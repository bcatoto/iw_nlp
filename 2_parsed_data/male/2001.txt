Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him! I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture. Can I see your back? Your father put cigarettes out on you? Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness? Back in the Czech Republic? Your mother was blind? Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like. I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here. This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me. But it's... I would say...half. Half is fair. Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing. Don't worry about him. Think about yourself. Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia. Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that. ...delusions and paranoia. Oh, sure. I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check. I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him. I'm coming with you. Don't say anything. Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for? I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.Yeah, sure. Beep me when you're ready for the press conference. Oh yeah...? Alright. Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions. Oh. There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial. How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield. Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine. Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?! The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King! Okay. But not water sports. Oh really. That's nice. You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot? Are you out of your fucking mind?? Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?! A shower!? Did you take one, too? What do you mean, 'cleaned up?' I came to see how the investigation was going. I called and you're not here. I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!! I beep you - you don't return my call. Where the hell have you been?! Then why didn't you talk to the reporter? Who did cause and origin? Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that? Did the D.A. videotape her deposition? You do that, wiseguy. Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does. What was that, Korfin? Don't you guys understand? It's all about image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth? A cop? Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you. Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you? Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you. Go on. C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people? I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us. Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours. It was my decision, not his. I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers. Are you hit? The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera. Don't look - put her in the car. Stay this side. C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful. Only one guys checked in? It's okay. Any I.D.? Where is she? A timer. Tomorrow. At lunch. I'm gonna propose. What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk. Who knows? But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later. That's me. Vodka tonic. He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly! Describe him. What are you saying? Did you tell him you did? Do you have any Czech girls working for you? We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel. Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up. Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions. You know, I don't know. I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him. How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer. That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that. You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it. Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional. No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead. Just a shower? Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me. Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs. Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left. You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building? So am I. My point exactly. What would your girlfriend think of that? You wanna talk to her alone? She's fucked. Even if that story is true. Something back home? Is that all there is? What are you hiding? Why are you afraid Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first. Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about? So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back. You thirsty? Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's. Better than one. Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come. I'll let you know what happens. This has nothing to do with your fire. You got any better ideas? Stay here. You're Polish? This isn't homicide school. There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do. Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary? What would you call her? Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile. Pretty. You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal. Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me? Good. Good. Commendable. Nah, why should you? Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit. Watch the news? No, what is it? No, we don't mind. You mind Leon? You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you? If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck. Then do it, asshole. What's your accomplishment. What do you want? Don't be late. See you later. Good luck. Yeah, yeah. Good thing. Yeah. I promise. Tonight. Patronizing you... Nay, I love you. I promise. We'll talk. You'll be great. You'll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me. I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk. No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great. Well, that's great. That's good. Answer it. Answer the phone. Could be Leon's. You're ruthless. You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not. Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was... I'm not. Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out? Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh... I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you! Hey. Alright. Alright? Yeah. Now's not a good time. Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously. He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine. I really can't give out any information right now at this point. I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of. We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know. You know you can't do that. C'mon. There are two bodies found at this point. We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done. Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time. Yeah, yeah. Jesus. Keep them out of my way. I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me. Yeah. And he still went to the party. He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle. Not what. Who. How old are your kids? I'm not moody. Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore. So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go. I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off....so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... I'm abused. Don't you think? Out on my back when I was a small boy. That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me. Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out? Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness... Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me. My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind. Give me another one, please. What else do you need? Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don't try to negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or no. No. No way. What's your cut? How much? What about my movie rights? Book rights? No, he is here. Shit... What about Oleg? I was all of these. You bring the cigarettes? Yes. Yes, come with me! Where are we going? He has the camera! He took the movie! Oh no! No! Shit! Here. I have your money. Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane. Smarter than Americans. You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me. So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now? So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time. Good - be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want to die like hero. I kill someone famous. Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books. So...who's Nicky? No. Are you proposing? Dog food. You stuff sausage in it. I am butcher. Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk about surrendering. If you don't want my film - I'll call another show. And they will show it. We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars. No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you. Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film. If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her. Tell him to put his gun down! The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you. C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls. You can't kill me. You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life. My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend. Give me the address!! Listen to me. I don't want sex. Just give me the address and then you go. I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address? Where is escort service? I ordered a Czech girl. Daphne, you know her? Where's Czech girl? He doesn't speak English. Two weeks. We are both from Prague. Is there a problem? Yes. I have five-hundred dollars. Two weeks holiday. Yes sir. Yes. Both. Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview? Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights? Who is he? Traitor!! You think you are a director? You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit. And I hate you. I fucking hate you. You got that? Yes. But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit. Credit? Your idea? I thought it was my idea. Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director? I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape! Bad last moment - I cut it out. Shut up. Look! The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael. Oleg, don't be paranoid. You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you? I gave you half of what they gave me. Look - here we are! Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera! No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? Oh - I got it. Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice. We come out free, rich and famous! Sit down! What does it look like? It's an address book! Put the camera down, Oleg. And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry. The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it. Don't want to film this? Shut up. Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up! Get in the bathroom! I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl? How you erase this? Speak English! Turn that fucking thing off! Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs. For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so. Unless you refuse, Oleg. Turn that off! Get the bags. We have no money. Come on. Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school! Now speak Czech or English. And don't fool around anymore. You almost got us thrown out! Don't speak Russian! Did you hear what I said? Don't fool around. Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth. You spent all the money while I was in prison? Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!? A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work! As a plumber?! A job? Ha. Ha. Milos. Get my money! You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money? Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding. Surprise! Surprise!Any chance we can do that again? Okay. You ready? Ready? You're worried for my safety. I'm touched. That's unique. So what's unique? My kids? Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9. Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid! How old are you? Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole... It's all true! Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit. Now -- I get it. Am I right, Leon? I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie. Sooner or later that's everybody. Jesus Christ. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? It doesn't work that way. I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me. Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you. Viewer discretion advised! I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy! I can't talk business. Hang up. Have a drink. Get her a whiskey. What are you doing here? If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend! This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him. Paulie, you've got kids, right? In love? With who? Isn't he a little moody? That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage. I'm trying to tell you. Well, he... I know.I'd like to speak for himself, okay? How long are you planning to stay? No, you're travelling together. I want to talk to you together. Hi, how are you? Can I take a look at your documents? Are you related? Please join us. Come on forward. Is he with you? Are you travelling together? Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area! How much money are you carrying with you? What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? Next. Could I see your documents, please? Excuse me? Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies? What are you coming here to do? Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York? Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here? Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?Daphne, I... ...Do you really want me to forget about you? What are you doing? I'll make some for us. Do you have coffee? You better get packed. I'm glad I met you. A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one. If I was your boyfriend, I might be. Is he your boyfriend? I still can't believe Eddie's gone. They're not gonna send you right back. I know. I'm just trying to find out who you are. So you were never a prostitute? What about back home? Did you ever turn tricks before? You considered becoming a prostitute? Yeah. This way. The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires. I can't take you to my place. Divorced. They won't until this is over. If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation. Alright. That's a justifiable homicide. But Chief? Over this?? End my career? Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian. What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot. Chief - mind if I take her? No! Nothing happened. I let her take a shower. Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up. Hey, Chief, what are you doing here? 'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it. Who do you think, Chief?! Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that? But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her. I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent. Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but... I took her there for a shower and that's it. Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her. Hey. I'm a professional. You know what I'm saying here. C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently. I'm serious here. I don't have a girlfriend. Yeah. Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her. Raw deal. Why not? She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her. I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid. Of course. I'm on duty. I'm on my way with Eddie. Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be there already. Two heads. I'll call it... tails. This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over. But what if it does? You might need my help. Mind if I ride along with you? You goin' to the escort service? My folks are. My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle. I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something. I'll come with you. Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally. Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell. Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows? Who says she's a suspect? Hmmmm. The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here. If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report? Did you get a report from the M.E.? I don't even watch TV. Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff. Nah, I musta missed it. It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want. Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor? You know what that is, right? Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin' to do. Let her go! Let her go!! Where's your partner? Get down on your knees. You'll be my first. Tommy, take a walk. Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment? He's yours but I take him in! I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in. He's my collar! No way! He's mine! Evidence. Of a homicide. And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them. So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up? Thanks. Appreciate it. Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this. Now get outta here. You okay? I'll send a cop back for you. Oh yeah? Guess again. Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy? Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!! Yeah? What kind? How did you start the fire this time? What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter. They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment! Get outta here! Not good. Lay down. Stay down, Bobby. Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?! If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway. You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene. How long they been livin' here? Maybe you can be his stand-in. Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him. There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us. She looked scared. Oh shit! Oh no! That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us. He knew all along. The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run. Don't blow your nose! Mouth's clean, too. Could you put out the cigar? Part of the job is picking up scents. Oh yeah, why? You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious? I heard. Who the hell let them up there? GET OUTTA HERE NOW!! GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!! DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!! Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy. Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off. Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?Yeah. Yeah. He finished awhile ago. I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media. Yeah, right. What the hell happened? How was it? It hurts. Aw, Jesus! Aren't you tired? You hear that question, Garcia? -- From Czechoslovakia? And how long have they been livin' in your building? Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'. Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don't know who your girl is. Yeah? What? What?? You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it. But you knew that, right? Clean? Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie. 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now! Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here. I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph? Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time! No. I'm okay. Stay with her. Yeah. Sorry...PD only. Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case. Takin' a bath. What's he looking for? You ready? When? It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid. Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell? Coffee for me, I gotta slow down. Don't give me that fucking shit. You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself. And you, you'll pay for what you did! Yeah? Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love. Well, he killed my partner! We're takin' him. Don't argue! I'll take him. What was that? Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight. That's what it looks like to me. No. Go ahead.Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you. I used an accelerant. Yeah, I'm religious. I'm not an Atheist like you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?We started over, you can too. It's easy to learn. Yes, the money is good. I can get you a job. Look at the way we live. I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?! We spent it! Take your eyes off her, Oleg! Look. It wasn't my fault you two were caught. It's his fault. Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?! I wasn't going to wait!!! Did you hurt her? Emil???!A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights! Hey. C'mon, you can't leave me like this. Some freak'll come by and stab me! Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns. Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money? Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action! No, I don't get that! Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul. I'm serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit. Because I am the director. Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now. Be quiet. Watch. This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' And 'action!' I'm serious. In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me? You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we? Cut! Good idea! This way. Hold it this way. Good. Let me get a shot of it. What is that? Why not? I did. What is it? Oh, shit. I hate looking at that! Does it hurt? Gotta light the scene better. Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN. Whatever we do - we fuck her, right? Whore? I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera! You said speak Czech! I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer. What? Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog. Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision. Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies! I want to document my trip to America. Okay. Okay. Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white. I'm here for movies. A cheap hotel. New York. I speak English. Yes...he's my friend.But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes? And isn't there a movie in the works about you? Permanently disrupted? Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist? You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people? Your doctor?Are you married? And what do you do with the bones? You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for? Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that. And what kind of work do you do?That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal. I'm not a criminal! I wasn't convicted. We're in negotiations, that's correct. Look, I'm in here. You call this a career move? Look, I'm a victim here, too. I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate. My life has been permanently disrupted. It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of. How could I know. I'm not a doctor. Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication. This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood. Don't stoop to his level! What are you gonna do? The clerk? Room was registered to a Francis Capra.Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not? In here, says he wants a million. This all you want? New York's finest. This is his case.Now you tell us. This is healing? Jim Younger, I told you-- Tom, I'm this close to coming with you... You can ride like that? It's tougher than it looks. Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride." I'm sorry, Cole. Swear on Jimmy's grave. Swear. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! What have you done? Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean. That was because of... the reputation the gang had. This is the best score yet. What? Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out. Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms. No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing. Uhh, yeah it does. Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em. The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys. Zee, I'm pleased you came. Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something. Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty. He's smiling. Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago! Tomorrow. They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior -- He just lost his temper a little. They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper. Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay. ... Will Perry ... Then I love it. Corn gonna shoot at me? Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES! My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you. Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble... He's planning a job. Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem. It's Cole. The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here... Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies. You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get! One false move and I'll blow your heads off! Hey! Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it. You explain it to him. But if we take their money and supplies... Not yet. But I'm hoping. Two. Best damn plan I heard all war.You shut up now, boy. How? What you sayin' boy? What?He's not bad at it. You're just upset about Jesse. We all are. I swear -- Bob. I didn't... I ain't done -- How'd they -- Leave me alone, Bob. As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve. It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to. That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick. We got a problem here, brother? How? You stay out of this, Bob. These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad. I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men. Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite. Here's Liberty's favorite son! I'll never forget what you did, cousin. That was two hours ago. Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty. Never a good thing. Gatling! They've got a Gatling! We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw. You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought -- Missed you, cousin. WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?! We'll make them pay for this. Bob, rip up some bandages. Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty! Dammit! You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin. Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich! Then let me run the show, General Lee. I'm the better soldier, Jesse. That's it. I got us through the War all right. Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea -- I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job. If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems. It'll be the biggest score yet. This is your fault for hogging all the publicity. Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here. All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang." Jesse, we got to have a word. Twenty?! It's not a bank. Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart. I got three. Don't let it happen again. The James-Younger Gang. Let's ride. I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money. So what do we do, General Lee? Because we were good at it? Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns. It was exciting. After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse? She was European! She got two of them. What is wrong with you? You're not scared, are you? Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year. Where you boys going? Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road. Let's ride, Rangers! Ride with me, cousin? 'Bout time you got here, buddy. Well? Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want. Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself! Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom. They gonna rush us? Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride? -- Exactly. Because this is a war. Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think -- BASTARDS! Come back here and face me! Ah. I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice. Sadie was not a man! Which one, right or left? What the -- Both would be nice. OPEN THE DAMN SAFE! This here is the Younger Gang! What? The safe. Now.Sometimes a wound will kill. I couldn't lose him. I think I may just go on to the reservation. I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche. I'm thinking... Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you... You ride like a Comanche. You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are. Me get heap firewater -- Ho-yah! Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock. Great Chief of St. Louis send me. You 'um big lawman? I'd appreciate that. It's a secret. On account of we're robbing it. You're right, sir.I had you covered. From back there. So? What is it?It's fine by me, Jesse. You know you're welcome any time! Go on. You're pretty much all healed up. Boys... Web died fighting? My little Web did that? I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck. Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning. They're gone. What are you -- The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt. Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?The Army can hang him. Damn! Oh no... Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms. Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ... Nope. Yesterday. I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction. They're just insurance in case we run. Another dozen out back. Cole, he didn't mean that. Jesse. Strategically. Get buckets! Shakespeare. He's European. Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's... The brown one. I think one of 'em's glass. Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys. Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up. Cannon or Gatling? Hell, they hardly even noticed us. I'll meet you down there in a few weeks. I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time. Yeah. Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him. Jim was old enough... Got any ideas, little brother? No, I -- Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad. We're drunk. A better life than the one you could have had with Zee? Maybe it started out that way. But now... I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way. If I could go back to farming -- It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now. Jesse, we're outlaws. Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control! The posters? Gents, we are in the middle of something here. It's the scientific method. It's all the rage. And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives. And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right? We're gonna have to talk... How'd it go in there? Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin. ... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else. Pinkertons. It's the railroad. You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody -- Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable. You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming? I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can. You know him? Your Zee? Hmm. "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world." She's still talking to Jesus. Next time try "fat and haggard." You are a charmer. "Big and older"? Maybe, maybe... Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right. Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself. You're doing just fine. We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here. Hello, Liberty Missoura! I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time. I reckoned. No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out. I figure. You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats. Mm-hmm. Pff. They hardly even noticed you. Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off. Everything but the boring parts. Yeah Jimmy? I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around. Can't argue that. Saved a lot of folk from the railroad. That he was. Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up. I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy. Yeah, Jimmy?Tell me. What? He's been full of vinegar lately. You are a fine figure of a man. This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it. Beg pardon? Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go... "Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars." "The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk." We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there. All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours. Exactly. You have no shame. How many of them did he kill? Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again. No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your -- I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back. I think I recognize you. You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy! Where'd you get all these riders? Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind. Missed you too, cousin. Who's next? You? Me? Bob? I'm out. Pass me some whisky. Okay, you're gonna rest here. A trap. Fine. We hit this bank. Still smells fishy. And I'm the better outlaw. And almost got hanged in peacetime. A bad idea. Beautiful. You're forgetting who's in charge -- What are you saying? Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper. What will be? Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang. Yep. Sure, cousin. "The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men." It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job. See, Frank's being smart about this. I got seven thousand. Sorry. Perfect, Cole. Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care. This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day. Yeah. But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that? The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it. Thanks for the help. All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman -- She had a moustache. You ever notice Zerelda's eyes? In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming. Not now. Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that. Hands off your hip, Cole. Home, boys. Back to our farms. There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em. I could use the walk. What's going on? Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here. But out. What do you say, sir? Go home, Doc. They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys. Died a hero. Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them. -- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee. See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there. A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking? You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know. He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that? Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim. They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door. You taking sides against me, now, Frank? Oh yeah. What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming. We're doing this for Ma. That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen. You've killed your fair share of men. And we're good at it. This has been a good year. Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang. Bob's upset. I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare? And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives. And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck -- Fine. How'd it go out here? Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through. Don't care. Ma. Shut up. Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by? What do you think? Damn. All that reading paid off. Heard of him. -- if you stop saying things about my Zee. What worries me is that Jesus is talking back. I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep. You can shut up now. That just might work. What kind of story are they going to believe? All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me. Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth. Zee, we got to talk to you and your father. Frank, don't you have something to say? Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got. All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle. Hell of a war. Web's dead. See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it. That would have made an impression. Such as? So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention. Distracting enough for you? So we got a plan? Doc Mimms will -- We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms. Ma! Please! Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today. Easterners. Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend. A fair number, Ma. I'll explain on the way. Yes ma'am. You are a hell of a woman. Yes ma'am. What? Swimming. Swimming is good. Aw, shucks, ma'am... Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you? Let me see that. I beg your pardon? "Hmm" what? I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time. That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here. She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri. She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind. I had to see you. I'm getting married. Zee. When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes. Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does. Me neither. Frank and me have to go away for a while. I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time. Yep. Little ones. Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..." Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth. Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth. Not if I find the right girl. Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor. Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy. I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate. I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older. Unfair. You are completely unfair. I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day. What? What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean. No! I mean, of course not. No. I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it. Nuh-huh ... Mmmm. If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help. But you got big! Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms? Fair enough. Thanks. That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else. Ahh, you'll miss me. I'm not hanged yet. Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it. I figured. No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one. Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me. The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town. You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive? Last February? You almost ended my career before it began. Did you order our houses burned down? So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains? But I like the presidential suite. Right here in church? Thank you. I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your... You don't think God'll mind, do you? You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy. This time we'll make an exception. What about that Rock Island bastard? You do that. I swear. I think so. You been with a girl ever? Jim, you been with a girl yet? I guess so. Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky. No. And the same age Web was. No. And you're too young.Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time... ... too young for whisky... It's his money. He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse? Tell you something else. I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up. You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother. Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse? Hell yeah! I been with... Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know? Well, not exactly. Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm. I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn. Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink. You okay, Jesse? I like that. I'm the same age you were when you went off to war. Don't talk about it much, though. Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once. Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk? Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink? Thank you, Miss -- ? Not at all. Really? Oh, you were talking to Jesse. Why, yeah.How much of that story is true? Uncle Frank? So what was he? But he killed a lot of men, too. They're making him a hero now. Sounds like he was a hell of a man. ...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot. Y'know, Uncle Frank...Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk! East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass? Of St. Louis? The District Marshall Yeah, Injun. What do you want?Fine. I'll just wait here. Oh. Why didn't you just say so? Then why can't I go in there? I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!There's only four of them... How can that be? They had to be dealt with! Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate. I'm doing you folks a favor -- How did you know? I remember you. Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain. What, sir? Sir? The final route for the railroad is complete. We should go burn that school to the ground, sir! Your men knew the risks. We did. To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks. Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track -- They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile. I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight. A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers. Yes sir. Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident. Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers. I can completely understand your distress, sir. Really! Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.Communion. Now let's have a drink. Who needs to repair a leaky church roof. Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth. The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable. "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James? This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time. The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee. He's too important, James. They'll set the army on you. You and your wife. No, I'll hang you. But I may miss you just a bit. You cocky little bastard. That's what I would have done. Was it worth it? Oh. That's nice to know. We're going to hang you, you know. I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much. Damn. Yes? Mmm. How did you spot the ambush in Torrell? Pity. Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day. That's the idea. Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers. We're moving you tomorrow. Move you fools! They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school. By burning down their homes? My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time. It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case. Well, this land is about to be condemned. Vengeance. Why, their intense hatred of you, of course. No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank. There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed. Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends. No. It's going to be a long spring. No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course, You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it? Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side. And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes. First of all: you, shut up. Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs. All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning. It's going to be a long winter. Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create. It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns. Oh, that's the best part. It is a nice piece of writing. I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree. Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains. Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too. Not to mention my men who lost their lives.Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton? This is him. That. What is that? Parker. I look forward to seeing it. With my money! What is going on here, man? THEN WHO DID?! I'll kill them for blowing up my railway! How much did they get from the safe? I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress. You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity. Just perfect. Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers. Good. Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order. NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen! And it is my pleasure to be here. What the hell is that sound? What is that? Can you put men at all four? In English, Pinkerton. So he's won. Can't you tell me anything? I demand action. I can't believe this. Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses. So you can't tell me anything? I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers! "The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!" Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month! "A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West." This is no game. I want them arrested and hanged! You wouldn't have done that? Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.Shit. Where the hell were you? When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody? Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank. What the --All right, all right. Jesse James never yelled at folk... Where is Jesse James? Of course! Uh, sir?And Outpost? You're happy there? Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area. If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first. My goodness. Milo? What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset. Have a seat. Milo? Give me two seconds with Lacy here? Go on in, I won't be a moment. ...It's -- Milo, isn't it? Like I said: shot in the dark. Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do. Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant....When did you know? What?! Is it your software? You're interfaced with our dish. What?! Okay. What? Will I get to work for Outpost? You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show. Well I parked illegally. See y'later? 'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck. Can you help me?You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up. Milo. Surprised he's not your guest. Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world. There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished. Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line. Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird. We could move 'em up here. 'Couldn't convince Teddy to come? Milo? I'm Danny.I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control. I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are. You see what's hanging on the wall? Oh, that's right. You're "clueless." You could've handwritten it. "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..." You left my party to send E-mail? 'Sorry about the late notice... Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet. ...Worse? What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right? Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid. 'Have a look? You look a little tired. The answer's not in the box. It's in the band. Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place. 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way. You've been coming in early. I meant did you find other stuff to -- Did you? Had you talked to him much lately? I heard what happened. It scales, don't you think? The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait. Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead? What're you implying. Right... Right. Milo. What's up? You're making me young again. Take a look at this. Slightly different approach. Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they -- How's it going? Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before? It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right? In a tree. That's what I told her. My wife. Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions. 'Think I should buy some originals? Okay. I'm Gary. Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here. But somehow got away. When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 -- You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me? The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges. Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky? I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room. It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up. There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it. Would you like a Coke or something? Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you. Just do it. 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12. Wait... He knows. Let's go. Okay, #2. Just do what I'm asking! Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate. Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me. What'd the girl say? Maybe we should all get on it. This is good. Who did it?I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their -- You don't wanna move, do you? I'm just screwed. You know what I mean. Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me. 'Gonna wait outside. They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs. You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay? ...You wanna work -- here? Your app kind of blew mine out of the water. Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style. He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means? You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years. Not that I don't miss you. I mean, it's your life. I think you should go. In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.We tried! And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood. Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy? That'd change with a criminal indictment. Outpost doesn't own em. That's gotta kill him, right?I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite. Where we going? You calling Phil and Randy? Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do. What would Milo want in here, anyway? Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time. What're we looking for? Every entry was authorized. Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?Right. Wait. A toast. ...wanna savor this. Great. Don't we have any chopsticks? ...What? You look beautiful. Great! No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you. You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I -- I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again. I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life. I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself. It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited -- Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you. Look at this. Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle. To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you... ...Different? If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened. After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary. The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when -- Remember Lyle Barton? It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back. Nothing. So you believe me? I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me. They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five. I can't just walk away! It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening. ...gotta get in there. How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know. I've gotta get in there. You think I don't know that? Go where? You can't get away from people like this. It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top. Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically. Oh Jesus. I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing. I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys. What're you -- what? What! You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting. Isn't that -- extreme? I know, I know. That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire. 'Not saying it makes sense. It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly. He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?" To our new life. ...What's wrong? You know he's never been anybody's counselor before? That took some fun out of -- When's Brian coming for the TV? You saved my life in alot of ways. C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating -- I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide. ...But? If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too. When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway. A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff. Yes sir. 'Just didn't know who else to talk to. I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis. It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they? My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley. I am. I am, sir. Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. Yes sir. I need to talk to you. Mr. Barton, do you remember me? It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something... Right... What's that mean again? You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects. He's working backwards, too. Let's do number five? Is it your dish? Gimme the coordinates? Wanna be a part of history? Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door -- What'd they ever do for you? No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost. Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life. This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner. 'Forgot to introduce you. I have a girlfriend. Sure, I'll see what I can do. You're living here? Who's that? He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything. He's pretty tight with his family. Oh hi. I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software. I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more. Gary, I -- I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties. I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons. That's great! Thanks. Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one. No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse. ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious. His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again. Sure. I'm okay. It's going well! Gary, hi. The wrong place? Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there... It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something. 'Don't know what I'd do without her. Oh. Yeah. Talk about work? Never! Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure. Were the flags for Teddy? Definitely. I'm sure. Nothing! You really wrote this just today? Well -- you sent for me. You did this -- overnight? It's okay. Really. Maybe I'm going too fast. Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden. That's insane. You're ahead of your time. ...Do I? No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself. I do! It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it? Skywire. Low enough to relay internet traffic. You know a lot about art, I guess. Oh. No thanks. Cool! You would? Wow. When would we come? 'Think he hung up. ...Hello? Cool. Got out of my other commitment. We'll come up with the next big thing. Those really weird, short lines. It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up. Just thought his work should go on. I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and -- You do? All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools. Wait a second. He knows I know. He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12. ...He knows. Let's try #2. Bring it to the other location. They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop? Meet me at the other location. At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary. She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't. He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do. We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version. But I've gotta go home for an hour. That's lame, isn't it? Perfect. How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to -- Oh. Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf? They know I broke in. Alice helped me. Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own. Thank God. Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there. I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into -- "A beautiful geek? What're the chances?" I told Teddy about you. 'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are? Why were you snooping in my office? Why were you so careless? I don't know -- Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions. Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast. You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you? It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away. We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet. What? Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN. "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em. It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in! Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for? Yeah, they dig stuff like this. "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001." He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire. Certainly not at my happy home. Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick. Do we post it on the Net? There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question. They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over. No, no. Never. Hmm? They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge." They'd frame him. I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. I know what he did to you. You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much. It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there. You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. I snuck into #21. She saved my life. So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now? Why's that? You're compulsive. Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code? "There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. Is it like that with your counselor? No. Please. Cool! Show me. What've you got there? Did I say something? Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something. Me too! Were you an Army brat or something? ...Were you? I'm getting a teacher's pet rep. You know mine. Lisa. I didn't plan this. What does that mean? What d'you mean? No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful. I don't know. I met this girl. Jesus, Teddy. What?! Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff. Wanted to say goodbye to him... Is that how Larry feels? ...You got my E-mail? Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites. What're they building? I've got a girlfriend, remember? She's a programmer? His Snapples were in alphabetical order. So -- how far are we from the campus?He wasn't acting? Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo. That'll be a test, won't it? Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you? 'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department? Gary? What? Longitude 109 -- Ready for number three? Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes -- Gary, don't worry, we -- Hasn't affected his work, though. There may be a little less trust after your outburst. 'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac. You don't look anything like a three- year-old. Did you download Corey? In San Jose? Speaking of which... There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site. We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.Damn. 'Have to go back over there. Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door. Yeah, yeah. Maybe he'll get back to work. Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem? We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in? Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now. Where is he? You're not listening. That kid's the great white hope. There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual. What is it?You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested. #21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in. Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost. Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. You'll be working with her. Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody. Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big... 'Guess he needs to micro-manage something. So how'd you like the house? Oh we're not going to the campus.Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit! Come with me. I'm calling Gary. They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later. Let's get him in here. Any irregularity in the pattern. Keep looking. Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa. I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it. Let's run a printout on card entries. Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused? Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place. We're too late. Take a look. Who're these guys? I could get it out of him. Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I -- Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one. I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place. A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances? Did you tell Alice? What? Come on. Is it serious? I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet? Milo? They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers. But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week. We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms. Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five! Uh. Not exactly. And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.The sets were good. Yeah it was okay. Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff Such as? I got you those trousers from Paul Smith. You know what for. Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me �150. You first. You have. You've actually fallen for this prick. What. You're what? You're with this creep now. What? What are you doing? A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby? What? Thank you. Yeah. That's not a burn. What's this? We'll stop then. Do you want to stop? What do you mean? There's over eighty thousand here.I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide. You can see why it's sensitive? To customers approaching the bank from the rear This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.Right. Hello. Uh... Yes. Right. Ch... Leave her alone. Just leave her alone. Oh Jesus. Of course I can't. Oh Jesus. I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus. I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there. I'll give him money. Tell him to put the... Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money. What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ? What did he say? Tell me! What? What does he want? Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him. Put the fucking kettle down. Good night. You can stay tonight. Fine. I thought you were leaving today. I suppose it's... I mean define your terms. No. It's not that. Tell me what he said. Tell me. What was that? Binoculars. I... When? What? Uh. Do you like England? No, no... You must have a visa or something... So how long will you be in England? Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food. What was that? So? No. Right. Right. So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins? Hold on. And... Yes. I know. I need to know who you are first please. What did he say? I'm asking what you're here for. What are you doing here? Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you? Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John. Right. What does it mean? It's a long way to go for a date. No. What? No. I know. Why? It's not mine either. Please. Whatever. Goodbye. You can probably buy them on the flight. Okay. Promise? Okay. Goodbye. Because it was a lie. Yeah. No thanks. Whatever. No. I think I better just go. It's alright. What's your name? I don't know. Except for Small Eyes. I don't want anyone to die. Nobody's that unhappy. I've got news for you. It's not working. You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog. Laugh it up. I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all. She's dead. It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes. What? Are you scared? Have you had any before? Do you know if it's a boy or a girl? Well what have you got? I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing. Thank Christ for that. Yeah. He's a smashing bloke. Then okay. So how old were you when you met him? Please, there's no... Oh. You don't have to say anything Get out. Get out You don't understand me. It wasn't what I wanted. I got what I paid for. What? I think it's my safest bet, don't you? Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die. I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again. Some... What does that mean? Sometimes which? So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what? Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff. So. What then? You just detach sex from everything.. And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency. And. It's wrong. Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money. So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate? No. Shut up. I'm not listening. I don't want to talk about it. Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too. Excuse me? Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed. Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks. Oh Jesus. So uh... Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock. Fine. So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name... What? Give me some money. Shut up. Have you got your passport? Have you got your passport? No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ? What? No you're not.. What? Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash. In every sense. If at all possible. I do. I want to very badly. In the world. You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world. Well as it turns out I did. Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me. I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison. That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy. I don't want to know. Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee. I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously. Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber. Of course. They go. Yes. Yes. What's wrong? Yes I know. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Syevodnya? I don't understand. Sorry? Uh... Are you a giraffe? Do you follow or should I speak slower? Good. Or should I speak slower? Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying? And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you? I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined? So. Is it different to how you imagined it? I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants." I'm pretty nervous. Are you? I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it. It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"? Right. Okay. Good. Is that everything? Cash. Thanks. Please check. Is it full? Please could you check. Is the flight full?How do you want to pay? You have excellent English. I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever. Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked. I paid for those guitar cases. When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid? I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week. No I don't. What for? Fifty thousand. Almost exactly. I'm so sorry. He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not. You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank. He wants the money from your bank. He wants a lot of money. He wants money. He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry. He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says. John. I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone. I understand. I'm so sorry To be indoors on such a day. It's crime. How is bank? It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something. Do you believe in love? You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love. He says why did you send to Russia for a wife. No. It is too judgmental. Oh nothing. Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war. "I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds. "I saw you waiting there, by the gate." She says she has a secret to tell. Classic! Thank God. She says 'Yes!' She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John! You're asking for my documents? Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth. I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you. So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are. Right. So I can say he smokes me. So. I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me. We better watch him. He's crazy. Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem. Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us. And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you. Good. Oh. We are Russian. He says he feels safe here. What? Sorry. You've lost me... You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates. How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?GOOD MORNING! GOOD MORNING! Good MORNING! Good morning...Did you know him? I feel bad for his family. Donnie. Donnie Darko. He got smooshed. By a jet engine. Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.Not if you chose to stay within God's channel... If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right? If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path. Could these wormholes appear in nature? Like a spear that comes out of your stomach? Like a spear. Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life. Like a DeLorean. So... that's it? -- and be able to find one of these wormholes. So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light -- I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel? Dr. Monnitoff? "The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko. What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha? When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face. Not until like... eighth grade. Our saviour... Dea ex machina... Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about. I didn't say shit. How much longer is this gonna last? Why do they call you Frank? What happened to your eye? Take it off. I want to see you. Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit. You have to do something for me first. Where did you come from? Who is... we? Why did you make me flood the school? How can you do that? Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine. A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail. I don't wanna talk about it. We went to a hotel. Yeah... No. Frank. Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her. Come with me. There's something you have to know, Gretchen. Everything is going to be just fine. It's safe here. Did you call the cops? But you're OK? Where is she? Hey. You OK? Then when? I have to talk to you. Will you please talk to me? What do you mean? You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge? The whole movie. Let's go. Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep. So, we call them... IMGs. I know she's here. She never leaves the house. She wrote it. There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence. Will you come see her with me? The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road. I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff. Do you know who Grandma Death is? They suspended me for two days. We're moving through time. I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be. That's alright... I understand. Well... You know... we've been going together for a week and a half... With, like, images? Why not just buy your baby a night light? I don't want to talk about it. So what happened to your neck? Why? Yeah? No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge. It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace. No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there. Where are you going? No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together. Will you go with me? I'm sorry. We never would have had this conversation. It's a good thing the school was flooded today. The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect. Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000. I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine. That's easy. Antiseptics. What makes you think I'm not? I'm sorry. I was in jail once. I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen. I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things. Wow. Did he go to jail? Oh, I... have those too. What kind of problems does your dad have? So... you just moved here? I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit. Sure. School's cancelled. Hey... People aren't that simple. Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else. Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love. I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple. I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this. How does it feel to have a wacko for a son? Do you get to meet Ed? Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything. Grandma Death. Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills? I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom. Get out of my room. Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck? You're such a fuck-ass. Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children. I know, Dad. A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason. But that's OK... because I know I deserve it. I guess she just lost faith in the world. You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day. Grandma Death. So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows? Where it came from? Do they know yet? It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit. I think I already have. But now she won't even talk to me. Cellar door. What's "Cellar Door"? What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you? That's bullshit. You're a good teacher. Where are you going? Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on? Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die. Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human? Why should we care? A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit. Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart. They want to change things. Goodbye, Dr. Thurman. Thank you. It's too late. I've already ruined my life. He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me. I can see him right now! Frank is going to kill. Soon. Time is almost up. It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore. Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon. I have the power to build a time machine. I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going. Because I'm so horny. I think now that he might... I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means... Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me. That I did it again. Regret. Hungry Hungry Hippos. They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year. Yes. I went to jail. People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone. People get hurt. I... I was playing with fire. Yes. Yeah... you know... Fucking. I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff. Whoa. That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too. You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself. Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank... Nothing. It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us. I followed my spear... and I found something... I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd. I don't want to be alone. So, does that make me, like, an atheist? No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch... It reminded me of my dog Callie. I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman. She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence. My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone. I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous. I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's. Four times... so far. No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick! I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano. I think... about... "Who's the Boss?" I think about... fucking a lot during school. I think about girls a lot. Yes. Gretchen. We're going together now. I met a girl. Yes. No. That's stupid. Into the future. Then he said that the world was coming to an end. He said to follow him. A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course. Don't you watch the news? I think he saved my life. His name is Frank. So, I met a new friend. I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically. Everything is going to be just fine. Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it. Congratulations. Her name is Gretchen. I was just being honest. Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication. Because you tell Mom everything. You're not gonna tell Mom, are you? Yeah. Guess who wrote it? It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel". Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to. Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ. Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit! Gerald. How much are they paying you to be here?Goodbye, Donald. Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists. Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water. You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you. And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up. If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else. Where is he, Donald? Who is he going to kill? What is going to happen? When will this happen? Then how is time travel possible? How is that possible? Where are we going, Donald? Where are we going? God exists because you're horny. Why? If God exists? Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes? You've done it again? What else makes you feel regret? How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos? What did you want for Christmas that year? Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead? But you were punished. But it was an accident. The house was under construction. Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire? So, your parents... why did you disappoint them? And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand? Have you ever made love, Donald? The good stuff. I know. Are you embarrassed by these things that you see? Have you told Gretchen about the spears? What did you find? And they grow out of our stomachs? No. That makes you keep searching. Do you feel alone right now? Is Callie still around? How does that make you feel? A sign from whom? Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group? Can anyone else see him? How many times have you seen Frank? Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank. What about your family, Donnie? Who is the boss? What else do you think about during school? I asked you about school. How are things going at school? Do you think a lot about girls? What is her name? So, tell me about your day, Donald. And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand? Do you believe that the world is coming to an end? Follow him where? Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened. I don't own a television. How so? Frank. Would you like to talk about this friend? All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald. Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication. But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental. I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication. He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind. Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination. Frank... the giant bunny rabbit? Has your son ever told you about Frank? What I think is going on with your son.I know I'm not the best... communicator. But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool. But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them. You're my only son... Who's been giving you weird looks? You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself. Grandma Death. Oh, shit! You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want. No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned. But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it. Know what? Good Lord. So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match. So how was school today? He died, remember? On the way to the prom. He was doomed. Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school? You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound... You're not a bitch.You should already know that. Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you. It is the name of my father... and his father before me. I am so sorry. Why are you wearing that stupid man suit? You have a request? I want to show you something. Do you believe in time travel, Donnie? You'll know soon enough. We just want to guide you in the right direction. I can do anything I want... and so can you...Now that's what I like to hear! Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour. Are you AFRAID? Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING! That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!" Good morning, mongrels! I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places. Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid. Excuse me? What's your name, son?I guess they made him do it. Yep. What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else. I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.How did this happen? Christ. Is that an axe? What else? This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation... Kitty... Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do! How old is Grandma Death? My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again? DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night! I stole four beers from my dad. Not Vanity. He's a homo. Smurfette doesn't fuck. Wicked. What is this shit? Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work. There's no rule! Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus. Chut up!We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper. Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny. No more fuckin' for her. Raspberry. All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home. Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home. You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55. Go back to China, bitch!What did you say? You know what? I think that you did it. That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it. Did you tell them that I flooded the school?But I can't -- I just buzzed him in. Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up. She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it. Yeah, I heard about that. About what? Pumpkin, are you in there? Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want. I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling... Pumpkin? What's wrong? Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them. Are you still looking for a job? I have some good news for you, Pumpkin. I made spaghetti. Do you want some? Yup. Maxine. Give up? Someone from the past. Guess. Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place? Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter. You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to. It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training. Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula. Have you seen my blue spatula?Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat! Seymour? You gotta be kidding me! So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room. I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go... You still interested in that? Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records. Seymour does. Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you. Absolutely no practice necessary. You shread like a giant. Just press a button. Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being. A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose? That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that. Right. Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you. They're Seymour's. No problem. Maybe she's got another boyfriend. Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure. Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh? Well, here's where the fun never stops!Hey, where are you going? Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money... You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine. Fine, and how are you? Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.Get a job! I'm so sorry if you were offended! Oh, how "punk." Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money? If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside! Punk rock is over! Didn't they tell you?Are you ready to go? Hi Enid. Okay... I promise. Why not? Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere? How long have you been up? Oh, hi... You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious... God... I always used to dream about this... Yeah, well -- You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me! When did I say I hated you? Nothing. Yeah, right... What do you mean "why"? Do you want something to drink? Are you the one who left that note? Hi... what's up? Yeah, well... hi... Hi. You need counseling. No. Forget it. Jesus, look at this guy. In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form... Yeah, right. So, where's "Weird Al"? Aren't there a million places like this? Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes. No. Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do... Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done. Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside. Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride. Yeah. I agree. He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody! Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.You don't know what you're talking about. Yes. Norman.It's not optional! Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing? What the hell is wrong with you?! Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job. Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater... What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature! I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and... I-I honestly never intended for this to happen... It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out. I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh... Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call. Dana! Hi! Uh, Dana... this is Enid... Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies. Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie. No, really I -- Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh... Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia? That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this. I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here... But, I... You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me? I-I never expected anything like this to happen... I will if you want to. ...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere? I-I-I... What do you want? I dunno, I... So where would we go? I don't think I'm in any condition to drive. Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems. I guess I probably used to when I was your age. What? Yeah, well I like you too... What about Joe? Yeah, sure. Of course. I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you? You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity. I hate sports. I'm just being realistic. If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed. God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty! Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs." I could never move - I've got too much stuff. That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not -- Uh... I think there's some root beer... What's the matter? Uh... sure... come in. What's up? What are you doing here? ...What do you mean? I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends... In what way do you mean? No, of course not. I... I don't think so. Just someone so young... No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you... No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to -- Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me... Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana. It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know... I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I -- ...I better not... I... I don't know. I don't really think I should... ...so... is he your boyfriend now? I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how -- No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and -- We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week -- Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon... Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know... I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy... Really? YAAA! Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye! Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk... Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well... Oh, hi... Uh... hello? How can you be so sure? Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me. It's just somebody's idea of a joke... Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me... Who knows? I won't even dignify that with a response. Why? Oh yeah? Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you. I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything. Really? That's the spirit! Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date. Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support... It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute... Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ... Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it... I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you -- What? Why? No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something... I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want? Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me... Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters. For nineteen years... Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them... Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo. Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise? What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now. If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not? "Yet." I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some -- Hooray for me. But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore. You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me... Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity. Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless. Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet. Jesus... What did you tell that girl? Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No... Yes, that would certainly do... What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!? I'm not holding my breath in that department. I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult! That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face! KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening... Uh, I don't have much money with me right now. These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think. Shh! I really don't think it's a good idea. I don't think so... I - I'd really rather not... Yeah, sure... very funny.... Well are -- So is that your boyfriend? Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably... Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests. I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself? I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive... I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"... Jesus! I really didn't get a good look at her. I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me... Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really -- I appreciate the offer but you really don't -- Yeah, well... Good luck... Oh, right... Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me. You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff... I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers. Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me. I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential... Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know... Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits. I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything. NO!!! Watch my stuff. Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it... The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies. So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh? A dollar seventy-five. This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue. Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend. Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff. There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music? Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s? I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign." Indian records? Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up. Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records? She could at least have the decency to call me back. Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time. What fake blind date? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What do you mean? Did she say that? Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me? Really, I don't know enough about it to... I have no idea - I just want to... She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was... I don't know. Maybe she's with Josh? Why would she be hiding from me? Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her. No... they said she was here... Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here? Yes? Thank you, doctor. It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage... Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it. I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.Do you have a check for me? Seymour? Don't thank me. You're doing all the work. Why don't we start with that next week? Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you! So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications. Really? Both of you?... Why not? Oh, hey Enid... So... we finally made it!It's going famously, son, famously! Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up. And think about what you've done. No "buts." Go to your room now. That is the wrong fork, young man. Uh... We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp. A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?No. A little resistance would be nice, damn it. I'm going alone. This could be dangerous. You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes! I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape. I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back. That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous. I want our boy back. I don't know. I don't know. Something's missing. Lila? Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous. Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff? Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary. Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts! I love you, Gabrielle. That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?! No! I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you. No. You look so beautiful. God, you're beautiful. Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you. What? Well, I think... Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person. I've got some things to tell you. Please. Just one minute of your time. I just want to talk. Hi. It's Nathan. Urgh. Unnhh. But I don't know how to leave Lila. I love you so much, Gabrielle. Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out. What is it? My little French. Very well. Fine. Gabby, what is it? Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey? You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem. Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye. What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do? Shit. Hi, honey. Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world. So soft. So smooth. I'm sorry. It's just... It's true. I wouldn't lie. Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident. I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know. I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all. Yes. Happy happy. Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful. That would be good. When you were a little French girl? Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all. I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh? Oui. Now you've got me talking French. No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry. Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think. God, Did I hang up on you? Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle. Of course not. Not at all. No. Don't be silly. It's just... Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to... No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant. Oh, Hi, Gabrielle. Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here. Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay? You decide. Today is your day. Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we? Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle? Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore. C'mon, monkey boy. Shut up! I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit. Look at you two. You both disgust me. Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio. Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you? Lila... Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing. Yes. I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did. I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila. Shit. Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs. Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila. Nah. You just relax. How's the book? I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up. Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances. Thank you very much for that. I think he's ready. Bravo to you, Puff! I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable. At the time though I thought it might help. Such as what womanly things? How come? Really? Have you? I guess. My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project. Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied? Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink. ...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed. That's great. It's a great color for you. That's great. Sure. Of course. Shh. It's okay. It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want. Yeah. It's nice. It's really good. I'm just preoccupied. No. Of course not. Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late. Good. Making progress. I'm glad you're female. Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene? Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female. Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you? I have to think! I have to think! Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted! Don't quibble. You know what I mean. You have to shave? Like an ape? Your entire body? Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle? Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work! Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly. Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right. What are you doing in there? Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk. ...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon... Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson. Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality. Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous. Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject. It's perfect! Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated? Actually, I just had an amusing thought. I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do. Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies! You'll catch cold. It's cold. What do you suppose he is, a survivalist? If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person. Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that. It might behoove us to turn back at this point. A deer? What? I love you so much. We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny." Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y. Flares? I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit? Perfectomundo! We are ready! Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save. What SPF, sweetie? Oh, and the sun block? Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion? Shaving cream? Terrific. Can't wait! That's a great idea. Why certainly! Of course. I simply love the... naturalness of it all. I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature. I'm sorry about my parents. What are you doing in there? Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible. I don't care. I don't care! Like what, for example? You do? It's just that I have some peculiarities, and... Yes. Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical. Yes, and... It's only that I really enjoy your company and... I'm sorry that I became so upset. No biggie. Tell her, Harold... It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses. My God! The fork! The fork! You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ... Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world. Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm. The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels. It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans. I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded. Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course. Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid. No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment. I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing. I've been seeing someone. A therapist. Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond. Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics. I have to say that I'm not there yet. They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true. As do I. Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read. No. Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again. Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we? Puff, put the gun down. Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur. Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject. Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you? And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support. Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance. Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage. Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do. I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing. Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer. Even better. And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you. Tomorrow, the acid test. Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight. Lila? Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world. This is great, Puff. You're doing fine. Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case. Bravo, Puff! Bravo! I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis? Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha. No, why? So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.Oui. Let's go eat, I'm starved. As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet? Woof. Like father, like son. Gabrielle. Great. God, I've wanted you forever. Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off. But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind. Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us. I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad. Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you. We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows. What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together. Nice night. I want to be the way I was before. But I like being human now. Very well. It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know. Shan't happen again. My apologies, madam. You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you. I have to talk. Is that okay? Unka unka unka unka unka. Ounpoo. Ungh. Unn. Ugnh. Interesting. here, here. Thanks to you, Nate. It would be my pleasure, doctor. Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to... Got it. Oh, I will! Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you. It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really? Extra dessert? Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy! Yahoo! I bow to your expertise in these matters. I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem. I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors. Okay. That's fair. Oh boy! Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen. I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines. Yes. It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was... And I have to go back into the woods now... forever. Mother? Yes?And how do you feel about Gabrielle? I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila. Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair. Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on. Alright, asshole. Oh, come on! Asshole that does not count as a kill. Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life. Pause play. Speaking of which, duck! You got lucky. Watch it punk, I'm armed.Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine. Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar. The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it reaches the core, we're done. Minimal. What? If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her. We don't have a choice! When the left hull goes, so will the right. THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship. Rizzo pull the fucking lever! What are you doing?!! Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize! Could you show a little compassion?! Goodbye old friend. We're not leaving Crutch! What do you mean, not enough time? Duck fuckers? Sergeant! Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room. Rizzo did. Explosive. We're blowing the walkway. Sergeant? We thought you were... Where the hell were you?!! Where have you been?!! Thorgan, pull us in. Kkinsa! Open the doors! Uh-oh. Thorgan, suit up. Let's move out! Two more charges to go. What are you doing back?!! Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on! Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there. I'll need system four converters. What are you gonna do, tell me? Rizzo! Can you hear me?! Shit! Everyone okay? Better let me. Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage. And you said high school was boring. Creepy. Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there. Suit up. And now we're all out of it. Hurry! I don't know! I'd say we have about ten minutes tops. Where is...? Thorgan? You coming?! Bring 'em all. Let's move! We could convert fission transistors. Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!Get out of here! Can't shut em' down from here. Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself? Bomb? Yeah, yeah. Well, what have you got to say for yourself? Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die! What? wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo! You just keep an eye out. Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs. You got that right. Not a chance. Yllo, what's your head count? Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time. My job. Jesus what the hell is that? Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two - I still think we should send for a team of real scientists. Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it. How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect? What if they're carrying? Did you even check? You're a teacher. My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . . Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here. We need weapons. Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down. I need to know what you know about this guy. I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us. Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on! Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead. I'm with you kid. Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!! Kicker, anything? Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do! You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!! Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt. Jesus, God! I'm pulling, damnit! Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down. Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo. Give me a break! What happened? Where is everybody? What happened?I don't have all day, kid. Okay, enough of this shit. Yes it does. He's not part of the program. That sucks. Why won't he go down? You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head. That's nine to four, geek-boy. Punk?Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing? Negative. Fuckin A... Roger that. Time to kick some ass! Oh man, what the hell happened? Leave him behind! Defense droids. I'm on it. Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door. Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out. Yo, Teach, what the fuck?See you then . . . doctor. If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here? Alright, I'm . . . No way . . . is this a joke? Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . . You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good. Delongpre! Out of time! Done? We made it? I don't know. Nothing. His mother? Can we blow it with just two? We can't lead him into the other hull! What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship? What's that? No. If the ship goes, so does Jaso. It's locked! Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out. We don't have time to argue! Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks. Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting! He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here. Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?! Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it. Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live. He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it. No, you're dead! You're all dead! Where is he? I get it. Old woman? Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you? I'm stuck! Delongpre, you don't even know me. I think so, why? I think I had some when I was eight. No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing! Okay, good tip. Eat me. His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work. Oh sure, all the time. Wait around on your asses all day. I'll need a distraction. You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it. Not so bad. I couldn't save them. They were all wrong. They couldn't control him. Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going. I thought you meant... So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up. What's this? Hey!! Hey. It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II? What if you miss? 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?! I guessed. Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die. Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work. Don't just stand there! Shoot him! Guys!!! The shuttle? Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. Last chance. Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something? I hope so. We have to get off this ship. Sergeant, we could use a big bomb. Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways? Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge? Boeman don't. You know I'm right. I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves. You killed him? Are there any other shuttles? I'm surrounded by idiots. Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie... Barbie from hell... Robot huh? I gotta go back. Damn! Close the door! I'll be right back. Then open the doors! Keep trying! I just know. Ssh. He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship. Three...two...one... How do you open the damn door? Guys, please come with me! That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee! More soldiers? What good will that do? You wanna die? Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all! Get him out of there! I didn't say he was alive. Jason! Can't you see? He did this. Are you finished? Jason? He's on this ship?! But...I...400 years? JASON?! WHERE IS HE?! 30? How long was I out? Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible. How did I get here, how did you bring me back? Where..? Who . . .? I'm alive. You brought me back. Guys, he's right behind us! Can we get through these? Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me. Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing. So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces? What have I done?! Idiots. Old Earth? Hockey player? He's not a ...This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program? Goodbye, my love. Done! As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance. Kay-Em! I'm coming, I'm coming. Hey! I'm not ready. They're back here. We're not supposed to do that. The hull's imploding! I think I broke my arm. Where'd you get the gun? You see that? Nice touch. Cool. He's trying to ask you out on a date. Oh, shit. He's going to see us. Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you? Just come on, I've got an idea. Kaboom. I'm on my way. I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing? Go-go-go-go-go!!!! Yuck. She's obviously dealt with this guy before. You're leaving me here alone? Would you? You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you? Hurry! She's lost it! You think it killed . . . Yeah, I guess not. I'm gonna spew. This is what it means right here. I missed you too. Kay-em you okay? Kay-Em we made it! You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you. Kay-Em, you okay? Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass. Good point. Sorry, sorry. Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming. Almost done. Come here, might as well fix that arm. Am I in there? Oh shit! There he is! The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back. Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden. It's okay. Sure but what good will that do? Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there. Yes! Exactly. What have you done? He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead! The hockey player? He a friend of yours?Sergeant! But I didn't see... Ok Sarge, what's your status? Yeah yeah. Got it. Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though. At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski? JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later. ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends. Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa. Wait a minute...I need... Fine, just stay out of my way. Hit it. What the hell are you doing? That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with. I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean? I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back. Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her. Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head! I am an expert! Get them in the lab! They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the shuttle. Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre? We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey. Shut up! She just wants this thing dead! God damnit! Will you stop doing that?! I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women. More time...shit, she's had 400 years... Well? She broke my fucking nose! I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do. It's time. We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report. Thank you. We've got a situation here! Just do as you're told! Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab. Just get us to the ship! Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found. Adrienne! Stoney! I'm missing two! Crutch? Jesus! Can't you knock? Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf. Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous! Jesus! Later. No! He's coming with us! Kicker! This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way. Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century! We're missing two of the kids! I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours? Hypothetically, how much are we talking? Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at. I'm sending you the files. We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found. It's okay, he just wanted his machete. You're crazy! 4You're not going anywhere. Scientists. Very intellegent men. They can deal with this sort of thing. Are we locked down? You're not going anywhere. That's ridiculous. You're overreacting. Azrael can you repeat that? Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive. Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking. He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity. That's right, now if you could... We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions. Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions... We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years. Nanotechnology. Obviously so.Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs. Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups? But it's a top three school -- Harvard Law School?Huh? Come again? Who's askin'?Who? What? What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder. I believe we are. I'll take that as a no. Were you with another man? Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi. He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury. Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons. Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood. You understand you're on trial for murder? What alibi? Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him? Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon? Did she have a weapon in her hand? I do. I'm not allowing it. You're not going up there. I'm a man who knows what I want. You're a beautiful girl, Elle. I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate? I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll. About the alibi -- You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened. Sit down. Good work today, Ms. Woods. What are you talking about? Why the hell not? Did you get it? That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi. Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair? So she was distraught that her husband was dead? Was she carrying a weapon? What did you see when you entered the house?That's not what's important. He's an ass that's gonna try. He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass. What do you think? Someone missed you. So Friday at eight? As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy. Up for a celebration dinner? Oh, my God!! What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay. So now you're -- ? What're you talking about? You earned it -- Whoa -- Why? Hey -- Back up. How do you know he's gay? What?! You really think I'm attractive? Projecting joy is not my job. I don't -- Do that stuff. What the hell is that for? That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should. In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him. Wait -- Hilary Clinton. I can't. Okay, how would it work? You're serious? The what? So? And you know this for a fact? How can you still believe she's innocent? Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship? We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan -- Damn. We can't see her for an hour? I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade. How do you figure? But maybe it is -- And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something. She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network... She's completely untrustworthy. Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi -- Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did? I wasn't gonna -- Good luck. And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from. Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability. Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have? No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers. You have Stromwell. The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method. And what is your boyfriend's name? And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham? Where? Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date? Hovering? Why do you say that? I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney. Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it. Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did? She's naked.Just the love in my heart. Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close. No, she was crying her eyes out. I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham. Chuck. Three months. A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us. Yes.There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count? Your what? Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck. Class schedule, map, book list.Name? Relation? Licensed attorney or family member?You don't really believe she's innocent? That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it. His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy. Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body. Amazing how? Maiden name -- Daniels. You know her? It's pink. You should. Do you have a resume? You're applying for my internship, aren't you? Yes? Ms. Woods? Why not?Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt. -- his life? How about -- Would you be willing to stake your life on it? Yes?Are you serious? It made me realize something. I'm an idiot. How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on? Pink ones. If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself. You look -- nice. I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get. Well, yeah, but -- I didn't mean -- Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough. That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos. Now I am. Wow. You're a walking felony. Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party. Good. Good. So -- uh -- how was your first class? Uh -- sure. You got into Harvard Law? You go where? What're you talking about? You're not here to see me? I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious. East coast people are different. I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me. Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do. Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus. C'mon. Let me take you home. Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine -- That's not entirely -- Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn. I'm sorry, Elle, I just -- That's why I think it's time for us to -- But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around. My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day. I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious. You're beautiful.With Dale. Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through! And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best! And he said he loved me! Dad's disappeared! I'm not cheating! I'm not looking! Marco! When does George get to come see his house? I checked everywhere. He's not there. He's not there. That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up. Huh, Mom? And video games after! Did you know him before you knew Dad? Sam! We can work. I wanna be with you today. Are you going to see Sam again? I love red! That's my favorite color! What color? Who are you? I don't think Dad wants you home. I would have anyway. Mom said I should.Months. After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit? Well, if it is, we have a problem. Mr. Stevens. One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height. He's filed to have construction stopped immediately. I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass? I hate to ask about a window. Allowed outside the enclosed area. An exhaust system or a window is code. Oh, yes. Bob Larson. Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen? Mr. Stevens?Well, it's the least I can do. Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work. I could maybe ask them if you could choose one. But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. They're a part of this firm. They inspire me. I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed. It amazes me. I would miss that too much. Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay. What can I do for you, George? Well, I feel better about this now. I didn't know there would be a quiz, George. Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor. What are you talking about? You love your job. Listen...maybe I can get you a year. Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there. Forty. Oh. That's too long. Maybe that's too long. Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects. It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do. All of us are typing and clicking, George. Whether we want to, or not. This isn't me. We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer. But you won't change. Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry? Peter Webber! Right. Quite the spotlight on that guy. Right...she married...what was he? How's your wife? how much weight have you lost? What are you on?I know what the deal is. Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid. Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer. It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends. All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude. My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod. Income village is the place to hook up with hump. The whole summer, man. Party in Tahoe.What did you think it would be? Let's shut up and not kill her. Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that? I've taken a lot of morphine. Oral morphine...for my back. Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing? You have to ask like that? You're a good girl. I mean drugs. I thought you said he was? Can you keep Sam straight? I had them in my pocket. My keys. What's today? Don't you have school? I'm living here while I build another house. Alyssa. Why? Are you his friend? He must. I'll survive. That would take weeks. To the patio and one north-facing window... And six inches to the height. I have the permit. It's thirty feet. If that's what it takes. I flushed it down the toilet. A sink? And if I enclosed it? A violation? I've been dreading you. Yes, it is. Thank you. I built my first model here when I was twenty. There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. Twenty years of my life. I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? Only the ones that really mean something to me. I've got one favor to ask. Good. I was hoping for that. For everything. It may sound that way, but I react out of fear. My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like. You haven't been listening, have you? From the day I started...to today. Can't stand it. I hate this job. I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead. We were probably in school together. You went to Berkley? How old are you? Maybe...? I've been here twenty years. I'm not. Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models. I did tell you, didn't I? That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today? He buys and sells the world. When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry. Now she's just hostile. Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry. Pardon me? I'm good, thanks. Hello? I forgot where I put my keys. My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what. You were the only neighbor I could tolerate. The plumber's due out on Friday. There are no windows facing my...exposure. He escaped. He's going back in. I don't wanna go, Sam. I never tried to get you to like me. I tried to get you to love me. I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it. We're all dying from the start. I just got picked for Advanced Placement. Yes. I wanted you here so we could have a few months together. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Something bad to force something good. The kind where there isn't really an answer. I wanted you here so we could have a few months together. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Something bad to force something good. The kind where there isn't really an answer. Are you taking them still? She seemed upset. You look better than ever. Absolutely. Have him put it on a separate line. At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses. After everything. I loved him too much. Everything would have been better if you had. You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother. I remember reading about her in the paper. They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that. I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him. To hide a black eye. I was just thinking about my mom. She wouldn't leave him. I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. I mean it was dark outside and in. But we never talked about it. I'm proud of you, Sam. If I asked you to stop, would you? What would you be doing now? I gave up on you. I wish you had told me then. I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you. So, I didn't. He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that. When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment. But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting. I know parts of who you are. That's not true. What are you now? What would you like to be? I know the feeling. I know. Why? Hi, Alyssa. Try it. It feels good. Do whatever you want with it. I don't care. All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together. Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are. This is the end of it, Sam. I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you. You know that great thing, though? Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is. Or it can just blow you away. Make you something different in an instant. It happened to me. I won't ever hit you. I don't want you smaller. I want you to be happy. You're not. Not here with me. Not home with your mother. Not up in Tahoe. Not alone. Not anywhere. You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes. In your sleep. In your answer to everything. You're barely alive. The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never won the game. Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words... My dad used to play a game. I never really understood what it was until after he was gone. Sit down for a second. The gloves on the table are for you. I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit. I might have a solution. A friend of yours is here. Well, until you know, you can't go. When are you going to be back? Where are you going? Hey...hey! You'll have money when you work for it. I can promise you complete privacy. I don't beg. I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati. It'll be fine. I'd blame you. I want you here. You'll have money when you work. I don't know. Your brothers are right. It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around. It bugs me. I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out. No you don't. Get the inkling, Sam. I'm getting tired of your attitude. Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing? I warned you yesterday. Goodnight. I almost saw Catalina. You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father. Think of it as a family tradition. You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam. I won't ever hit you. This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it. So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck. Now. Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too. And there's no make-up at my house. No glue sniffing. Huffing. No pills, no grass. You don't have a choice. You have everything? I'll get your bag. You'll know me by the time we're through. Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me? Because I live there. I'll be around to check up on you. Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime. Isn't that weird? I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years. Six years. I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me. A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to. I haven't been touched in years. I can die trying. Stage four pancreatic cancer. They haven't even pretended to offer treatment. You tell me, when would you start eating red meat? You know what mortise and tenon is? I'd build a house. Good for you. I don't let him. He just loves to. I want you to find someone for me. I need you to do me a favor. I haven't forced him to work. I only wet him down once. Why would he leave? Check the permits. It was built as a guesthouse. It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated. Ah! Oh.... Thanks for telling me. It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title. Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty. I aimed high. She's a little sad, is all. She needs to be alone, I think. Oh. Sorry. Three. Not a perfect day. I'm an idiot to have you up there. It's not my back that's killing me. So could I. What? What did he say? Left you? No. Mostly me. I didn't think you'd come today. You need to know what? Do I still love you? Let's not do this, okay? You bit my finger. I can't pick you up. I'll say a lot of things I've never said before. It's habit. That was the truth. What did I say? Going on? I can hire workers to help me. I'd rather you not be here. How much time do they get to spend with their dad? It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore. I'd hate to have them bored. Maybe you shouldn't come everyday. Oh, I'm worse. Much, much worse. Watch out for the smile, boys. Tell him how you made me fall in love with you. It's been a while. I think so. You're a good mother. I'll find something that won't kill them. You brought your kids? He won't use my shower. I don't get it. No, I'm...thanks. I took something. My stupid back. With your hands or your tongue? Hindsight. It's like foresight without a future. Go in there and lick his attitude. Oh...with his ear infection! Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though? Finished or unfinished? It's not breakfast yet. What is it? You head was pressed against my chest. I could feel your heart racing. And I remember I kissed your hair. The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves. It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was. Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good. It's been a long time. I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has. That I'm happy today. I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza? Which? But you hated four out of the five you did. What? We're fine. Turkey sandwiches. He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe. If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring. He can hate me. You can hate me. He can try to kill me while I sleep. You can call the police. You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me. He's my son. He's sixteen. That's it. Let's go. He's not spending the summer in Tahoe. Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me? I can't leave the house? I don't have a phone. Hey, hey! I want him with me. At least we'll have a house to show for it. Sounding? I need help. He's cheap labor. The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a toilet. We'll survive. Not for the weekend. For the summer. I'll be by Saturday to pick him up. When's school over? The garage. I love those doors. Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy. There's nothing anymore to stop me. I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house. I was parked in day parking. I need to talk to you. I wasn't thinking. Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think. Kurt's been feeding him. Four days. I left to think. A blueprint spool. I didn't think you'd know I went missing. I'm not talking just physically. Even your anger is perfect. You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life. Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up. You're loud today. Why does he have a lock on his door? He doesn't answer. Where is he? You let him pierce his nose? You should lock your doors.I could use the money. He already knows everything about what he can't do. You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want. She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen. I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing. She like figures things out on her own and then that's it. Don't even...I'm there. You got the money? Nothing. It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes. Been thinking?Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches. He builds models for architects. His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen. George just never really...aimed that high. Even with not hitting a rabbit. I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun. It was always like you were frightened. Quiet and boring. We've known each other since grade school. You've been good this week. And of course the Beck's, with the... From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today. Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn. The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure. Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day? God, you look like crap, George. It's my day off. I thought I'd help with the plumbing. I'm surprised he hasn't left. Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house. I know there's an explanation. At least your father tried, George. Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot. I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you... Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it! I can't afford dirt in this town. I live in Riverside, Goddammitt And you get to piss in the ocean. Left you this place. We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know. I liked your dad more than I liked you. Then you tell me, what just happened? What the fuck? What are you talking about? He said he heard hammering.That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me. I'll be in the bedroom. Where are the kids? Please don't leave me. I never asked for more. You live a fabulous life, Robin. I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me. That sounds pathetic, doesn't it? I was talking about our marriage. So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it? You can't go with me because of Sam? You can't go because of Sam? Good. That was the plan. We couldn't stand him and George needed help. What? Lois will stay with them. Or we can pawn them off on your parents. Sooner than the Fall. Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative? We should take a vacation. I'd be you. If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry. Should I? Is Lois still here? I'm starved. His father is a man. I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle. You don't look like you. Do it now! Take it off. Are you wearing eye shadow? Okay. No. I've missed you guys. You got a dog? Hey.We did a lot of the wiring too. He was there and then he wasn't! What are you doing? I don't even care if he ever comes back. Because Dad left? It's okay. I just wanted to know where Mom was? How many bedrooms will your house have? I guess I could teach you some things. Do you know anything about building a house? Why? It's not ours. It's George's. Hey. Dad's home, already? Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy! Yes, it is. Someone stop her! Can we really help build a house? All day again? Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early? Dad said it first. Queer. Why?Red. Do you guys feel like painting? He hasn't called? So put your plans of my room in the trash. Oh. What's that for? Floating to Catalina. I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. You'd hate him for the trick. You hate your father. Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours. On the handlebars or your shoulders? Okay. I guess. What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality. I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you. It would help me if I could kiss you. You're off, you know? You're way, way off. You're driving me crazy! Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire? I'm not gay. What are you talking about? It's freakish. I don't get it. I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look. What's the point of this? Hand me a towel. Hand me a towel. I don't even...what do you mean? I don't even know what that means. Why are you so stupid? I don't want you to! Hand me a towel. I'm getting out. I'm sorry. I'm just here to shower. He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it. Really? Not really. No. Kinda. He got busted? I can use your mom's. No thanks. Why? Really? Yeah. No. That's okay. I might not stay, anyway. I can't even take a shower here. He's a freak. He jumped into the ocean. I don't know. I don't know. I'm supposed to be in Tahoe. They're trying to make me spend the summer here. I'm leaving in the morning. Hey. I'm hungry! Where's my dinner? Who ate my dinner? Huh? Who's in trouble now? Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa. Is Alyssa here? We're getting out of the ground today. Thank you. Thanks, I'd like that. Thank you. Thanks for the shower. Not a shower. I'm sorry. Uh huh. Oh...okay. Oh...do you know when she'll be home? Is Alyssa home? You don't know what the deal is. There is no fucking deal. I never said anything. I haven't done anything. I'll ask. I don't know. Here. Well, congratulations! You fucking pulled it off! This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here? Trying to get me to like you. You lied to me! And you told Mom today? I still don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. What kind of problem? I still don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. What kind of problem? No, but I count them. In a sock isn't new, you know? I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what? Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain. And you're going through them quick. What's wrong with your back? I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left. Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside? That's so weird... After everything he did to you and your mom? Do you ever wish you had done it? I would have killed him. Why wouldn't she leave? Sun glasses? Are you talking? Don't be. And hide whatever that new drug is you have. I like it. I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying. Getting high, I guess. I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up. I'm telling you now. He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today. He's got nothing to do with me. What do you know about me? See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am. Nothing. What I'm not. How do you become something you're not? I like how it feels not to feel. I took some of your Vicodin. Hi, Mom. We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father. Don't. I don't want it. I'm not even listening. I'll have to pay him back. I was holding for someone. That wasn't even mine. Oh, so you're in the big shit now! Child abuse. People go to prison for what you just did to me. No. You can't make me do a thing. You're too fucking late. I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid. You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now! Did you got through my pants? Where is it? Oh, okay. I don't know. I don't know. I'm leaving. If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money. You can't promise me anything! You don't have anything to promise! You live in a garage! You don't have cable! You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer! You don't have a job! And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard. Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom? I'm not doing it! No one would blame me if I left! You're so predictable. I'm gonna take a walk. I need some money. You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out? Why? I hate turkey. No. Don't touch me! You can't touch me! What are you doing?! Probably in the bible. Are you totally insane?! I'll hate you forever. If you hit me, I'll call the police. Mom...please. I'm not going! Mom, tell him I'm not going. You already promised me! I'm not going! Who are you, anyway? I don't even know you. No I'm not! You live in Cory's parents' cabin? Why would you be there? To check up on me? It's just a joke. A stupid joke. I'm thinking it's too weird now. I wasn't sure. What's your deal with Alyssa? You got any weed? Does Alyssa know? No. The payoff. Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said. I'm sixteen years old. I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you? Who? Do you like red? Either do you. If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through? No. Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court. Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for. Maybe it's what I want. This is what he wants. Yeah. I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it. The door was open. Depends on what I'd give up on. There were no PG's. So I just gave them money to play games. I locked the door! Get out! I locked the door! Get out! What are you doing in my room?Good luck. Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep. Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today. Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.We have snifters When served warm -- Snifter are for warm drinks --It's on West Broadway. I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though. Women? As far as...? Thank you, sir. It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms. Honestly, the suites are all about the same. All the suites are about the same. What, sir? Thank you very much, sir. Are you sure? Not on me, sir. I can take you down there. Yes, sir. Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315. Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you. ...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening. They were grabbing her fucking ass -- What are you talking about? No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks. No thank you. Yeah. Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben. What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang? I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did. Nobody's fuckin talking to you. No more. Bullshit. You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks -- I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone. Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late. What time is it there? Mommy's not home? Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy? Chloe? You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby. What's wrong, baby? Show uncle Ricky what you made. Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes? She's, uh, sleeping. Ricky, can you put on a seat belt? What'd you say? Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up. Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can. How could you let her see this? She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had. Max offered to stake me. I'll support you. I want you to quit. Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you! Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife! Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin. No way that cocksucker's driving you. Go. Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner. No coke tonight. Right? I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it. I feel weird asking him. Well, that's not gonna happen. Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if -- You talk to Max today? They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face. I'm ready. Who's watching the baby? If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around. Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy. I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy? A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered? No. What kind of bachelor party? So, what kind of gig is this? Honey? I don't get it. Your dance is over. Get your hands off of her. I said no touching. I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching. There's no touching. Where's Ricky. That it? How so? Where's Ricky? Where we going? It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives. Heard of them. Ruiz tied in out there? What do you mean 'troughed?' Yeah? No. Where is this happening? So what do we do? Yeah. What's that? Why isn't Ruiz coming? Shit. When's it going down? How bad is it? So, when's the drop. What's his name? He making the drop? Yeah. Where is he? Get away from her. She'll be out in a minute. You driving her? Yeah, sure. 5-5-1. Draw. I had a fight up at Sportsman's. I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant. There won't be a next thing. You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked. I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club -- You want -- Yes. Yeah. No. Okay. I'll think about it. It's not that I don't appreciate the offer... I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess... Yeah. Sure. He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear. He'll work it off. You told him you liked him. What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity. Ruiz knows about this? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I know. No. I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm -- I don't understand. Then what are you saying? So, that's it. I'm out? What? I'll work it off. That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom -- They were out of line -- Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line. That's why they call it the smart money. She was fast, huh? Pshhh... This one? Why? Me? No. Not really. Sure. Yeah. Where's the drop? What's the plan? A bad heart. Nah, man... Good morning. We get it. We're sorry. What drill? Taken care of? Aren't we waiting for Ricky? Yeah. Yeah? This Ruiz guy, what's his deal? 'Trustafarians?' Yeah. No. That's cool, man. No. Just the cross streets. Harlem? What is it, a restaurant? So, Jimmy, you know where this address is? Where is the Soho Grand? Nah. I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant. What's that? Bobby. Hi. I, uh, think that's us. Listen, man, we really gotta... It's important. Excuse me, we need to make a call. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it. Can you check? We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list? We're with Ruiz. I'll be a minute. I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in? Take us right to Kennedy. Now. Easy... You're not getting a gun. Where do you get this shit? Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed. I don't want to take any more chances. Let's just go now and wait. How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner. No more, man. This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy. Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school. I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me. They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker... Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room? I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks! What happened to the fifteen hundred? Eighty bucks?!? What do you have left? You're out of money? Why? It was six in the fucking morning. You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun? You wouldn't even know where to get one. I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him We don't need guns. I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins. Did you hear what he just said? Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now? The what? Let's do it. Nothing, man. Yeah. Where they gonna whack us? I swear to God, I'll fucking puke. Put that shit out... We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse. You gonna shank him in the shower? What are you doing. It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan. We're not getting whacked. He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know. He wants to see us now. Hi. It's Ruiz. Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye. What the fuck was that about? What the hell did you do? Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. What the fuck's going on? Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one. Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car. You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz. You fucking nuts? Where do you think you're going? Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop. Why you gotta make everything difficult? You happy? Yeah. You would think. Like I said, I don't know. What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy? I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot. What did I 'get?' Missing what? He didn't say shit. I don't know. His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade. You got something to say -- What the fuck is that supposed -- You just don't fucking get it, do you? You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you. Motherfucker... You sold it? I thought they stole it. No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are. What the fuck do you have to complain about? What the fuck do you... No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner. They asked who it was. Nothing. I told you what they said. They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth. Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime? It's on West Broadway. We can walk. We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month. I know you're not calling Jimmy. What are you doing? Who's gonna smell me a mile away? Oh really. Why's that? Don't worry about it. Just be smart. Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last. Great. On my fucking room. Jesus, man. Plus ten? How much was it? How much is it? C'mon, man... Who you calling? Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service. 'Cardiff Giant.' That's us. No. Look. There. Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go. I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max. We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call. Nah, don't bother -- What's the movie? Pretty nice. It's ours. Is that the woman from..? I don't know. Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore. She wants you to paint the ashtray. I'm not taking her to a bar. I promised Chloe we'd come here. See? Now everyone's got one on. What do you got there? C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket. Seat belt. How'd you unlock my phone? Nice work. I like it. I like it. I gotta pick up the baby. Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him. We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business. Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus. I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus. We look good this year. Sorry coach. You wanna go right now? Bullshit... What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow. No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity. You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job. He didn't say we need guns. We don't need guns. Come on, man. Not with the owners here. Shhh... Then why do you try to get in? I thought you hate that club. Bye. I will. I got no idea. I know the number. Yeah. I know the number. I'll page you. I'm not gonna bring it up to him. Don't be shitty. Don't be shitty. It's not losing record. Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1. So? What are you saying? What about boxing? C'mon... Bobby and Ricky. Tom. How's it going?Any time, bro. Sorry, man, but... He's not here. Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though. Ruiz isn't here. He's on the list. Hey. I'm half Lebanese. Maybe you wanna try the China Club. What? You see a Ricky Slade? How is it you're good? You on a list? The line's over there. Cool. You look good, man. You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting? What's up, man.I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else? Excuse me. Yes. Yes. Would you care for another one? Yes? You're up front. Everything's free up here. How much is what? I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage. It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes. Yes?I be off in a minute. Say again...? So's this. Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying? I'm on the phone. Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...I -- I -- I... Don't... Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber -- Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment? Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone -- But what about them? Whu --Then put my Martel's in a snifter. What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker? Yeah, snifters are for cognac -- Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time. I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with. This is it. That's it. He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there. Ricky's taken care of. Quick drop. In and out. And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge. They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case. Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants. Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it. He must have that shit troughed. Brooklyn. Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is? We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then. We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California. A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit. This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller. Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows? It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing. To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now. Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon. Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy. What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz? Excuse -- C'mon girl. Eat up. Yeah. What's up? Jess ready? I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight. Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money. What's your record at? Well, you look it. You win? It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been? I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?. Watch it... Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta. The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician. Just don't ask me no more shit. Stop. See you later. What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?' I'm not saying shit to neither of you. Don't drag my ass into this -- I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?' Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to. 'Strapped?' Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me. Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there. Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull? No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery. Couldn't make it. Here's the money. That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink. No, thanks, man. We got to head out. How's it going? Here... Don't worry, man. It's all for you. That shouldn't be a problem. Coke? What do you want? Sure. Anyplace in particular? You want another drink? No shit? Well, he ain't gonna be around no more. Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home. Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here. Word. Nah, man... Good morning. Yeah.Yeah, he's getting there on his own. Ricky's taken care of. Understand me? Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship. You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean? Depends what night. Spa? I can wait around if you want. Well, this is the corner. You don't know where you're going? Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem. Soho. Traveling light. I like that. Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked? You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right? Hi. I'm Jimmy. Different. Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians. The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand. No. What is it? I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff. Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell. You'll love it. You're from LA, right? The Soho Grand? Soho Grand, right?Thanks. We're square. Four fernet. Sure. You boys want anything?I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing -- Take a few days -- Yes. Goodbye. Not you. I want Ricky to answer. What is it? Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear? Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask? You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished. How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in. You vouch for him? I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me. That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van. Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky? Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth. We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop. Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent. I got a way we make everybody happy. Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say? Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out? It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you. Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep. I didn't say that. You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul. Not driving Jess, you won't. Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand. They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth. Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys. I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you? Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast. A million. Easy. Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today? It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze. Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it? You bet the ponies? You like the ponies? And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing. We're square. I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van. Goodbye. Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you. So tell me how it is. Tell me. You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming? What? You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you. That money is your per diem. Yes. You're going to New York. dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK. Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --See you later. Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is. Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway. Nightlife. Where's the hot ass? Where's the place to go tonight? No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty. What if I gave you forty? Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms. Is it the good room? So? Yeah. Take it. Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty. Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred? Is it a good room? Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here. What's 'incidentals?' Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay... Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !' I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here. So you're models? I don't get it. What do you do? You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything? So, wait, you're from where? No. I'll wait here. Dude, we were practically made... Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan. Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up? Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy. Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance. Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice... Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better. Three and a half hours? So what do we do? Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep. It's gonna be fine. I'm sorry... This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie. Calm down. What about it? You did? You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while. Eighty five. Eighty. No. You wanna see how fast I get a gun? Float me a hundred bucks. That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden. Wanna bet? All the more reason. I'm pretty sure we do. We need guns. Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house. Yeah. Let's look at the penguins. The penguin house. Let's check out the penguins. I'm your soldier. You want us strapped, don't you? Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us? C'mon, man... Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up -- I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked. Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is? We're getting whacked. Where? What's up? She was jonesing for me. I swear to God, I didn't do anything. Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub. Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do. Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk. Siddown, motherfucker. 'Sex and paychecks.' Look who's back? Want some champagne? Fine. You got that right. Work's over. I'm gonna party. Back in. Fuck this. You too? About what? So we're working? He woulda told us right? So is this the drop? Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas... Yeah. What vibe? Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him? Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it. This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else? You know this guy? I mean, that's what I heard -- You know he fucks all his girls, don't you? Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that. Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy. Sold it, stole it, whatever... Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van. Don't even start. This is bullshit, man. So they said more than the address. How'd they know who you were? Nothing else. They didn't say an address? What exactly did they say? Fuck... Well, I don't want to walk. You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it? As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that? What are you doing? Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about. We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit. But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already. Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay? Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy. Yeah, I guess. Forty-six. How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye. Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool. Shhh... Hello, room service? You sure? Maybe we should call for a cab. Oh, I'll represent alright. Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours. You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here. I'll get the girl. See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets. Holy shit. Can you believe this? To keep? She really liked the kitchen. Right here's fine. This paint sucks. The white shows through. Who's driving her? I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple. What? Did she say something? Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid. Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's. Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer. Jesus Christ, fine. Alright? No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer -- I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer. Shhh... Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there. You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four. It's not even yours. Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid. Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass. Who is this fucking Ruiz? What are we delivering? Fuck him. We'll kill Fairfax this year. Sorry coach. I'll beat your ass -- Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you. Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds -- Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity. He implied it. I think we might. We need guns. Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early... Fuck them. I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace. So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.' I'll page you with the number. Ask if he said anything to her. I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done? Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number. Yeah. Page me. You know the number? Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up... I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us. How am I being shitty? That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record -- So, it's not a winning record. So, it was a draw. You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max. What about it? Did Max mention anything about any jobs? I didn't do anything -- You want to come splash around. Well, come on then. It's back here. You want your surprise? I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel. What do you mean 'kinda?' And you grew up in Manhattan? Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list. Did you see that shit? Motherfucker. You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech? Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you? Cardiff Giant. Just check. Cardiff Giant? Yeah. Ricky Slade. Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean? Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man. Hey, bro. Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double. Where do you live? Where do you live? Yes. Drinks are free, right? The videos. Yeah, sure. How much are they? Ugh... Yeah, uh, what's the movie? I'm half Irish. Ow, shit... Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split. So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything? I'll tell him someone else told me. You really in trouble? What? Why am I bad? Why? What I say bad? He spoke to me. You want me to dis him? It means you got a gun? You strapped? How do you know it's not drugs? Where's Spa. I call 'em wiggers. A lot of Persians? I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is? You know my pager number? So you're our own private guy? So whenever we want... Yeah. Yeah. Is it nice? Ricky. Yes, sir. But, Max -- So, wait, what are we dropping off? You want... Why are you picking on me? Don't worry. I get it. I get it. Yes. What about my keys? Keys. Yeah. And where do we bring it? And the money. Where do we bring the money? We're going to New York? Can I borrow a piece of -- When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street. Why aren't you coming? Yeah. So, we're talking money laundering... The Red Dragon. Who's gonna outfit us? He has a cute what...? No... Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that? She poured it for -- We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything. It's a digestif. Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that. No. I'll take a strega. I'll get it. Dip? A rose by any other name would -- Well, word on the street is you're Welsh. And where might that be? Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live? So, you must be the Red Dragon.You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say? Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight. Tom, the Welsh dude -- I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it. Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon. Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas? Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house. Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears. 'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?. That's him. Now you all know the drill, right? Last thing I want is you with a gun. You think it's funny, motherfucker? You think this shit's funny, Ho? Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa. Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room. You rode? Thanks, man. You need anything, you call. Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you? Yeah, bring us four fernet. That's none of your fucking business. What? Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down. Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account. Outfit? What's he talking about? Four mimosas. You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up. What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right? Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass. What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne. Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right? Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif. What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?Cool. See you later. A little. S'up.Fuck... Right, right. The 'thugs.' Fine, fine. And you were...? Hey, boys. I... I just hired these guys to watch my back... I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count. Sorry about that. Where's your mate? Come, now. You just got here. Brilliantly. Care for a pint? Here they are, then. No, really, mate? Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around... I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants. A little Charlie, perhaps. I hear the China Club is a laugh. Does anyone want another? Pity. What's say we have a drink? Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either. No? And where is...? Who's up for a night on the town. Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know. I am. Scotland. Edinburgh. Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom. And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini. Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare. Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist here. <i></i> I beg your pardon? Sad commentary, huh? Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here. Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull. Olive or eyeball? Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica , right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking? Animals? What kind of animals?Thank me next time you see me. It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead. Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him. I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go? <i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind. If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die. Well - you'd need a body. I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I enjoy my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is so irresponsible . Why ?? Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all his idea. You were completely innocent -Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day. Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now... At the moment, yes. He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see. Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit. You're really gonna pop the question? And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like. Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get People and Entertainment Tonight to cover it. Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit. Less. What's the matter? A pi�ata. That's a great idea! ...In some weird way I respect that. Oh my God...you're proposing? Why? Being rich is not a trap . That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them. Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta strike . I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth! Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God - Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here... Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!! You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain. That's not going to stop his nightmare - Holy shit.Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice! Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want. The monkey, of course. It was his idea. It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker ! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan! Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...? Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ? Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got big plans for that body of yours! Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying . And you didn't hear it from me. Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, very few people have done it. Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of that schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be grateful ? Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should know. I'm his little brother. Me? Me , go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to that piece of - Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick. Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM. Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support? It's a special kind of party. A farewell party. Do you...get what I'm saying? Kid - didn't they tell you about this party? Uh huh. And? Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the house ! <i></i> This is an honor . We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like caviar , man. You da shits !!Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist. Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine. Move it. We got exactly five minutes left. Isn't that Lulu? Stu...LOOK! There's a thing here! There's a switch! Stu...Stu... I don't know . Oh, sure . Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment? OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here. You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick . For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!! Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it? Stu, you have my absolute confidence . �- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!! Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum�. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT? I'm so dumb! I deserve to die - Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT?? Stu... It's a party . Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that. Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass. Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper. Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket? I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic. The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your ass ! I'm reportin' this to my union!! FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING - Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment! My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before. Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me. You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could both be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't count . Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me. I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's nightmares . And of course, I need not add - Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then. I was, uh, just getting ready to leave... I didn't say anything. Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable. Stu Miley. Olive. - Where exactly am I? Uhh - martini? Chasing me - animals - horrible - Death! Thank you! Back? You're sending me back? Hey. Where's Monkeybone? Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now. DEATH!! Bend over? Coming from you, that's quite a compliment. Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour. I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her. I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare you right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again. You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos. So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big pi�ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em. My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - right now . <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me. I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night. Herb. I have to go . I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap! Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand. Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries? Julie and I - we were just gonna go... You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons ?? Monkeybone...!? But why me ? Why'd you pick on me ?? Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!? YOU SET ME UP!! NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY - Land of Death. How do I get there? Hyp, I'll do anything. Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to... You're Death's brother ? Maybe you could talk to Death! Nine AM! But that's - twelve hours . Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never... I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some... Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm - Tell me what? Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm okay . Until I can get out of here... Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me die . My tail itches. Baby...you're asking the wrong guy. How was it? I don't recall. Julie?... Hey, you are a looker. I'd better go report this... Are you okay?? Did we just - hit something? I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life. I might wake up. I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream? The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him. Look at this! He won't let us leave! Yeah, I could , but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better. That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be us . Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you. They don't love me. They love Monkeybone. Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th-- How am I gonna get past the guards? You can't do this! You'll get in trouble! Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her what Monkeybone is up to?? Kitty... my situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey. Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again. Nothing for him! He's being repressed. Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y-- You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me. It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone? You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you. What? IT'S NOT WORKING. Where'd he go?? He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you. Now we just gotta figure out how to get there. All right. You can come. No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing. <i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you. Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone. Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do. Well - yeah - but that doesn't... apply . It was different then. I was depressed . My life is great now. I'm in love! Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you - How'd you get in there? Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little... doodle . I've been stuck down here for months . Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna kick ass ! He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get to wake up ?? <i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!! He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come he goes back and I stay here? Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey. What union? THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK! <i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying? I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name? Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my species . I am not. And I don't gotta. Then you can learn to act normally. I had to! You have humiliated me in public for the last time .Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body. No, I won't let you do it. Ha! Right bitch! Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?... Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash. Wife?! Ah, they just don't know you the way I do. Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend? Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all. That's it. Me, too. 101? Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy. Hey, Brenda. My favorite memory was when we -- Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you -- Oh... I guess I'll die now. And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.I don't care. You pick. Yeah. Can I borrow five bucks? Hey, wanna' share a soda? That's what your man is supposed to do. Hey, look out, a bee! Let's get a hot dog. You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love... I don't want to be your friend like this anymore. Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level. Look, what I'm trying to say -- Listen to me I -- I know, but I've been thinking -- Cindy, about this whole friendship thing... There's something I really want to share with you. Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die. Cindy, let me... Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend. Better try a little higher. No. Keep rubbing. No. Try a little higher. What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold. Shit! Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked. Huh? Great!!! I was thinking the same thing. Yes... Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking... Yeah, I think I'm bleeding. Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand? Let's get outta here. Where the hell are we? Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart... Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny. Whoa, check this out. She looks like you. Dude, somebody's on the rag. Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part. Sure. We can practice talking. It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh? Then what kinda stuff can we do? Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend. Open chest!!! Sure, that would be cool. Friends. Maybe we can study together or something. So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together. I meant you're into ghosts. So, I see you're really into spooks. Hey, you left your book back there.Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there. Nobody wants to go. Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform. We have to destroy him. Quick, everyone to the lab. What the hell are you doing? I don't need your help. The keys. She took the keys. I can do it myself. Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug. The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere. I think we should consider cutting the experiment short. Professor, we need to talk. What the hell?! I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded. The image there. No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out. Professor, I think you should see this. My God! Is she dead? Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders. Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there. That one. Yes, I thought that it would be best. Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances. Would you please focus? Professor! I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe. In about fifteen minutes. And what happens when all hell breaks loose? How are we going to get them all up there? They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre. That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met. Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this. As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration. I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top. Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for. Here you go, Professor. I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable. They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them. I finished all the interviews. Alright. Come on, you guys. Oh, I couldn't do that. That's right. Just a little Rogaine. And sexy. You do. Well, there's a lot riding on this project. Just a little experiment. Hi. That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate. Yours, or the turkeys? Thanks, handyman. I guess so. Alright, go to the belt store... Okay, give me my belt. A little bit... Give me your belt. Alright... I might need your help. What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine. I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs. It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy. How is she? I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before... Uh... I'm Father McFeely No, I'm fine. My holy water. What she said about your mother? Oh shit, you gonna take that? No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass. Remember, don't ask her too many questions. Then let us prepare. Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there. Did you bring my bag? Soon. First, I must bless this house. Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.Yes!!!! Now you'll be mine, Cindy. Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn. Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress. Made you say it! Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop." Um, I'm not touching anything. Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain. No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff. Thanks. I made them by hand. I'm Hanson the caretaker. Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you. I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two? Who's first? Anyone like a wing? I'm the caretaker, not the handyman. Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something. Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly. This part removes the sense of humor. Shorty, why don't you say grace? Yo son, check this out. Now you're being rude, Shorty. Sit down and join us, Cindy.Father, I think you should rest. No thanks. What? Because she will lie? Yes. Father, are you okay? Would you like to see the girl? Father.He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish. No, he lost the house after the stock market crash. No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth. This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora. Saw who?! Who? I don't like this, this... I take it you're not mad at me. Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you? Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss. Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment. No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together. Theo, did you see the animal? That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here. It's some kind of energy field. We better record this. Alright, Cindy, what's so important? I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story. Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated. Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do. Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves. That's why we came here, remember? What? What is it, Dwight? It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room. Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun. Are you sure it's not the tape? What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What? No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs. Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs? Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years. I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly. After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything. So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up? Even in the bathroom? Are those cameras all throughout the house? Fine. What's all this stuff? Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw. Right. What about condoms? Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone. We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation? I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders. Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House. Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids? What's this? Willing? I like that. And, this one? Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean. Ooh, I like her. Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing. Any of them hot? Are these all the subjects? Let me help you. Let me see the files.Okay. I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back. He's right. I should go first. Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around. Yeah, me too. You sure? So, I guess I can go now. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Shhh... It's okay. Hello Brenda. Yeah, I broke my fall. I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago. What's your location? I repeat, what's your location? This is Ray. What's up? Where are you? Yeah, they're so warm and soft. Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on. It's the sequel. It's okay. You mean to tell me we're dead! You're not wearing a belt. I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt. My help? You never could feel your legs. Second best. Don't worry, I got your back. Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys. Yo' Tommy, what up, man? "Fucked me." "Fucked me." "Fucked me." Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too. What does it say? I woke up naked, too.That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid. Hey, y'all! What's going on? That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine? I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy. Uh, uh. I told you it would taste just like chicken. Hey, I got an idea. Aww, the little bird died. Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later. Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together. Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn! Now you gotta learn the correct slang. Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this. Gear. You know, clothing. Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear. Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college? I don't know, but I sure hope so. I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage... Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God -- Sorry, y'all. My bad. Dog, you look hot. Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson. Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.Would you die already?! Never happened! Okay... maybe that would be best. Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day. That means more screen time for us. Let her go, Cin. So, whatever happened to her? Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me. No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone. Come on. We better get you cleaned up. Are you okay? She's right. We should stick together. What if I wanted to borrow those keys? You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate. Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it? Of course. So sexy. That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart. The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is. Work, work, work. Is that all that you do? What are you working on? Hello Dwight.Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me. I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man. "Ray!" "Ray!" Aww. Cool. Dude. Get out?! What does it say? It says, "Ray." Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.Well, then, as what did you go? Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party. Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony? Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party? Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive... All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now? Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl? We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this? Start with what you knew then. Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?" Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there? Good. Good. Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935. A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it? I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident." And what is the state of your memory now? Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory? Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true? Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right. Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix? Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson? Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"Mr. Appleton, you will... Go ahead, son. Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath. The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth. Yes. A prepared statement. Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct? The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton. We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee? Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?Don't mention it. Welcome home, Luke. Here we are. Ben, when's Delly due back? Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office? Exactly. Break it to her gently. Give the man a hug, boy! That's your father! Shhhhhh. Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory. What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here. A mystery or a damn miracle. And by god I can't tell which. Boy, you say you have no idea who you are? That right? No wallet, huh? Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers... C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou. Or the Bijou. Either one. The Jimmy Stewart picture? I remember that one. Saw it over at the Bijou. So, you remember that, huh? What's that? But what? You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?So... you do intend to fix the place up after all? You think it over. No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building. The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket. Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point. I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it. And that's just for the property, mind you. If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds. I just want the land. I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands. I don't think he gave it very much thought. And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou. Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back. Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.Thanks for the lift, Cecil. Well, son, you're home! Only one in town. Get in, son. Listen to me! The young man in there... Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there... Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here. Oh, God, I love you, son. I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it? Vultures... Anybody take it? Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel. Did you... did you... The film broke... Luke... what time is it? You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad." Ha! Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left. Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact... Beautiful, wasn't it? Oh, no, I... They're... Yes? Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly. You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball." Ernie. Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to. I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you... Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures. Yes? Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa. No, your mother did, then I did after she passed. I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too. Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start. This is the staff of the Bijou. They couldn't wait to see you. Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home. That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul. Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. C'mon, I'll show you where we live. Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to. Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight. We've been closed for a while. Wait'll you see the inside! Nine and-a-half years ago. You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two. You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead. Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby. Harry, son. Harry.Pete... Then I'll call you a cab. I wanna close up soon. C'mon, let's call her. Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up. Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy? Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender? You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening. Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him. The G-man? What. Pete. You think maybe you've had enough?I had it, a minute ago... Honey, I... I can't... it's the... It's possible. I'm afraid not. He looked right at your picture without batting an eye. But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him. It just takes a catalyst. He doesn't remember anything, Delly. Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone... Well... That always used to work. That's my girl! Did you...? How'd it go? Delly? In here. Tomorrow afternoon... ... oh my god... Mother o'god... Are you saying that he's... By all means. No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil? That's where you live. ... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me. Thanks. Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are... That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy. Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does. Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick." What is it? It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all. And you don't know your name or who you are, that right? Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before. Here, one of mine. Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean. Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in. Been drinkin' a bit, have we? Any idea how you got here, son? Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. I'm sorry. It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down. No, I'm not much of a dancer. You kids off to the dance? Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it... Evening, Luke.Take a hike. Am-scray. Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone. What's his rent? Wouldn't blame him if he was. Jesus. You smell gas? Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you? So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself. You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS. Well, that's not what they think. What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name? Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do. Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning. What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter? Not at all. Why not? Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer. When'd you quit smoking? Cigarette? No, of course not, why should you be sorry? You're the new Peter Appleton. You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. Very noble. That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets. Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden. Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's. Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President. But it'll always be someone. Count on it. Exactly. However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you. The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong. Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball? That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great. But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen. Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um... They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all. You can't testify. You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk. I know. A Purple Heart. Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix. They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know. Kid, that cuts no ice with them. You should watch what you say. So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization. Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is. "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters. Now, did you go to any meetings? Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did. Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?Delly, shhhhhh... Delly. I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father. And I'm not... I'm not Luke. Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now. Guess I must've learned. Thanks. That's... pretty frightening. How do you tell those two apart, anyway? Nope. Just filling in the blanks. No kidding. ... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on. Huh. That was nice of me. My what? They're not bad. Oh. I don't smoke? Have you got a cigarette? A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely. Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around. It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly. Oh. What? Oh... Were we going to get married? Do you have the... What was that? We were in love... weren't we? No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along. I'm sorry. You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that? What did... what did I want to be? Have you always wanted to be a lawyer? Whoa. So, you're really gonna be a lawyer? It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it. How'd they get it inside? Why me? City hall? Well... where can we go? Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome. I did? Huh! I do? Me too. What. I've seen you before. Your picture... Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt... A super market. Huh. That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...? Well, he loves the place. It's his home. We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work. Thanks. Good to meet you. Again. You're not going anywhere, Harry. A few. I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds. Did I what? I'm here. I know, I know... keep still. Jesus... Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start. ... what? Dad, I... Yes. Why don't you two get out there and dance? And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those? Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up. Well... You bet. I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up. Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry. ... Ernie. But I... Yeah, I know, but poultry...? "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?" "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs." "February 10, 1942. Picture 'Ball of Fire.'" Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here. Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here? You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has. Oh. What... what time is it? Who... are they? Mother. She's beautiful. Didn't you have any help? Why? Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed? Ah. Can't wait. Nine and-a-half years... When did I leave? Ah. Luke. Luke. I like it. And... what's my name again? Excuse me... what's your, um, your name? Can we get him to the hospital? Aren't you coming? Oh, you mean the suit. Harry kept all my old clothes. Fits okay, but it's a little big. What's wrong? Evening, Doctor Lardner. What? No, I... I can play the piano? That was beautiful. When was that? Oh. Yeah... me too. Of course. Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat. So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name? Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me. Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?" Is there a young Tim?That's my r-r-rent. T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army. They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war. We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here? Cat. Found me. No. I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure. Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are? All that matters is what you g-g-gave us. And you can't take that away now. You're wrong, Peter Appleton. You do belong here. Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that? Oh... Oh. Oh. They will. They w-w-will. They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back. Thanks. Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you! I see you got the telegram. Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong. Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you. Okay. What's the second thing? Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this. Damn... Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers... I wish you were coming with me. Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact. You'll stand by me? What about you, Delly? Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?" The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them. Thanks, I like it. I think. Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke. I know who I am now, and you don't. And... I don't like me very much. This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he? Yeah? I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me. Hi. That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member. I'm not refuting anything. No, sir. Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for? Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom... Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her. Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there. Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things? Yes it does. Yes... yes, I do. Mr. Clyde, I remember everything. Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory? Yes. Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there. Yes, sir. Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all. Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him. Sir, that is true. Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it. I... I need a drink of water. I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail. I'm a little hesitant to say. Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time. A statement? I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman. Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California. I do. I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out. I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago. The Bijou? I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it. "It's a Wonderful Life?" "It's a Wonderful Life." Well, this place sorta reminds me of something. No. But... Yes. 'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer. I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself. Nope. Can't. We're through. Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist. Sandra Sinclair. This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike. You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer? Too bad. He says I'm a communist. Zackly. You tight with J. Edgar Hoover? Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something. Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave. We live in a theater? Wish I could say the same thing. She's very pretty. Call me... Ishmael? I... no, I... I just can't... It's possible. I just don't remember. Thanks. I guess I did. I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it. No, sir. Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life? Oh god, oh, god, no, I... Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college... Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them. Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that. What do you mean? Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore. Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail. Not any more. Luke didn't smoke. No thanks. I'm not sorry for what I said. It's wrong, Leo. That's not the country Luke fought for. So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one. And I won't be a communist anymore. Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them. Yes. Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair! So, it is a blacklist. "Ashes To Ashes?" Yeah, well, that's enough. Why not? At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career! Exactly. I was decorated. Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes! What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one? I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist! Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway. No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying! Who the hell is this "they?" I... I don't believe this. I thought you... My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton. I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident. It's about me. Tim, I have to tell you something. The customers? I don't know... Please, sit. Sure. Come on in. I was just packing. Will you help me, Sandy? They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help. Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching. I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in? What exactly did you hear? You bet, honey. Thank you, Mr. Lawson. Yes. Very. The war... They all know you? I suppose. Thanks. Ancestors? No. Absolutely not. No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner. My girlfriend. If she still is... I already have.All right. All right. We'll see. Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way. Sir, are you a communist? Would that be Miss Sinclair? Who? Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are. Said as much myself, Doc. Can't place him, though. To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker. Well, morning's half-over. I'm off. Got any money? You hungry, son? Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max. Okinawa, I believe. Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy. 'Course they all know me. And I know all them. Town's got my name, don't it? You look familiar, fella. What's your name? Actually, my grandpap. But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it? Here.Huh? Oh, sure. Just pull the door shut when you leave. Huh? Thirty a month. Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency. He lose his job or somethin'? You think he's drunk somewhere? Hey, it's the best way to tell. Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.You've got a lot of fucking gall. Thirty nine. Scratch the two, write in a four. I have a small window of time. Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting? Any thoughts on casting yet? Hey, listen, I love her. She's Sophia's best friend. I never said any of this, alright. I'll deny it on the stand... You guys are gonna have kids. That is so great. Maybe that's what this is all about. Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore. You know adults don't do this for a living. You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough. Sophia knew that intuitively. Look at Clair. Clair's a mess. Make sure she gets the epidural. Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be. "Life is but a walking shadow. A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film? Mac's a pretty great director, Joe. He's a woman's director. And nothing's happening. Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed. He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place. And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script. She can barely get the lines out. There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take. I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe. Something's gone. You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you. It's gone. I think she's scared. And that's death. I don't know what's going on. I don't care to guess. Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all. She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue. The movie. Poor Mac. It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you. The camera loves her. A great actress. Absolutely. And she's got great tits. And you've only just met. She's got great tits. It's going. It's going. Why last? What's that? I'm not that good. Absolutely not. Absolutely.We've heard lots about you. Oh. You're them. And you know our friends, how? Let me. I'm Jeffrey.They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns! Hm. Do you like fucking out of doors? Just every once in a blue moon, you know. Damn near. And a damn near perfect drug. I call that a perfect day. Let me heal you, baby. Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you. Do you want me to save you? Do you want me to save you? You're crazy baby. I love you. Forget it, Judy. Well it's fucking time. Time. Hey! Time. Judy! Time you guys. Hey!! Cal, my wife Judy. You have to sign your taxes anyway. Probably not. Anytime, sport. Give him a minute, Clair. He's okay, Clair. You wanna give him a little room? I don't think so. Hey! Would you? Ryan's novel? What was it? What the fuck was it? I'm ready. Beats a lawsuit. Just do what I say, alright? Before I forget. Put it on the bookshelf. Did he promise? Did you tell Joe to behave? That was the plan. And you're thrilled to have them. Did you invite them? There's still time to undo this. They're paying him scale. Not millions. Whatever you say. Listen, I love you. I worry because you don't. It's my job. I'm feeling guilty. I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground. You only made half your quote this year. What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city. The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning. The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat. I suppose. Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest. Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England. No small doing. We closed.Five years ago, I was at the party, remember? Scratch the two, write in a four. Leo. Leo's twenty-eight, Cal. October-ish. Leo? It was out to Jude Law. Jude passed. Leo? What? I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films. But those were all such great directors. Who, Sally? Oh, she's really enjoying it. I think. Is Mac okay? No, what? With great tits. I'm going to ask her if I can touch them. Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits. i can't wait to work with her. Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... The wisdom. She's an old soul. She knew that Shostakovich thing. Did you notice? She's a constant surprise. Isn't Skye amazing? And how's the diva doing? Can we... one at a time? Hold it down, and one at a time. You're last, Cal. The neighbors from hell. The kind that lay in wait. I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I? Wouldn't I? It has your ring. Had a little help? Jack. Did you compose that yourself? Leave us alone right now. Fuck you. Stupid tart. But she's alright. And? The suspense is killing me. What is it? So? Escape hatch. And Dad was having a go about the garden. Something was misplanted... You really need to be fucked. I should have damn well bought it. Well, we can't afford it. The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing. Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting? Four million. Shit, I forgot to call her back. She's off on a trip somewhere. Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold. When does he graduate high school? Ow! Gina, you obviously need to get fucked. I'm not so sure. Look again in three months. Please? Can I open it? That for us? Anymore. Fuck you. Will you make love with me? Oh, Sally Mae... I know. It's for the baby's crib. I know. Happy anniversary. That's under lock and key. Life gets messy. Ugly messy. But I don't understand you. And I don't think I ever understood Lucy. I don't understand throwing it away. How do you throw all that away? Any of it. I want it all. You guys want guarantees? I want the possibilities. And all kinds of crap comes with that. A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff. All the good shit. All the surprises. It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it. We'd have had amazing children, you and me. We'd have had a ride. You'd have surprised yourself. I'll never love anybody else, you know. Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it? No. I don't want to go tonight. I can't got tonight. I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight. Alright, good. Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now? I have no idea who you are. I'll never forgive you. I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I? I wasn't part of that decision. Did I occur to you at all? It's a fucking farce. It's a fucking farce. How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing. Do you have any idea what you've done to us? You're not ready. What?! You aborted our child?! You changed your mind. Don't do this! Don't do this. Don't push me away. This is insanity. Sally... Sally, for Christ's sake. Your director and your co-star of your current movie. Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally. Okay. If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore. And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in. That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally. Well there you go. I let you off the hook. You're one goddamn lucky actress. Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it. And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently. Hello? Last birthday was? Who the fuck do you think you are? The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life. Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally. It's a novel. Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy. That is not true. Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit. And second... Just stop right there, Sally. We've been through this. DO I want anyone else? No. Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life? I'm trying. That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love. It's whether we can live together... like this! All the time. Love? Otis! Sally, so I took a few pills. I went out dancing. I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you. I haven't lied to you. I told you about the people I've slept with. I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me. Sally, we're back, I love you. Trust that. Please let's not do this. Rave parties?! That's so typical - you would think it was called rage. Perfect! Jesus, Sally. You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier. Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate. This is a nightmare. We should have kept him upstairs. Otis!!!! Or shitty!! Otis!! Sally, calm down. We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical. He'll find his way back. Well he can't have gone far. Listen to yourself... Don't worry, it's alright. We'll find him. What's wrong with you? Oh for fuck's sake. Nobody uses that gate. I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays. No driving. That's the rule. I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time. Dolphins. Great. Whatever! You know how he gets. Well, he went absolutely bonkers. Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal. And that, my dear friends, is the day... I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake. Truce. Okay, knock it off. It's an unfair advantage. Panes is not on your team anymore. Two minutes. It's taken care of. Okay. Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum. Who'd like to go and find Otis? Otis! No barking! You can never be too early or too thin. I'll say as little as possible. I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna. I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really. Skye! I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually. You read the book again? Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again. If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park. Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right. It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. You want me to uninvite her? She goes on location tomorrow. Sally, I'm sorry. Look, I can't keep her on hold. Okay. I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you. It was the only chance I had to meet her. What? Don't get it. For good. We're great. No. I missed that. You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you? Not. Kiss the back of my knees. What did you get me? Accept a compliment. I love you. Most beautiful woman in the world. Happy anniversary. Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan? Sure. Come on, Panes... Has she called? Panes! How are you? It's Jerry's worst idea. He's the best dog in the world. They're both coming tonight. Not my idea. Mmm hmmm. Ah. And I you. Do I put you off? Joking. Not long. Don't I find what? Yes I did. No. Yes. It's a novel. Yes, she is. The novel. No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead. Oh. Well. Good. I love gifts. What did you guys get us? Thanks, I'll take that. Champagne? Oh don't. Everyone says that. Oh. You're serious. I meant Sally. God, I really need to jump about a bit. How's your film going? Thanks, Mac. And thanks for being so supportive about all this. I really love you, you know. Not particularly. Weird, isn't it? God I'm rally up. Do you feel anything yet, Mac? What? Oh yeah, the camera man? They gave me a list. Ah there's our snookums now. It was a mistake. This isn't a plot to do in Otis. Stop being such a bitch, Sal. Yeah, it was. For a writer nothing's sacred. No, nothing at all. Sorry? I like you. Come here. You must have been a baby. How long have you been married? And he doesn't smoke? A lot of cakes. That's a lot of those. I'm sorry. I think he's really angry with me too. Lemon it is. Lemon or raspberry? You're never too old for a lolly. I'm having one. Here, drink this. Drink lots of water. Hold on to this. Take deep breaths. Nice and slow. Would you like a lolly? Oh? It's easy. You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl. Let's go for a walk. Are you okay? Sally!!!! I need to leave you now. We're way past inappropriate. Scout's honor. Easy tiger. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm a total fucking maniac. Delete all that, okay? I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife. Oh shit. I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis. Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon. We hear dogs barking at night, too. And it's not Otis. Oh shit. I'm sorry. And your phone calls are nasty and abusive. And I've come this close to suing you for harassment. And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you. And you know, he really does not. Elitism? What? Very well put. Hm. No you're not. Oh. Uh-huh. Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux. I see you've moved up from the soft stuff. In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me. So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic. And it keeps changing. You're an interior decorator, right? Right away. Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan? No, he's absolutely right. You're absolutely right, Ryan. Dog talk must be banned. Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us. Can I get you a drink? This is an amazing present. What a sweetheart you are. I'm so happy you like it. I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends. How do you do, Skye?I'll be fine. Really babe. Give me a minute. What what's about? I don't know how to make her funny. Or I won't. I can't help her. I'm out of my depth. You don't have any clothes on. Not this time. I'm in mourning. It's an object lesson in grace. Wow! Look who's here before me! My leading man is on time for once. She already has. So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what? I'm fine, babe. I'm gonna take a little walk. I need a minute. Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close. Yeah, thanks pal. Hey. Thanks, buddy. I'm fine, babe. Man, I must really be stoned. Thanks, buddy. Are you always this much fun? It was fifteen seconds. Go. No. No. Let me tell you something. Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood. The sleep depravation alone. I meant Sally. Well, you know...good days, bad days. Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy. Anything I can do. Kind of. Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends. And great DP's I could give them a call for you. And you got Skye Davidson. Pretty big leagues for a first timer. Do you even like movies? You got your DP? You lose this? How's he doing? Jesus Christ. No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Time! What? Clair is a hovering mother.I'll do it. Coffee? What's a sign for that? She'll never call again. She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally? Oh, you know, I am. Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two? No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are. How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich? Would you, like, marry him? Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich? Set to the poem of Yetveshenko! Otis you crazy dog! Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon? My people are very hungry. I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know. Andre Zhdanov? How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov? Otis!! Shostakovich identified with the Jew. He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism. Oh yes, indeed. That was my clue, you see. The Shostakovich. That was my clue. The charades. I was impressed. Do you need anything else? Is there space here? No, never. Not at all. Come on in. What did I do? From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle... I guess. You don't need to thank me. Yes, you're a monster. You're my best friend. So tell me, how's it going? Um. Happy for you. Well, something's wrong. Alright. Well, that's something new. Why not? That's it? Yes. Fine? How's the movie going? Your movie. You are making a movie, aren't you? No, really, five thousand with your discount. I'm worried about your Galiano. Why don't you go fuck yourself? What does that mean? I'd cut off her red wine if I were you. I'm Levi Panes. Will you excuse us, Skye? It's time for Sally's meds. "Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here." I didn't hear me say tonight. "We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes. I hate you being alone. Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks." I wasn't finished. No. No, not like the last time. She was the rest of my life. "How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart." It's not ruined, for fuck's sake. It's one of your parties. Oh, okay, forgive me. Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake. Like your business managers? You see, that's worse. She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours. It could be worse. You don't know she's a bitch. She's even better looking in the flesh. Oh great. Not enough. Suicidal. It's much less codependent. It's a machine gun. I thought I'd kill myself.Did you see permits? Did he have a license? To code? Was it a contractor? Did you know the contractor? So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence? How long have you worked for the Therrians? What? Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog! Excuse me? Why? God willing. You're not serious. Ready to go? I don't need a drug. Are you making an ass of yourself? They're nothing like us. I'm not going to leave you alone. Yes. You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain? She didn't pull that out of thin air. It causes brain damage. You'd better drink a lot of water. Well, yes, actually. I'm sure you understand. Absolutely. You always wonder where your books end up. Why don't we use it? I didn't know you had this. Rose. Well today it was Otis. And you should keep him away from our yard. Because Sheila will defend herself. It's just very distracting when you're trying to work. At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes. I have it on tape. Yes.On the plane. Greetings, Mr. George. I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks. You tell Diego I don't appreciate it. You tell him I want my money by Friday. Can you do that? Oh, I see. George. Well, that explains everything. Open your mouth, George. QUIET! Callate! Where's Diego?Ha ha. That's too much, Georgie. Those days are over. The rate is one-thousand dollars. Inflation, you know? Alright. I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you. I don't think there will be a problem. Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie. Why don't we start small? A toast! To Mister George Jung. Mr. I 95, north and south. My brother-in-law. Happy birthday! Yes. Jack Stevens is already a very busy man. Along with many others. You shouldn't stay away so long. The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire. He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point. Let us walk. From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip. Norman Cay is not a person. He is an island, George. In the Bahamas. From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home. Pleased to meet you finally, George. I am Augusto Oliveras. Dejen la maricada pues! No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie! George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano. Blanca, por favor. Que queres decir. Que es lo que el va hacer? Pues, no va hacer nada. I don't know. Drunk somewhere. Try the bar. And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight. I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you. So beautiful. You look like you're about to burst.Diego needs to see you right away, please. Excuse us, Amorcito. Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone. For you, and you, and you. You. Your responsibility is over. You do not fly. You are not a pilot. You are not a distributor. You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane. That is all. You make a percentage. A generous one. And you're lucky to get that. Why are you speaking? The coca is my responsibility! I demand to know everything. I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know. I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important. Whose cloths? Your clothes? Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the suitcase? Tell me about the suitcases. What is the make and the color? Not so fast. I would like to go over the details.Christ almighty, George. Feed her a cheeseburger or something. What does she weight, eighty pounds? That was out of line. You? I lost sight of everything. Forgot who my friends were. Look, I'm sorry about everything. I feel like an idiot. You were right. I did fuck you. And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too. Happy Birthday, George. Mirtha invited me. It's nothing personal, George. Just business. Nice doing business with you, George. It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this? Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies. I don't think so. And I only deal with you? Goodness. Come on, George, no one is going to pay that. I don't know... You're kidding, right? That's a hundred pounds a week. It's your grass. I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you. Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment. I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops? What can I do for you guys? It's your grass. I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you. Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment. I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops? What can I do for you guys?What's that? George? You better get yourself a good lawyer this time. We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one. No fucking way.George, don't be so emotional. This is business. Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother. No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never. I did not. Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George. George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother? What? Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up. Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos? Everything is not alright. I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face! I'm driving you crazy? No. You're driving me crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream? What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle. I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me. Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough? I love you, my brother, do you know that? I'm married, George. Me. I can't believe it. Can you believe I'm married, George? Then relax. It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government. And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles. No questions. No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino. What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar. Who is going to fuck with us? George, we've got sixty-one million dollars. It's either here or someplace else. We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it. Try the closet. Try the back bedroom. Weight it. If it's sixty pounds, it's three. If it's fifty, it's two-point five. We're half a million off. It's two-point-five, George. I am sure. Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later. Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection? Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America. Life is cheap here, you know? No offense, but you know what I'm saying? George, good to see you, my brother. Touche. Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours. Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine? Bad news, George. I'm in Colombia. George. I need you to go to Miami. This is only part of the business, George. A very small part. Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you. I must go to Colombia. That's my George, always thinking. I know. A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George. What's the matter, George? Please, continue. Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery. Yes. Look around you. The sun. The water. The women. It's better than Danbury, no? Come on. I have some friends I would like you to meet. George, are we gonna do this or not? But you must. It's the only way. You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody. Ho ho ho. Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes. Slow down, George. Slow down. Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up. Congratulations, brother. I've been waiting for you. George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out? Allo? Great. I love the Bahamas. Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel. How many kilos can we fit in these planes? What type of planes do you have? Don't worry. We will talk of everything. We have the time. You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine. Now do you see what I am saying? Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions. And that's wholesale. Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand. No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo. IN Miami, we sell for sixty. George? What do you know about cocaine? You failed because you had the wrong dream. No, my brother. Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why? In my country, I am a magico. A man with a dream. A man on the rise. To take nothing and make it something, okay? I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish. That is why I am in your country. Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream. Do you have a dream, George? You like to make the boundaries disappear. It's not only the money, is it, George? The adventure is part of the victory. It's the thrill, ah? I never believed you were a murderer. I knew. I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It's in your spirit. Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape. Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer. You have your intrigues. I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne. In nine months, I am free. How much time do you have? Never mind. Not for you to worry. Nothing. Just a little project. Ah, yes. The murder. Oh, come on, George. If we are to be friends, we must trust each other. Me, too. Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good. But we are roommates, okay? And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars. For the grand theft auto. Okay? So, now it is your turn. Now you will tell me, okay? You will tell me why you are here? No? Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime? Your offense? Why are you here? If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat! This man is having a heart attack. In how long? A week? Cocaine? How much? He's in tachycardia. George, your heart is racing. Have you been using drugs?Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George. I'm sorry, George. Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher. It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent teacher, George. When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary. We must remember we have wives, friends, familia. Even familia that has not been born. But sometimes, we must forget as well. I am like you. I must teach the lesson. We want to teach the lesson. But we cannot. We must remember that life is the teacher. I see. I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad. You now know who your Brutus is. Please. Sit down. We'll drink some scotch. Diego? George, you look terrible. And Diego? Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are right. But money. Beautiful girls? Family. Power? Yes. Money. Which is what, George? Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George? People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George? I like to come up here. To make the decisions. To be one with nature. As much as I can give you? Ha ha. Very good. I like that. Come, George. Let us drive. We have much to talk about. So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George? I like you, George. You are loyal. That is good. That is rare. Maybe crazy. Yes. I can tell already. You are like me. I look at you and I see myself. It's in the eyes, no, George? But, never mind. I am thinking we can do much together. This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business. To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I don't like problems. Un rata - no good. But he could have run, fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die. The man in the garden. He was full of courage. Good. Very good. Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country. The man who gives us the airplanes. The man from America. The mafia. Chicago. Boom boom. Hollywood. You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George? So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?Yeah. Nice. Who's the cheapskate? Layaway shmayaway. I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for. Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape? That was a beautiful message. ...you sonofabitch. Putting on George's boots. That's where you belong... I'll tell her. Yeah, I know. This is it, isn't it? Money. You and your mother. All the time chasing it. I never understood it. Good. You're not going to trial? She's angry. It's all over the news. I heard. Ermine, your son is here. No, it's good. You have a family. It's good if it makes you happy. It's nice to have nice things. Are you happy, son? You're like your mother. You love money. Don't bullshit me, George. I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time. Let me tell you something, son. You would have been great at anything. I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices. You know, the police are looking for you. Not mad. Tough spot. You loved her, didn't you? You really loved her. ...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft... What are you going to do? Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family. What are you going to do? Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family.Don't be stupid, George. We've got him. We've got him dead to rights. But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more. He's going down, George. It's election year. We're not making any deals. You hear about your old friend, Diego? How are you doing, George?What plane? We going someplace? Where we headed? You have your money. It's all there. What the fuck is going on? Where do you guys want to count? Um-hmm. I don't know. He sent me. I'm George. This is a one time thing, Gusto. One and I'm out. Give me a good price for old time's sake. What do you think? Five-thousand per kilo. No. I have the space. I figured it out. This is what I want to do. No honey, I'm alright. That's impossible. We can't be up and running. Who's distributing? He what? Motherfucker works fast. What? My pleasure, Augusto. Diego has told me much about you. Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off. What? You're not going to wait for me? Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two. Baby, you didn't have to come. Promise me that we'll never be like them. I don't want to wind up like that. Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself. No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest. I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments. Are you sure you're okay? You're pale. Okay, guys, we're gonna leave. Let's get the check. You wanna split? Honey, your nose! We'll take it. Should we buy it? I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell. Yeah. I am. Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right. This is it for me. Nothing like this back home. Are you sure this guy is cool? Yeah. I am. Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right. This is it for me. Nothing like this back home. Are you sure this guy is cool? I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole. Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old. That's some fucking deal. I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here. I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen. Excuse me? Something about vengance being best served cold. No, I cam here out of my own volition. Yes, I am. Mirtha. I see. How much? Excuse me? You're a fucking amateur! It's a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen kilos. What are we doing here, Diego? This guy's a clown. He's talking about clothes. My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter? What? Yeah, sure. What details? I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs. I know. She needs to slow down. She's going to blow an O-ring. For calling you a homo. It's in the past. I'm out of the business now, so forget about it. No hard feelings. We need to move on. And besides, I'm sorry, too. I heard. Yeah. She told me. Yeah. I understand. Just business. Right. Fuck you. Not bad for a weekend's work, huh? Half a million for you. Half a million for me. One-point-three five for the Colombians. Sell it? What did I tell you? Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone? You guys are such babies. You want to go home, go. Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode. Barbara and me. No one else. Goodness is right. If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek. Fifty-fifty. That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend. In your pocket, free and clear. It's already been negotiated. It's done. The money is there waiting. Here's the best part. We can charge five-hundred a pound. Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight. The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week. Two bags per flight. Twenty-five pounds in each bag. What the fuck is that? We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop? No. We want some grass. What the fuck is that? We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop? No. We want some grass. Get me a six pack. Oh hey, one more thing? Fuck you, then. I sign nothing. I want my kid out of protective custody. Now. No fucking around. My wife and my kid on a plane tonight. I sign when they call me safe and sound. You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man. I talked to Foreal, Diego. You went behind my back and you cut me out. You fucked me, Diego. No more brothers, Diego. Derek Foreal. Derek Foreal. Derek fucking Foreal. Alright? The answer to all your dreams. Are you happy now? Derek Foreal. Estoy bien, okay? Everything is alright. There's no problem. Okay? This never happened. No one has to know anything about this. Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is. Do it now. Take it easy! Everything's okay! This is not the time, Diego. Nothing. Todo esta bien. Jesus fucking Christ, Diego. I ain't telling you. It's just business. Now, shut up. You're driving me crazy. What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it? Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate. I love you too, man. You're a lucky man, Diego. And keep only forty-percent? No thanks. Are you comfortable with this? There's no room. Where do I put this!? I don't give a shit. Close enough. Fuck it. I'm not counting it again. I'm calling it three. Three million. I counted it twice. Yeah. You do the talking. Just a friend. Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking. What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail? But to the victor belong the spoils. I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek. Just sell it, Derek. Well, you better get here fast. I'm sitting on... Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money. What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I've got a parole officer waiting for me. And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we? It is bad. It's chump change. We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border. We're getting screwed. What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit. We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic. Okay. Good to see you, Diego. I just got released five minutes ago. I can't go anywhere, Diego. I'm on parole. I can't leave the state. Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you? How are we doing? Yeah, I'm out. Diego? It's George. Diego Delgado, please? We'll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone there. I don't know. A hundred, hundred and fifty. How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami? Four passenger, single engine Cessna. Getting it here is no problem. Trust me. I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we get? Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ. Oh my G-d. That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo. I don't know, Diego. I've got a good thing going already. Everybody smokes pot. It's easy. Cocaine is a rich man's drug. It's too expensive. Because they caught me? Because I got caught. I would if I could get some sleep. Good night. I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed. What's the other one? I've got to get out of here, Diego. Twenty-six months. I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything. What kind of project? What do you got there, Diego? Murder. I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego. Not really, no. I don't want to talk about it. What? Today. I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams. Coke. Mom. Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family. It's a family heirloom. Okay, Mom. It's okay. Where's Dad? Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you? Barbara. Mexico. Surprised to see me? Yeah, layaway. Well, you know. It's um... Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good? I get it. I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay. For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up! You're saying life will take care of Diego? You know why I'm here. You know what I have to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk. I didn't come here to drink scotch. Yeah. Yeah, well... Diego is my brother. Money. Keep them coming. Sure. Yeah, maybe. Freedom. I want money. What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know. It's beautiful. Yes, sir. As much as you can give me. Yes, it is. With all respect, Padrino. Diego is my partner. I do not do business without him. Yes. Un sapo? It would be my pleasure. Actually, it was three. I meant every word of it. I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars." Love, George. That was a good one, Dad. That was really something. Remember that? And that FBI agent, Trout? When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said... Tell Mom, you know... Give it to her, Dad. It'll make her happy. Give this to Mom, will you? No. Yeah. Listen. I'm going to be going away for awhile. Hi. Yeah, Dad. I'm happy right now. Dad. So, business is going good. I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable. With my investments... I know. I'm great at what I do, Dad. I mean, I'm really great. Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me. You mad at me? Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do? Just low. May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face... I'm going to California. No, Dad. I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... I know. There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different. Something free form, you know? Something for me, and college just isn't it. I'm going to California. No, Dad. I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... I know. There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different. Something free form, you know? Something for me, and college just isn't it. No thanks, fellas. You've got the wrong fucking guy. I'm not a rat. What the fuck? Is he going to walk? What about him? What do you guys want? He's getting middled, too. And Derek's our partner. What's good for us is good for him. The set-up is wrong. We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail. We're getting middled. Holy shit, Dulli. What the hell are you doing here? George. It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? Figured what out? George. It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? Figured what out? Mirtha, how are you doing? He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do? Yeah. Is she here? Is she coming? Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. I know. Well, that's all I really wanted to say. So, okay, then. Yeah. Yeah, you will. Of course. Yeah, well. I'm working on that. I've got something going. Yeah, so I've been thinking. I love her, y'know? I kind of want to have her. I've been away for so long. Make up for the missed time, you know? You knew I was seeing Kristina, right? What do you want me to say? I'm in prison. You should know. You put me here. What? Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car. What is your fucking problem? There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya. Not in front of the kid. Please, Mirtha. I'll start working for Augusto. I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something. No, that's alright. Where are you going? Alright. But this is... No. These are her first steps. Watch her. Look, Mirtha. She's walking. Pablo said no. It's all over. And I'm never going back. I have you. We have the baby. And there's nothing else. It's just the family now. Shhh. Sleep now. Shhh, honey, never mind. It's alright. It's over. I quit the business. I'm out. Put that shit away, they're here. Jesus Christ. I like fire. What is your name? I don't know. My name is George. Why are you smiling? Do I know you? Hello. After everything. After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you. I love you. I love you so much. You've got to know that. You've got to know. I fucked up. I didn't mean to... I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. I swear on your life. I swear. On my life. That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date. There's schools in California. You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags. Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like. I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday. Thursday after school. I don't know. Maybe California. I'm thinking about getting out of town this week. You want to come with me? I'll be here. California, huh? What is it? A Disneyland thing? California? You can go anywhere in the world. India. Tibet. Australia. Paris. And you choose California? Yeah, sure, whatever. Let me ask you something. If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go? Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again. Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry. I'm going to make this right. I've got a few things going on... You can call me Dad if you want. Dad. How are you doing? Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you. No, never. Don't even think about that, it's impossible. I love your mother. And you are my heart. Could I live without my heart? Could I? I don't know. Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset. Because she's visiting me. But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow. My daughter. But I have a visitor. Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America... Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table. Yes, I do. I don't give a shit. Split it up. Have a great life. I'm done. I'm out. Starting over. Cheers. You saved my life, Dulli. You'll never fucking know. All you guys. Everyone just got a raise. Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen. Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody. Who's the co-pilot? Actually, I've got some news. That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it. What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns? I don't need a little. I need a lot. All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane. Very nice. I'll take it. Yes, I am. Are we good? Yeah, we're good. We're beautiful. We're perfect. This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit. Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance. That was it. Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details. My end was roughly five-hundred thousand. Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand. Start over somewhere. One final score. That's all I needed. Holy shit, Dulli! Not that far, only halfway. You sure you know what you're doing? Who speaks Spanish? So, we need to get to the source. It's not enough. Yeah? Yeah? Stoned? Right on. This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors? Yeah, but what are you doing out here?We'll do that tomorrow, okay? It's lockdown time. Okay, George. Not today, George. Time to go back.Are we good? Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo! Relax. I've flown with my old man a million times. And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about. Okay. So we need a source. Where do we start? So? What? When there's something to move, it's too easy not to. Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U.... Shit, yeah. Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east? I wish there was shit like this back home. G-d, I'm stoned. I'm stoned. I'm really... No, man. I'm too fucked up. I'm on vacation. On my way back to school. Well, I'll tell you. I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy. I didn't know you guys were living in California. Don't be such a pussy. You know, he's got a point. We're fucking Americans. We stick out like sore thumbs. What's the matter, George? Something wrong? You look like you just fucked your mother. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand. It's all there. Wow. A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars. Right. And Holyoke. There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available. Nothing good, anyway. I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit. That's right. Fuck yeah. I never seen nothing like it. I'm fucking wasted.Jesus, George, fifteen percent. That's an extra two-hundred large. They're over at the booth. You're looking at him. We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go. You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment. You assume all the bust risks. We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further. If not, we can forget we had this conversation. It's a four-man operation. Two on the ground. Two in the air.Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado? Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado. Do you see him here in the courtroom? Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?Good to see you, Jorge. You are a man of your word. Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns. Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well. We must be careful. Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast. You take a little and then come back. Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing? For instance, something like this? Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical. I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial. Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical. I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial. Source? What about Derek? What the fuck are you talking about, man? Look what the cat dragged in. Tuna. We sell it. I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach. We move all of it. We've made ourselves a hundred bucks. Or a lot of weed for our head. What do you think? Not bad, huh? I got the baggies and everything. You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out. Figured it out. Tuna. We sell it. I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach. We move all of it. We've made ourselves a hundred bucks. Or a lot of weed for our head. What do you think? Not bad, huh? I got the baggies and everything. You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out. Figured it out. I can't believe we're stealing a plane. This is bullshit, George. We're never going to find anything down there. Cheer up, man. Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich. Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it. Smith. Hampshire.... No shit, Kevin? Nice weed, huh?Well, close the fucking door by all means. But don't expect me to go down there and do it. We can't go back there. Are you crazy? You saw -- Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here. You people really don't like dogs. Yeah? Died there? How? Is it true? Alright. Yes sir. Anything you say. Then what do you care? He yours, sir? Go for it. ...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad. You think that's really him? What the hell you talking about? Maurice, man, shut the fuck up. Just some flies. Nothing. Contact paranoia. Must be buggin' from hanging with you. You didn't hear that? "Take him... " Something. "Bury him" or... Keep smokin', fool. Are you nuts? What's your problem with Crippled Dick? Bones! How baddass is zat? This is the place for us. Patrick, you get platinum props, man. Platinum. So what the hell's the good news? Or just Hell-adjacent... Climb out to where? Fine. But I'm bringing a couple of friends. Well, go find his lazy ass. I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome. Where's the gangsta of love? You sure got a way with women, bro. What happened up there? Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here. Where's the others? No. Well, yeah. Maybe just a little. Shit. Tia ain't a chick. She's family. And don't forget it. Pat's right. It'll be fun. You soundin' like the old man now. You want us to move in here? Damn. That is the ugliest building I have ever seen. Looks like a damn graveyard round here. But that's your old hood, Pops. That's some terrible shit. Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years. I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?Bones. You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him. Soon. Real soon. Big Bad Eddie Mack? Got shit for brains and that's a fack. Hey-heh... Unh-unh, little brother. I got a natural high. A supernatural high. I said, no thanks. I ain't interested. And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here. Those 'fools' are my people. But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag. What else? Money. I do alright. Everybody's happy. What it will be. Hush, baby. Where we'll always be... I want you to do something for me, baby. I've got what I want. Turn around baby, look at me. Look at your man. No. Not...not you. You I forgive. Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe. Second, it's got to have just a little give, here. At the edges. And last, but not very far from least... You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff. Don't you worry about a thing. This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight. Must be my clothes line. No? How bout my phone line? Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag. All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess. That was your mama's bag. I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise. Don't need luck tonight. I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no. Then fuck it!!! Aw that's easy. I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother? No brother. I wouldn'ta. I never done a man - any man. Let alone a brother like that. Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked. Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad? You about to find out. And the hell everybody else, right? I don't understand it. You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas. I always looked after you. You had a piece of everything I had. Time like this, is that what you really want to know? How I got the fuck in here? What it will be. Since we was just grasshoppers... I don't need to hear the deal. I don't need any partners. I don't need new product. And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face. We met. That's your dream, Homes. Not mine. I don't want to leave this street. Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me. Nothing but net? Could be a swish. Or a muthafucking air ball. They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops. Go easy on Jay Bird. I can remember when we was his age...Fuck it. Alright. Where is it? Let me see it. You got the shit? We're here. Where the hell are you?Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there. Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there. Clean your mouth, or I will. Those boys had no business messing down there. Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get. That's what? You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule. I got a Lexus. And nobody gave it to me -- Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia. That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure. You know I can't. What will it take? What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy! Wait, Jimmy. Think about it. You woulda done the same thing if you was me. I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own. How did you get in here? You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world. Sorry, my brother. Everybody just be cool. Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal. Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you? One simple word, three little letters. Yes. That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal. Big houses, legit business... Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this. Not just big. BIG. Like big business big. Big corporation big. Big government big. Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands. Nothing but net. It's all arranged for tonight. Eddie Mack's gonna be there. And Offisa Korruptsky, too. 'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun. Get back on the curb! Now! Help me. I'm so sorry. But please, help me... Please...help me... That's the past. It's dead. You were just a kid. It's...it's a bad neighborhood. As you can see now. I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out. I was trying to protect you. Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself. Bullshit! Bullshit!! You're selling it back! That's an order! No one'll ever come here. Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it. Listen to me, boy. I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in! What are we doing down here? Where are we going? You know I hate surprises. Can't be done. That place already died and gone to hell. No way man... That's it. Get out. Now! Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago. They could never connect it to us. You're right. One of my associates sold the building last month. I didn't sell it. What building? Or you didn't know what to do with it. And you? Still a pig. Just a much fatter one. Keep your hands to yourself, willya? Don't call me that. What the hell do you want?You cut him, or I shoot you. Make your choice. Nice rack. How old is -- You better hope not. Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead. That's a Bozo no-no. Jay-bird. Well, somebody bought it. That's what I heard. Don't shit a shitter. Our building. What did you call it? His 'tomb'? We had an agreement. You were supposed to sit on it. Not sell it -- Maybe so. Maybe so. But that ain't why I came to see you. You sold the building. No reason to get nasty. Yeah, I've stayed in the organization. But then again I never got the percentage you did. I been watching you. You done good. Invested wisely. Respectable businessman now. Just like you always wanted. You certainly traded up. ...the trophy wife. Nice lookin'. Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird. Now you. Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job. Fair enough for the shit. But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition. No time for eightball. I got your tip. Not your style. Is it Eddie? Killing off your customers? Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared. 12-year olds. They scare easy. Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash. Come with me. I know it. The old slaughterhouse. Hey, Sal. That little weasel we popped today? He's got something for us. I knew he would once he thought about it.Go on. It won't kill you. Just try it. Ain't no big thang. It's just a po' man's free base. Here, check it out. Yeah, but I ain't talking horse. I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more. It ain't the money - it's the high. The big fat floating 'what if?' And it's way more profitable. Nobody ever wins. So you never have to pay out. But things change. You gotta think ahead. You got a nice crib here. Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood. What it is? What it is? What it will be, muthafucka. You was just doing your job. I ain't killed nobody. Shall I rack 'em? Play a game, Lupe? No more thoughts from your asses. Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me? How many times I told you, no psycho shit. There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it. That you stole off those white boys was down here last night? Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night! Goddamnit! How many times I told you -- Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise. Then how'd you hear it, fool? You boys been hitting the pipe? Get that car the hell away from here, now! I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool. But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off. You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha? Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills. Damn. It's so...fresh. "This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond. Don't know where the deuce is parked. Boys and girls, Moms and Dads. Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones. Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio. Some flies? I think this qualifies as way more than "some." Ugh. Muchos moscos, man. This is too much. 'S up? Take who where? What you smokin'? The man said just to use my imagination. Let's see...yeah, I get it. Potential. I can see it now. The first major urban theme park. Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials. Totally E-ticket. Look around, this place is a dump! Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump. Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king. We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club. "Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool. I am the future. I am all colors. All races. All creeds. I am the melting pot. I am the tossed salad. I am post racial. Just what army do you think the Colonel was in? Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan. "Special recipe". I'm telling you. There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile. The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken. Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash. Potential toxic dump site. "This is Patrick..." "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt. Even the space cowboy can't... He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..." You haven't? Jimmy Bones? And damp, too. Let's not forget damp. Sqweeep. We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin -- "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..." Gonna be le hot shit. Pardon my Francais. Dance club. The Resurrection Brothers play there. Heard of them? Not really to live, just to play. Need any help with those bags, Ma'am? And some people need their medication tweaked.Is this Hell? Anywhere but here. We can climb out. You ain't going down there. Not alone. I'll go. Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner. Damned if I know. Yeah, we can. Least till after this weekend. He ain't going nowhere. We'll deal with it then. Maurice left. Tia's taking a bath. Yeah, there is a strange vibe here. Spooked? Let's get going. Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here. I believe in you guys. You are the real shit. And you know it. Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too. Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part. We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here -- That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time. Naw. I think it's... I dunno. Something about it just buzzes me. I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back. We gotta jump! Here! Here, find my hand. The stairs are right near here. I saw them. Let's just walk up there. Okay, okay. Listen: Bill! Bill?! My old man calls the shots. He built that gate and these damn walls. Don't worry about it. I'll stay with the boys. It's alright. If you want to go home... I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father? Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here. All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible. Cinn? And you believe her? The dead get out? Lucky thing. Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off? Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S. And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which. What else does she say? Why? Careful. That's bad luck. Anytime. Be seeing you. I manage them. Naw. But they will be. They're the best. no really, let us help. We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors. Daddy? Dad? Dead? I don't think your past is dead. It's alive. And it bites. I saw your face. You knew that place. You knew those people. Bullshit, Dad. Don't front me. For once. Just tell me the truth. I came from there, too. Why? Why did you give a shit about the building? Why did you care that we were there of all places? From what? You could have had it done. You didn't want us there. Did you do it? You'll take care of it? Not this time. No way. I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight. I thought you'd be psyched. Just trying to do what you did. Take nothing and make something out of it. Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued. A little business move I made. On my own. I think you're gonna approve. But maybe we're the ones who should be down there. Doing something. Making it better. Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor. It leaked and stained. Post-toasted's more like it. Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about? Last time I checked, you weren't black. I'm not sure what the hell you are. But I know you aren't a black man. Why not? He eats everything else. I thought you were bringing the Colonel? Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool. But I think we can do better. Why don't y'all check out the rest? I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up. Warm this place up, you'll see. It has serious potential. You gotta use your imagination. I was born near here. My dad's from here. He never mentioned it. Not that I remember. Yeah, you heard of him? Whattaya think? Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor. I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem. I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination. It's not safe down there. The fire started down there. The whole thing could collapse. But the place burned to the ground. Save him? What are you talking about? I was born near here. But after my mother died, my dad moved. I grew up out in Rossmore Park. Shit! Damn dog. We gonna have to do something about you. Evidence of what? We're all tired. Everybody makes mistakes. Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different. Ours! Moe's terms. Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.Fuckin' comedian. See you tomorrow. I'm on my way home. Can you handle it yourself? Shit, that was fast.Take my advice. Get the hell out of there. It's a bad place. Always has been. Hey, kid. How the hell should I know? Yeah. He lived there. And died there, too. Take my advice. And shoot that dog. Or let me. Hell no! Hey, watcha doing with that dog?Wh-wh-whooo? Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street. Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block. Looking to score? Don't worry. It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it. Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone. Go on, I ain't shitting you. I can't carry it in my pocket, man. And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop. You gonna have to pick it up yourself. Let me see it. Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot. Leave your car and walk over here. You got the cash? Back here. At the end of the block. We just thought... But -- We got a gift for you, Eddie. Fresh new BMW.It was just like in my head. No, Eddie. It's just that, I dunno. He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur. All I remember is the voice. It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth. That's all we did, steal their ride. We didn't do nothing, Eddie.And have you found Peace..? Oh, yes. He's found Peace. Mason Verger. For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice. Can you be free....? Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana. Rich, comic book freaks. Oh, Good. The ornithological leitmotif... ...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust? You said "here's what they want you to do." Aren't you part of them anymore...? Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or what ? Have you transgressed...? I'd prefer it... But it's just a vacant exercise. ...aren't you afraid of me...? There's one or two freaks, and, for a " Pass ," I'll rat them out to you... Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...? We could skip the Gavotte. That would adversely impact my income. You said "here's what they want you to do..." Why? ...why? ...very good. Why me? Yes? I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter. As the Soul of Man. Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive. He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or: "natural composting." Do you think he'd come after you ...? He said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because I was civil. I'm struck by your phraseology. I did not last with him. I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time. Yes, I presumed it was about him. I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions. Orderly. It's a growth business. Or, perhaps... Perhaps you did not have the support you required. ...what hindered you...? If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee. To show ... in my ability to squander . What one might deem an advantage ... that my strength is greater than yours ... And now I have "dociled" you, have I not? By forcing your obedience. Would you mind saying that into your bag...?

Could you tell me: did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...? Yes, but the important thing, as I've said... Ask me when we get home. The Case that I am working on... "Because we don't have any money." Because...? No. Invite us? No, he simply... ...what do you expect me to... I am on the track of... ...my love... ...why are we here in the first place...?

He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling. Bring me a drink. HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM. Where have we Seen it Before. ...WHY DID HE COME BACK? WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...? Why did he come back? Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter? Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true. I offered the bounty. It was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong . And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder. Do you Agent Starling: do you know God ? The government says. Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother. The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home. You can't see Mama anymore. Or Shirley. Or Kitty Cat. That's what the Government says... Yes. Franklin, you can't live there anymore. With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat. You have to go away. Yes.... yes... Do you like it at your home, Franklin? She's not the first foster that you've had. Is she? In and out. Yes. And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin? Where do you live? Oh, no, no. It won't be that long. Is it necessary to know? ...tell them... Make them eat the figurine. ...when I... ...after you' re dead. AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the word ... And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence. DON'T YOU THINK? IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU THINK ? BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE HIM AND HER FOR THE PIGS! Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime. The Greatest crime. Perhaps the only crime. I never ceased to hope! You're free ... Explain in depth the plan we have for him. Until tomorrow. You don't wish to beg ...? ARE YOU DONE ? Why should you care? Thank you, Cordell. I have not, I would not . For life life goes on Starling. And, wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... I'm... One moment. I was afflicted , do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter. I was afflicted before. Before. Do you see? In my arrogance. Do not Do not curse God when you are humiliated. Listen to me: embrace it, and you embrace life .... Listen , and you hear the word of God ... Isn't it funny? You can look on my face which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me. Which shows a Strength which must come from strong strong convictions. But you shy when I say the name of God. My encounter. Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere.... And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness? Because? Because we must leave the past in the past. Ah. And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him... Ah, yes, ah yes. Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to capture him? How terrible for you... For the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.What shape is the scar? What shape is the scar? And why should we believe you? I'm sure I don't know who you mean. ...what did you want?You think you're so...but you're just... Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore! That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this? But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before. Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us... It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut. Why are you...don't stop...why? About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I... I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation. Did you wait until you were 18? You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age... I'm gay. Like you didn't know.That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself. Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you? I just wanted to know if you've seen this. Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked. Say Hi for me. Uh, yeah, that's...wow. You are the prince of the darkness. I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself. It is? I don't know about this, Wichita. Am I even right for Talia? What About Wendy? I mean, you and Wendy--how are you and Wendy... WICHITA Complicated. Extremely. Wichita and Donald drift closer toward the head-setted Wendy, who stands to the side of the searchers like a commandant. WENDY Now remember, people, let's keep away from the mountain. Repeat... There you are. Could you possibly do one thing and help keep the campers away from.... WICHITA Hey everybody, we're climbing the mountain! Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said... I'm not really a--Does it count if... Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever. There you are! Man, I don't know how to thank... Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say... Oh thanks, it was nothing... Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...You have no idea. Now run away. Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18. Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like... Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything. Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough? Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you... You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody. I know you like to think of yourself as the Anti-Oberon, but man, you're getting just as spooky. What was that speech in there? Does Camp really have to be a revolutionary act? Can't the children, at their own pace, discover...Yeah, okay, I was a little out of hand, but come on, you got to give me Todd. Don't get me wrong, I've learned to love the little Piggy, but Todd is the most invincible loser I've ever come across. His greatest talent is lack thereof. No matter what the category, bet against him and win. Goodnight. Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes. I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you. Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven. No, they're not from Wendy. You are to be executed at Dawn anyway. Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita... Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it. Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids. And this Peepers was your...dog? If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention. Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now... Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed. "Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit! No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent... Sadist! I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline? You're a monster. That kid is going to be traumatized for... Believe me, I wish I knew less. Oh, if you weren't such a pig... They're the easiest to shoplift, okay? No woman should have to pay for something forced-on-her-without- choice by Nature...what's the matter, Hayley? Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist. "or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita. Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars... That wants to be a Yes. You and Wichita go to school together, right? Have you two ever... It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves. One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one. ...sorry... Clever observation. Go back to Wichita. Oh that's right, you can't. Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down. Either way, you come away with knowledge. You'll be hiding behind a tree. Uh-huh. You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning. I didn't realize I had to declare a major. When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority? Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod? Nothing. Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right? Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right? I have to see her... I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one? She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club. Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck... Howdy Pouty. Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession... Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids.... They wouldn't be a bit surprised.. Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast. Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom. Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am... You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it... That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that... Eavesdropping, eh? Hear anything good? Hello?! What's in it for me? Goodnight, Jasper. Hey, it's not a crush anymore if you actually say it to the person you supposedly have the... Thought I'd get points for a post-modern approach to coming on to you. Hey, I thought I wasn't your type. Your Secret admirer? You're all making me blush... When all else fails, Jasper--Gum. Even now in these troubled times, every child's drug of choice. Go stand by the flagpole. I just never thought of you in that... Talia, you're a wonderful person... Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to... Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon... Shut the fuck--! Stop! Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me? What do you want me to say? Not now, Wendy. She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide. Do you really think I care? Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room. It's been known to happen. I should leave. You probably need your rest. I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position... I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way of thinking, we could really do some great counseling. It's all about the evolution of the species, we can improve... Todd was out there blocking the entrance. You would have been proud of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around... When were you in Niagara Falls? "Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for... So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend... Talking while kissing. It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in... You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing... We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork? I think your passion is terrific. Talia's a rock. She'll be fine... Yes you do. Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep. Hey--that coffee? You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about? That's not what I was worried about. What in the hell did you do that for? What are you doing, Wendy? What's in that cup? No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay... I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with. The swelling is gonna go down, right? God, you're beautiful. Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...Where is it? Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that�s where he's headed. We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast. He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded. Here! Who's that? How low? It won't hold! Sure. Dr. Grant was. I don�t know. They set a trap They actually set a trap. About a thousand feet above it, actually. Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were. So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet? That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island. I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES! I CAN GET HIM! You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions. Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the... ALAN! We could co-write a paper. It looks intact. I don't remember that on InGen's list. Baryonyx? Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that snout. Is it a rex? I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin. Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along. It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling. No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM! They're here. It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology. Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment. How was your trip? Profitable?He loves you too. then we should... We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to. Where's Dad? DAD! What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs? We're safe! No. I couldn't see. You should. The lady you called, how do you know she can help us? Something must've scared them. But then you never get to go in space. I want to be an astronaut. Do you have any kids? Then we go home? Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get. Are you sure? I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start. Mine's new. Know what this is? I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself. Yeah. Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer. Found this, but the battery's dead. When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind. The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then. You're Alan Grant, aren't you? I read both of your books. They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out. In Costa Rica?A bird cage. Oh, my God. One way to find out. This is how you play God. Quiet! After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive? A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed. How many days have they been missing? And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals. NO! Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else. You're no better than the people who built this place. Billy, I can't talk to you now. We need to keep moving. KEEP GOING! Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish. We should take it with us to signal any planes. That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to? Not with that sail. Spinosaurus Aegypticus. They never got that big. How would you classify it? I don't think so. Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see... The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away. And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people. Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic. That does sound lucky. Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag. What? Absolutely not. Not if it can't dig. You rented an automated litter box. We'll be broke in four weeks. A well-accepted theory. Okay. Goodbye, Ellie. I'd better get going. The last of my breed. It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur. To a degree we never imagined. We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team. You remember the sounds they made? Raptors, mostly. Really? What do you do there? He used to know me. Hmm? The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles. No we're not. Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you? They look worried. Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash? You're right. It's strikes me now I never told her that. She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything. Bonitas. Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do. See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground. I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts. No. Although I've studied them in the wild. We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up. Why? We need to head for the coast. How much of this island have you explored? A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil. What did you think? Did you read Malcolm's book? The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common. It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks. Any weapons, radios? Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me. Which one do you prefer? You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too. On the island. Eric, your parents are both here. Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help. Billy! Back out! Move! But you never came across just one. There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there? You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive. No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island. I have never been on this island! Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane... What the hell is going on? What are they doing? This plane can not land! That's hard to believe. I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can�t fly low enough to see anything of interest. That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified... Hmmm. You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time. What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age. You mean it? He could have died. I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy. My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing. I'm trying! That thing took him down this way! We're not going anywhere, I promise. Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh? I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he... I don't remember I don't know. I don't have it with me. That one time was just the bumper. Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it�s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it. I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night. Am I right? It's not safe. Udesky. Eric! Are you here? I know you liked Ben. I had no right to... I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him. That's him. That�s Eric! Young adult. What did you say! What did you say? What? Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me. Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him? No, Dr. Grant says... Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory. You look good. People change. Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y. Sorry. We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that? Her new boyfriend. Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back. He says it's a bad idea! Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea! Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else. We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide. Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile... First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years. Eric! He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island. Right? I thought you were an expert. They couldn�t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down. Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top. I didn't know, there were two islands. Stan. Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing. It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use. Amanda! Well that's good. There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that. Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son. Sure you have. You wrote that book... We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before. Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green... Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy. Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government. No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you. Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something... I guarantee it'll be worth your while. Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.Git along little dowgie and call me back. I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me. Cynthia... that would not be a good idea. Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When? You gotta be kidding? And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range? Cynthia...what's going on? Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters? The Cowboy?? Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night. But I'm not broke. And? What do you mean "you know"? Someone's shut off my money! I'm going home. I'll call you later. I'm going home Cynthia. I'm going home. No. Who fired everyone? What did you say? What's going on, Cynthia? And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me! And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!! You'd better fix this, Ray!!! Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing. So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture. So what's the problem? Okay. So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad? I understand. It will work out. Okay. One. Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do? Okay, I'm thinking. How's that? That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be. I agree with what you said...truly. Sure. Whatever. No problem. What's on your mind? Yeah. Howdy to you. Fine. I'll check out in the morning. Unbelievable. Look... here. I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay? So, what did they say? How... how'd they know I was here? ... What?? Yes...what is it?Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this. Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all. Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all. My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon. Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again. You're an understandin' fella. Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that? Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault... So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me. There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have? No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me? Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me? So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life. What did I say? Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right? A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with? Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya? Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel. Beautiful night. Howdy!To get rid of this god-awful feeling. Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream. You see what I mean... I had a dream about this place. It's kind of embarrassing but, This Denny's. I just wanted to come here.Damn, that's a long drive. Where at? Interesting. Find out who they are? Oh yeah. The one of 'em still alive? Nice wallets. That's what I'm thinkin'. Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings? Yeah, they showed me Two men... two guns in the Caddy. You feel it?Palmdale. Yeah ... and they both use the same address. Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere. Well he said... you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is. Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott. Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy. No. Could be someone's missin' maybe. Could be unrelated. The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy. Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner. Yeah.It was just a thing. The story made you laugh. Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough. Making ends meet, huh. Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?Right then. So, you came to see if he's out there? Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me. Oh boy. Go ahead. Okay. Why this Denny's? To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's? Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher. That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you. Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled. I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files. The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us. I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.Before what? But you won't. I came back. I thought that's what you wanted. Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies. I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think? Just tell me where it hurts, baby.It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van. What's the matter now? Yeah, what for? You're so easy. No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy. Yeah, that's a funny story. Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble. Hardly. Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy. So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that. You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby? A brunette? ... maybe beat up? Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there. Not a coke or anything?Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms. Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name? Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we? And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in? And who are we auditioning for today?I'll speak to someone. We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role. There is no problem.May I have your name please? No. I can't. Yes, there was.Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin? Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin? Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone. I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you. Betty Elms?What is it with Red? I've never seen him this way. If Evelyn's here, the rest are here! No, numbnuts, die. You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen. But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight." I've never known it to fail. That's your line for tonight, ya know.He's been like that all day. Hey Danny, you coming? Are you sure they're here? What, good-lookin' sumbitch? You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant? Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley. We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying. On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?Too late for apologies, Walker. You'll love it. No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance. I don't buy that hot dog shit. So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa. Oh yeah. I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron. That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base. You're Walker, right?You guys know her?! I gotta have an intro! Man, I'd like to -- Mai-tai's. I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's. The one that slept in my mouth last night. Where's that lizard? Yeah, but he was wearing shoes! Shit, he's puking on my feet! You guys are new? No, like... Ever hear of mai-tai's? Comes in a big...pot. Like...like...I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir. I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds. Sir, I -- Hale-what? Sir? You liked that? Yes Sir. Rafe's girl, Evelyn? Yeah. What the hell happened to you guys? What lizard? Hey. You. Mr. Coma. He did. Anthony, Red, stay with the guns! Coma, you cover the cannons! Joe, Theo, come with us! Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers. Earl! You said the planes were ready but -- but what? You guys get those! Earl, Rafe, come with me! They ready, Earl? I can't make it. And I'm on yours. Land of the free. Broomsticks instead of tail guns. Longer? It's getting shorter. We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel. I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork." It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?" It's shorter than our practice runway. Maybe just trying to measure up. We've always tried to beat each other. What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done. Fun today. Like old times. Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it. I'm out of fuel! Home of the brave. Little less. Yeah. So you can call me if you need help. They're all over us! It's tight. This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two! Six P-40's. Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here. Come on! She said I was so much like you. I said, No, I'm not. I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder. But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am. She loves you. I know that. And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me. Don't blame her, Rafe. It's not like you're thinking. I guess I'm used to it. I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back. You left her. How's that for a fact? So what are you saying? I was grieving too. What facts are those? You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai. Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think. Why be sorry? That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it. Let's go get a drink. Unless you're scared to talk about it. You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset. Then why are you looking for her? Didn't you say you told her not to come? Some other time. I don't feel like a party. Nah, you go on. Don't make this a joke, Rafe. You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people. I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it? How could you do this? Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air! Home of the brave! Good shooting, Rafe! Kill the bastards! Power dive! Yeah. What about easier to hit in an air raid? Hey! What is this, the planes all bunched up like that? Hang on. From the air? Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night? Sorry. I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to. Rafe was...he was lonely. He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty. The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring. That might not have been such a good idea. They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield. The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile. How's everything? ...He said that? I taught him to drink beer. He taught me how to fly. Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes. Real straight, frugal. My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along. Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral. He took me back to his house, and I never left. Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened. Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker. I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.No baseball diamonds, Red. I'd like to bomb their Emperor too. But I think that'd just piss 'em off. The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior. So let's try this again. Military targets only. Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium. I have a phrase I want you all to memorize: "Lushu hoo megwa fugi." It means "I am an American." In Chinese. We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne. The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast. We'll launch off the carriers from there. I know. Listen you guys. I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run. If I don't make it, you don't go. I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself. I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man. In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes. You'll be flying multi-engines here. Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late. You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together. Do you know what top secret is? Explain what? I heard what you did. Good luck over there McCawley. I admire your decision. That's bullshit, son. But it's really good bullshit. Don't get smart with me, son. There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.Who the fuck taught you to fly? Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy. Of the four left, only one is full of fuel. Cock-suckin' right I do!! In the gun lockers! They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it. There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set. And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway. We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement. We've done studies. We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.I have'na been able ta -- Fook ya dooble! Fook ya! If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States! Well which of those three ya want fixed? Leapin' Jesus!We got a saying here. A-low-HA! Who's gonna to that? Japan is four thousand miles away. So you guys just arrived, huh? The brass is afraid of sabotage. This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter. If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes. That's me, Sir. Yes you can. Danny... Home of the Brave. We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China. I'm on your wing. It's not getting any longer. They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch. That'll help. What's between you and her is between you and her. But here's what's between you and me. Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine. Bullshit. We've played with each other, pushed each other. This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me. Who's that for -- Evelyn? No. You're trying to beat me. Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there? What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral? I'm out of ammo! Land of the free. I got a half a tank. You? You hear my okay? Bet they don't dust crops in Japan. Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn. They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo? What's there? Where are we going? Get me into a plane! How sweet. Is that when you put the move on her? Fuck you. How come you're not pukin'? How's this for a fact? I loved her first. I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off. Yeah, right. Anyway, you didn't know. I understand how it could happen. I know why any guy would love her. And I can't blame you that it happened. You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her. We gotta face some facts here. If you can't keep up, don't drink yours. Waitress! Four beers! I didn't mean it. Sorry. Upset? Why should I be upset? It's a test. If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me. Yeah. I have to talk to Evelyn. And I want you to meet her. Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny. It's time I made mine. I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots. The Colonel helped me work it out. Didn't you say test the limits? There's another one! Land of the free... Good shooting, Danny! It's Germans! Bandits at 2 o'clock. Colonel...we're all going. Whether you make it or not. I take it back, about the flowers. We're all gonna die. Bombers. Well sure, Colonel -- Is that the good new, Sir, or -- We can explain, Colonel. Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Never, Sir. I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit. And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks. To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage." How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it? It must of been a convincing letter. What?... Of course I forgive you. I know what you feel for Danny is real. And your choice is your choice. I need to tell you something. I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand. Forgive me. What else can we do? Don't worry about that. Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up. It's all right. Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes. I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back. Nothing that won't heal. I guess. I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle. The Colonel sent a man to pick me up. They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour. I've done a lot of talking. You haven't said anything. ...Survive? I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me. I hit the water hard. And it was so...cold. I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew. You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute. I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up. Maybe not. But I need you to know. I love you. And I will come back. I'll find a way. And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real. Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable. What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that. If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life. I had to tell you in person. Because there's something else I need to say. Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F. They need pilots, and we need experience. I leave tomorrow. I'm going to the war. The real war. Hitler's taken Europe. The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine. And not just there, but here. There's one thing I have to say. I'm going away. The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it. But I've got to because it's true. I love you. That must surprise you. No, he...got some news today. He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight. Nice to meet you, Betty. Hello, Lieutenant. Good to see you. Crank her! Learn English, then! And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German. All of 'em. The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.Yeah. But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s- SIIING! Only when I'm n-n-n- How would I know. You know the football player, Red G- Grange? Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange. He, I'm R-Red. Red S-Strange. Well, you p-puked on his feet. I th-think I'm gonna like it here. A m-missionary? Y-Yes Sir. Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice. And to practice it, ya gotta play -- I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball. Then wh-where do we land? C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks. And where's the secret base, Sir? The one we t-takeoff from.God help them. So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel. Have the planes made it to China? What if the Japanese did invade?And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all. As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw. The second wave has not returned. And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report? We must go ahead. This is our moment. We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port. I don't like this. A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war. Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific. Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way. Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us. Uncharged torpedoes have different balance. The Americans themselves have made it possible. We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor. The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans. No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover. In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace. If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.Seal the cave? No sir, I haven't forgotten. A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit. I apologize. Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ... We've never meant to be treasonable, sir. But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts. How did you know we'd come here? Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ... Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again. Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes. Dr. Zaius -- Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over. They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides... ... his culture is our culture. That was different. We thought you were .... inferior. What are you doing there? Taylor, I'd rather you - Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun. Right now, if you like. No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly. It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is. Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing. It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find? To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours. As you wish. The best. But we won't need them. Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now. Right. Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon. How did it go? Zira.... Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise -- No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle. Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment. That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy. The evidence was very meager -- It's probably wrong -- No, they won't - Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off? I don't. And I'm not going to try. No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it. Flight is a scientific impossibility. And they fell out of the sky with you? Now, just a minute -- Where did you learn to do this? It's a stunt. Humans don't write. Zira, come on. You know they can't -- Oh oh. Here comes Number One. Remembers what? What's so special about him? Neither do I. Do you have to work tonight?Blessed are the vegetarians. Where there's one there's another. And another. And another. Taylor -- quit riding him. Any particular reason? Which direction? No. Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates. But how long is a day? Yo! Yo!They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ... Hmph. You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment. But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I? These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here? I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood. Him.Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy. Objection! Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant. That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater. He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination. Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ... There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet. Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law. Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain? Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think. Tell us why all apes are created equal. Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules. I'll see. What happened? Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do. Huh? See? He keeps pretending he can talk. You could get hurt doing that, Doctor. No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act. Good morning, Dr. Zira.We got off at the wrong stop. Try telling them our names. Can we take a dip? Scarecrows? I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away. Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative. Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you? Taylor. I'm telling you -- Climb off me, will you! I'm prepared to die. All right -- If only we could get a fix. Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory. long pause) You know it. Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months. You don't seem very cut up about it. Sorry... I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened? Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper? Gone. It's no use ... there she goes. What signal?What? I think you're making a mistake. They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go? Yes, I can do that. What is it? Disillusioned... But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values -- Always giving orders. Just like every other adult. Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair? Shouldn't we be moving on? If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders -- Zira doesn't want your female. So you can talk. I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped. Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property -- To scare off humans? Who put them up? Gorilla hunters ... He wouldn't leave her.And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him. You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here. Why special? I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash. What is that?Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question. This hearing is adjourned. Sustained. Sustained. Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature. Very well. I suggest we go and look at them. Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce. Come to the point, Dr. Honorius. State your case, Mr. Prosecutor. Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not? Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity! Dr. Zira! Silence that man! Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet. It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself. Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down. Sustained. How so? This is a joke in very poor taste. Stop right there. Bring me that paper. Read it yourself. Mind your tongue, madame. Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law. Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal. You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.Good luck then. And now you know the truth. Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have. Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look? Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours. No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back. Shut up. If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it. When are you going to show me what's in the cave? You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone. Where does the river lead? I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there. Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen. You still don't believe me, do you? Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what we'll try for. What about you? Just the same, I want one. Do you have any weapons? Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us. Let's find them all. You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree. None at all. That way. Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out. Any sign of dangerous ionization? Good question. Landon -- check your communications kit. One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9. We've enough food and water for three days. Geiger counter? Got your sensors? Show this to the President. Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others. I admit, I know nothing of your culture. You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet. No cigar. Okay. Let's take a look. But I'm not prepared to die. Don't bother Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever. Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste? And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes. Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why? I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead. What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are. It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better. Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust. Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old. I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade. Still can't accept it, huh? By our time. You've turned gray. It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year. Air leak. Died in her sleep. Landon! Join the expedition. We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion. That could be Bellatrix. We're here to stay. Forget it. Abandon ship. To Earth! That we've landed! Landon! Send a last signal. The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed. Don't try to follow us. I'm pretty handy with things like this. That's the boy. Keep 'em flying. Lucius. I'll start by following the shoreline. And my nose. I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner. All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders. Not everything. They left a hostage. How do you feel, Lucius? Relax. You'll see it all later. Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses. In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair. I'm for that. Fine. Just let her out. I want her. She comes along too. Come on. Get me out of here. Who are you? You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me! One is in a museum! This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story... My name is Taylor. We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing. What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave. Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why? No, thanks. I'll take freedom. Sure. In a cage. Then there is another jungle? He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet. Tell him to pull back! I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills. Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you. Okay.Up to the cave. Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them? When were the Sacred Scrolls written? All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test. Stop right there. I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done? I don't know. Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started? Then you admit -- All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic? That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor. I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira. What about it? My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system. I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours. No. What about me? With one of them. God bless you. Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye. It's better than going to prison for heresy. Would you like to come along? Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash? Why not? Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive. He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls. Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith. And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge. What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun? You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate. Maybe not. Yes. You're going back to the Forbidden Zone? Listen- You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes! You! ... You knew about this? Second from the left. It's him...Landon. What is this? Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me? I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want? My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor! Listen, listen -- I can speak --That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy. Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets. Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape. Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll? 'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.' To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations. Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable. I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless. I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason. It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone. I see you brought along the female of your species. I didn't realize a man could be monogamous. He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked. You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs? Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius? Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail. Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find. The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago. Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself. Where else, but in a cage, does man belong? Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate. Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive? Cease fire! Withdraw! That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof. Of course. Twelve hundred years ago. What is your proposal? There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science. Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned. You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone. You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one. Guards! If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity. You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly. The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there. Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone? I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women? Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon -- Of course. Certainly not. You're a mutant. A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent. Where were you nurtured? Then how is it we speak the same language? Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'? You lied. Where is your tribe? However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve. That is why I summoned you here tonight. Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you. Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death. Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ... Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius. And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means? Identify him, then. Speak to him. Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures? In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be. I'm sorry. He won't survive. Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you. What? Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything? Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk. Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes. How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion? Where are they now? But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished? You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture. Do you believe him? Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert. Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office? Of course. He saw you moving yours.No, Carter. The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong. And what the hell is Heaven on Earth? I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why? Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter? I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there. It's nine-thirty in the morning. Is it true, Carter? Are you in Hong Kong right now?Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor. Captain, you there? Hello? Shit! Is it because of the hookers, sir? You tell them there's no crime in being lonely. Two hundred cops? Was Mario Sanchez there? He owes me money. Did I say dinner? I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit. Hong Kong? I'm not in Hong Kong. I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station. How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner? I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari. Do they sell those here in the gift shop? Somebody cash me out! Two-hundred thousand dollars? Who wants a hundred dollars? How much is that? Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it? Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you? You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right? Are you a racist? Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black? What the hell is that? Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced. Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says. Where is he? I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests. I'm with the band. I'm the lead singer. All right, Kenny. Thanks. You're off the hook. For now. What? Yeah. We already been there. This is big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service calls 'em superbills. Banks can't even tell the difference. So tell me what you know. How'd you know? Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around. I'd like to see you try. Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate. And I got mine, meaning you. Nice how that works out. I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down. What?? Where'd you hear that? What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money? How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses? It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit. So what's your story? Yeah, that's right. How do we know you're not lying? Let me see your badge. Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you right now. Your friend's ship? Oh, man. I must've walked onto the wrong yacht. I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work. Red Dragon? You sure about that? Called? What's my ship called? Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson. I don't want to play games with you, Isabella. I like you. I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes. That's right. I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan. I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles. But hey, I understand. Make yourself at home, Isabella. Champagne, caviar, whatever you want. My ship is your ship. San Juan! You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo. How you doing, baby? My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria. C'mon, Lee. He's going to jail. You won, now just put the gun down. Lee, you okay? I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist. I got proof. See, I got a mini-bar key. That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted. I'd like to pay you for that laptop. Let's go. I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me. I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you. This is the only color they had left. Now get up! I said get on your feet! She is nice. But I am very tense. I'm gonna need a lot of massages. I'll take that one, too. How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink. She can do my feet. Any girl? Okay. Let's start with that one. No. It's my first time. Never leave home without it. Lee, this one's on me. You save your money. That's right. You're right, you're a smart guy. Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar. But this is an even swap. Pure genius. Lemme ask you something, Steven. And I want the truth. Is there any way I can date your daughter? Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz... Stevie, how's it going my man? Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot. Wait a second. You're Steven Reign? You're big time. You own all them big hotels. What are you doing in Hong Kong? I could use a little vacation. Some Kung-Pao? The Plaza Hotel? New York City? Come on, Lee. Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up. There must be something you want. They owe us, man. That's the least they can do. It's okay, I got lots more. About fifty grand. I won it at the tables. Your father's badge? No way, man. I can't take this. You take care of yourself, Lee. I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye. That your gate down there? I saw that. She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though. Walking away, never looking back. We made it, man. Lee, wait a second. It's not worth it, man. He's making you do this. Just GO! You go after Ricky. I got this. What?!?! No you didn't! Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth? Lee! I'll give it my best shot. I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene. When security comes over, you make your move. Wait a second. There's guards all over the place. You'll need a distraction. Isabella? Are you crazy, man? She almost got us killed. She's setting you up again! Dancing? I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo. Did she have a friend? Lee, what the hell are you doing? Wait here. I'll handle this. Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia. That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell. Couple? No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here. Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case. Follow me my Asian brother. Wait a second. We can't go in like this. Look at this place, we gotta look fly. We gotta Mac out. That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat. Lee. I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash. Don't you talk about my mama. That's more like it. Oh no you don't. Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee. I'll kick your ass from here to Compton. End of the line. Now that I believe. No Chinese man discovered electricity. Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity. Hello, Benjamin. I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box. Very nice. Go ahead. Sing your ass off. That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims? As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice. Are you serious? That's rough, man. If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy. Steamed dumplings? What about a little king pao chicken? You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No mu-shu? How was the sex? If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her. You thinking about that girl that dumped you? Fine by me. I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don't let everybody in. Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven? I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven? I don't believe in reincarnation. So I won't see you in the next world. I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me. We'll die in peace. You got that right. And we ain't brothers. Maybe we should just end this right here. We are not partners. Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead. It doesn't matter. I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me! This wasn't my case, Lee. Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central. I didn't have to help you. Look, man I'm sorry. I know you got a thing for her. For how long? Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides. What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody. How could you fall for that shit? I knew she was dirty. Snoopy is about six inches taller than you. I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance. You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me. I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly. They don't know that. What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview? I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings. You saw the way she was staring at me. Secret Service Agent Carter. This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy. Let me see it again? I wouldn't do that!!! Take it! There's people up here! I don't need a turn! Pick it up! She's walking back towards the door. No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone. Lee, she's wired... She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg. Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick. Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs? She just took her hair down. Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands. You better get that ice. Skirt just came off. She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy. Oh, sweet glory hallelujah... Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you. Gimme the binoculars. What's going on? Hot? I'm freezing my ass off. What did you say? Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen. Excuse me? Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive. I've seen it a million times. I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you? You pull a muscle or something? Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic. Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over. He'll be back soon. Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out. They still just talking? The same place you find all RichWhiteMen. Gefilte Fish. Lox and bagel. I love this stuff. Here, try it with a smear. Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming? You people were screaming your asses off. Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down. Because when the shooting started he was way too cool. See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!! Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked. Not bad. Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one. Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign. Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word. Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man. I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one. You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane. -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it. It sounds impossible -- Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal. Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first. So are you getting on the plane or not?! IT IS CRAZY! You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing... This is about your Daddy's death? Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me... This is about more than all that, isn't it? This is about your Daddy's last case, right? How the hell did Tan get away with it? Ask me if I give a shit. Forget it. You're not very good at this, are you? I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw. Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy. What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper? What the hell is going on here? Why the hell should you believe him? He had us beat up. Naked. That's nasty shit. What, leave you alone so he can cap you? Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth. Who? Detective Yu? Never met him. Who died? And you ain't black! Really? When's the last time you had some Mu-shu Let's hear it, Lee, when was it? Year of the rat? You're pathetic, man. When's the last time you had some fun? When's the last time you took a night off, had a date? My bullshit? I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords! Why you mad at me? You needed back-up, so I backed you up. I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards. Back to Heaven on Earth. I need my damn passport back. I'm going home. Goddamn you got a small ass. I'm a dangerous man. You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat. That's Ricky Tan? He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down. What's wrong? Hey! You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line. She said I could pick any girl I want. How you doin'? I am a tourist. And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold. Now start practicing and don't make me come back here! I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit. There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner. You're sorry. I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry. Just take me home. You lied to me. All I wanted was a little mu-shu. Shit. C'mon, get up here and help me out. What'd I say? You mean Tito. We had Toto for dinner last night. Man, are you crazy? You think that scares me? I'm from L.A. We invented gangs. We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it. We get royalties from other gangs. Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done. Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar? Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun. Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing. I knew you were lying. Are you kidding, they love me. I'm a star, Lee. A god to these people! Blend in? I'm two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going? Take this. It's a Magnum. You can fold it in half. Just relax and don't worry about a thing. I'll hook you up in there. You got condoms? You better take one. Your breath has been a little funky all day. Let me look at you. That's what I'm talking about. A real Hong Kong night club. You want an Altoid? Don't be messing with me, Lee. I will kick your ass. I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty. Not Mu-shu. Mu-shu. I want to see some women. Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu! Don't be giving me attitude, Lee. I've been here three days and we haven't done shit. We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl. I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu. I said that? Which word was "goat?" All I did was invite them for a drink. Did you see the way those girls drove off? I did you a favor. I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car. Fine with me. Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you -- What "revenge" is he talking about?Winner! Four, winner! Two-hundred thousand! Winner six! No, sir. No, I just assumed... Those are five hundred dollar chips.Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help. Wait. The band has been playing over an hour. Invitation, please.I knew it. The guy's name is Zing. He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza. One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week. I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing. Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills. I knew something was wrong. Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared. The whole thing. And they checked out. 100%. I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you? You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning. How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn. Shit don't happen I don't know about. Is this about the funny money? Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass. James, you see my kids back there? You know how much I'm paying for private school? How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather? I got my sources. Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James. I still have my lunch money from third grade. That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking. Never shut up. What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck? No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw. Master Ching taught me.Amen to that, brother. A little Mu-shu. First class. I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden. See the Knicks play. This money is evidence. No, Carter. I can't take this. What is this? It's okay. I can finally let it go. I guess so. Thank you, Carter. Yes. She's going home to New York. I need some ice. No problem. It's worth it to me. Carter... We have to get to the Penthouse. Ricky Tan is alive. Yes I did. I said MMMMMM! I did! MMMMMM!!!! Try to keep them busy for five minutes. No. I'm going to find out. It was Isabella. She says the plates are in the soft count room. Dancing? Carter...here comes the rich white man. Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune. Yes. We have lots of big men chasing us. What is Mac out? Let's go. Red Dragon. Vegas... You could never kick my ass. You mama's boy. You've been a good friend, James Carter. We're slowing down. This must be it. Yes he did. He also invented the bicycle. A Chinese man discovered electricity. Who's Benjamin? It's focus. Every opponent has a weak spot. You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike. They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head. I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something? Forget it. It doesn't matter. Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think I have a good voice? Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk. No kung pao chicken. Never. No mu-shu. There was no sex. She was very traditional. We were waiting until we were married. Mind your own business. No. I think we should stop talking. What's a Chinese heaven? Yes. We have heaven. Fine. See you in the next world. Fine with me. Well we're not friends. I'm not used to having a partner. Why did you help me? Shhh, my head hurts. She saved our lives. Are you okay? I am not third world ugly. Women like me, they think I'm cute. Like Snoopy. She never even looked at you. We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else. We can help you. I'm a detective in Hong Kong. It's a bomb. Get it out of here! Wait! There's people down there! It's your turn! I don't understand? What is it? What? Snoopy? I love Snoopy. I don't want to hear this. What's she doing? No. It's not right. She's getting undressed. I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice. You want some ice? Is it hot in here? Nothing. I said nothing. Slow down, baby. I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring. She's just standing around -- not doing much. She hated my voice. Said it drove her crazy. I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it. She finally told me it was driving her crazy. No. It was my singing. It's a long story. My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding. The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months. Carter, there's something I have to tell you. You were right about what you said in Hong Kong. All I do is work. Never take a day off. It's all I have right now. How do you know? He just left. Kissed her on the cheek. Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign. Maybe. But not like Asians. We never panic. You sound like that all the time. How do you know he's our man? Who? Follow the RichWhiteMan... Follow the Rich White Man? I should go back. Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor... Why LA? You said -- I cannot go to LA... What? I know. I know. I am sorry. I thought you'd think it was crazy. No, no, that would be crazy -- All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved. Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly. He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along. Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty. Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case. Good at what? No. She's a school teacher. Don't be talking about my mama. Or my ass! I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok. Remember I told you my father was a policeman? Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years. I'm okay, you go. Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? Not Yu. You! You. Carter? You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese. I have plenty of dates. It's my job! Stop! I'm sick of your bullshit! Fine. Go home. Who needs you. Where are you going? Don't look at my ass! I'm calling for back up! This is a very dangerous man. Over there -- that's Ricky Tan. Well, hurry up. What are you doing? My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time. Hello. Just follow my lead and act like a tourist. Carter...you ready to have some fun!? This won't take long. No time. There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed. I'm sorry. Try to land on your feet. You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking. No. You are a civilian. In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto. Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China. No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is. We must tread softly and keep our ears open. I'm sorry. This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover. Carter, get off that stage! Bathroom. I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in. No. No. Carter, would I lie to you? Of course not. My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight. Big party. Mu-shu? You're hungry? You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two. You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat. Those girls drove off because of you. That was my CD. Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD. I didn't know which side you were on. Are you okay? No. But I'll help you. How do I know I can trust you? Why don't you go get them? Just trying to make it look real. Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck. What's going on? Excuse me? And Hu Li killed him for the plates. Is this a payoff? Then you know I'm not walking away from this case. Do you still have the bills? Baby Duck? The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing? I'll take him. Thank you. Did you tell Sterling? All he wanted was some mu-shu. The Secret Service? Why? It's my responsibility. Any leads? If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you. Put the plates down. It's over. Tell me why they killed the customs agents. The police can protect you. Don't. You must come with me for questioning. Heaven on Earth? Master, I don't understand. A temple, where Heaven is on Earth? A mountain, where Earth reaches for the -- I know, Master, but... Ricky Tan? I need your help, Master. I'm seeking a man who used to train with you. He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal. Yes, Master.It's a massage parlor downtown. "Heaven on Earth." You will find your answers there. The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth. A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven. No. Your father. Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did -- He was the best I ever trained, you know. Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent. ...he kills for money. Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?Do you have it in you, Lee? Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father? Would you like me to tell you how your father died? Could you have your partner wait for us outside? It's no problem. But I must excuse myself, inspector. I don't think so... I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend. Enjoying your visit? I'm busy at the moment. Don't you remember? I'm already dead. I don't think it's over. There are casinos all over this country. Let me make you a rich man, Lee. Don't make the same mistake he did. You're just like your father, Lee. All these years hiding behind his badge. I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change. When you think about it, I didn't really kill him. I just put him out of his misery. There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor... Nobody can protect me. I'll make a deal with you, Lee. But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong. ... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now. I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did. My enemies are trying to frame me. There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose. My name has been written into the book of death. Despite what people suspect...what you suspect -- Lee, I've missed you, brother. I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A. I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case. I don't ever want to see you again, you got that? Quite a night, Inspector. Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone. You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation. Put a diaper on him, Chin. I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee. Who the hell is that? No. He will report to me. Do we understand each other? Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation. Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need. If you have information, it belongs to us.You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time. Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house. Vegas has been my town for 30 years. I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here? Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong. I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.Escort Detective Carter to the airport -- Let him find out on his own. I want the Hong Kong police handling this. Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol. Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight. Victoria harbor. If you don't want to... Are you okay, Lee? Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service. We think it's Ricky Tan. If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand. Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy. Two American translators were killed. That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our investigation. Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people... This is still Hong Kong.Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors. You know any survivors, Dad? We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies. Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked! What? What if he is? Maybe he's gay. Thanks, Scoob. And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined. You know...Stanley... There are some rumors... There's something I need to talk about with you. Hey. Even though it was only his cousins that were killed? But I thought he came over to America before the war. He was in a concentration camp? He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute. Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea? And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future? Nice to have you here. Welcome to the show, Scooby. Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look. I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions? Hey, Scooby! How's it going?Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered. Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you! Your story was terrible! What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK? What do you want? Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind. You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex. You're tired of me. I can tell. So you don't want to hear my new ending? But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context. Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw. Well, I changed the ending a little. I can read it to you. Hey, you want to hear my short story now?Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me. Consuelo, what is rape exactly? Why was he on Death Row? But really, you never know. But still, you can't be sure. Maybe he was and you just didn't know it. Maybe it's for the best�I mean, if he was guilty of doing something wrong�People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so? How did they execute him? Oh. How did it happen? Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus? You have a bay? Who is Jesus? Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you. Speak English. Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter? Consuelo. Are you crying? But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting. But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do? But like, what do you like to do when you're not working? Hmmm. But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything? Must've been hard being poor. Weren't there high schools in El Salvador? When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank. What did you do in high school? But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff? Wow. Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two? Really? How many? Do you have any brothers or sisters? Consuelo? 550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade! I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got? Mom? Twinkeys! I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school? Sure, Dad. Gee, you're home early! Hi, Dad! OK! OK. Stay there. I'll be right back. You're welcome. Dad?�Would you let me try hypnotizing you now? I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better. Maybe he's that one in a million! Dad?�Do you think that Brady will ever get better? Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't. Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!Again!! Again! Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!' 'Fuck me hard!' Say, 'Nigger.' ...gger. Say, Ni... Take off your top. It's over there. No. I'm not 'going out' with Catherine. Maybe. She's OK. You have beautiful skin. That's good. You're not. Uh huh. Well, now you have. What are you doing here? Hello, Vi.Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal? C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking. 'OK.' So you just don't care. Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have? All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere. None at all? How about those 'underground' comics? Any books you like to read for fun?No prob. I'm cool. Oh. Like what? What? Hey. What's up? Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host. Well, I was thinking...I might work for you. Great to be here. Thank you. I'll be your guest! Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here? What's tomorrow? Fine. But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born. We did the same thing last year also. I dunno. My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend. Hey. Can you pass the salad over. Was anyone in my room today? OK. Whaddya wanna talk about? Yeah? Man, it's just, like, conversation. Just the same. The same. Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and... I dunno. Fuck! I dunno. See if I have any connections. Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman. I dunno... OK. I hate reading. No. No, not really. You want some? Yeah. I know. Yeah? You should be. I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV. Is it loaded? Gee, your Dad's smart. How'd you get it? Pretty cool, Stanley. Don't be. Your movie's a hit. Oh. He did? I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct. Thanks man. Can I see what you have so far? Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering�Is the documentary almost finished? 200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird. Prnceton. So like, yeah�I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like �still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews�Y'know, I figure I can always drop out. Whoopee. Doubt it. Is this to like get into Sundance? What for? Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project? You a pervert?No, thanks. I mean... You know...I like you. Scooby? I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why. Scooby, don't! Be careful! No, I don't think so... I know. It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet. Thanks.I don't know. Maybe they'll like it. Well, I need to see this with an audience! Hip alternative types who will understand the process better� OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types. OK, you're right, you're right� You know, we need to screen what we've got�invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types�and see what real people think of this. Nothing, I guess� No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious�But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time? Yes, I know�But still, it should be somewhat entertaining. You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry? Thanks. I'll tell Mike. Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper. Yes, I do. I love them! I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is. So whaddya think? ...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism? But what kind of pull did you have? Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience. 'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope... Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds. You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today. Maybe she has caller ID. Yeah, sure. Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary! Great. How old are they? How many? Huh. Kids? Yeah...So you're um...you're married? Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'? Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies. Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point. Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then... Oh, I don't remember that... N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers? I'm a documentary filmmaker. I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity. Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished. Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing. Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out. Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that. Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on. So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it? Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do... That's what I was gonna ask you. Great! Oh, fine. How are you? Toby Oxman. Hello, is this Pam? Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry... Yeah. He went to Harward. Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college? What is most important to you? Sure�um�yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know. Uh, yeah, we're getting there. But what did you get on your SATs? So where'd you get in? HBO and MTV have also shown some interest. Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel. Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it. Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine. Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact. No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?Wrong number Nooooooo! Kim-Lo? Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...Fern! C'mere! She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose. My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader. Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns. Oh, why didn't you say. For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you. The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash. Take it or leave it. Right. That'll be fifteen hundred - cash. Bullets. Okay. How much ammo you reckon you'll need? Yeah? Maybe we can make a deal. That's Itchy, alright. How many y'need? She did, did she? How is the old girl? Really...Oh... What are you working on? ...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled. "Run to my voice - and don't look back." The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car! Ah! They jumped, Diane! They jumped! Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins. Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these. Huh? Oh Jesus... I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch. Baby, we are living the great American Dream! Ah! I almost forgot gas for the baby machine. I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line. But we agreed your job is running the baby machine... Me too! Will it ever end?! I love this lady! If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be? Like Cocoa Puffs. Good. Captain Crunch. Bad. Shreds the roof of your mouth. I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!" And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me." But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better. I'm going to save our kid all that pain. But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby. Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head. Y'think? Yeah. Spit from your dad? I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table. Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.Sorry. My hands are tied. Uh, yes. Yes you did. Let me explain something... I'm sorry.Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too. I don't know. On all what? And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them. When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased? Yesterday I read that Furtw�ngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America. But I promised your mother. I don't know. Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares. Eating is eating... and... Respect your elders and your betters! That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to! Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise. Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being. Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect. When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect? Can I ask you a favour, Major? Your manner. Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtw�ngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world. and totally irrelevant. Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant! Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could... Why not show Dr. Furtw�ngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory? Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday? Five minutes. Major Richards said he'd call to let us know. I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich. The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive. Yes. They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side. Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you. I guess it's possible. Some. was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and... I guess so, sir. David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir. I'm very sorry. Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do? How can I know such a thing? Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio. Of course I know what that is. Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did. Those attitudes do not exist in me. I don't understand what you mean. I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter. Stop this, please, stop this now! I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many. I have illegitimate children. Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad. This is absolute nonsense! Yes, that's what happened. Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding. I'm sorry. I have no idea. He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.' Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me. That's an outrageous lie! Yes, I know who he is. Von der Null? Von der Null? No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics. have no idea what ordinary people thought. We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor. Then you are wrong. You won't find it because no such telegram exists. I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous. I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings. I have no idea what you're talking about. What telegram? I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost. Maintain liberty, humanity and justice. When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes. You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive. I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical. I wish to say something. It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again. He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word. Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels. I was warned. I wasn't told. I just knew it. Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts. I've had enough of this, I'm leaving. They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave. I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German. I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes? If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are. It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me. During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtw�ngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant. I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies. It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me. Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait? I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends... When will my case be heard by the Tribunal? May I ask a question? I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember. I don't remember in detail, there were so many. It's the truth. I made no deal! Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein? That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked. I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally. Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934. I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly. I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title. That is correct. I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.Our duty is to help Furtw�ngler with his defence, That's why I want you to look at this... These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right? You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just. On Furtw�ngler. Where do you stand on all this?And ask him about his private life. Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K. Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtw�ngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front. But if you really want to get Furtw�ngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan. Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtw�ngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan. There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null. No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members. Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery. One of your people told me. Furtw�ngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday. I've remembered something else... The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite. Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want... You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate. What? You usually don't work on Sunday, Major? So. You wanted to see me. Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case. Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major... Show you? Yes, you remember. It's Dr. Furtw�ngler's baton, which I stole. Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games? Major. How could I know what's in the archive? I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records. Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man? I Do I know Hans Hinkel? Do I know Hans Hinkel? Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th. Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience? Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtw�ngler today? Me? Never. Never. It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David? A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters. David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew? With more what? More what? Yeah. My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong? What? But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they? Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted. You bet. Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true? David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now? Did you hear the question? You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life. How many illegitimate children do you have? Yes, David? You have a question for Helmuth, David? It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi. Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes. That's big of him. Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies? What's that mean? So what is it? David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive? What the hell are they doing? 'Dim-shits'? So, what does the Russki want? You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated? Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same. I guess you admire musicians. Where you from, David? You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven. Sounds a lot of run. So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now? I'm Steve. What's your name? For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out. I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal. I have a duty. No can do. What museum? This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts. Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that. But what... before that turns rotten... What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel? Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs. That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini. We're dealing with degenerates here. I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.' And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit. Not yet. Colonel. Pleasure. If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea? Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts. What's not right? What is this, Emmi? Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it. Do you know where the Adagio begins? Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too. Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills. You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven. What's in those files? I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too? Mine's the Eleventh. Think you can get me any of that? Steve. And your father was executed. Your mother, too. Says here because of your father. What's that mean? Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for? You do shorthand and typing? You live here, in Berlin? Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father. Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies! I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it. They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them. Who's conducting? Okay, so what is it? Do you know what that is? I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations. Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But-- I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things? No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go! Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years. But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay! No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter. You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm? What? Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime? Jealousy? Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book, The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K. I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday? And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked? Now, that young conductor what's his name? That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan? You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad. And what happened to Von der Nul? And what did he say? You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm? You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels? Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since? How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic. Yes, von der Null. Tell me about von der Null. No! You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought? Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for? Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it. Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President. The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider. 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.' And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag? Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated? And what was that? Go ahead, be my guest. If it's too hot, open your tie. Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you. Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful. What did Goering say? Who warned you? How? Who? Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files? I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are? Decent. Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtw�ngler, do you know Hans Hinkel? Steve Arnold... See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit! I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt... You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert, So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number? You sure knew a lot of people in high places. So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you? You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right? Why were they going to arrest you? I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended? Tough, tough! Your guess is as good as mine. Sure. Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them. Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call - 'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.' Did you call someone you knew? I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that? I don't buy that. How come? That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942? The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other? Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies? Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that? What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President. Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member? What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here, Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw�ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party. I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that? His private life? The Miracle Kid. Who's he? Never heard of him, who is he? But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that? Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram. One of my people? He did? Yeah? Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country. Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here? This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning? I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts. I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return. Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again? Was a member of...? Speak up? One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'? All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one? Great catch, kid. The boy runs off. Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret. And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out. Do it, Helmuth. Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same. Show me. How could I forget? The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember. Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand? Helmuth. Do you know what's in this archive? You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it? That's what I asked. Do you know Hans Hinkel? I'll ask the questions, Helmuth. Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party. Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist? When you got to the crescendo. Was looking at Furtw�ngler like that? You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films. Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret? Oh! The evening before, I see... But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday. Like this bandleader. They said I was dogged? Right. Claims assessor. Jeez, and I never heard of him. Sure. Nope. Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand? Brave? To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo. He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he? Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor? Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say. I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party. Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtw�ngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany. Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it. Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture. Conscientious, determined, dogged. You were in insurance before the war. He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one. Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is? So, you never heard of him.It was Beethoven's Ninth. Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act... It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtw�ngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels. Dr. Furtw�ngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape. No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician - Absolutely not. First oboe.And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You-- Screw you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is dry cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never-- Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is-- ...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion. Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh... ...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh-- Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point? Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer-- I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh? ...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh? Cash?! ...You bring a check? Right! Strictly business. No problem! Maybe. ...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh... Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well... Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya? Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance. Sure. Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee? You got the dough?! ...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop? Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber. Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage. That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on... It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage. Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul! A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?I'm not proud of what I did. But you . I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it. What kind of man are you? ...What kind of man are you? ...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell. Come on in. I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in. Please, Ed. Please, Ed. Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife! That's my capitalization on the Annex! My operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann. ...Oh, Jesus. He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us. Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious. The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount. $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I can do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is. I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus. Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store-- her store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed. Well, you know what that would do to me. Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows. ...Ed, I... Uh-huh. ...Say, where do you get those things anyway? ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day. Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop? She's a rare one. ...That's quite a wife you got there. ...Were you in the service, Ed? How ya doin', Ed?Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink? Ann-- Ann-- ...Yes? Yes? Yes, Ann? Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all. ...I'm so sorry about your loss. Ann. Will you come in? ...No, please. Birdy-- ...I guess I've been all wet. Huh. Yeah. Maybe... Huh. Ah... it's nothing. ...Uh-huh. I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony. Look, I'm no expert, but-- He didn't say that. Just see him, as a favor to me. I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words. I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand. You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest-- That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman. Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away. Sure... Sure, it's his house. ...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're-- Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards... Yeah. Hello, Birdy. Hello, Tony. Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good. Who? Yeah. Thanks. Hello, Rachel. ...You don't like the music out there? Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert-- I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the-- Did she make mistakes? I don't understand. Well? How'd she do? Well, I don't pretend to be an expert. Uh-huh. No. Uh... family friend. OK. All right. ...You're not gonna screw me on this? Look, uh... Creighton... Uh-huh. That'll be fine. It's OK. Yeah. Sure. Cash. Yeah. Way out of line. You're out of line, mister. ...Was that a pass? Ed. I'll have it in a week. And how do we share-- What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do? No. I--tell me-- I can get it, yeah. No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition-- I'm, uh, I'm--the barber. ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today? Huh. That right. Uh-- I, uh... Big Dave-- ...Huh? So you paid the guy? ...Dave? OK. Your place? But it's... Mm. ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave? Mm. How, uh... how did he know that-- Would he... it sounds pretty obvious. ...You know... who who is? How much to they want, Dave? Uh-huh. I guess it would be pretty awkward. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What is it, Dave? Specialty store down in Sacramento. All right, I guess. How's business, Dave? Mm. No, Dave, I wasn't. OK. Take your coat, Ann? My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years. Told what? Just coffee. ...Doris-- Honey... You don't have to tell me anything. Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider. You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer. You don't have to-- What happened to you? How are you? Honey... Congratulations, Gina. I didn't say a word. Mm. So? How's that? Who? Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties. Yeah, right. Where you going? Mm. ...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money? ...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway... ...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake... ...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris... ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe... I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave... So... who... who actually-- Yeah. ...I don't get it. ...I don't think so. I took Doris's keys. I don't know. I don't think so. I... just knew. A husband knows. He and Doris... were having an affair. I was with her. It was Big Dave's. I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money. ...OK. No. Of course not. She didn't do it. Sure, Walter. Thanks. Yeah. I'm OK, Walter, thanks. Uh-huh. He's the, uh... Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh... ...So, uh, who should I-- I'm fine. Thanks. So, who should I-- So-- He a good man? Yeah. What do I, uh... I'm fine. No thanks. Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home. Uh-huh. Yeah. I don't work here. My wife does. ...Huh? Sorry, I just didn't remember. That was something. I'm Ed Crane. That was quite something. ...Did you make that up? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's very generous. Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider-- Yeah. ...Nah. OK. I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt. ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt. No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away. I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing. ...You ever wonder about it? This hair. Frank. Yeah, yeah--go home. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie... Yeah. Huh? Uh-huh. Birdy... Birdy... I didn't mean to-- I don't understand. My wife ? Huh? ...We goin'? Doesn't bother me. Hello. Yeah? ...I'm Crane. No thanks, I-- Yeah-- Crane. Ed Crane. Hello, Walter.They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A rock , the barbershop. I mean, how long has this place been here? Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me. They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that. The hell with it, Eddie! I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together! Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches! This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together! Damn, I got a headache to beat the band. You don't got a headache? ...How you today, Ed? What the hell are you talking about? What the-- Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid. Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal? Whuddya mean? Yeah. Huh? ...You sure, Eddie? Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed... Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek? The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think. ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying? Jesus... Russians exploded an A-bomb. ...Ed? How d'ya like them apples? Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it. No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law. Second chair. He's a barber. Sure. Can Ed come too? Yes, sir. Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours-- We're just closing, friend.What'd he say? He's the dead guy. They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail. Huh? No. What'd he say? Does he understand? You'll go to the prison hospital. Uh... you're under arrest. Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious? Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow. Homicide. ...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth... Hello! My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner. Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries. ...You're Ed Crane? You also have an interest in the securing property? Mr...? 'Lo, Ed. Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here. Not an owner. Ah. Could you come with me please? Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned! OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?He said OK. Is that what he said? Under arrest for murder. As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious? His eyes are open. Are you awake?... Is he awake? Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya. ...Yeah, it's a tough break. Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent. Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh... They sent us to tell ya....and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women... ...who among us is in a position to say... ...a puny player on the great world's stage... Not guilty, your honor... Who? Who?! I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting this woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might know who! But we can't know what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is also a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier not to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't gotta know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, they don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. You explain it to me. Go ahead. Try. ...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, you'll have to tell us . Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who did serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to you to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch! And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money... Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth. Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all? Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back? How did you get into the store? Will anyone else say they knew? OK, how did you know? OK, we forget the blackmail. You killed him. How come? --don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got you , a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone. ...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you-- cooked by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene you had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a dame's weapon-- Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific. Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No? Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell you what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood? Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? You don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here. I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible. Ed, how're you holding up? Yeah, the best. Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money. ...Probity. Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here. No thanks, honey. Coffee, Ed? Taking it seriously. Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm... 'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender. Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless. OK. Boy. Jesus! Sure you don't need one? Oh, hell. Drink?Check out the rack on that broad in the angora. Uh-huh. Some beat, huh? Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is. Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!! I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror.... I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau.... There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn. We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....They sound like you. They don't have extermination camps. The Zionists aren't Nazis. I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was. What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.That's a movie, you moron. What?? He's an asshole. She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front.... ...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it.... Why the fuck not? Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do. How come you know all this shit? Fire... Let's look at the fucking thing. What do you care? Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he -- Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and -- Why'd we have to leave so fast? Do we have to listen to this shit? You coming? What, do you like it here? Bring your friends.... We're not his friends. Who the fuck are you?Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference? You will. No, they don't. Not the smart ones. Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money. Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore. There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are. Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong. Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now. This? This is a joke. I'll give your group a thousand bucks. You write that? Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters. That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces. Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>? Fucking Danny, man... Are you shitting me?? Right in the store? Why are you taking that? What'd you say? Who's Eichmann? I thought there were people here....Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air. An investment banking house. Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues... Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews. ...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but... That doesn't seem to be happening, does it? We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack.... What's that? Okay. Surprise us... They left an hour ago. You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on. How soon can you get back to the city? Leo Strauss... I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye. I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out? ...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point? How would you kill him? But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again. You wouldn't announce it? They used to. Today it's not an issue. That would be a catastrophic mistake. Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians.... More cultural than political.The Nazis did everything the f�hrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality. Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels. They had Sabra and Shattila. They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories.... Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi. What's a fascist? They only kill them when they love them? Just don't. Yeah, but not on the letters. No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews. How come you don't know it? How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about -- The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings. It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire. I don't, but... Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz. Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson? Oh, please... Yes. We'll go to the country sometime, okay? Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison. Then I won't bring you.... Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint. Give it to me. What do you think you're doing? You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are. I don't care about money. People still need values, beliefs.... Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that -- You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine. I have a job. You gotta get out of here. You eat first, then you light. Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat. And be crushed. Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn't exist. Shit... Did you talk to your mother today? Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing? You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...? Kaddish is the prayer for the dead. You want a punch in the mouth? Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why? The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?... Nazis talk about it all the time. What...? You think I'm Jewish? Plus you have nothing else to do all day. You're learning the Hebrew really fast. No, I think you shouldn't. You shouldn't. Don't curse in front of it. No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah. About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick.... Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief. No difference. V'asitem... Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet... Even though his dick is so big? They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay... How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons... It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters. Good question. Both. Aleph... You can't curse in front of it either. See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that. Yeah, it's stupid. Put it on, or I won't teach you. They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't.... Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it. Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years. Why? And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you.... Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha... Va-yomer... And he said. It goes the other way. What do you care? No. That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter. I stole it. From a synagogue. I'm coming to your room tonight. Your father?? When can I see you? Why won't you talk to me? Then how come you're talking to me? Oh, really? You weren't complaining about my play last time. Yes, I am. Basically I am. You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness? What's he care about? Is he a Nazi? Are they still together? How come so many of the books are in Spanish? "...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..." You want it to be an event. I just read it.... I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift. At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed. Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction. The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease. Too difficult? Have you read Toynbee? Spengler? Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch. He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas. I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there? Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night? I didn't realize you cared. Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.] I'm stealing it. Nothing. Let's go.... Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod. Who's Eichmann?!!? I'll go look.... I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- What about...Manzetti, the synagogues.... I've been waiting all my life for something like this. A week or so. There's something I want to do here first. What about Mrs. Moebius and...? It's the truth.... They're liars and cowards. I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer. Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven. Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time... I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason. No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl. It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it. People hate Jews. Do you agree? Obviously. Get the fuck away from me. If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me? Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick? You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me. I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand. What were you, following me? No. Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God. It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper. To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said? Listen to me.... Do you know who you're fucking with here? Look at me. DO I look Jewish? Look... You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter? Who? How would I know him? What? Excuse me?... You're kidding, right? Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews. Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength.... Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end... Those aren't Jews. Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil. The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society. Let's just say I've done due diligence. You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness. Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you? After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man. Because the Jew is essentially female. Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why? And Jewish men like to get it. Jewish girls like to give head, right? And? WHat did you notice? Did you ever fuck one, Guy? You ever fuck a Jewish girl? Let me give you an example.... Sexuality. The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well.... German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos... What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from? In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it? I agree. What about Curtis Zampf? No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me? There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty. Fucking kike. The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it? I can't say that. But I wasn't. I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think. You're lying. A forty-five. With the shoes... There was more than one? You mean the <i>Times</i> guy? How did you...? I can't help what I think. That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it. To hear them read Torah. I always won. No! Don't tell me what I -- I don't do that. How did you get the fucking number? Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should -- Beth Shalom. Like you wanted. Lina... It's happening. Tonight. Fine. You mean Ilio Manzetti? Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild. We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal? Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority. I was going to ask you the same thing. From the Rhineland originally. It's German. Daniel Balint. Steve's going to explain it. But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid? You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that? But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid. The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk. What about chicken? I've got to get back to the -- Nobody ever beat me up. Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know. What kids?... Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?... They're not my people.... Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone. I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes. He doesn't want me around. Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer? Who knows what that is? No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse... Who told you that? <i>New York Times</i>...? Hello...? Seven-thirty tomorrow evening. Just do it. No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine. I have an idea.... Take a right on 59th... We'll put it someplace else. The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated. Mrs. Moebius. They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked. Not too fast. Keep driving. Don't slow down. I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here. It'll be enough if we use it right. Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight. What about Drake, did he ever show up? I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen. That damn thing. You know how it made me look...? Here... Shut up. Fuck you.... What is it? The mother. You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy. You could do it. Where's Mrs. Moebius? Which was his room? Get out of my way. Shut up... Wow, that's uh...great... Yeah, hey, how're you doing... No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private. I'm in a kind of...underground...thing. JTS...? Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on? I didn't. I told you, I can't -- I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can -- How? How did you know they were Jews? Who'd you kill? Why me? ...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us. What do you think you should have done? SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT... The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son? What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son? And what did you do? Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy. Valentine... And that's when the Mets started to stink. Not like Mr. Dorfmann. Adam Sandler. Howard Stern. No. Dennis Leary. "Do chickens give milk?" It's Friday.... Do you think I... I was just trying to make a point. If -- We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction. We tested the new bomb. They're not that Jewish. Beth Shalom? It's Reform. I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I... Fund-raising?? Oh, fuck you... EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES.... Eat shit....What's that? You missed on purpose. Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up. Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head. I was a Jew in a previous life. I can tell.... Four. But no one this important. You want to kill a Jew. I already did. Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.Just a little... What's the difference? There's some maple walnut in the freezer. 'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please... After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything. He was funny. Funny? Obviously. Leary? Who's this? Exactly. The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct? But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire? Do I give a shit?Steve... I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like -- No, I don't admit it's stupid. Look, you want cheese, go someplace else. That's meat.It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue? Who killed Manzetti? I don't think you know what you are. Explain it so I can. How do you reconcile the two? Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group. Did you kill Ilio Manzetti? But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already? Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no. Give me a reason not to. Why would Nadelman lie? That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here? Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else? So you're saying it's not true. He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988. Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...? Are all Jews the same? Of course they're Jews. He has Israel. So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt. Danny, what makes you think you know all this? Does that mean the Jew is the better lover? Female... Why? Everybody likes to, don't they? I don't know. Is that right? Notice? Like what...? What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why? What??!? Sexuality??? What do you mean? A poison...? Danny, what about the Jews? My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally. It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist? The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that? Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker. I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting. Is it okay if I record this?Where do you think you're going? Okay, that's it. You're going back to -- You can't say that.... What are you trying to say?So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now... When do you want it to go off? It's not going to be fine. It's -- If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to... Where? So what do we do with the device? Why? Why would she? Who even knew? You said they didn't have night guards. Christ... Oh, what is this shit? Didn't you get anything? That's all we've got left. No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went. It will. I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer. This will be a different kind of device. Open it up. What...? Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs. A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause. Which one were you aiming at? Get out of here.... That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal. Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes. Number ten.Yes! ...I want you to do it on the outside, too. You do it on the inside.... I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes... And let us say... ...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming.... May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf. Watch your language.... No one follows that midrash. You think?! Based on what? But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that -- The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that? In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin? What do you mean? ...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers. Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and -- She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney... We're getting married next spring. In Israel. You remember Miriam.... Are you an artist? What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet. I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS... Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.A Jewish prayer. Isn't it true? I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas.... Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.Hang on. Aren't you on suspension? Go ahead.No excuses, just do it! When in doubt, pull the yellow wire. I don't know. Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down. Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe. That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait... Stay to your left. Don't touch that. Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel. Okay, let's go in. Good, now the other side. He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote. Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor. Right. Off the scale. You got it. No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound... Should we head for the Interstate? How do you know? Driving in circles, waiting for- What's up? Ex-girlfriend? Congratulations, you just built your first ticker. No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you. Your partner? Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second. You don't have to talk about it. How long were you hooked? I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire. One shuts it down, one turns arms it. I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments. Right. Not bad for Bomb squad, eh? How long are we going to stay? Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ... Bingo! Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ... This is where the van was parked. No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage. Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers. With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver? There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course. Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs. Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers. An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout. So what were they doing here? Then let's go see what they missed. Drive. No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did. Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar? Only once, at Redstone. I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish? Don't push it, slick. Treat. We treat devices. We don't use the b-word. Bad luck. By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch. Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive. This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand? That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner. When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department. Alright, let's check it out. Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do. High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition. Where did you get this? Who the heck're you? Any word? Political. We work fast enough for you? Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area. Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work. It's from an IRA. T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk. Call upstairs, see what you can find out. Easy, guys. Reilly! He's loaded! Alright! Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon. A bowling alley. Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal. I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register. Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something. C4, plastic explosive. Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives. Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. Coming? Bev, you're the greatest... We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town. Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. You got it. "Punks", huh? Oh shit... Whadaya mean? Right. What do you think? Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway? Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight. How're you guys doing? Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ... He is! Oh shit... Shit. We're fucked. Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking? Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you. I don't know... That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on. No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.No thanks, Bev. Damn. How's the print coming? We just got a bomb threat upstairs. Thanks. -Where? Officer Reilly, vice. Where are they? I'm looking for the Bomb Squad. Just do it. Patch me through to the Bomb Squad. Dispatch, this is Reilly. How the hell do you feel yellow? What... ? Which one's which? Yeah, another round thing. Make up your mind, trigger. What's wrong? Something round, two wires ... More metal... sharp edge... Wires... metal, cold... something soft... Keep talking. Nothing. C'mon, talk to me! We can do it! Talk to me. Let's assess. What do we do? Fuck factor? Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off. Me, too. Would you? Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town. Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul. Where you guys at? Be right back. It's working. I terrible with mechanical things. I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since. I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me. Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual. What? Which one's which? So cut both. Why do you do it? You guys seem pretty tight. Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago. What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked. `Til we get a better lead. Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive? Look, it's a longshot... Yep. Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along. Just how easy is it to build a... device? Sounds like terrorist heaven. Cream of the crop, huh? You? You mentioned something called Redstone. I don't know. You tell me? The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside. Oh yeah? Prove it. Hey, look-- Where...? She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before? Anything else I should know? So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"? Mike Reilly. Now wait just a fucking- What? What was-? Why...? We've got one hour. Are you coming or not? What're you talking about? We can start in the area where the robbery occurred. Thanks. What do you mean? Off a girl's wrist. A suspect... You the Bomb Squad? Then why tell me? Thank you. Taylor's dead. Who is he? I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type. You touch me again and-- A ticking bomb... Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton. But sir-- I want to work this. Mike. No thanks, I'm fine. Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead. Insurance? What kind of bomb was it? Look, it's important. It don't work- Don't talk. Yeah, just a nick ... Nah, let's just take a look-see. She wanted to cook me breakfast. She didn't work out, had to cut her loose. What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty. No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked. You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway? You don't fish. So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch. I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail. Look who's talking, old man. Nice to be here. Looks like Pooch's doing okay. Someone who smokes French cigarettes. T.J., what're you doing? You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches? A what? Huh? Captain assigned me to assist you. What? It's about this. Reilly, Vice. I- We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up! Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard. I know. It won't work, he'll know it's a trap... I promised her she'd be safe. My God, you're going to use her, aren't you? I didn't. But I had to try. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Report on the case so far. Sir... Yes, sir. Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them. I'll do it. It's detonation cord, for a bomb. I'll do it. Sir, I-- Captain...Ain't that a shit-- Take your time... one day at a time, kid... Mike... You okay? We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up. What was it this time? I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it. Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery? One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family. How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping. Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful. You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens... Next week we work the park. C'mon, it's a quiet night. Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose. Reilly, what're you doing here? What the hell's going on? We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert. What about the ballistics report? Prints? Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes- Pull back. You're only an observer. Reilly, what the hell are you-? You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon. Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business- It's our only option. Glass, you're to stand by with your team. Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and- She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk? But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it? You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean. What's this? I thought I told you-- I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand? Goddamit, Reilly-- What? Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie- Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
