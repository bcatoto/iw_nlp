I told you! I can't breathe. "Volga boat..., man." Whoomph! And about eighty years of dust. For what? Be great for bumper cars. Sam, this may be none of my business,  but I'm concerned you're doing too  much coke. How 'bout me? I'll never wash again. Hey, look what I found. There's a  penny inside. For luck in our new loft. It's a  good omen. You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you  could sell it tomorrow and double  your investment. What I wouldn't do for a place like  this. It's gonna be great. Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move  your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so  you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He  called yesterday and said he has to  see you today about the Danway stuff.  Three o'clock was the only time he  could make it. Also, the board meeting  in L.A. has been confirmed for the  12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight. Hey, Sam, relax. This isn't brain  surgery you're going into. I hate pitching to these Japanese  guys. They make me nervous. I mean,  what am I supposed to say, "Who do  you think'll win that big Sumo  championship"? Sam, you'll be fine. You're great  with people. Hey, nice. I like those. ...Molly. Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa.  That's the car I'm gonna drive when  I'm making two hundred grand. Better pay off your Mustang first. So Carl, what did the doctor say? He said it was contagious. Very  contagious. I shouldn't be going  into work today. But what could I do? And what about the rash? Not good. It's spreading everywhere. On your genitals again? Everywhere. He said be sure not to  touch anyone. Morning Rose. Listen, when the  Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore  take them right to the... They're early! Noon? Damn! Hold on. Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in  Albany by noon. Can you transfer it  to his payroll account? Sure. Just let me have your MAC code. Discretion, huh? You bet. I'll do it right away. Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf  of Market Security Bank & Trust, I  welcome you to our city. Arigato. I'm afraid that's the only Japanese  I know. But I realize it's not our  language fluency, or lack of it,  that brings you to Market Security.  Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking  expertise, our ability to represent  and anticipate all of your banking  needs. As you know, we are not the  largest banking establishment in New  York. But, with combined assets of over  200 billion dollars, we have a firm  commitment to the international  marketplace. Excuse me. Hello? Uh hmm. Okay. Well, that's just fine. Thank you. I'll remember that. Saved your life. Better than seeing this gorgeous  body splattered all over the street.  Here, look out. Sam? Molly? Anybody home? I couldn't keep him away. Hi, Moll. Hi, Sam. So, how's it goin? Where do you want this? Wow! The place looks great. Really  great. "Like" is hardly the word. I never  imagined it would be this beautiful.  This is incredible. What do you mean? It's comfortable.  For T.V. I love that chair. It goes with me. It was the middle of December. I was  sitting in my old office, the one  Charlie's in. Suddenly, I heard this  woman screaming. I thought someone'd  been shot or something. She was four thousand dollars over  her limit. She's still angry. Get outta here, Frank! You should have seen her. All pink  and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous,  like a rose. And she's screaming,  demanding to see the president. So  Wilton brought her to me. You? You weren't even a VP yet. She didn't know that. What's a Montana accent? I wasn't nervous. I thought you were cute. What are you doing? At 2:00 am? You notice Carl's eyes today? They  were all over you. I feel inspired. The matter? Nothing... really. No. Not really. I don't know. A lot of things. I  just don't want the bubble to burst...  Whenever something good happens to  me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose  it. What? Ditto. Oh Jesus. Another one. I should cancel my L.A. trip... These  things always happen in threes. Yeah. So did they. Amazing, huh? Just like that. Blackout. A glitch. What's up? The Mark Greenberg and Larry White  accounts. I can't get in. Your MAC  code doesn't work. I changed it. Why? What's up? Nothing. I just want to nose around  a bit... Can you keep your mouth  shut? Yeah, sure. Tell me, what's going  on. I think I've stumbled onto something.  There's too much money in these  accounts. Too much money. That's ridiculous.  How could there be too much money? That's what I keep asking myself. It must be the computer. I've been checking. Yeah, Mr. Fixit. Come on, move over. Let me see what  I can do. Not yet. I'm gonna dig around a bit. Okay, okay. Just call me when you're  ready for help. So, what are you and Moll doing  tonight? We're going to the theatre. She wants  to see "Macbeth" at the Spring Street  Repertory. I loved it. Six times. Molly, the "New York Times" is some  frustrated little critic with pimples  on his ass who flunked out of art  school. Who cares what The New York  Times thinks? Your work's beautiful. That's a fact,  Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone  thinks. What? It's just been so long since... I  mean, you never wanted to talk about  it. What do you think, Moll? What are you talking about? People say "I love you" all the time.  It doesn't mean anything. Let me handle this. Your wallet! Take the money. Just leave the wallet  and my... Molly! No!!!!!! This isn't happening. It's not  happening. Help me! Do it! Do it! Molly? Molly! Molly! What's happening to me?! Molly! Molly. Don't stop! I'm not dead! So, what happened to you? What? You're new, huh? I can tell. Are you talking to me? Relax. It ain't like before, you  know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax. Who are you? I'm waiting for my wife. She's in  4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it. Shot, huh? That'll do it every time.  Poor bastard. Well, get used to it.  You could be here a long time. I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't  as bad as you think. Zip zap. They  ain't nothin' at all. You'll see.  You'll catch on. He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it  a million times. He's a goner. See?  Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could  have been the other ones. You never  know. Hurry, we're losing him. What'd I tell you? Bingo! He's gone. Who are you? What's happening...? No! Oh God, help me. As we say farewell to our friend Sam  Wheat, we are reminded of his  kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy  of spirit... All that we treasure, our friends,  our loved ones, our body, our mind,  are but on loan to us. We must  surrender them all. We are all  travelers on the same road which  leads to the same end. As our loved one enters eternal life,  let us remember that love, too, is  eternal, that although we will miss  him, our love will light the void  and dispel the darkness. Molly. ...and into Your hands we commend  his spirit. May he rest in peace. In  the name of the Father, the Son, and  the Holy Ghost. Amen. What time you going back to work?...  What's the buzz on Digital? It's  sad. He was so young... How's your  new Honda?... Going away this weekend? I am here, Moll. I am. Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my  favorite... Molly, don't. Say something. Help her, Carl. It's hard. It's very hard. Oh good. That's really good. Dave Brubeck. Newport '86. Should I  toss 'em? Molly, we hated that concert. Oh, you want to save those? Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll? We all do. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I don't know  how that got in there. Hey, Moll. Why don't you come? It's  like summer outside. Just for a stroll. It'd be good to  get out. Molly... you're not the one who died! Thata girl. Hey, Molly! Wait! "Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie.  Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the  levy was dry. Them good ol' boys  were drinkin' whiskey and rye, and  singing this'll be the day that I..." You motherfucking bastard! What the  hell are you doing here? What are  you doing? Molly, no! Get out! Stay off! This is mine! Damn! She came home. I couldn't get it.  Give me a couple of days. I'll go  back. Get what? Who the hell are you? What  were you doing at Molly's? What the  hell's going on? Stay away from her! Sure lady! Oh my God... Way to go. Milk her for every penny. Yeah? Where? What a crock of shit! Who? What's going on? Who are you talking to? Are you talking to me? I don't believe this. Hey you. My  name is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me?  Sam Wheat! Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it! Jesus! Go away. Hell no. I'm stayin' right  here! Someone else? Are you outta your  mind? Not till you help me. I'm standing right beside you. What? Listen, damn it. You can help me.  There's a woman, Molly Jensen. She's  in terrible danger. The man who killed  me broke into our apartment. He's  going to go back. You've gotta warn  her. She has to! This man's a killer!  He's got a key. It's just a phone call. You're all  I've got. Lookit. I'm not leavin'  till you help me. I don't sleep  anymore, so I can sit here day and  night. I don't care how long it takes.  I can talk forever. You gotta go there. "I'm Henery the Eighth I am / Henery  the Eighth I am, I am / I'm gettin'  married to the widow next door /  She's been married seven times before  / And every one was an Henery /  Wouldn't take a Willie or a Sam /  I'm her eighth old man I'm Henery /  Henery the Eighth I am, I am / Henery  the Eighth I am / Second verse same  as the first / I'm Henery the Eighth  I am..." Just wait. Just one more time. Please. It's a  big place. "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the  wall, ninety nine bottles of beer," Ask her about the sweater in the  closet, the one she knitted that's  too big. Four sizes. She couldn't throw it out. I saw. I  was there. I hear you. Haven't you ever heard of phones? Thank God. Tell her she's wrong. I'm holding her hand. I'm holding her hand. God, I love her. I love her so much. Ditto. Tell her "ditto". Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling. I do not have an attitude. Goddamn it, Oda Mae! Relax, Oda Mae. Jesus Christ! Damn it. All right. I apologize. Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell  Molly what I'm saying. You gotta  tell her word for word. Molly, you're in danger. Say it! I know the man who killed me. Willie  Lopez. I know where he lives. Write it down. You do it! 321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D. Molly, he's got my wallet and my  key. He was in here. You have to go to the police. The  Mugger wasn't acting alone. It was a  setup, Moll. I was murdered. Where you going? Molly, there's no one on earth who'd  like it to be true more than me, but  you've got to be rational about this.  I understand your desire to hold on  to him, but this... this is absurd. Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it. She  needs some support here. Molly, you're a grown woman. How can  you believe some fortune teller from  Brooklyn...? I don't believe it, Molly. Not for a  minute. Come on, Carl. Open your mind. What kind of things? Oh boy. This is getting deranged.  We're going off the deep end here. Give him the address, Moll. This is sick. This is really sick.  How can you swallow this crap? Who  knows if this guy exists? Maybe she's  just setting someone up. Find out? What are you talking about? Sam wants you to go to the police?  Molly! Jesus! Are you outta your  mind? What are you gonna tell 'em?  Some storefront psychic's been getting  messages from the dead? Do you know  how that sounds? You're talkin' ghosts  here, for God's sake. I'm sorry. This stuff just really  gets to me. I'm trying to, but... Look, if it'll  make you sleep any better, I'll check  it out, okay? Now why don't you go  to bed. Try and get some sleep. Way to go, Carl! Carl, what're you doin' here? Who've you been talking to? Talking to? What the hell do you  mean? What's going on? Some woman knows all about you. The  murder, everything. Where's she  getting it from, huh? What the hell are you talking about?  I haven't said a word. She knows your name, goddamn it! She  knows where you live! A lot of women know where I live. This isn't a joke, man. You find  that bitch, whoever she is, and...  get rid of her, you hear me? I've  got four million dollars stuck in  that fucking computer. If I don't  get those codes, if that money's not  transferred soon, I'm dead. If I  lose Balistrari's money, we're both  dead. Tell him you only wash dirty money  on the first of the month. What is wrong with you? Is everything  a joke? You were supposed to steal  his wallet. You weren't supposed to  kill him. Was that a joke? I did you a favor. Freebee. Jesus! These are drug dealers, man. Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've  risked my job here. I could go to  jail. A hundred thousand of that  money goes to me. Now give me Sam's  key. I'll get that address book  myself. You killed me, Carl. You had me  killed. Look what you've done to me!  Look what you've done! You fucker! You mother fucker! I had  a life, Goddamn you. I had a life! How intimate? Okay, let me get this straight.  According to this psychic lady, there  are ghosts and spirits all over the  place, watching us all the time,  huh?... I'm sorry. I've got important things  to do. God, let this be it! Oh God, yes! Tony, this is Carl. I'm all set.  We're fine. Everything's fine. Just  tell me what you want me to do. We want you to transfer the money  from the 12 separate accounts into a  single account under the name "Rita  Miller". Tomorrow, at five minutes  before closing, 3:55 p. m., transfer  the full account to First Island  Bank of Nassau, registry number 486- Call us when it's done. Tell Mr. Balistrari there won't be  any problems. I'll do that. Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need  you. Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up? Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll! Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm  sorry to disturb you. I felt bad  about last night. This supernatural  stuff just makes me so uncomfortable.  I don't even read horoscopes. No it's not. You needed me to hear  you and I didn't and that was wrong.  I want you to know that I'm your  friend, Moll. You were never our friend. Hey, I brought you some Japanese  apple pears. I know you like them. Listen, can I come in for a minute?  I won't stay long. I've had one of  those days. Maybe a cup of coffee? No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him  in! What can I tell you. It's been tough.  Hell, you know. It still hurts so  much. Then on top of it all... it's the  responsibilities. They've given me  my own accounts, but I've had no  time to adjust. My mind has been  reeling. Where were you this morning? I thought  you were coming to the bank to sign  those papers. You're kidding. You really did it? I  don't believe... What did you tell  them? What did they say? A ripoff artist, huh? Molly, no. Sometimes we need to believe. It's hard to face reality, Moll, the  hard cold facts of it. What you have  to remember is the love you felt.  That's what's real. You have to  remember how good Sam was. How much  he loved you. You were everything to him, Molly.  You were his life. You're not alone. You're young. You've  got so much talent. You're  fantastically gorgeous. Just think about Sam. Think about  what he meant to you, the years you  had together, how wonderful they  were. Let your feelings out. Life turns on a dime, Moll. People  think they have forever, that they'll  always have tomorrow. But it's not  true. Sam taught us that. We have to  live for now, for today. No!!! Sure. It's okay. I understand. I  really do. Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow  night? Just talk. Can I interest you  in that? NO!!! Get off my train! Teach me how you do that! I want to  learn! I'm not leaving til you teach  me! You stubborn asshole. What are you doing? What are you  doing? You can't push it with your  finger. You're dead. I don't get it. It's your mind, you idiot. It's all  in the mind. The problem is you think  you're still real, that you're  standin' on the floor, that you're  wearin' those clothes. Bullshit! You  don't even have a body anymore. It's  all up here. You wanna move things,  you gotta use your mind. You gotta  focus! You hear what I'm saying? How do you focus? I don't know how you focus! You just  focus! It's all in the anger. You gotta  direct it. You gotta channel it. I'm angry all the time. It doesn't  do a thing. Cause you're angry all over. You  gotta be angry here, in the pit of  your stomach. Bring it down here.  Let it explode. It's like a reactor, you know. Pow! I did it! Way to go. From your gut. What do I keep tellin'  you? Give it time! What else have you  got? How long have you been here? Since they pushed me. Someone pushed you? Yeah, someone pushed me! Who? What? You don't believe me? You think  I fell? You think I jumped? Well,  fuck you! It wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed  to go! I'm not supposed to be here! I'd give everything for a drag. Just  one drag. Who the hell are you? Why are you  hounding me like this? Leave me alone. What the hell? What is all this? What's goin' on? Oda Mae. You're doing it. This is  for real. How do you like that? Come on. Look at this. You're doing  great. Can you hurry this up? My husband's  in the waiting room. I need your help, Oda Mae. There's  something we need to do. Give it up? I'm already dead. And how am I supposed to do that? Ortisha?! Ortisha, where are you? I can't see  too good. Mother of God, what've you done to  your hair!? What happened to me? I can barely  move. You should know better than to try  that. It's not worth it. It'll wipe  you out for days. That was incredible, Oda Mae. He spoke through you. It was amazing. You're great, Oda Mae! You're a real  medium. It's what you were born for. Oda Mae, what's wrong? Are you the one that can talk to the  dead? I said I need to know if you're the  one. This is important. I have a friend.  He died recently. Some say he was  mugged. I think he was murdered. I'm told you can contact people like  that. Is that true? I can't wait til later. Good question. Why don't you tell  me? You're the psychic, right? Then what is it, lady? You're the mindreader. I hear you've  been tellin' people about me for  days. What's my name? Willie! How'd you know that? Oda Mae, we're in trouble... I can stop them. But I can't do it  alone. You've gotta help me. You're right. And they'll be back.  I'm your only chance. I need you Oda Mae. I need you to  get some fake ID's. Help me now, they'll never bother  you again. I promise. I'll teach you. You'll learn fast. See where it says "New Accounts"?  That's where you're going. Just do what I say. Can I help you? Tell her you're here to fill out a  signature card for a new account. And do you know your account number? Yes. 926-31043. Rita Miller. What? Tell her Rita Miller. Didn't they have you sign a card  when you opened the account? Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for  you by phone and asked you to come  in today. Ah. Just sign you name at the bottom on  the first blank line. No, no, no. Rita Miller. Tell her to see that it goes right  up to the third floor file since you  have a transaction to make. A what? ...uh, sure. Hello. Carl Bruner speaking. Carl? Mr. Balsitrari Balistrari? Carl, it's me, John.  I've got the info on the Bradley  portfolio. Oh yeah, yeah. That's great. I'll  pick it up later. Tell the guard you're here to see  Lyle Furgeson. Do you have an appointment? Don't say that! Tell him Rita Miller's  here. Just one moment, please. Don't embellish. Excuse me? Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a  real jerk. Just be quiet and listen. I've known  him five years and he still thinks  my name's Paul. He's a social moron. You don't have  to worry about anything. Tell the  guard Furgeson knows you. You spent  time with him and his wife Shirley  at the Brewster's Christmas party  last year. What is this regarding? This'll be easy. Furgeson was so  drunk at that party, he could have  had a conversation with Tina Turner  and he wouldn't remember. Ask how Bobby and Snooky are. Tell him you've been wondering how  they did on the Gibraltar securities. "We sure did!" "Good old Randy". "Her" shoulders. You're closing an account. 926-31043. 31-0-43. Say "yes"! A cashier's check! Tell him a  cashier's check. Get me the First Island Bank of  Nassau. It's on the rolodex. Sign Rita Miller. I'll be back in a minute. You're on  your own. Don't say anything foolish. Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out  of here. Say goodbye. Hurry up, Oda Mae. Is someone playing with the computers? Is this a joke? One of my accounts  is closed. No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's  all right. I can do it. Oda Mae. Take the check out of your  purse. Just do it. Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller. Do what I say. That's blood money, Oda. I was killed  for that money. Endorse it now. We're giving it away. Look to your left. Do what I tell you. Yes, you can. If you don't do it,  they'll track you down. Your only  protection is to get rid of it, now. I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go  to heaven for this. Write "St. Joseph's Shelter". I'm proud of you. Come on, we're friends. I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae. Search, you bastard! You'll never  find it. It's gone. They'll kill you for this, Carl. You  and Willie. They'll wipe you off the  face of the earth. What the...? Who's doing that? You bastard! You goddamn bastard! Ah! It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you  have a date with Molly, you creepy  son-of-a bitch? Jesus! Oh God! I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy.  I completely forgot. Old Carl had a little trouble at the  office. I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I  talk to you for minute? Can I come  in? I need to ask you a question. He needs to borrow four million  dollars. Molly, I know what the police said,  but when you thought Sam was here,  when you thought he spoke to you,  what did you feel? What did he say? Molly, that psychic woman, I want to  know what she told you. I want to  know what she said. Oh shit! At the bank? Stomach. My stomach. Do you have  anything? Pepto Bismol. What are you doing to me. Get away!  Get away! You touch me again and I'll set her  on fire. I mean it. I'll kill her.  I'll blow up the whole building if I  have to. Stay away! Go on, try it again. Let me see you  turn it off now. Try and hurt me. I'll kill her if  you hurt me. What's a matter? You believe me,  huh? You better believe me! I want  my money. I need that money and I  want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that  psychic lady doesn't bring it here,  Molly's dead. You must have left the stove on. Just glad I smelled it. Molly, I'm sorry. I've got to go.  Look, there's something going on. I  can't talk now. Some trouble at the  bank. I don't have time to talk now. What  if I come back? Around 11:00? I can't. I'm sorry to do this, but  it's important. I'll be back. Eleven! Oda Mae! We're in trouble. They want  the check. They're comin' to kill  you. We gotta get outta here. It's them. They're heading for the door. No they won't. I'm gonna get 'em. Whataya mean? I'm a ghost, aren't I? Looks like someone just left. I'll check the building. Damn! Who's there? Who's doing that? Oh God! Let me outta here! Help me! Look out! He's dead, Oda Mae. No. It's not over, Oda Mae. There's  still Carl. Tell him to hurry! Listen, lady, I'm going as fast as I  can. Tell her she's wearing the blouse I  spilled the Margarita on and the  earrings I gave her for Christmas. Gimme a penny quick. Empty your purse. On the floor. Now. Push a penny under the door. Tell her it's for luck. I'm sitting beside you. With all my heart. I'd give anything to be alive again,  just to feel you once more. No! What's happening to me? Molly, open up. It's me. Get out of here! The fire escape. Molly. Open up. Are you there? Molly! I want the check. Just give me the  check. Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's  not her money. Keep out of this, Molly! Where is it? Where? Where is it, goddamn it? Where is  it? You're lying! Don't lie to me! I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll  kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give  me the check. Sam, please. I didn't mean for him  to kill you. It's not my fault. Come  on, Sam, give me the check. Give it  to me and I'll leave her alone. Sam? Sam? Sam? Goodbye, Moll. Molly?! I can't stay anymore. I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae. Thank you. Your mama would be proud. I love you, Molly. I've always loved  you. It's so amazing, Moll... The love inside. You take it with you.
