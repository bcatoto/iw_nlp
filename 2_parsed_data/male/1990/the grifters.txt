Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me. Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing. You know it, Lilly. You're a thousand percent right! That's right. Take a little, leave a little. Not skimming a thing, Lilly? On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much? See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly. You want a drink? Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door. You'll never shit right again. What's that, Lilly? And if you do it wrong? Tell me about the oranges, Lilly. You ever hear about the oranges? I'll loan you a raincoat. You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes? It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it. I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this. You expect me to buy this? Motherhood. What the fuck are you doin with a son? Your what? You wanna talk to me straight up? Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off! One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth? You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me? How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that? You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando. Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn. It's his kidneys. Right in front of the room. I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert. Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean. Oh, everything's the same size, same price. Evening. Welcome to Phoenix. Hah. The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different. Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon! It's all hollow. Nothing behind it. Can't move. You ruined me! You destroyed me! Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer. Want a look? Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken. Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already... Mary Beth! This has never been anything but -- Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money. Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely. Mary Beth, what we have here, uh... You brought a case? Good. Here you are! Two rich people! These machines -- They're in here. We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately. Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in. You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means? The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing? Loose talk is the one thing I worry about. And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.Yes, yes, but that's -- His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital. Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside. The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.Take two, three days. Call when you get there. Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo. Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.Well, I'd have to see it, of course. You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in... I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry. I'll get you a check. Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars. Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased? This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry. I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see. You are a valued customer, as you know. Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.This time... My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting. It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money. I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.That's that, then. No question, huh? Not many. Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock. I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here. Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun. One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound... You up to it now? A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me. Do you have any particular reason to say that? I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon. I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even. That's natural. I realize this is a shock. Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here. Roy Dillon?Fair enough. Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was. Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet. Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities... The truth is, Mr. Kaggs -- I guess I'm just not a leader of men. Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry. Perk. Oh, sure. Fine. Well... But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to -- I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody -- Well, uh... No. What? Me? Sounds like a good Idea. Just myself. So I heard. Lead on. That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman. Roy Dillon. Whadaya say? NO! Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing? There's nothing more to talk about. What? Just trying to help, Lilly. That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes... If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it? Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly. Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out. Well, uh... I don't see why not. I don't? That's right. No. For God's sake, Lilly! What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself. Never. Uh-huh. Not very good! Oh? I didn't know anything was. Oh, you'll live, Lilly. Yeah, sure, that sounds nice. I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either. No. I know you do, so that's why -- I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you -- I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now -- Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself. Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you. You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job. Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over. And Myra's stuff? You must have some money. Don't be sorry. You're not taking it. You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though. This way's perfect. That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix? I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it. No. Myra followed you, huh? Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down. Why should they? The cops are satisfied. You're dead, Lilly, it worked. Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it. I just came back from Phoenix. Going somewhere? Well, that's good news. Well... nice to see you again, Lilly. I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh? You ought to put a bandage on that. Expecting visitors? I pay my debts. Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough? We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants. Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend. That's right. Why? I tripped over a chair. You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that! Lucky? You call that lucky? Bluebell came in? Sure. Up to you. Not as tough as you, huh? How come? You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob. I like those. It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself. What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what? I can take care of my own bills, Lilly. What happened to your hand? I guess I owe you my life. Thanks, uh, Lilly. Nice to see you. What am I doing in here? Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years? They knocked out my tooth! They twisted my arm. In your other hand. I am in school. I can't. I just left home. Let me see how you did that one. You taught me a lot. Then I invented. You watch that mouth. What's that? ) What? I'm happy the way I am. No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you. Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever. What I say is, no. We don't do partners. That's what I say. Don't I get any say in this? Maybe I like it where I am. I don't think I need it. The last I looked, we were just talking things over. Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners? And hello to you, too. Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay? Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out. Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard. Running your broker scam, you mean. You must have some very knowledgeable friends. She didn't see you, in other words. ) The track? Did you run into Lilly? You were gone for a while. Oh, come here. You -- I don't know. What? What for? Yeah? Sure. I'm pretty tired myself. Things a man isn't supposed to know. I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through? Sure. I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them. Take a hike, you mean? I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me. That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it? Upstate where? Where? What happened to Cole? Yeah? How? And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run. I thought these people were broke. And when he got serious? Is that right? I've heard the name. Nobody does that single-o. You talk the lingo. What's your pitch? Myra, I'm not following this. I'm a salesman. Working the what? What? Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work. You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more. See you soon. You ain't seen nothin. We'll rent a car. Because it's comfortable. Every day in every way. Oh, don't be stupid. That's just Lilly's way. I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that. Mama! I just do what the doctor says, babe. You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts. Her job. Oh, yeah? Thanks. How long do they say I'm in here? You called the doctor, huh? Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game? What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage? All? It ain't bad. Oh, I am, baby, believe me. Mm? Let's find out. That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all. Taking you for granite? Always, for you, baby. Oh, yeah. That's that. No, its -- Why did she--? Oh, Jesus. Not many laughs in this room, eh? Well, let's get the shock over with. Ate the gun. Oh. What? Yes, I know, I know. Sure. Let's get it over. Not that it matters. This is the morgue? My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day. It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide. Gun? No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out. Well, mostly, I don't believe it. Thank you. Yes? Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush. That's true, Mr. Simms. Well, thank you. And thank them. Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by. Mr. Simms.Happy to see you looking so good. We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves. Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon. Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
