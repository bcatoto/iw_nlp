Ah, shit. You got me. I ain't even married. Now put your fucking hands in the air! Lemme ask you a question. Ever fuck a mutant? I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down... Well, there it is; the Last Resort. Sure you wanna go in? Cheap domes. And no air to screen out the rays. Freaks?...'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory. Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not First time on Mars? You're getting off to an early start. So, where to? Oh, the usual. More money, more freedom, more air. Welcome to Mars. Over there man. He ain't got five kids to feed. Hey, I got four kids to feed. I think my grampa might be here. And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air. Whatcha doin' to me, man?! I got six kids to feed! Need a ride?I'd advise you to hurry. Never mind. Wet a towel and wrap it around your head. That'll muffle the signal. Don't bother looking. It's in your skull. They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.There you go, Mr. Brubaker. Suite 610 in the East Wing. I'll go encode your room key. Identification? Hmm. It seems you left something in our safe. Would you like the same suite? Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.You're nothing! You're nobody! You're a stupid dream. Well all dreams come to an end. I didn't want it to end this way. I wanted Hauser back. But nooo. You had to be Quaid. Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up... Impossible. Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet. Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on. My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people. Fire it up, Doc. Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes. And you like Melina, right? Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right. She's gonna be Hauser's babe. Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you. Perfect, my ass! --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you. Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked. The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us. We gave you lots of help. Benny here... He wasn't in on it. You set him off by going to Rekall. That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics. You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato. The fucking mutants could always sniff us out. So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole. Don't be modest. Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing. Well, my boy, you're a hero. Kill him. Don't be an idiot. Perfect!...Get out of Sector G. Now. Don't think. Do it. Stop fighting and get out. Great! Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass. Now let's get down to business. Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head. And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic. Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening. --Do you think you can play along? Who told you to think?! I don't give you enough information to think! You do what you're told!! That's what you do! I know that. Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system. As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want. Anything. If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end. Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person? Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that? I want him back in place with Lori. Lori says he can't remember jack shit! If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth. What the fuck is going on down there?!It's a symbol. Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep. Swallow this. No need to be rude. I'll do it. Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?" What about the girl? Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified. Is that a coincidence? Think about it. Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday. And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent. I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure. I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down. Not exactly. What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes. But you're inventing it yourself as you go along. You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console. At Rekall. I'm quite serious. You're not here, and neither am I. I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now. This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.O.K., everybody pull out! Richter! Call from Cohaagen. Arrest that woman! Where? Not since you lost him. Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.They found us! Everybody out! Shit! Wrong. Kuato's a mutant. So don't get upset when you see him. Yes, you do. That's why we brought you here. -- Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain. And Kuato's gonna dig it out. You tell me. Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless. You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine? On his way. Sit down. If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning. Hey, hey Tony. Give the big guy a break.Unh-uh, pal. You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else. You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble. You blabbed, Quaid! You blabbed about Mars! Come on, let's go have that drink. Let me buy you a drink. Yeah, you did. I told you not to but you did anyway. You went to Rekall, remember? How was your trip to Mars? Hey, Quaid! Don't fuck with your brain, pal. It ain't worth it. A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized. Well don't. "RekallRekallRekall." You thinkin' of goin' there? Oh, Rekall. Rekall?Look at this shit. I've got a lock! There! He's not at ground level. I've got a weak signal over there. That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere. What is it? Level 2. Galleria. I've got Quaid. I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it. I don't blame you man. I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady. Up to the right.Thanks for taking Johnnycab. The fare is eighteen credits, please. Would you please repeat the destination? Welcome to JohnnyCab. Where can I...? The door opened. You got it. I'm sorry. Would you please rephrase the question.Ernie, dump him in a cab. Around the corner. Tiffany, you help him. I'll destroy his file and refund his money. And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid. Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall. Oh shit....Oh shit... Why not? Use your head, you dumb bitch! He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip! What the fuck is going on here?! You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?! I'm with an very important client. What is it? What's he talking about? I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet. Now you tell me. Is that worth three hundred measly credits? Aaah, let me tantalize you. You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission. People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman... You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip. You. You're the same. No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you. Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself. I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip". Whatever you say...Just answer one question. What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken? Smart move. Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options. You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket. Look at the statistics. I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference. Guaranteed, or your money back. As real as any memory in your head. First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights: Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course... Venusville. Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits. That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail. --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant. Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is. To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em. Right. Mars. Now help me out here, Doug. You were interested in a memory of... Good to see ya. Right this way. Doug...Bob McClane.What happened to number five? Take me to the hotel. And you get a kickback. Why not? What happened to them? Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....? Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of. The Last Resort. What to the rebels want? What was that? An accident? You got the job. Where's yours? What's wrong with this one? How'd you find me? Who are you? What do you want? May I use your pen? Thank you. Get it, please. Definitely. Thank you. I am Quaid. Do you expect me to believe you? What are you afraid of? Turn it on. Come on, Cohaagen! You got what you want. Give these people air! The guy's a fucking asshole. Who is it this time--my mother? Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet. Sorry. Too perfect. So why am I still alive? Get your story straight. This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall. --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant. He's lying. Hauser turned against you. Fuck you. Sleazy...and demure. Brunette. Hetero. Not really. I've just always been fascinated by Mars. Eight years. Two-headed monsters? Nice to meet you. What is it? Suppose I do...then what? You open it. That's right. She's real. I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall. Bullshit. It's all coincidence. How much is Cohaagen paying you for this? Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you? Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming! And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me. Amazing. Where are we? Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me. I'm listening. What do you want? Melina! C'mon! You're Kuato, right? I don't know. What, aliens? Yeah. Where's Kuato? We don't have much choice then, do we? Relax, you'll live longer. Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else! Are you crazy?! I don't know anything about Mars. What the fuck did I do wrong?! Tell me! Harry, what the hell is this? No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow. What are you, my father? I did? What trip? Harry! No shit... Why not? I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. They sell fake memories. Hey Harry...Harry! You ever heard of Rekall? Quit while you're ahead. Anywhere! Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!! Drive! DRIVE!! How did I get in this taxi?! Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter. Bullshit. Right. That's why you tried to kill me. I suppose you're not here either. Yeah. Some of it was fun. Clever girl. I didn't know you were so kinky. I'm honored. O.K. then. If I'm not me, then who the hell am I? Bullshit. Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too? And falling in love? You think I'm an idiot? Remember our wedding? The hell you're not. Not talk! I said TALK!! You call this a paranoid delusion?! They did! But I killed them! Forget Rekall, will you! These men were going to kill me... --I got a trip to Mars. Let me finish! I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and... I don't know! It had something to do with Mars. Harry from work...He was the boss. No! Spies or something. And Harry from work...Get down! Some men just tried to kill me! Bye. Lori, don't you understand? I feel I was meant for something more than this. I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody. I'm late. Lori, move. All right, forget about it. Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists. Just think about it. Move to Mars. Let's do it. Lori... You know I do. Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams. But I'm always home by morning. I don't know. Nobody. Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream! Who? Mmmm..... Let me go! They'll be here any minute! They'll kill you all! Go on. Secret agent...How much is that? I'm not interested in that. I give up. No options. All right. What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund? Come on, don't bullshit me. How real does it seem? What's in the two week package? I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars. That a problem? Mars. Nice to meet you. I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream? The whole core of Mars is ice. The reactor melts it and releases oxygen. Cohaagen knows it makes air. But the bastard won't turn it on. It's just up ahead. Aliens built it. The one in the mine! The reactor. Are you all right? Are you still you? He's lying. I don't need Kuato for that. Like what? What can I do? I saw them. Not bad, for a hooker. Just wondering. By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall? Now what? So you dropped by to apologize? I thought you didn't like me. Melina, please...People are trying to kill me. He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good. Melina, Hauser sent me to do something. Inside what? Don't be ridiculous. Why would I lie to you? Forget I said wife. She wasn't really my wife. Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ... I didn't lose it. Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else. Me. Not any more. Hauser left me a note. I don't remember you. I don't remember us. I don't even remember me. I don't remember you. There's something I have to tell you... I guess he didn't. Blondes. I love you. What was I doing on Mars?! Damn! ...Who are you? Wait! I gave you?It's about goddamn time. I say we throw the switch and see what happens. Yes, sir. They've got Quaid! They're protecting him! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. But I thought... He had help. From our side, sir. No, sir. That's now. In an hour, he could have total recall. We can't let him run around. He knows too much. I'm trying to neutralize a traitor. Pull them out. This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down. HER! There! The woman! Quaid! That's Quaid! Watch your mouth, Captain. Any news of Quaid? What the hell is this? Come on! Up! Split up. Find him. I've got him. The guy in the turban. Shit! He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars. Where is he? What was that? I couldn't hear you. Are you saying she liked it? I want that fucker dead. Where?We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars. You asked me to find you if you disappeared. So here I am, good-bye. What? I'm leaving it here. Come get it and keep moving. This is the suitcase you gave me.
