My cannon. Cannon fuse. How much you think? You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!? What? Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place! We had food, water... Roger that. Yeah, still got one poking around. Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to do? No problem. You stupid punk! You came that close, that close!! Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town. You guys all set? Some kind of mutation...? Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door. "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain." What do you think? Max firepower or...? I think I scared it! Damn! Val, we can't get them. Never figured on having to shoot through dirt! Best goddamn bullet stop there is. Come back. Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace... What the hell's going on in town? Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready... Well, who put you two in charge? She's got my vote. Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right? That's fine. We've got some new things to teach them. In a minute. What's under the ground? We're not getting up on the roof. Earth shelter's the best. Known that since I was a kid. Val? What the hell you doing back already? Just barely, Pham. What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on? Come back. Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency. I'm on forty-nine. What the hell you doing back already? A beauty, isn't it? We bought three of them for the rec room.What do you use it for? What the hell is that, anyway? I don't know... They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds? You can't fight'em that way... That's four. Let us know if it starts moving, Burt. Hang on, Burt. The bastards are up to something. Yeah, like they got a plan... Good. You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail. So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains... Okay, Burt, listen. Forget shooting them. Tell me this: can you get to your truck? One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass. Ready as we'll ever be. Or a big mother slug maybe? Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things. You bet. You gonna be staying up here? Howdy, Rhonda. Where the hell are they? Hope they didn't wise up. So...now what? No. We go straight. He'll never make it! They're gonna get him! Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum... No good. You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail. You know, up the jeep trail. You know, Val went to that college, too. For a whole year. Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million. I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here. We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death. I'd vote for outer space. No way those are local boys. Well, at least the bastard can't climb. Pardon my French. I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in. Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else. Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead? No problem. Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out. Well, we'll ask around. Let you know if we hear of anything. Oh yeah? Think about this: She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man. For my part, I'd be proud to have her. I'd goddamn worship her. She likes both of us. We both helped her out. Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself. She just practically asked you for a date. What the hell is wrong?! You're not civil, you're glum. We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me. Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil. Yeah...but no ties. People ? Hell, National Geographic . Road's in! Light it, man! LIGHT IT!! What the hell are you doing?!! I want to live for the three days. Use the fucking bomb! Or just knock us over. Look, use the bomb! Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope... Well...that's it. We're not getting off this rock... Jesus, Val, it's pretty far. I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there. Don't worry about me, jerkoff. I'm best at driving the Cat. Like hell you are. We got a plan! Doesn't matter. The cat can pull any thing. A car, huh? Like a big armored car? Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer! Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons. No way they could stop it. Wait a minute...the Cat. Could we take the Cat? Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway. Shut it up! Shut the little bastard up! I'm gonna kick his ass! You're right, don't matter where they come from. You go north, I'll go south. Run for it? Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails. You're not even trying to come up with a plan! Don't he have a home to go to? Well, folks, what's the plan? You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here. Son of a god damned bitch! Been waiting there all this time. How the hell's it even know we're still here? Fuck you, too. Pardon my French. Well...haven't seen a sign for hours. Maybe it's long gone. I think we wait right here. Okay, now, how far's your truck? Prairie dog burrow... Yeah. Where's your truck? Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway. Pham Van don't get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks! Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of any thing like this before? This is one big mother! What the hell are they? Shut up! They got wind of something they don't like! Why would they do it? Here's the plan...We don't even stop. Ride like hell. Tonight we keep right on going. We'll walk the horses. Car's gone. We just missed them, that's all. That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark. You want the rifle or the Smith? Relax. A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick. A man who plans ahead. Slick as snot and I'm not lying. It must've grabbed us. That's why the truck stalled-out. Hey, I don't want spend the night out here! You're hung up again. Val! Val! Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now. Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead. Oh, Jesus!! Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way. We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee. You got that right. Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do? Camp out down below and just wait for him to die? Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger... Reckon he hated Perfection more than us? You suppose he wanted to kill himself? You're full of shit. One job I'd never take is working around electricity. Adios, bridge! We did it! We faced temptation and we did not bend! She's got us. Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection. Uh oh, it's Nancy. She wants another load of firewood. In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection. We gotta better ourselves." You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here? You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right now ? Damn it, Val! Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this! Car wash?! That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that. We could. We could. But we'd have to get really serious. It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place. You gotta ask that ? Catch it later, Pham. Gotta get over to Nestor's. I thought you called it your pecker. Look, don't make the mistake I made. Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me? Here with you. Don't matter. They're all the same: dead weight. Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails. Make my skin crawl! ...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter... Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z... Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her. You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her. Nah, it's September. Must be the new one. Nestor's out of town tomorrow. We don't dig today. We don't get paid today. Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead. You never take the long view. Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday. It is Monday, right? Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor. You're gonna get us hung up. Has a lot of rain. Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment. I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and... I was in one. A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree. Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon. Wasn't so damn funny, I can tell you. No...it was eggs. I did eggs. You didn't cook breakfast?You bet. I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her. If that ain't the truth. And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred. Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those. She wants to lay down. I'm a little worried.God, what a stink! Am I sure?! It was right there. There's the cord. It's...gone...! Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time. What? The con...! Oh my God. I'm dead. Let's finish in the morning.I'd do the same. Well, catch you Thursday. We playing cards tonight? Forget it. I got vegetables coming out my ears. Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as seen a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres. Well, I brung her something I know she likes. How's she doing?I've got a plan. You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby. Get us some help. Okay, ten dollars. I didn't do it! What's going on? And I appreciate it. Hey Val, listen. Bearing going out, you think?BACK OFF, BURT...! Right. We're gonna run. Get ready. Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles. Be there in two hours, tops! Damn it! They'll sink this rig just like a boat! Let's go you two. We're headed for the mountains. Listen! Listen! We know what they are! They're big things under the ground! Much bigger than we thought! They're coming after you! They're coming right now! Burt, get out! Get up on your roof or someplace! We found out what's been killing people! They're under the ground! Burt! This is Val! Get out of your basement!! Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof! Then we'll talk, okay?! Burt, can you hear me now? You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely... We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece! You are so full of shit... What? Somebody paying you to do this? Civil? I'm civil. No ties. Sell the movie rights. We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar. Road's in! Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in People magazine... Not yet, not yet... I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!! So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway. It's out last one. We can't kill them all. They're...they're trying to make us move! Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...? Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure. Come on, everybody! We gotta run for those rocks over there! Damn it. What the hell are they doing? They're up to something. Watch your ass, shithead. Only if something happens to me. Get real. I'm faster than you. I'm making the run to the Cat. Well...all right ! We just roll on out of here! Its tires are flat... But...we could pull something! We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it! Jesus. It's slower than hell. We need another plan. How the hell long it take you to change a tire? Chuck him out the door! Like a little hors d'oeuvre. I'm gonna help you. Right. We need to be talking about what we're gonna do. Right. Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options... Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower. First let's see if Stumpy's still out there. Me, too. It's been listening to us. It's got no eyes. It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure... Son of a bitch! Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see? I don't know. If this one's any faster than that other one... God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones. Little sons of bitches. We'll take your word for it. Naw, don't want to winch it. That'd tear it all up. Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps. You got that right! Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them. We just didn't tell you . Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these! We're really in on something here! So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime? Sons of bitches! Oh shit! That is the plan...I mean, goddamn it! What the hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon? Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from? Great. Thank you. The rifle. Screw you. For all you know they could fly . Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners. They better be fast. Fifteen lousy bucks. Yeah! Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...! Fuck you! I am not! Jesus! I don't believe this! Those assholes are supposed to be fixing the goddamn road! Hey! Where are you guys? People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?! Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know? What the hell is going on? I mean WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!! I'll go with that plan. Probably up a pole starving itself to death. Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place. Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst? Come on, sombody must've chased him up there. If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun? He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you. Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground. Jeez, look at that guy. So long, cactus! Damn straight! Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing! That's the plan. Forget it, man. It's not worth it. I'll call that little bluff. How close? What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet. I was up for going to Bixby. I was getting excited. Well, you're the one won't work in the car wash. You're the one's gotta have a plan. Yeah, sure. Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two. So? That car wash pays good, and they're always looking. So what if we just did it...today. Pack up. Drive straight down to Bixby. Get serious. Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them? Right. We plan ahead. That way we don't do anything right now. Earl explained it to me. Well, I'm a victim of circumstance. Tammy Lynn Baxter. Well, sure. Why? What the hell do we know about seismographs? The new one! That's supposed to be a girl! Who the hell's that? That's not what's his name...the grad student? Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today. Do Nestor tomorrow. Do not talk to the driver. Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year. Handymen, Earl. We're handymen. If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him. How many cows does it take to make a stampede? Is it like three or more? Is there a minimum speed? Hell you did. Your turn. Did it yesterday. Franks and beans. Yeah, Heather, we got you. They're tearing down the houses here! We all gotta get outta here together! Now! We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan. Burt! Heather! Yeah, Burt. The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III. Ran into the new college student, Rona. Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham! Twenty. I don't believe this. The phone is out! Pham, your phone is out! You don't get it, Pham. The idea was: we were ripping you off. Could be. LET'S DO IT! Good point. I think the ground's getting closer. I think we do it. We're gonna save our asses here! Yeah, good! Something to keep them busy. We need a decoy. Like what ?! There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains! What?!! Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?! They're working together, too. What's it doing? You paying attention? This oughta hurt like hell. Rhonda's got an idea about that. Yeah. One, two, three... Think it's still following us? You okay? Yeah, vibrations in the ground. Around here? Why would they? Yeah, geography.
