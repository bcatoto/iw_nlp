Do you want some help? I can call upstairs. Are you all right? Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game. You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing. Yeah, ever since that ... Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him? By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.Don't bother to call again, okay? I'm hanging up. Listen, Jake. I gotta go. Maybe the demons are real. Maybe there's a larger truth. Maybe it's not the army, Jake. They're not interested, Jake. There's nothing to expose. I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen. It's hard to explain. That's right. We did. Hello. What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?Don't go. Wait ... Daddy. Mom, it's ... It's cold. There was a bang. Daddy, what was that noise?I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay? It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand. I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam. I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it. You mind? I'm eating, huh? You need ... a doctor. Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay? Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they? Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university? Ah! I thought you were a mailman. Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here? The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean? I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.What else did he say, Jake? But the paper ... Why do you say that? You think they're connected? Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back. He say what they looked like? How long had that been going on? What do you mean, demons?No! Oh God. No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain. Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family! No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then. Let me out of here! I don't know. I don't know. This isn't happening. I'm alive. Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead. Take me home. Get me out of here. Like Della. Just to see you. That's all. I see. Della? No, thanks. No, don't. But thanks. I'm okay. Hello, Sam. What do you want from me? Stop!!!! Oh God! Just my luck. Oh, terrific. It's short, huh? I could have told you that. Hey, wait! What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ? Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that? What are you talking about? What do you mean? Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know? Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you? What's going on? How can you just turn away? What about the others? Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this. Well, try, huh. What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why? Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about? Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger. He was upset. He thought people were following him. Don't go? I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe. Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours. Now what? Tell your mother. It was the window. Gabe? What are you doing ... ? War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Used you? Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you? A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something. Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you. Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh? I'm too messed up to teach. I am. Doctor. Ph.D. Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man. This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what. I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy. No. Not really ... A couple of weeks, I think. He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said. He told me he was going to Hell. We should get ourselves a lawyer. Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one. Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on. An explosion, just like Paul's. ... I've seen them, too. Not tonight, Louis. No more rest. I'm walking, aren't I? There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis. What? By myself? I've seen it. It's all pain. I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis. Am I dead, Louis? Am I dead? Louis, you're a life saver. I don't know. I've been having them recently. You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that? I had this weird flash just then. God almighty. What did you do to me? I can't relax. What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos. What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in. She hates me, Louis. Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years! I thought you said she didn't say much. She told you that? Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that. She talk about the boys? Sarah. I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say? What did she have to say? Her knee acting up? What can I tell you? How do you know? Hell, you think I am? But I see them. I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. Please help me. I need your insight, your intuition. Yes. I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis. It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to. Christ, I know how it sounds. I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life. Yes. No. I see them. I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean. I need to know about ... demons. I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady. Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft. I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos. Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all. I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch. I haven't seen her in months. It's good to see you. The postal service. I'm a mailman. Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me. That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him. Whataya mean, no record? Jacob Singer. Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me. Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes. New? He's been here for years. I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please. Save me! I'm not dead. I am not dead. She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious. She was good in bed, though. Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice. What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was? This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy. Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed. It's freezing. Goddamn it. I want Louis. No. Don't move me. I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had. They stole it. My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor. TELL ME, DAMN YOU! WHO ARE YOU? Goddamn you! Oh God! This isn't happening. Where have they gone? No! What's going on? Where's my family? Where are they? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys? Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say. Stop it, Jez. Don't do that. Don't be funny. West. I picked up my ticket. I'm leaving in the morning, Jez. Mid-town mostly. Then don't bug me. Shit! Can't I just have a bad day? Goddamn it. Why do you say that? I'm tired. I'm not upset. I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten. Well leave then. Go to Hell. You know goddamn well what I mean. That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana. I don't know you. Why won't you answer me? Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me. With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away. TELL ME, DAMN YOU! WHO ARE YOU? Who are you? What are you doing to me? What's going on? Where have they gone? No! What's going on? Where's my family? Where are they? What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys? I love you when you're angry. No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable. I promise. No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you. It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone. Stick with me, kid. I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie. Me neither. Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez. I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do. I have no idea. I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God. A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him. I'm not here. You haven't seen me. Don't! I can do anything I want. You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news! Stay away from me, Jez. Let go! Jezzie? I don't believe this. What's he talking about? What? What do you mean? Why didn't you call me? He did? When? In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real. You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone. Underneath all the bullshit, just love. I love you, Jez. With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away. You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up. What? Are we in Brooklyn? Am I home? Help me! Help me! Hey, I'm not dressed. Jezzie! My feet are throbbing! Don't gimme that. I can't do it. Look at me. I'm ice cold. You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die. Coming here? What'd the doctor say? What are you talking about? I'm freezing. What the hell are you doin'? How high is that? What does it say? What's it say? A hundred and two? If I could stop it, I'd stop it. Show me Della! Where's Della? Bring her here? Where? Where are we? I wanna leave. Get me out of here. They weren't human! Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me. They're like demons, Jez. What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures? When was the last time I said a word? Why do you bring her up? I'll be glad to avoid the crush. I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me. I'm going home. How's it going? Ready? I just want to look ... Wait. Don't. Gabe. Well, you didn't marry her. She looked good then. What do you mean you can see? What? Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College. Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida. What's in here? I must have been out of my head. And look what I got. Yeah, but for what? You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny? And where do you think Jezebel comes from? They're Biblical. They were prophets. Eli. Why can't you remember their names? Who? Jed? Thanks. What's that? Jezzie, I can't see. I don't know. No. Have you seen my glasses? Don't ask. Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time. Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow. What do you mean? Thanks. Where to? If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was. Where is the lamp? I didn't want to wake you. What the hell did you do, move all the furniture? I don't know what to say. No. I couldn't. I would have stayed there if I could. Mike, it was real. It was glorious. It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there. I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle. What's happening? Help me. I can't move. I think I'm falling asleep. One drop? I don't know. What is it? Never? How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something? You come here often? So why tell me now? If you knew, why didn't you say anything? Who then? But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there? None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive? Like it was yesterday. The Ladder? Yeah, sure. We were losing the war. Shows how much you knew. Long time ago. I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me? No. I'll take the other one. Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably. You got a nice tan, though. How was Palm Springs? Where's Wong? They're awfully heavy. Yeah, you and everyone else. Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet? Excuse me. Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep. Help me! What?! What is wrong with you? You come near me and I'll blow us all up. For what? For seeking the truth? Help me! This is not a dream! This is my life. Last night! They were as real as you are! That's a lie. My family was here. Where's Sarah? Where did she go? She was here ... I'm awake? Where am I? Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue. Call my chiropractor. Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there. You come home with me. I don't know. I don't know. The army? What is it Paul? What's happening to me? Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams. Everywhere, like a plague. I've seen them too ... the demons! Don't do anything. Paul, I know what you're talking about. It's okay, Paul. It's okay. Why not? Who, Paul? What exactly ... ? Who is? You in trouble? What's goin' on Paul? That black car? What's wrong? You can't talk in Brownsville? Why the hell we drivin' here? Nope. It's not worth it. You'll never win. It's almost like a conspiracy, huh? You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed? Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds. Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick. Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor? Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life? Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years? Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned! Speaking. Hello. No. No. It's okay. I'm okay. Blew up? What do you mean it blew up? How did it happen? Jesus, Jesus! ... When? Died? I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?Me, too. Grass never did that to me. Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something? How do you know?Do you want me to get someone? No one knows. They say it blew up. Last month, before Thanksgiving. A car accident. I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died. Can I help you?Jake, you need to rest. What are you talking about? You can barely stand. What are you doing? You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try. Perfect. We got it. Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand. You ever read Meister Eckart? How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart? Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side. Well, I'll see what I can do about it. From a slipped disc? That'd be a first. Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you? I know. Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you. What? I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit. Wiggle your toes. If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong. Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office. You should go back to her. Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake. She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out. She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you. She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months. Ah, good. Now turn to your left. Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out. Who? Turn on your right side. How about the other "right?" I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left. A bit. I saw Sarah the other day. I know you. How come you're so tense today? Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.Save the words ... Just send back my credit card. What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too. This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be. Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me. I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here. Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back. Well that's good to know. Better living through chemistry, that's my motto. And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone. Just relax. Pleasant dreams. It's strong stuff. "Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh? Stick out your tongue. That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax. Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on. I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue. I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it. Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me. Sometimes. When it's convenient. Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help. The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business. I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records. Yeah. But not with the Cong. A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it. A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought. Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember. That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder. Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know. Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder. No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies. Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there? Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse. So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68. Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors. Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind? I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home. They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something. She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us? They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire. I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army. Oh God. I know. I know. God almighty. I thought I was the only one. You've seen them? What do you mean? I don't know what to do. They're waitin' for me, that's why. I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home. Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild. They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind. That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me. Yeah. I don't know. Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em. Let's get a couple drinks, okay? Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us? I'm not sure where I can talk anymore. I just need to talk. You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous. Still married, Jake? You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh? No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it. Count 'em on one hand. I work in a bakery. I need to see you. I need to see you, Jake. Nothin' much. A long time. Paul Gruneger! Jacob Singer?If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form? You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here. I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files. What's your name? Our doctors are seen by appointment only. Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment? Carlson? Is he new here?I don't have to ask if you can feel that. I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little. We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call? Who did? Your back? Did you fall?What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange. That was set. I'm tellin' you. Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that. Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident. I say you should get a shrink. Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you. Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall. Not me, buddy. Dr. Carlson's dead? Shit! It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.Push 'em back. That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. He'll never make it. Total delirium. He's burning up. Dream on! Clear the area. This is an order! We're not going to hurt you. Please come quietly. Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest. Push 'em back. That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. Total delirium. He's burning up.
