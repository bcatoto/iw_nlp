Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn. You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great. He made mirrors. Busting his balls? If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box. Listen to him. "Watch the suit," he says. A little pisser I've known all my life. Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big. Son of a bitch. Get over here. Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin. Paulie. You're all I got. I need help. Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit. I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong. But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me. I was fucking crazy. But I'm okay now. I can be trusted. I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together... It was easy money. I did it in the can. Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie. I've been all fucked up since I got out. I understand. Nods again. Nods. Paulie. Why would I? I swear. Why would I get into that? Me? Why would I get into that shit? Wha? Me? Oh I Him. The guy from near where Christie used to live? What thing? The Brooklyn thing? Tell him. It's okay. Yeah. What about the kids' school? Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay. What happened? You okay? Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it? Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand. I need it. I was depending on that money. You what? You know. The stuff I left. Where's the stuff? So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out. Just get me out. Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out. Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first. I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead. Paul will calm down. You'll see. What did he say, exactly? Hello! Hello! Have a good flight? I had everybody working. Even our old babysitter. Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie. Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning. Get packed. We're getting out of here. Never. Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it. Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody. It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody. Forget Paulie. As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything. We've got to help each other. It'll be okay. Stop! Stop! What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me. Jezuz Christ! What are you talking about? Shit. I'm just having my last few drinks. Son of a bitch. It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do. What's the matter with you? You're crazy. That again. How much? Are you nuts? Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car. Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it. What bag? Get inside! Go inside. I'll be right there. I'm in construction. He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage. I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right? She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes. I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said. Take it easy. We can talk about it. I didn't know, I swear. I thought it was next week. I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check. I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy. Yeah. Yeah. How? He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all. On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck. I can't eat, just get me some coffee. Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye. Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country. Nah. Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction. Come on, don't fuck around, will ya? What'll I tell Fran? Paulie's gonna make him? There are cops all over the place. What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay? I gotta talk to you. Jimmy. What lions? I'm not going near any lions. If Paulie finds out, we got problems. It's been six months. What? Paulie was just talking about him. Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax. Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city. He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal. I mean, he actually enjoyed it. Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies. He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast. What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street. Marty, please. Let me talk to him. He heard. Will you stop. Done. What are you gonna do? Fight with him? He wants his money. I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right. I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building. It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot. My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me. I can't make any more deliveries. What could I do? If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat. I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone. Do you realize what we're involved in here now? What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg. Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean? Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important. Call from an outside phone. I mean it. You know what to do? Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick. You ready? They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it? Tommy, come on. Put the gun away. Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy! Tommy ... Will you get the fuck out of here. Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad. Tommy. Come on. Relax. Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it. Come on, relax. He's drunk. He's been locked up for six years. It's okay. I'll make it up. I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay? Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all. Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody. Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this. There's enough powder around here to put us all away.I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case. He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida. It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh. I think you got a good shot at beating the case. What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit. I better call again. You want the melon? I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls. Watch this. Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her. Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him. So what? Where are they gonna go? Don't worry about it. Oh yeah? Anything you say. Have a drink first. Give'm a drink. We did it. We did it. For Christmas. Your share. It's just a taste. We only have to shove'em over the moat. we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions. Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems. It's still better than letting somebody find him. The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard. Well, we gotta dig him up again. We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate? You got money for your bullshit television, don't you? I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money? Keep 'em coming. Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him. The third store down. I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block. I gotta talk to him as soon as I can. Did he say what they're asking him about? How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade. Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools. We'll pick it up. We'll pack up everything and send it to you.No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one. The oldest one. He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack. She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor. Look at Jeannie's kid.Okay? I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight... Are you okay? What happened? So do I. I hate to do dishes. Stay there.Please? Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do. But, Paulie, please. But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town. I can't go here. I can't go there. But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie. You know me all my life. I've always done the right thing.I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. : You're some fucking jerk. Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything? What happened to you?No more shines, Billy. Don't go busting my balls. Okay? Hey, Billy. Watch the suit. Billy, how are you? No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it. No, no. It's okay. Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend? For Chrissake. Come on. You don't even have to stay. Jeesuz! What's the big deal? You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend. You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful. There's a shovel at my mother's. Keep him here. I'm going for a bag. He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good. I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.Here. Take it. Now I gotta turn my back on you. You treated me like shit. You thought I was some fucking jerk? Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied. You think I didn't know what you were doing? I warned you a million times. Anybody! You understand? And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me. You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand? I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison. I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me. You understand? I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here. Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean. I don't want any more of that Shit. No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on. No. No. The guy from downtown. What did you hear about that thing? What? You want a partner? What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would? Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop. You? You think you're the only one? I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen. You think that matters? You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards. If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
