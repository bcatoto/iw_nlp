A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ?  Have you seen Edward ?  Well, my wife went to a lot of trouble : she called a caterer.  Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you ?  Philip, good. Hey, I understand Edward's taking over Morse Industries.  Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan.  Can I get in on it ?  Yeah. Call me.  When ?  Just call me.  Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer.  Hey, where's the guest of honor anyway ?  Well, if I know this fellow, he's probably off in a corner somewhere charming a very pretty lady.  How are you ?  I told my secretary to make the arrangements. Didn't she call you ? JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak to you.  I see. JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) I have my own life too, you know, Edward.  This is a very important week for me. I need you here. JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at your beck and call.  I do not believe that you are at my beck and call. JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) Well, that's the way you always make me feel. Maybe I should just move out.  If that's what you want, yes. JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it.  Now is as good a time as any. JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.  Good-bye, Jessica.  Phil suggested that maybe I should take a lawy...  Phil is just my lawyer, okay ?  Yes, sir.  How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei ?  I don't know.  You don't know ? Tokyo opened maybe ninety minutes ago. You have to keep on top of these things, all right ?  Done.  Hi. How're you doing ?  I want this whole thing... wrapped up as soon as possible. I gotta get to New York by Sunday. I got tickets to the Met.  Yes, sir.  Your coat, Mr. Lewis.  Thank you.  Susan !  Hi.  Oh, yeah. Thanks. Heard you got married.  Mmm... Mmm... Susan, tell me something.  When you and I were dating, did you speak to my secretary more than you spoke to me ?  Hmm. Your husband's a very lucky guy.  Bye.  Do you ?  Wonderful.  Excuse me.  Edward, where you going ?  You got the keys to your car ?  Why, what's wrong with the limo ?  Look, the limo is buried back there. Darryl can't get it out.  Mmm.  Please give me the keys.  All right, look. I don't think you should drive. You're a little excited. Don't drive my car. Let me work something out here.  Fellas, what kind of a system is this ? Can you move these cars out of here ?  Look, Edward. Edward... Uh, are you familiar with a stick shift ?  Uh, yeah.  Have you driven a shift ?  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Listen, all right. Just be ginger with it. Don't...  It's a new car. Don't, uh... Just don't...  Okay. I can do it.  Edward ! Give me a break, please !  I love this car.  I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're going. You're gonna get lost in the dark !  Beverly Hills is down the hill !  I don't need to fall at your feet. Just 'cause you cut me to the bone. And I won't miss the way that you kiss me. EDWARD (voice over) Oh, shit.  We were never carved in stone. If I don't listen to the talk of the town. Then maybe I can fool myself. I'll get over you I know I will. I'll pretend my ship's not sinking. And I'll tell myself I'm over you.  'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking.  Well, here I am.  Well, I'm just goin' to school like I'm real, real cool. Gotta dance like a fool Got the message.  And I gotta be a wild one Ooh, yeah. I'm a wild one.  Gonna break it loose.

Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Will you be needing the car anymore tonight ?  I... I hope not !  Yeah.  So you'll be all right ?  Go back to your office.  Well, thanks for the ride.  Good-bye. EDWARD (voice over) No taxis ?  I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an hour ?  Yeah... Well, if you don't have any prior engagements, I'd be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.  Edward.  No ?!  Why don't you put this on ?  Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that rents rooms by the hour.  You're gonna be fine. Come with me. And stop fidgeting.  Hello. You have messages ?  Thank you.  Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please ?  First time in an elevator.  Try.  Penthouse.  Yes.  To the left.  Oh, I miss keys.  Impressed ?  Sure they do. VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace) Wow, great view ! I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here.  I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there.  I'm afraid of heights.  It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the first floor, but I can't find one.  Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.  I hadn't exactly planned this.  Always.  Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.  You're on my fax.  Cute. Very cute. Thank you.  A buffet of safety.  No, no. I...  Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ?  Business, I think.  A lawyer ?  What makes you think I'm a lawyer ?  I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.  Champagne.  Uh, over by the bar.  Thank you.  Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.  Don't worry about it.  Not at all.  I have both.  My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home... with my ex-dog.  There you go.  My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of my apartment even as we speak.  Why don't you try a strawberry ?  It brings out the flavor in the champagne.  No.  Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue with you.  Why don't we just get through that right now ?  How much for the entire night ?  Try me.  Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.  To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone tonight.  No.  I bet you have.  I don't know. I really don't know.  I didn't hear you. What did you say ?  What is... What do you have in, uh, your hand there ? What are you hiding ?  All right, look. I do not want any drugs here. I don't want any of this. Get your things and your money and please leave.  What is this ? What is this ?  This is dental floss.  I'm sorry. Please continue.  No, I'm going.  It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me.  I'm going.  Uh-huh. I've got them from London. I need them now from Tokyo. I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank you very much.  I'm high on life. Can't you tell ? VIVIAN (voice over) You know, I never saw this episode.  What do you do ?  Neither do I.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, good morning.  Good morning, sir.  Good morning, Marjorie.  Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected. He's run his company for a very long time now. I don't think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.  He wants to meet you face to face, hmm...  Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow. Tonight. Dinner. Set it up.  Oh, Edward, Edward. I... Look, it's really not a good idea that you see him.  Definitely not alone.  Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are gonna go wrong.  That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car.  Oh, God. What ?  It corners like it's on rails.  What ? What does that mean ?  Well, good morning.  Better.  No, there's no hurry. Are you hungry ? You must be.  Why don't you sit and have something to eat ?  I, uh, took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu.  I didn't know what you'd like.  All right ? Good.  Did you sleep well ?  Occupational hazard ?  Uh, yes, a little, on the couch.  I was, uh, working last night.  That's right.  There are four other chairs here.  I buy companies.  Uh, I buy companies that are in financial difficulty.  Well, the company I'm buying this week, I'm getting for the bargain price of about one billion.  Yes.  I went all the way.  No, I get some of it from banks, investors. It's not an easy thing to do.  No.  No.  I sell them.  Well, I... don't sell the whole company. I break it up into pieces... and then I sell that off. It's worth more than the whole.  Yeah, sort of. But legal.  Mm-hmm. VIVIAN (voice over) There. See, now it's perfect.  Not bad. Not bad at all. Where'd you learn to do that ?  Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end.  Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.  Oh, that's good. PHILIP (voice over on the phone) He's bringing his grandson.  He's grooming him to take over. I don't know.  Ah, yes. Very intense young man named David. He plays polo.  Look, I gotta say this again. I don't like you going alone, you know.  Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.  Housekeeping is singing.  Yeah... listen.  No, you don't.  Besides, I already have one. VIVIAN (singing in voice over) If you want to impress me...  You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to.  I'm on my way.  More than life itself.  Vivian, I have a business proposition for you.  I'm gonna be in town until Sunday. I'd like you to spend the week with me.  Yes. Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee. Would you consider spending the week with me ?  I will pay you to be at my beck and call.  I want a professional. I don't need any romantic hassles this week.  Oh, yes, of course !  All right, here we go. Give me a ballpark figure. How much ?  Six nights at three hundred is eighteen hundred.  Two thousand.  Done.  Vivian ?  Vivian, is that a yes ?  I'll be gone most of the day. I want you to buy some clothes.  We may be going out evenings. You'll need something to wear.  Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy.  Conservative. You understand ?  Elegant. Any questions ?  Not if you expect me to answer.  I would've paid four. I'll see you tonight.  Three thousand for six days. And, Vivian, I will let you go.  Hello ?  Ma ? VIVIAN (voice over on the phone) It's Viv.  Oh. Hi. I had to party. Where are you ?  Do I have to hear this ?  Bullshit !  Oh, man ! I am bummed. I gave that guy to you !  Three thousand. Really ? Is he twisted ?  Did he give you the money yet ? VIVIAN (voice over on the phone) At the end of the week.  That's what's wrong with him.  Reg... Bev... Wil.  In Beverly Hills ? VIVIAN (voice over on the phone) Yeah.  Rodeo Drive, baby.  Ah !   Arrivederci.  Miss Wilson, do you know that lady ?  Wild women do. And they don't regret it.  Wild women show what they're going through.  Ooh ! Wild women do what you think you'll never.  What you only dream about wild women do.  Oh, yes, they do.  You tell me you want a woman who is simple as a flower.  Well, if you want me to act like that, you've got to pay me by the hour.  Wild women do and they don't regret it.  Oh, wild women show what they're going through.  Oooh-whoo ! Ooh, yeah.  Wild women do what you think you'll never.  Thank you.  Excuse me, miss, may I help you ?  Uh, do you have a key ?  You're a guest here ?  And who would that be ?  Edward ?  Mm-hmmm.  Dennis.  Dennis, did you just come off the night shift ? Hmm ?  Yes, sir.  Do you know this young lady ?  She's with Mr. Lewis.  Mr. Lewis ?  Evidently she joined him last night.  Thank you. VIVIAN (voice over from the elevator) Oh, God ! What now ? What ? What ?  No, no. It's all right. Just come with me. We'll have a little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you.  Don't play with me, young lady.  Thank you. Vivian.  Well, Miss Vivian. Things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Now, Mr. Lewis, however, is a very special customer, and we like to think of our special customers as friends. Now, as a customer, we would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests, but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it. Now, I'm assuming that you're a...  Relative ?  Mm-hmmm. I thought so. Then you must be his...  Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again. I assume you have no other uncles here.  Good ! Then we understand each other. I would also encourage you... to dress a little more appropriately. that'll be all.  Women's clothing.  Bridget, please.  Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard Thompson here at the Regent Beverly Wil...  Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the projection, please ?  Yeah, what ? Speak.  Navy contract. I can't believe this shit. I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper on this one !  Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more. Those stocks could go through the roof.  Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.  Walk away ? Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man- hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything !  Philip, I think he's right. PHILIP (raising his voice) Forget it, Mark.  Gentlemen, relax !  Relax ! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations Committee ?  Senator Adams.  All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is.  The Navy's not going to spend 350 million dollar on anything without going to Appropriations first.  I don't understand what's going on here today, gentlemen.  That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me.  I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the geologicals ? BOB (voice over) No problem.  Thank you. PHILIP (voice over) Edward.  Listen, everything all set for the meeting tonight ?  Mm-hmm. THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over) Yes, Senator Adams, please.  Who... Who is this girl you're going with ? THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over) Yes.  Nobody you know. THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over) Yes, Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey. Yes, I have him right here.  Well, I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it.  No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure they're quite lovely. Thank you.  You're welcome, Miss Vivian.  Never, ever pick up the phone.  I'll be in the hotel lobby, 7:45 sharp. VIVIAN (voicer over on the phone) What ? You're not coming up to the door ?  This isn't a date. It's business.  I'm taking you to a restaurant called the Voltaire.  Well, thank you very much.  Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you.  Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone call.  It didn't fit ?  Shrimp fork, salad fork, dinner fork.  All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines. Four tines : dinner fork. And sometimes there are three tines in the salad fork. And sometimes...  Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of the hotel.  Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call.  Yes, um, sir. I have a message for you, sir.  From who ?  From your niece, sir.  My what ?  The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir.  Oh. Hmm.  I think we both know that she's not my niece.  Of course.  The reason I know that is that I am an only child.  Yes, sir.  What's the message ?  She's waiting for you in the lounge. Intriguing young lady, Miss Vivian.  Intriguing.  Have a good evening, sir.  Thank you, Mr... ?  Thompson. I'm the manager...  ...manager of the hotel, sir.  You're stunning.  Shall we go to dinner ?  This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.  Stop fidgeting.  Mr. Morse.  Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.  This fireball is my grandson, David.  Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is true enough.  I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.  Mr. Morse. David.  Please, sit.  Where are you going ?  Upstairs, to the right.  Shall I order for you ?  I'll do that. DAVID MORSE (voice over) Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a company... DAVID MORSE (voice over) ...should control its destiny.  Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.  I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure which goes with what ! DAVID MORSE (voice over) You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of cities. Men like my grandfather made this country.  These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a delicacy. Try it. David ?  Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control... and I don't think you will... but if you did, what do you plan to do with the company ?  Break it up and sell off the pieces.  I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea... of your turning forty years of my work into your garage sale. EDWARD (voice over) At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are going to be a very rich man.  I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.  I met your father. What's his name ?  Carter. JAMES MORSE (voice over) Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.  He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is.  No, I have the franchise on that.  Does that make him proud ?  I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.  Oh, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.  Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for you ?  Leave my company alone.  I can't do that. I own ten million shares.  I'll buy your stock back.  You don't have the money.  We will. We're getting a contract to build ten destroyers.  There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there.  And how the hell did you pull something like that ? You got dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ? JAMES MORSE (voice over) Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David.  Mr. Lewis plays hardball.  Yes, yes, I do.  I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure to meet you. I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis.  I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner.  I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss.  Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart.  I look forward to it, sir.  Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ?  I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does it ?  Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he does, but he does.  No, just the two. THE WAITER (voice over) Yes, sir.  Yes, sir. EDWARD (voice over) Check, please.  Yes, sir.  Not in this building.  Well, I'm only halfway out.  Thanks for the recap.  What I would like is for you to get down from there. You're making me very nervous. Please come down.  Vivian, I'm serious. Come... I'm not looking.  The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I like this man or not.  I will not let myself become emotionally involved in business.  Oh, of course, not with me. You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money.  Last month.  I hadn't spoken to him in fourteen and a half years. I wasn't there when he died.  No.  «Veg out» ?  Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli tomorrow.  I'm going downstairs for a while.  Thank you. Thank you very much.  I only play for strangers.  Gentlemen, would you mind leaving us, please ?  Thank you.  Now, if you have any trouble using this card, have them call the hotel. All right ?  Mm-hmm. I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday.  Why not ?  Mean to you ?  They're not looking at you. They're looking at me.  Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit cards.  Okay, stop fidgeting.  Get rid of your gum.  I don't believe you did that.  Yes ?  I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you ?  Edward Lewis.  Ah, yes, sir.  You see this young lady over here ?  Yes.  Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ?  Oh, yes.  Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that. That's why when you came in...  Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ?  ...we knew from the first...  We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You understand that.  Sir, if I may say so, you're in the right store and the right city for that matter.  Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to have some fun. Okay ?  Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it !  Come on. Bring it out, girls.  Excuse me, sir, uh,  Yeah ?  Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about ? Just profane or really offensive ?  Really offensive.  I like him so much !  Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far ? Pretty well, I think.  I think we need some major sucking up.  Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful man. I could see the second you walked in here, you were someone to reckon with...  Hollister.  Yes, sir.  Not me. Her.  I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.  How we doing, ladies ?  Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell are you ? The word's all over the street.  He's countering ?  I don't know. He, uh... I think he's throwing in with the employees.  He still needs someone to underwrite the paper.  Yeah, okay. You got it.  You're on your own. I have to go back to work. You look great !  She has my card.  And we'll help her use it, sir.  Pretty woman walking down the street.  Pretty woman the kind I like to meet. Pretty woman.  I don't believe you. You're not the truth.  No one could look as good as you. Mercy.  Would you give her the tie ?  The tie ?  Take off the tie. Give her the tie.  The tie.  He really wants to do this, by the way.  Who ordered pizza ?  Pretty woman, stop a while.  Pretty woman, talk a while. Pretty woman give your smile to me.  Pretty woman Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pretty woman, look my way.  Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me.  Pretty woman don't walk on by.  Pretty woman don't make me cry. Pretty woman.  Don't walk away, hey.  Oh, oh, pretty woman.  Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh ?  Jake, set something up with Blair. Around two o'clock, two- thirty, would be good.  You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he owns, right down to his underwear, to secure a loan from the bank.  And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh ?  Hmm.  So, it goes without saying... that your business means a lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse. So, all you gotta do is call the bank.  Yeah.  Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is wrong with you this week ? Are you giving Morse a chance to get away ?  You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil ?  What ?  Blocks. Building blocks. Erector sets.  So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the point ?  We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything.  We make money, Edward. We worked for a year on this deal. It's what you said you wanted. I'm handing it to you.  Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill. Let's finish this. Call the bank !  Nice tie.  Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman. And he took his money with him. EDWARD (voice over) And then she died. I was very angry with him.  It cost me ten thousands dollars in therapy to say that sentence : «I was very angry with him». I do it very well, don't I ? I'll say it again. «I was very angry with him».  Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father.  My father was president of the third company I ever took over. I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece.  He said I was cured.  Watch where you're walking, because, if you step in something, we're not going back in the car.  Not too near the tree. I don't like the ants.  Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere ?  Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood Boulevard.  Come on. Let go. Let go.  All right. You look great. You look like a lady. You're gonna have a wonderful time.  Okay. Don't fidget and smile. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Humboldt's coming around to this side. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Toquenee is on Kennan. Penalty on that play.  This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters, who have made marrying well an art form.  Be back in just a second. Hold on.  Well done.  Business.  Yeah. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) That's the chukker, ladies and gentlemen. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Falcons, seven. Gems, four.  Excuse me. Edward !  Edward. Over here.  Phil.  Ah, good to see you.  Me too. I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward.  Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife, Elizabeth.  Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns. Well, let me get you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay ?  I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here ?  Mm-hmm. I asked him.  That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm !  He's my lawyer. He's all right.  Maybe we'll try that later.  I spend time with them, yeah.  No wonder what ?  This is a time-honored tradition, ladies and gentlemen. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) As old as the game of polo itself. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Kings and queens used to do this.   No, it's all part of the game of polo. You get to have your shoes polished by a member of the club.  I think I got something in the car that will buff that up.  Vivian, hi. David Morse.  How are you ?  I thought that was you. I like this hat.  Edward's date. ELIZABETH (voice over) I'm going for a ride with the Ritter's in their new car. Okay, hon ?  Uh-huh.  Have fun.  Come meet my horse, Vivian.  Come on. He's right here.  Uh... I was asking for directions. There she was.  Oh, so you just ran into her ? That's great, Jesus !  So anyway, what does she do ? Does she... does she work ?  She's in sales.  Sales ? That's terrific. That's good. What does she sell ?  Why do you want to know ?  Now just hear me out on this, okay ? I've known you a long time. I... I see some differences in you this week, like the tie, and, uh... I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't the difference, especially when I see her talking to David Morse. EDWARD (voice over) I introduced them at dinner the other night. PHILIP (voice over) So what ? Now they're best friends ?  I mean, this girl appears from out of nowhere. Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. That's a little convenient, don't you think ?  Don't be ridiculous.  Edward, how... how do you know that this girl... hasn't attached herself to you because she's bringing information back to Morse ? This happens ! Industrial espionage...  Phil, Phil, Phil ! Phil, listen to me.  What ?  She's not a spy. She is a hooker.  Oh !  She is a hooker. I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. In your car.  Oh, you are...  Yes, yes.  Oh, man !  You know, you're the only millionaire I ever heard of... who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you know ? SENATOR ADAMS (voice over) Edward !  I'm sorry I told you.  Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it.  Thank you. I hope the information I gave you was helpful. EDWARD (voice over) Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you for it.  There's no change, is there ?  No, it's still bogged down.  Having a nice time, Vivian ?  Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm ?  Yeah, Edward told me. But don't worry : you're secret is safe with me. Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get together sometime...  ...after Edward leaves.  We'll just have to do that, hmm ? ELIZABETH (voice over) Philip ! GWEN (voice over from the P.A.) Hi, tailgaters. I'd like to mention a couple of our silver sponsors... GWEN (voice over from the P.A.) ...Jacobs Distributors, Norrell Saddlery, and we'd like to give a great big thanks to our platinum sponsor... GWEN (voice over from the P.A.) Edward Lewis Enterprises. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) The ball is in for chukker number four.  You all right ?  Fine. That's good. Seven «fines» since we left the match.  Could I have another word, please ?  I think I liked «fine» better.  Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate.  I did not... I did not...  I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for saying or doing that. But he is my attorney. I've known him for ten years.  He thought you were some kind of an industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.  Look, you're not my toy, I know you're not my toy.  Vivian ! Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here !  I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker ! And you are my employee !  I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it. That's the end of it !  As if you had so many more appealing options.  Somehow, I find that very hard to believe.  Where are you going ?  I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us. It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you to go. Will you stay the week ?  I saw you talking to David Morse. I didn't like it.  I didn't like it.  Down ?  Yes.  Mm.  So then you chose this as your profession ?  You could be so much more.  I think you are a very bright, very special woman.  No, I don't want to talk to him now. Tell him I'll call him on Monday.  Yes, sir.  Where are you going ? Did he sign these ?  No, he said he had to leave.  He had to...  Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep.  Don't panic, Philip. Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be back here in the morning.  Did you send the tickets to the hotel ?  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  Where are you going ?  I have a date.  With the hooker ?  Be careful, Philip.  Mmm.  Something's missing.  Well, maybe something in this box. I don't want you to get too excited. This is only on loan.  I'm a very good customer.  Quarter of a million.  It's a surprise.  Thank you.  When you're not fidgeting, you look very beautiful... and very tall.  You're a dream coming true. I can't believe how I have...  ...fallen for you.  You are the one who's led me to the sun.  How could I know...  You don't want to go to San Francisco in a limousine, do you ?  ...I was lost without you.  And I want to tell you...  ...you control my brain.  And you should know that...  ...you are life in my veins. PILOT (voice over) Well, it should be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis. The weather is clear all the way up to San Francisco. We should be there in about fifty minutes.  No, it's all right. Opening night never starts on time.  Thank you.  Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir.  Doris.  How nice to see you. Nice to see you.  Sir.  Good evening, Edward.  Wonderful news. Congratulations.  It's all right. I've already seen it.  Because they're the best.  Is there anything else, sir ?  No, thank you.  The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.  Mm-hmmm.  No, no. That's okay It's all right.  You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.  The music's very powerful.  People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul.  She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.  Yes. Good-bye now.  Did you really do that ? Why don't we finish this tomorrow ? It's really late, and I have to work.  Me, not work ?  I do own the company.  What'd he say ?  He's taking the day off ?  I have money. I don't know what a snap dog is, but I have money.  Cop a what ?  All right, read the first two pages.  Okay... Mmm...  I was talking to someone.  Did you know that two of the Bach pieces that we heard tonight... were found by Felix Mendelssohn in a butcher's shop ? They were wrapping meat with the sheet music.  What's with you ? You're fidgeting. What's wrong ?  Absolutely.  Darryl !  You say this is a nice place. I'm sure it's a very nice place.  I'll block it with my body.  Fame makes a man who'll take things over. Fame Lets him loose and hard to swallow.  Fame puts you there where things are hollow.  Hey, Viv, you looking good, man. What'd you win, the lottery or what ?  Hi.  Fame, what you like is in the limo. Fame.  I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the middle of West Side Story.  I think you owe me some money, baby.  Why don't you go to school tomorrow ?  Now I hear you got yourself a new job ?  You ain't going no place.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...  You're out of your neighborhood, home boy. This ain't no Beverly Hills !  I don't believe this. He has this knife coming out of his skateboard. He's going to stab me.  What are you gonna do, you gonna strangle me with a Slinky ?  Shut up !  All right, okay, this is what's happening. You believe that this person owes you money, right, two hundred dollars ?  That's right.  Why ?  Because this is my block.  His block ?  Edward. So how's it feel to be a trick ?  I am not a trick. This is a trick.  Darryl ! Left pocket.  Isn't that incredible ? And he does have a permit. Thank you, gentlemen.  Don't you ever go near her again.  The fact that this will be our last night together, and you'll finally be rid of me.  My business is almost over, so I'll be going back to New York.  I'd really like to see you again.  Yes. Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you to have an apartment, to have a car...  ...to have a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck up to you anytime you want to go shopping. Everything's done.  Vivian, it really wouldn't be like that.  Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets.  What do you see happening between us ?  Yes. PHILIP (voice over on the phone) I had to call.  I just got off the phone with James Morse. Get this.  What about ? PHILIP (voice over on the phone) He wouldn't say.  Edward, I think we got him. His nuts are on the block. We got him !  No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to wait until this afternoon. Have Morse meet me downtown this morning. Good-bye.  I have to go now, but I want you to understand... I heard everything you said. This is all I'm capable of right now. It's a very big step for me.  I've never treated you like a prostitute.  It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian.  Could you come down to the front desk ? There's someone here who wants to speak to you. She says her name is Miss De Luca...  Let me talk to her. Let me... Let me just talk to her.  Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here ? The sphincter police won't let me through. Okay.  She's on her way.  Fine.  Mr. Thompson.  Yes.  The window washer is refusing to come down.  It's a Saturday. Wait here, please. (to Miss Wilson) Watch her. MISS WILSON (voice over) Yes, sir.  Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.  Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were looking for me.  I was hiding out from Carlos.  Hey, I was busy. I had a life, you know. Nino got beat up. We had to visit him in the hospital. Rachel got arrested. It was a mess. Anyway, I got the money.  Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.  You know, he was talking about you last night. He would bust something if he saw you in this outfit.  I was afraid to hug you up there. I might wrinkle you !  You look really good.  No, something with shade.  You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard looking like you do, not that you ever did.  Yeah. So, when does he leave ?  You get to keep the clothes ?  «Definitely no».  Oh, no.  I know this weepy look on your face.  You fell in love with him.  You've fallen in love with him ?  Did you kiss him ? On the mouth ?  You kissed him on the mouth ?  You fall in love with him, and you kiss him on the mouth. Did I not teach you anything ?  You like him ?  You definitely like him. Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich, classy guy.  Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that. Hey, he asked you, right ? Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a house together. Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I don't know.  Anyway, it could work. It happens.  Those were very specific cases of crackheads.  Name someone ?  You want me to give you a name or something.  Oh, God, the pressure of a name.  Cinder-fucking-rella.  Winner gets a piggy-back. Come on, saddle up, boy. THE FATHER (voice over) Oh, Zachary ! Too many doughnuts.  Mr. Morse, you said this morning you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis is now listening.  I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer... on one condition. I'm not so concerned about me, but the people who are working for me.  It's not a problem. They'll be taken care of. Well, then, gentlemen. If we could address ourselves to the contracts in front of you. If you look at...  Excuse me, Phil.  Gentlemen, I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone. Thank you.  All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Please wait outside.  You too, Phil.  What do you mean ?  I mean I would like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.  Why does he get to stay ?  Please, please.  I'll be right outside.  Good.  Is that better ?  It's all right.  Would you like a cup of coffee ?  Black.  Mr. Morse, my interests in your company have changed.  What is it you're after now, Mr. Lewis ?  Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart. But I don't want anyone else to, either. And it is still extremely vulnerable. So I find myself... in unfamiliar territory. I want to help you.  Why ?  Mr. Morse, I think we can do something very special with your company.  What about our Navy contracts ?  Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed. I... bluffed a little bit.  You're very good at it.  Thank you very much. It's my job.  I think we can leave the details up to the others.  I find this hard to say without sounding condescending, but... I'm proud of you.  Thank you. I think we can let in the other suits now.  Let's continue the meeting.  Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.  Edward, please, what was this all about ? Hmm ?  It's all yours, Phil. Finish it up.  Great big ships.  You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk. Just stay here for a while. I'll be back.  Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis.  Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.  No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me.  No, if Edward were with me...  When. Actually, when... Edward was with me, he didn't blow off billion dollar deals !  I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think. Mind if I have a drink ?  Well, I'll just wait.  You know...  You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you know ?  Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with you right now, Vivian.  Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am really pissed, you know ?  Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you, huh...  ...and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy, just like Edward.  Hey, hey ! Goddamn it !  Ow !  Come on ! Come on ! I'll pay for it.  How much is it ? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks ?  Fifty ? You a fifty dollars whore, Vivian ?  What are you doing ? Get off !  Stop. I don't want to hurt you ! Stop it !  I don't know how to tell you this. You already did, Edward !  All right, all right.  Out. Out of here.  Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn... Aah !  Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn !  I think you broke my nose.  Get out of here.  What is wrong with you ? Come on, Edward ! I gave you ten years ! I devoted my whole life to you !  That's bullshit. This is such bullshit ! It's the kill you love, not me ! I made you a very rich man doing exactly what you loved. Now get out of here !  Not all guys hit.  That was a business decision.  It felt good.  Yes, I noticed you're packed. Why are you leaving now ?  That's not why you're leaving.  I know about wanting more. I invented the concept. The question is how much more.  Impossible relationships.  My special gift is impossible relationships.  Thank you.  Me too.  Do you want me to get you a bellboy ?  I'll carry this.  Stay. Stay the night with me. And not because I'm paying you, but because you want to.  Good-bye.  Mmm.  I didn't do it, sir.  No, no. Now, I didn't say that. I want you to call maintenance and have them deal with this. You must delegate authority.  Yes, sir.  Miss Vivian.  Thank you.  Well, then, I gather you're not accompanying Mr. Lewis to New York.  Have you arranged for transportation ?  Allow me.  Darryl. DARRYL (voice over) Yes, sir.  Please take Miss Vivian anywhere she wishes to go.  Yes, sir.  It's been a pleasure knowing you. Come and visit us again sometime.  Lay a whisper On my pillow. Leave the winter On the ground.  I wake up lonely...  ...The stare of silence In the bedroom And all around. Touch me now.  I close my eyes And dream away.  It must have been love, But it's over now. It must have been good...  ...But I lost it somehow. It must have been love, But it's over now.  From the moment we touched, Till the time had run out.  Is that everything, sir ?  Yes. Yes, that's everything.  I'll meet you downstairs, sir.  Thank you.  We look so dopey.  San Francisco's not that great, you know.  It's bad climate. It's foggy. It's unpredictable.  What are you gonna do there ?  Yeah, I could see that about you. I could see that.  And leave all this ? Not in a million.  Whoa. Whoa. What is this ?  You do ? You think I got potential ?  Okay.  No, I can't, I can't. It's your favorite.  What time's your bus ?  Yeah, well, I gotta split, 'cause good-byes make me crazy. So, take care of you.  Mr. Lewis.  You don't have any messages for me, do you ?  No, I'm afraid not, sir.  I'll need a car to the airport also.  Of course. Darryl will take you wherever you need to go.  Darryl, the limousine out front, please ?  Yes, sir.  Thank you, Darryl.  One last thing.  Yes.  If you could possibly return this to Fred's for me, please.  Yes, of course. May I, sir ?  Of course, please.  It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.  You know, Darryl also drove Miss Vivian home yesterday.  I'll take care of it.  Thank you, Mr. Thompson.  I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than Vivian... because I've got this beauty course I'm looking into. I'm not gonna be there that much, you know ?  'Cause you can't... You just can't turn tricks forever. You gotta have a goal. Do you have a goal ? ANGEL (voice over) Well, I always wanted to be in the Ice Capades.  Help you, love ?  There you go. Thank you very much.  So, you got a lot of stuff you gotta move in ?  No, Carlos burned most of my stuff when I said I was moving out.  Vivian !  Vivian !  Had to be the top floor, right ? VIVIAN (voice over, from the top of the building) It's the best.  All right. I'm coming up.  So what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued her ?  Everybody comes here. This is Hollywood, the land of dreams.  Some dreams come true, some don't. But keep on dreaming. THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over) This is Hollywood. Always time to dream, so keep on dreaming.  Pretty woman, Walking down the street. Pretty woman, The kind I like to meet. Pretty woman, I don't believe you. You're not the truth. No one could look as good as you. Mercy. Pretty woman won't you pardon me. Pretty woman I couldn't help but see, Pretty woman, That you look lovely as can be. Are you lonely just like me. Oh, pretty woman.  You really took me by surprise. You're someone I've needed for a lifetime. Your heart was cleverly disguised, And it didn't look that way in my mind. Tell me how could it be. I was the last to know. Darling, I couldn't read what was in your mind, To turn around and love me, With no Explanation. I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would take it With sweet consideration. And after all that we've been through, I can't believe it's true Until I hear you say. Ooh ! I know now, now, now. Ah ! No explanation. I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would take it.
