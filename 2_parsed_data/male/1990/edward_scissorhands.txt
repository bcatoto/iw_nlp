Snuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there.  Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.  Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.  Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would  have to start with scissors.  Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once  there was even a man who had scissors for  hands.  Yes.  No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top  of the mountain?  Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in  that mansion. He made many things, I suppose.  He also created a man. He gave him inside, a  heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost  everything. You see, the inventor was very old.  He died before he got to finish the man he  invented. So the man was left by himself,  incomplete and all alone.  Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward.  You know, you didn't have to call me, ma'am.  You could have taken care of this by yourself.  Yeah, you see, it's easy. The food trap's  clogged. That's all. You see this bolt here?  You just unscrew this. OK? And out she pops.  And then you just take this and put it back in  here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it,  because it fits in there by itself. And then  you just screw this back on.  Don't go.  I'm not finished.  He didn't wake up.  Edward.  I'm-I'm sorry.  Are you ok?  Thank you.  Really?  I wouldn't care.  This must be quite a change for you, Ed.  Sure. So what have you been doing up there in  that big old place? I bet the view must be  spectacular, Ed.  See all the way to the ocean?  Sometimes.  Man, those things are cool. You know I bet  they're razor sharp. One karate chop to a guy's  neck...  Thank you.  Can I bring him to show and tell on Monday?  Hartely into the windup and the strike one  pitch. Swung on and missed strike two. If it's  a hit, the club has 12 hits. But they still  have 11 on the scoreboard and it's 3-1. 0 and 2  the count to Warren. Now they change it to 12  hits.  Turn it up, Kevin. I can't hear it. Kevin! No,  make it louder. Sports announcements on   Hartely's strike two pitch is hammered.  You hear that, Mr. Boggs?  No, make it louder.  Sports announcements on   It's going way back. It's gone. It's out of  here. It is history.  Dad, look!  Sports announcements on   A grand slam for Martinez to make it a five-run  inning and blow this game to pieces.  I'll be darned.  What's going on over there, Peg. Call me....Hi,  it's Margie. Who is he? Call me. Oh, by the  way, here it's pouring rain in the mountains.  You think the kids are okay?...Hi, there,  darling. The gals are all in a tizzy about your  secret visitor. You can't keep him a secret  forever.  Boy, it's just wonderful, Ed. My god, you, you  have the whole family in there, don't you?  Edward, come here.  No, no, no. That's a terrible idea, son. Go to  the garage and get the oil can. We don't want  him rusting up on this now, do we?  Yes, it is.  We are not sheep.  That's right. Go on. Get out of here. Run!  Don't worry about her, Edward. She's just an  old lonely loony. That's all.  Myself?  Hey, play scissors, paper, stone with us.  Play scissors what?  I got a doctor friend might be able to help  you. Aren't they most incredible?  Hi, Mike. How are you doing? Hello, Jack. Hey,  kid. Hey, Hi. George Morroe! Whoa! That's a  heck of handshake. Uh, Harry! Harry! I saw you  on the golf course. You got a dozen of the  melons...  Eddie.  The guys and I were talking, we'd like  want to invite you to our card game on Friday  night. Would you like that? Only thing is, you  can't cut.  I have my own infirmity. Never did me a bit of  harm. Took some shrapnel during the war and  ever since then I can't feel a thing. Not a  damn thing. Listen Don't you ever let anybody  tell you you have a handicap.  I did?  Okay, everybody. Grab your plates. Soup's on.  I thought it was shish kebab.  What?  I thought it was shish kebab.  Yeah, it, it is shish kebab. It was a figure of  speech, Ed. You got to learn not to take things  so literally.  Let us pretend we're in the drawing room, and  the hostess is serving tea "Now, many numerous  little questions confront us" "Should the man  rise" "When he accepts his cup of tea?" "May  lump sugar be taken with the things?"  Hmm, no.  Is it good form to accept a second cup? "Now,  should the napkin be entirely unfolded." Oh  should the center crease. Be allowed to remain?  It is so easy to commit embarrassing  blunders. "But etiquette humiliation and discomfort. Mmm yes, boring. Let us switch to,  Um... To some poetry, Hmm?" "There was an old  man from the cape." "Who made himself there,  but they keep such a beautiful shape." That's  right. Go ahead, smile. It's funny. That's  right.  Okay, guys, we're home. shh.  If my parents set the alarm, I'm screwed I'll  sleep in the yard... again.  Did you?  How else can I be the center of the attention?  You didn't call your parents.  See you later. Bye.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, Jim let's go.  It's all right. It's all right.  Go back to bed. It's only Edward. This way.  We'll have you a setup here in a minute. Up  with your feet. A queen-size bed here. How do  you like that? It's all made up and everything.  There you go. What's the matter? What's wrong?  She gets you nervous? You've been closed up in  a way in that castle too long.  You don't know  anything about the wonderful world of teen-age  girls. They're all crazy. Here some. Straighten  that out.  What is it?  Lemonade. I don't know what it is. They reach a  certain age. They develop these gland things.  Their bodies swell up. They go crazy.  Glands?  yeah, glands. I try not to think about it Good. Isn't it?  Lemonade?  One chop to guy's neck. And it's all over.  They're the sharpest things in the world. They  can hack through anything. And...  Kim!  He's calling you, Kim.  Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you.  Really?  I'll be darned.  Yeah, isn't that wonderful?  Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new  toys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four  heads.  No, they keep things pretty much locked up. My  father has his own room for his stuff to make  sure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he  won't help me buy my own car.  Well, he probably wants you to pay for it  yourself. I agree with him. It builds  character. You'll appreciate it more. Speaking  of money, I understand you are not charging for  gardening, Edward?  Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of  life with cookies. You can't buy car with  cookies. Am I right, Jim?  Ah, that's true, sir. You can't.  I'm sorry.  She had some ideas?  You got it?  No.  Well, we're stranded.   Ed, what a guy! Good job. Hey, you didn't break  it or scratch it or anything. Hey, be a pal and  yell when Peg pulls in, huh?  Quite a story, yes? Any questions for Edward?  Yeah, get way over. Stand right up.  The friends I've made.  Any other questions?  I'd like to meet him.  We'll give that name after the show. Thank you  very much. That's very nice. Anyone else? Yes,  stand right up.  Yes, I know.  I think he'd like that.  More questions? Stand right up.  There's an idea. Anyone else? Yeah.  Sure, he does. Right, Kim?  Knock it off, bubble- butt.  You did it.  So?  How about it? Is there some special lady in  your life?  Uh, everything's all right. He'll take a break  and we'll be right back after these messages.  It was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha!  I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left  nut to see that again.  Peg could sell cosmetics.  I like that one.  Veloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the  dash board.  Sorry I'm late.  So, Edward, did you have a productive day?  Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon is going  to be. You could have a cosmetic counter.  Great.  And then she showed me the back room where she  took all of her clothes off.  Edward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am.   I'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty  parlor, that's what's going to teach you  volumes. There's nothing like running your own  business. I've never done it myself, but from  what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a  working man can have. So I guess the bank is  going to be your next step, huh?  The bank?  Yeah, take out a loan. Get yourself started.  Nothing to worry about. With your talent and  reputation, it's going to be a snap. Now.  No credit, no record of jobs you've held, no  savings, no personal investment, no social  security number. You may as well not even  exist. There is no collateral.  We simply can't do it. Now get yourself a  social security card. Establish credit and buy  yourself a car. You have the side to advantage.  You can get one of those handicapped placards.  No problem. Park anywhere you like.  Look. My parents have insurance up the rear.  Okay? And all it will cost them is a little  hassle. That's about it. In a week my dad will  have new and better everything.  Look. There's a guy who will give us cash for  the stuff.  Well, do you want to ride around in a van like  Denny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever  we like? With a mattress in the back?  Because my father keeps the damn room locked,  and we need Edward to get us in.  Look, you don't understand, everything he  handcuffs or ties will do anything for you.  Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?  What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any  other way.  Look. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us  to have our own van?  Those go on automatically. They've gone for the  weekend. I told you. That's right.  This burglar scared.  Yes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on.  This person stole from you?  Keep your voice down. I told you he stole it.  Right? Come on. Let's go.  His parents will make him give it back.  Listen, I've already tried that. The guy's  parents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim  you'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come  on. Come on. Come on.  The bastard had it wired separately. Come on.  We know you're in there.  We're in the process of deactivating the system  so that you can come out.  No way!  I'm not going back there. Okay?  No, because my father will prosecute.  Especially his own son. If Edward tells, I'll  kill him.  No.  Put your hands high in the air so we can see  them. Put your hands up!  He's got something in his hands. Looks like  knives.  Drop your weapon I repeat. Drop your weapon.  I'll ask you one more time and this is your  last warning. Drop your weapon. If you fail to  do so, we'll have to open fire. Don't make us  do that, please. Drop your weapons. Drop them.  Now. Looks like we got a psycho. Prepare to  fire.   Alright, cuff him.  We'll have to hold him overnight for  observation.  Pick him up in the morning.  What in god's name was going through your mind,  son?  What were you going to do with that stuff?  Except trouble. And you're in a heap of that.  Will he be okay, Doc?  The years in spent isolation have not equipped  him with the tools necessary to judge right  from wrong. He's had no context. He's been  completely without guidance. Furthermore his  work, the garden sculptures, hair styles, and  so forth. Indicate that he's a highly  imaginative.  Character.  It seems clear that his awareness of what we  call reality is radically underdeveloped.  But will he be all right out there?  Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.  Listen. It could keep me up all night worrying  about you. Watch yourself.  What do you say in your defense?  Nothing.  You have to say something.  No comments? No remarks?  So were you set up? What was going through your  mind? One comment.  One comment.  You are welcome.  I know it was Jim's house.  Yes.  Because you asked me to.  What's the matter with you? When you are going  to stop? I did what I could. My old man think  he's retarded, otherwise he'd still be in jail.  What more do you want from me?  So could do. You were there, too.  But you did do it. I don't get why you give  such a shit anyway.  Well, we are going to try to help you find a  way to replace the drapes and the towels, but  our confidence in you, Edward, is not going to  be so easy to replace.  Okay, a little ethics. You are walking down the  street. You find a suitcase full of money.  There's nobody around. No human person is in  evidence. What do you do? A You keep the money. B You use it to buy gifts for your friends and  your loved ones. C You give it to the poor. D You turn it into the police.  I keep the money.  Edward?  You know we had a cool show-and-tell today.  This kid brought in a box of baby possums, 10.  maybe 12. Totally naked. No hair at all.  Thank you, dear. Edward, we are waiting.  Give it to my loved ones?  You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give  it to the police.  Good thinking, Kevin.  We're trying to make things easier for him, so  let's cut the comedy for a little while.  We're not talking nice. We're talking right and  wrong.  Again?  Hi, honey. honey.  Kevin, you want to play scissors-paper-stone?  No.  No, why?  It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.  I'll be outside.  Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out! Go.  Freak!  Edward, where are you going?  He tried to hurt you.  Are you nuts? I just saw him.  Are you serious? I'm going to lose you to that?  He isn't even human.  Well. I don't know. He just walked down the  street.  All in the house. I'll take care of it. I'll go  find him.  Hello, I'm here to see the man with the hands.  He's not here. Thank you.  I'm looking for the man with scissors.  All right, calm down, go on home. We'll handle.  Just go home.  Now I got up by the Wiggmans, but I didn't see  him anywhere.  Where's Kevin now?  Where do you think you're going, young lady?  No, you're staying here in case somebody shows  up!  Police!  Are you okay?  Where's everybody?  I can't.  I know it's a little early for Christmas,  Edward, but I have a present for you.  Forget holding her hand. Picture the damage he  could do other places.  Yeah, that's sick. I feel like I'm coming to  pass out, or puke or something.  Later, first take me to her house.  Come on, don't make me drive.  Just do it!  Jesus, maybe she was right about you.  Just drive.  Relax.  See you tomorrow. Call me, Right?  Have they caught him yet?  Who?  Him, that cripple. Let me know when they do.  Let us all you know, okay? Like a good boy.  Oh! Are you ok? oh! owh!  Help! Edward help!  I'm your friend.  Stop! Don't! Stop! Get away, now! Somebody help  us! Help!  What are you doing? Get away!   Get the police!  Somebody call the police! Hey  Somebody call the police! Aah!   Go on, run.  What happened? Did you get him? Ok, Is he dead?  It's all over, go on home. There's nothing more  to see. What happened out there? It's all over!  I want some answers. Where is he?  Get back here! I want to ask you something. Do  you see him? Wait! I want to ask you... He's in  that car. Look at that.  They are coming? Did I hurt Kevin?  I didn't.  Hey! I said stay away from her!  Goodbye!  Is he in there?  She never saw him again. Not after that night.  Because I was there.  No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would  rather want him remember me the way as I was.  I don't know. Not for sure. But I believe he  is. You see, before he came down here, it never  snowed. And afterwards it did. If he weren't up  there now, I don't think it would be snowing.  Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.
