Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like  that!  Haven't I told you I can't  stand it when you holler in the  morning. What. Uh-huh. What?! No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what  we have for dinner.  I may not even  make it home for dinner.  You know  how Fridays are. Well then, it's a good thing you're  not regional manager and I am. See ya. Good morning.  Why, yes, she is.  Is  this Thelma?  Oh, Thelma, when you  gonna run away with me? Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here  right now, but I'll probably be back  'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave  a message. Now what are a couple of Kewpie dolls  like you doin' in a place like this? Well, you come to the right place.   You like chili?  They got good chili. Hell, no.  I was just bein' friendly. You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause  if he is, then he and I got somethin'  in common. Aw, I understand.  I didn't mean to  bother ya.  It's just hard not to  notice two such pretty ladies as  yourselves. You better dance with me before you  leave, or I'll never forgive you. Oopsy-doopsy.  We need to get you  some fresh air, little lady. What's wrong? What for? How you feelin' now, darlin'? Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty  good to me, too. It's okay.  I'm married, too. You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I  won't hurt you.  It's okay. Louise is alright. Don't you hit me!  Don't you fucking  hit me! You just shut up. Shut up. Get lost. Now, calm down.  We were just havin'  a little fun. Bitch.  I should have gone ahead and  fucked her. I said suck my cock. Could you identify 'em, if ya saw  'em again? Well, you're not exactly an expert  witness, but what makes you so sure? Who do you think did it? Lena, just cut the bullshit, will  ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya?   I been standin' in this stupid parkin'  lot all goddamn night, and I still  got to go file a report before I can  go home in time to get back up again! You didn't happen to notice what  kind of car they were driving? Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might  have to call you in for some more  questioning. What's that? Blood? Whose? His, I guess... You guess? Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here  right now... Hello!  I'm here.  Hang on a minute! Louise!  Where are you?  Are you  alright?  Honey... Louise, honey... Where are you?  You  sound funny. Are you in town?  This sounds long  distance. Louise, just tell me what the hell  is going on here!  I come back, nobody  knows where you are.  Is Thelma with  you?  Darryl's been callin' here  every half-hour sayin' he's gonna  kill you both when you get back,  he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her  if she is. Where'd y'all go? Yes, yes, darlin'.  I can help you.   Tell me where you are. What the fuck is going on? Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't  I bring it to you?  For God's sake,  baby, please, just tell me what's  happened, what could possibly be so  bad? Christ, sure... yes! You're in Oklahoma?! Louise, let me call you back after I  wire it, so you'll know which office  to go to. No, for that much money I have to  tell them exactly which office.  I  know, I've had to have money wired  to me on the road.  And there has to  be a code word or they won't give it  to you.  I'll have to tell you the  code. Call me back. I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I  love you, okay? All we know is there were two women  in a green T-Bird convertible that  turned left out of the parking lot,  going real fast.  We're trying to  get a make on the car, but nothin'  yet.  So far, we got nothin'. Well, you'd best get something.   Even if they didn't do it, it times  out that they most likely witnessed  it.  I want somebody to at least  talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a  description and see what we get back. Alright. Is there any reason to believe they've  left the state? That's certainly possible. Why don't we go ahead and let the  bureau in on this. I have no problem with that. Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que. 'Round the side, by the restrooms. Louise! I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed  you.  I almost couldn't get a check  cashed.  It's Saturday. Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie  Randall.  You'd know him if you saw  him.  His brother was in your class.   Terry. No, honey.  I told him I was buyin'  a car.  What is it for? It's a place called Shaw's Siesta  Motel.  The address is 1921 North  East 23.  It's under your name. Peaches. That's the code word.  I miss you,  peaches. Louise? Ma'am, are you sure you wouldn't  rather have the large economy size? Goddamnit, Thelma, where in the Sam  Hill are you?! What in the hell do you think you're  doing?  Have you lost your goddamn  mind?!  Is that it?  I leave for  work and you take complete leave of  your senses? Hold on.  Hold on a minute, damnit. No you won't.  You'll be back today.   Now!  You get your ass back here,  Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do  you understand me? That does it!  That Louise is nothin'  but a bad influence.  If you're not  back here tonight, Goddamnit,  Thelma... well, I just don't wanna  say... Thelma? What? Whoa!  Excuse me!  Miss, are you  alright? Is there anything I can do? Would you mind me asking which  direction you and your friend are  going?  I'm trying to get back to  school and my ride fell through, so  I'm kinda stuck.  Are you going my  way? Do you think you could... I mean, I  could help pay for gas. Well.  Maybe we better not ask her.   But thank you anyway. Y'all have a nice day.  Drive safe. You cheer up now! What?! What?!! The prints on the trunk of the car  match those of Thelma Dickinson. Well I'll be damned.  Isn't that  strange. And the husband says a gun is missing.   She took a lot of stuff.  It looks  like she maybe planned on being gone  a while.  The strange thing is, her  husband said she would never touch  that gun.  He got it for her 'cause  he's out late a lot, but he said  she'd never touch it, wouldn't learn  to shoot it, just left it in a drawer  for years. What kind of gun was it? A .38. Right.  Where are they? We're lookin'.  They were on their  way to some guy's cabin and they  never showed up.  We're lookin'.  We  hope you're lookin' too. Did you say Peaches?!  Why that's  the secret word!  Show her what she's  won, Don. Hey, peaches. Can we get another room?  Just put  it on my credit card. Ask me no questions, I'll tell you  no lies. Who's your friend? Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.   You can go on in and take a nice  cold shower. I always knew that. Okay, honey.  I don't want to rush  you.  I just wanna talk to you and... ...be alone with you.  I'll just be  in my room, 115, you just come on  down when you're ready. I'll be waiting. Who is it? Now, my little coconut, what seems  to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy  everything. Okay, okay, just tell me what's the  trouble. Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask  you one thing? Does it have something to do with  another guy?  Are you in love with  him? Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!   Where the fuck are you going?  Are  you just leaving for fucking ever?   What, did you fuckin' murder somebody  or what?! Alright, alright.  I'm sorry. Can I just ask you one other thing? Will you wear this? Will you at least see how it fits? You didn't see that one comin', did  ya? So whaddya think.  I mean... I  could... uh... get a job.  Of some  kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me  that for years, right? 'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to  lose you.  And for some reason I get  the feelin' you're about to split.   Permanently. I'm the one... I never made it work.   I just... It's not that I don't love  you.  It's not that.  I just never  thought I'd be thirty-six years old  and I never thought... I don't know  what I thought.  What do you want,  darlin'.  What do you want me to do. Are you just doin' this to punish  me? It does look good. Louise?  I think you are so damn  beautiful.  I mean that.  I always  have. Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I  never found you.  I'll say anything  you want.  We'll find a way to get  you out of this, whatever it is. I'm choking on it. Honey?  Ummm... Do you want me to  come with you? You keep this! Are you happy, Louise?  I just want  you to be happy. Honey? Do you think you could ever shoot  someone? Do you think you could ever think of  a set of circumstances that would  just cause you to haul off and shoot  someone? Why? I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a  stranger? On what? Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't  know why I'm even asking you this.   It's just... we can't place anybody  at the scene but these two gals that  everybody swears is sweet as pie.  I  don't know.  I keep hearing words --  impossible -- inconceivable.  If  just one person would say... That's what everybody says.  Only  problem is nobody's husband was  unaccounted for that night... Could  you shoot Eddie in the face?  At  point blank range? I gotta go to Little Rock. As you know, we've tapped your phone.   In the event that she calls in. We're going to leave someone here at  the house in the event that she calls  in.  Someone will be here until we  find them. The important thing is not to let on  that you know anything.  We want to  try and find out where they are.   Now I don't want to get too personal,  but do you have a good relationship  with your wife?  Are you close with  her? Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I'm about as  close as I can be with a nut case  like that. Well, if she calls, just be gentle.   Like you're happy to hear from her.   You know, like you really miss her.   Women love that shit. Jesus Christ. Good God. My Lord. I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me  one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try  to find that kid that was with 'em. Tell us about him. Just some young guy.  Around twenty  years old.  Dark hair. They said they'd picked him up along  the way.  He was a student.  But he  didn't look right.  But he left when  they got to the motel. Do you understand that you may be  facing an accessory charge? This is serious, son.  A man is dead. I know!  I'd tell you if I knew!   Goddamn!  I know something happened,  or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying  to remember everything!  Find that  fucking kid.  He probably knows  something. Is this the guy you saw them with? It's him. Oh, happy day. You gotta be kiddin' me.  They picked  up a murderer?! Armed robber. Oh, great. They're flying him here right now.   He was picked up this morning for  parole violation.  They also found  about six grand on him, so he probably  knocked over something while he was  out there.  They can drop him by  here for questioning.  I'm so happy. How much cash did he have? Hey!  Hey! That's Thelma Dickinson's husband. Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight  better 'n you right now. Where did you get $6600.00 in cash? We spoke with a gentlemen today who  says he personally delivered very  close to that same amount to a Miss  Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too? He said he took it to a motel in  Oklahoma City.  He also says that at  that time he met a man.  He identified  you through a series of mug shots.   He also told us that you and Mrs.  Dickinson seemed "close." Is that  true? Did you know that Mrs. Dickinson and  Miss Sawyer are wanted in connection  with a murder? Did either of them ever indicate  that they might be running from the  Law? You know what?  You're starting to  irritate me. Yeah.  Me too. Do you mind if I have a word with  him alone for a minute. Son, I gotta feelin' about somethin'  and I just wanna ask your opinion.   Do you think Thelma Dickinson would  have committed armed robbery if you  hadn't taken all their money? Cat got your tongue? There's two girls out there that had  a chance, they had a chance...!  And  you blew it for 'em.  Now they've  gotten in some serious trouble, some  very serious trouble and for at least  part of it, I'm gonna hold you  personally responsible for anything  that happens to them.  I've got no  feelin' for you.  But I may be the  only person in the world who gives a  rat's ass what happens to them and  you're either gonna tell me every  damn thing you know, so there's a  small chance I can actually do them  some good, or I'm gonna be all over  you like a fly on shit for the rest  of your natural life.  Your misery  is gonna be my goddamn mission in  life.  That's a sincere promise. Now, for one thing, you violated  your parole two days out.  And you  know Judge Hainey.  He hates this  sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of  this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And  then when he finds out that you're a  possible accessory to murder and  armed robbery, well, I think we can  safely place your ass back in the  slammer for at least the remaining  eight, don't you? Oh, definitely. Mr. Dickinson, if you'll just hang  on, I want a word with you and then  we'll take you home. Come back here, you little shit! Hello. Thelma!  Hello! Shit. What?!  All I said was hello. Uh, no!  No, why would any police be  here?  Hey, where are you girls,  anyway? What are you talking about, Louise? Hello, Miss Sawyer.  I'm Hal Slocumbe,  Chief Investigator, Homicide, Arkansas  State Police.  How are you? You girls are in some hot water. You're both okay?  Neither one of  you hurt?  You're bein' careful with  that gun? Good.  You wanna tell me what  happened? I just want you to know, neither one  of you are charged with murder yet.   You're still just wanted for  questioning.  Although, now, Mrs.   Dickinson's wanted in Oklahoma for  armed robbery. Miss Sawyer, I don't think y'all are  gonna make it to Mexico.  We should  talk.  Please.  I wanna to help you. Turn off your engine. It's just not working like this.  We  gotta do something.  It'd be one  thing if these girls were hardened  criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is  makin' us look bad.  I don't know...  maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe  that little creep lied. He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.   Nothin' at all.  He already got all  their money.  I just don't know what  we're dealin' with here.  Anyway, it  went out again last night on  Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just  wait it out a little longer.  She  said she was gonna call back.  Let's  just sit tight. We don't have a whole lotta choice,  do we?  I can't figure out if they're  real smart or just really, really  lucky. It don't matter.  Brains will only  get you so far and luck always runs  out. Hello. She wants to talk to you. Hello, Louise. How are things goin' out there? You're still with us though.  You're  somewhere on the face of the earth? I swear.  Louise, I almost feel like  I know you. You're gettin' in deeper every moment  you're gone. I do believe you.  That's what I  want everybody to believe.  Trouble  is, it doesn't look like an accident  and you're not here to tell me about  it... I need you to help me here. Did Harlan Puckett... You want to come on in? Then I'm sorry.  We're gonna have to  charge you with murder.  Now, do you  want to come out of this alive? Louise, I'll do anything.  I know  what's makin' you run.  I know what  happened to you in Texas. Max.  You gotta take me there!  I'm...  I'm the only one she's ever talked  to.  I don't want anybody losin'  their heads.  You know what happens.   The volume gets turned way up and  the next thing you know those girls  are gonna get shot. Okay, Hal, okay. Hi there!  You alright? Grrrreat! Fresno. Yeah.  I been seein' you, too. What?  What are you talkin' about? You women are crazy! I'm not apologizing for shit! Fuck that. Oh, Jesus! Yeah... sure did. Fuck you. Oh goddamn!!  You bitch!! You fucking bitch!  Aaaaaaarrrgghh!!!   You're gonna have to pay for that!!!   I'm gonna make you pay for that!!   You hear me??!! ...Abducted... shot up the car...  stole the officer's weapon...  tanker... blown up... terrorized... You're not even going to believe  this. ...requesting assistance.  In pursuit  of a green T-Bird, 1966 license,  seven, one, nine, William, Zebra,  Adam... Roger.  Be advised... ...armed and extremely dangerous... Hey!  Don't let them shoot those  girls.  This is too much.  They got  guns pointed at 'em! The women are armed, Hal.  This is  standard.  Now you stay calm here.   These boys know what they're doin'. This is the Arizona Highway Patrol.   You are under arrest.  You are  considered armed and dangerous.  Any  failure to obey any command will be  considered an act of aggression  against us. ...heard they shot a cop. No shit. With his own gun.  Put him in the  trunk and blew him away... Turn off the engine and place your  hands in the air! Max!  Let me talk to 'em!  I can't  believe this!  You've gotta do  something here! I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're  real busy right now, but how many  times, Max?  How many times has that  woman gotta be fucked over?  You  could lift one finger and save her  ass and you won't even do that? Get a hold of yourself!  You are way  out of your jurisdiction, now come  on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry  I let you come! Shit!  I can't fucking believe this! Hey.  Hey! What in the hell?! I've been around, I've seem some  things, People movin' faster than  the speed of sound, faster than a  speedin' bullet.  People livin' like  Superman, all day and all night.  I  won't say if it's wrong or I won't  say if it's right.  I'm pretty fast  myself.  But I do have some advice  to pass along, right here in the  words to this song... Better not look down, if you wanna  keep on flyin'.  Put the hammer down,  keep it full speed ahead.  Better  not look back or you might just wind  up cryin'.  You can keep it movin'  if you don't look down...
