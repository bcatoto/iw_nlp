He's right on the heading. He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole! Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner. Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind. Yes, Captain?Here. How ya doing, honey? What is it? What did you think of 'Great Expectations?' Yeah, I think he is. Hey, Fred!...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs. ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court. I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense. You are Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets! Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner. Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather. You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet. Did you decide on a runway yet? And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years. I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone? That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.' You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean. I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage. But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married? After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business. No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation. Were you vacationing in Los Angeles? Thank you. Cream? I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night. We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner. Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner. I'm an airline pilot. Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies. I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence? I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot. All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock. Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence? We have clearance, Clarence. Huh? Huh? Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.What is it, Doctor? What's happening? No, I mean we can't land for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago! Well...not for another two hours. I can't tell. Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can. Airsick? Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight. Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to. Hello. No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here. No, why don't you take care ot it? Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor? Roger. Roger. Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.Okay, this is one of my favorites. I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song. I'm Randy. Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly. Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner? Yes? Would either of you like another cup of coffee? Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up. There's a little girl on board who's ill and... Excuse me, Sister? Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready. Would you go up, please? It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes? Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering... Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner? Do you feel all right, sir? Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.Good-bye, darling. Good-bye, darling. So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself. Good-bye, darling. You promise you'll write.Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land. George Zipp said that? Surely there must be something you can do. Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing? Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down? Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights. Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying... all together !!! Surely you can't be serious. Both pilots! See them, Elaine? Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land. Yes? I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before. Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan. Rats! I've lost number three. It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts. Sluggish. Like a wet sponge. And a little ice. That's what I've been trying to tell these people. A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp. I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball! That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman. I wish I could say the same for George Zipp. Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid. Headquarters!? What is it? That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine. Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember? I love you, Elaine. My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission. Elaine, I've got to talk to you. But if you'll just give me... You expect me to believe that? You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record. Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change. Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over. Don't you feel anything for me at all any more? I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out. I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you. Elaine! Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here. Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it. The cockpit? What is it? No. No thank you. Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time. Thank you.Like this. Our man is sick. Come right away. I found it. Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir. Don't! What are you going to do? He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die. Aw, Bytes, he's sick.Shut up! I'll show you! I'll show you! If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh. He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop! You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you! Right... Right. I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities! I want him back! You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back. He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood! Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal! DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain! Never mind that, I want my man! I want my man back. I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I? Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen. That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die. Head's too heavy. He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going. He fell. He falls. He was fine when he left here, and now look at him. What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!Steady on, Treves. Have a seat. Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post. Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time. Well, it's up to us then, isn't it? Don't we? Of course they will. They're reasonable men. Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities. No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick? You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick. No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can. Can you imagine what his life has been like? Treves. Well done. I don't understand. I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day. It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words. Oh yes? Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them. He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about? Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend? Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance. Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon? Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry. No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee. I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are. A few words? I thought he was imbecile? Good! How is the patient? Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital? I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him. Oh, is he a friend of yours? What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point. Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable? Why isn't he in the General Ward, then? A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious? Indeed! Don't be mad. This muck can kill you. You've acquired a taste for this? Good morning, Treves. I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day. It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick. What is it, Treves? Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day. Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview? Are you comfortable here? I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis? How are you feeling today?You never mentioned his mental state. Nothing of any importance, eh? Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there. Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there? I say Freddie, what are you about? What a mess. Three quarters of an hour.I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits? An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel. O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate? Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?Oh no... no... you're a Romeo. Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all... Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. Have you read it? That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you... It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance. Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial. You've never been? Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there. She's very pretty, your mother. I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone. I knew you'd understand. Here. I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward. Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite... Is he... dying then? How awful for John. Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead. It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box. Good day, Mr. Merrick.If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good. She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her. Oh, yes. They have noble faces. How lovely. Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room. Two, please. Yes please, two. I am very pleased to meet you. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil... ...everyone has been very kind. ...I... everyone has been very kind to me. Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful. I feel much better. Thank you. I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you? Oh no? O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? No, but I certainly shall. Romance! Tell me about it, please! Alas, no. Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful? Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there? Yes. Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother. Oh, no. Good day...! Oh, yes. Oh no, my friend... Yes. You're English. y-y-yes-- I'll have to find some more. ...I learned a long time ago. The main spire. I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away. Thank you... very much. Yes. Good morning. No, nothing. Thank you very much. Yes. You too, my friend. Goodnight. Then I shouldn't change anything? Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see? Oh yes! It was wonderful! Yes, very soon. Oh no, I couldn't. Mr. Treves! Treves. Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends. Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves. My home. Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness. You did this for me? ...my... home? You don't think it's too gaudy, do you? Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you. Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her! I thought as much. ...Can you cure me? Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time... When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die? Good morning. Here. Would you... would you like to see my mother? Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice. The Children. Where are your children The children! May I see? Who are they of? I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses? It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself. Ohhh... Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed? I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman. Thank you very much. How long will I stay here? The hospital? This... is my new home? Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you? Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me. You did not ask me. But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you. Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to. Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you. Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you! Righteousness for his namesake. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness... Hello, my name is John Merrick. Hello... my name is... John Merrick. Mmmerrick. Mmmerrick. Merrick... John... Merrick My... name is... Hello... Yes. Yes! Yyess. ...Yyes Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money. When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound. Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all. I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there. Never mind. I'm the owner. Handsomely?... Who sent you? I don't think so. No sir, we're closed. And who might you be, sir?You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction. Say hello to London for me. I miss her. I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had. Won't be a moment. Of course! You want out? Want to come out? You alright?...Am I a good man or am I a bad man? But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous? That I am very little different from him. Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said. Hmmm? You stay with me. Yes. John loves the house. I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm... I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know. And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity? I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind? He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself? Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me. I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom. No, I think a whiskey. Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed? I'll join you shortly. I'll get my bag. What is it? Did you see it? Yes? Now I think we really do understand one another. So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you! You don't own this man! All you do is profit from another man's misery! I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that. You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what... He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation. Just a moment, how did you get in here? Everything will be seen to. You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab. This man belongs in hospital. Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest. He must have taken quite a fall. What happened? I intend to. What do you mean? Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to... Please do. But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen. Has the response picked up? No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him. Do you think they'll go along with us? Well, yes. I could easily arrange... Yes, I think I can. Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness. Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm? How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it. Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him. And what was that, John? Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly. ...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous. It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear. ...Yes, Sir. Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir. Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then? Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee. I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met. Well sir, perhaps I should explain... He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules. Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning. Yes sir, I'll look into that. Would you like to meet him sir? No, more of an acquaintance. Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional. Yes sir. Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking. No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten. Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you. It's quite nutritious, sir. Good morning, sir. He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot... I pray God he's an idiot. I don't know what I've got. You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself. Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance. Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them. Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this. How long has this man been here? Yes. Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do. And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain. I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain. I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited. John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick. Goodnight John. Sleep well. No, no, I wouldn't change a thing. No, John, not one that I can see. Yes John? I'm glad, John. Goodnight. Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening. Will the cathedral be finished soon, John? It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you. Stand up, John. Let them see you. John.... how can you ever forgive me? Are you sure? Because I can take it back. Is it the one you wanted? There is one more thing, John. Here. Yes. Yes, John. You want a dressing bag, John? Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have? How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you? The cathedral is coming along nicely. No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you. Yes, John? Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die. John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright? Good morning, John. Your mother? Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends. Of course. Oh, our relatives... the children. Oh yes. Not at all, John. How is your tea, John? That's a canopy, John. John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset? When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best. You look splendid, John. I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think? Of course! What did you think? Yes. Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular. Good evening. How are you feeling? We do have a lot to talk about, don't we? I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me? Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read? ...Yes potatoes... but... Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John? John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm. Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say... Righteousness... Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself? Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ... Say "Mmmerrick." Say "Mmmerrick." Say "Merrick". John Merrick. My name is... Excellent! Now, say... "Hello" Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? That's much better. I could understand that "yes". Yyyess. Yes John! So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here. John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree. You don't think it's too gaudy, do you. Yes. John wants it. A dressing bag. Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office. You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me. Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived. Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital... Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue. Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening. I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity. I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now. That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead? We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him. He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man. No, he's very upset about something. Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning. Yes! The workhouse! Yes... Yes, let's go in. Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him... Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance. Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today? YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED! YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE? HE'S GONE! Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him? WHERE IS MR. MERRICK? I'll send a cab. Here is my card. So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...? Pardon me? I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor? Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it. Are you the proprietor?I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in. They wanna talk to you. We're from... Let's go, Jake, wake up!Ok, champ. Just come by to wish you luck. Need anything? You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok? Hey champ! Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head! He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him. Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment. What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast? Aside from everything else, your family all right? All right, you guys, shake hands. All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?What? I want to believe you, LaMotta. Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank. You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog. I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.For what? About what? I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place. Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up? No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy. I'm Ok. Tommy, thanks for coming over. You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here... 'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody. I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money? Believe what you want. I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter. What who's been sayin'? What's up, Colonel? And where you goin'? What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business. No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch. It looks done. I'll take it the way it is. This looks done. Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around? Yeah, I really cleaned up on him. You're a good sport, lady. J.R., glad you could make it. Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it? You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie? Did you ever fuck my wife? I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met. Did you ever fuck my wife? Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody. But you said "you." What do you mean, "you"? What do you mean, "you"? You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody... When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'. Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth. Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time. You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'... Did Salvy fuck Vickie? Well, I heard some things. Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie? Didn't it have nothin' to do with me? Why didn't you tell me about it? You know, when you gave him a beatin'. Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town? How's that? Well, that's what I mean. Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth. Where you been? What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat! I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in. Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know... Yeah, except fall down. That's right. What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything. C'mon, Joey. Yeah, I know. What did Tommy say? I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand? When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth. What do you mean? I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her... Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here. Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her. Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass. Say what you're gonna say. Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager! I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place. No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go. I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno... Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand. I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title. Do you see her yet? How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough. Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife. I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know. Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now. You know, like bang her or anything? You wasn't with her? You wasn't with her, were you? Yeah, she's nice. What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one... She ever go with them? Like Salvy? 'Cause I wanna catch her alone. Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right... How do you know? You know her that good? Go 'head. Yeah -- Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you? Who's that? Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again. And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot. Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood. Answer me when I talk to you. See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody. Go ahead. Harder. Take the towel off. Here's your glove. Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw. You heard me, I said hit me. Hit me in the face. Yeah. Do me a favor. I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know... I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter. Nothing... Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me. Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie. It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight. I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight. I tell you what. You hit me here. Sugar Ray hits me here. I can't tell the difference. I just fight. You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight... Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now. Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about. I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad. He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down. Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title. Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice. How many pounds I gotta lose? At night? What time is it? Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it? What friends? Don't make no difference no more. Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ. I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped. I promise I just gotta pick up one thing. No. Open the door. Vickie, open up. I need to come in. Aw, c'mon, Vick -- Aw, c'mon. Don't say that. Open the door, Vickie. Sure, what else is new? I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club. Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number. I dunno. I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here. Then what? What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say? OK. Talk. What? I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out. Yeah -- You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you. Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch! You did? You're a fuckin' liar. Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy? Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt! Who've you been fuckin'? With Salvy, eh? Do I have to kill you, eh? Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer? I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it. What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here. Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night? Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away? What was it about? What'd you see? What'd you see? I called. You weren't there. Where you been all day? What's that kissing on the mouth shit? Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help. Don't ever do that again. You don't do it! You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight. You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do. Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that. You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want. You sure you're not thinking of him right now? That he's got a pretty face. Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro? Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you? Huh? You asleep? Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep? Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him? In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right? You're not interested in him? Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him? What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him? Who asked you? Who asked you? Who asked you? What do you mean, "good looking?" Now, touch me... ...here. Now take your panties off. Go 'head. Do it. Now take the rest off. Do what I say. Take off my pants. Come here. If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here. Come over here. It's OK. That's all right. He don't mind. No. Can you see it? Just give it a nice little tap. Just keep your eye on the ball. That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel? You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you. Oh no? I thought you was a movie star. I ain't ever talked to a movie star before. Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride? You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for? Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me? I'd tell you to bet a bundle. Yeah, the weight's Ok. He should. Never felt better. C'mon, Tommy -- Hi, Tommy. How are you?Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own. How can he embarrass you? Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that. Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy. Yeah, I understand, Tommy. Stop it. What're you, crazy? I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy. Whatsa matter with you? Whadda ya mean? What? You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month. So what? I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head. What? So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about. Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now. What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me? Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like. I did keep an eye... What? Whatever you touched, that's good now. Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it. No, I just told you what happened. It didn't have nothin' to do with you. Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about. When? I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way. Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth. What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law? Screw you, Jack. So eat just a little. You gotta eat something. I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak. We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die. All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait. Except fall down like a normal person. See? That's all there was to it. G'wan, do it. Protect yourself, rummy. Stick out your hands, Jake. I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is... Sure, I'll keep an eye on her. Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you. Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter. Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to. Whatcha doin'? Excuse me for a minute. Be right back. C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you. Nah, she would never... This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right? You want the title shot or not? You want the title shot? Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat? You want us to wait for you? You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong. They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why. He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight... Give me a chance. Let me look. No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take. C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight. I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything. Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what? With her? How? Huh? Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you. Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him. Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old. How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something. I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that. You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass. Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here. No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her? Whadda you care? I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como... What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here... Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I... What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove? Jack! Enough! Jack, I got no gloves. C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks. You want me to do what? Sure. What is it? You know? That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy. What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight. Hey, c'mon, what's the matter? What's wrong? I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you. What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife. Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law. I said, let's go. Right, the gym. All right, I'll try. See you later. I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody. Hey, leave the kids alone. What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother. Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there, take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash. And you're drinking with them right now. Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long. I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want. It don't look right. No, you're his wife. What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta? You sound bitter. Does that mean... You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time? Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate. Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young? Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand. Excuse me for living. Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink? Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget. Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody! Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that. Get lost. Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat." He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that? Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me? How's the weight? Ok? This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid. Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh? How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good? Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you. Jake, sit down for a minute.Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points. I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break. Three more, I figure. Yeah. At night. Nine o'clock. It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out. Don't fight anymore! It's a free country, don't fight anymore!That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork. You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today? By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.What--special autopsy? Did I? Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something] Just before she died she came to-- Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh Papers--they all want me to sign papers. No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me-- I don't know--I can't tell-- You--a friend to me? Maybe you want my money, too. No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money. I don't know, [I tell you]. No-Why didn't you notify the police? Maybe you're right. That sounds to me very remarkable.Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.] You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it? That's it. You get it quick. Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business. Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats. Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard. He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;? Did she talk? Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious? Take him to the psychopathic hospital. Dr. Meirschultz, too? Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz. Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later. Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what? No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money. Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you. What made you steal? Are you hungry? Who are you? What is your name? By the way--did you hear a shot last night? But where do the rats come in? Oh, I see. Cats' fur. What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]? Thousands? [Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats? I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint. Come on, we're wasting time. Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this? Take me down there. What's that? Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it? I'd like to have a look. What's down there? Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru. Do you have many patients, doctor? Oh, yes, he's in good hands now. So--that's it. Buckley took the body. Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body? How do you do. By the way, where is your assistant? I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help. Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger. Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise. [Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose. Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly. That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight. I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased. You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives. Indeed, he has often told me. No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important. Did you wish to see someone? Oh, I'm crazy, am I? Let me tell you something. Those women have--the gleam-- It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out. Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument. Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him. You here again? Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion. Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology. Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea. Yes indeed. He has been a difficult case. Now that you have him in custody--you have him haven't you? Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him. Well, news of Buckley? Oh, Maxwell? He's left. You found Buckley? Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed. [Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy. She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.] You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me. Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea! No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious-- What are you going to do? He isn't here.Yes, Dad. Yes, Dad. No, Dad. You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you? Dad? I guess so. Do you like this hotel? Dad? Then why don't you go to sleep? Do you feel bad? I am, Dad. Dad? Yes, Dad. Okay. Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine? You mean they ate each other up? What was the Donner party? I'm hungry. Dad? Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237? You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha? What about Room 237? Is there something bad here? Maybe he showed me something. I don't know. Yes. It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything. Yes. Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth. Tony. I'm not supposed to. Chocolate. Yeah. French Fries and Ketchup. No. Mommy! Mommy... Mommy...! Mommy... Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Okay, Mom. I won't, Mom. I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe. I won't make any noise. Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine? Mom? No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay...oh! All right. Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V. Okay, Mom. Okay. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here. Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter? Do I have to? To my stomach. Because he hides. No. No. It's the little boy that lives in my mouth. Talking to Tony. Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.' Yes. No.Yes, I'd like you to. Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day. Okay? Does Tony ever tell you to do things? Where does he go? Why not? if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony? Oh, Is Tony one of your animals? Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth? What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth? Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth? Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange? How did he manage to do that? What sort of injury did he have? Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here? Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...? Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance? Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained. They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again. Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about. I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny. Thank you. Yes.You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance? I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance. I fear that is the only thing to do. Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you. Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance. It's Grady, Mr. Torrance. Delbert Grady. Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more. Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will. A nigger cook. A nigger. He is, Mr. Torrance. Oh, they're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir. Yes, sir. I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir. Why no, sir. I don't believe so. Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir. Why no, sir. I don't believe so. That's right, sir. Yes, sir. Won't keep you a moment, sir. That doesn't matter, sir. You're the important one. Yes sir. Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh... I'm afraid it's advocaat sir. It tends to stain.Nothing. There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out! You understand, stay out! No I ain't. Room 237? Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good. Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind. Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast. No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't. I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining. Try to think what it was. Now think real hard, Doc. Think. Do they know he tell you things? Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony? How does he tell you things? Is Tony the one that tells you things? Who's Tony? Who says you ain't supposed to? Why don't you want to talk about it? Chocolate it shall be. Come on son. Do you like ice cream, Doc? You don't? Well what's your favorite food then? Now this is where we keep all of out meat. You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers. You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc? Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel. Thank you very much. I'll do that. Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there, Hallo. My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel. No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream. It will be a pleasure. Right this way Mrs. Torrance. Oh, that's just great. How do you folks like our hotel so far? Sure. Good. Well I guess I probably heard you call him that. I did? Beg pardon? Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice. Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch. Yeah, this is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you? Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest. Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred. Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie? Glad to meet you, Winifred.Good. I love you, Danny. I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh? Are you sure? Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you? What do you mean? What? Good. I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever. Yes I do. I love it. Don't you? Yes? I can't. I have too much to do. No. I'm just a little tired. Yes. Good. I want you to have a good time. Are you having a good time? How's it going, Doc? Come here for a minute, first. They had to, in order to survive. There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive. I think that was farther west in the Sierras. Well you should have eaten your breakfast. Yes? There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady. For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment. Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady. That's all I ask. No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here. Grady... oh. She eh... interferes. Well, he is a very willful boy. How? A nigger! Who? No. And, er... where are they now? Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here? haven't I seen you somewhere before? Delbert Grady. Grady? Fine. Awfully nice of you to say. Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree. Advocaat is it? Well, I'm looking for a change. I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet. Eh - formerly a school-teacher. Pleasure to meet you. Bill, how do you do? I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd. No charge? It's good to be back, Lloyd. Hi Lloyd. I've been away. Now I'm back. Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd. Thanks. Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better. Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter. That's swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you. You were always the best of them. How's my credit in this joint anyway? Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet. I was afraid they were going to be there until next April. So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice. You can do that, can't you, Lloyd? You're not to busy, are you? Wendy... Wendy... Give me the bat. Give me the bat. Wendy... Give me the bat. Stop swinging the bat. Give me the bat. Give me the bat. Wendy give me the bat. Put the bat down, Wendy. Stop swinging the bat. I'm not going to hurt you. Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!' I'm going to bash them right the fuck in. Wendy! I'm not going to hurt you. Why? Why? Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers? Have you ever thought about my responsibilities? Of course you are. As soon as possible. When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor? You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor? I don't think that's true. I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are. You can't remember. How do you like it? Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up! Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you? You mean just leave the hotel? Get him out of here? I think he did it to himself. Good. Absolutely nothing. How is he? Yes, I did. No, nothing at all. Which room was it? I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny. I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had. It's the most horrible dream I ever had. Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm? or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in. Now do you think you can handle that? Fine. Now we're going to make a new rule. Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing, and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand? Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration. I'm not being grouchy. I just want to finish my work. What do you want me to do about it? I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere. Yeah... that's all it is. Lots of ideas. No good ones. Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first. Hmm, nice. I know it. Eleven thirty - Jesus! What time is it? Perfect for a child. Sure is. Uh...huh. Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before nine or ten. Hi, babe. Well, it's very... homely. I'd better collect my family first. Right there. No, my son's discovered the games room. No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat. Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict. Well, that is eh quite a story. I don't believe they did. I'm intrigued. They'll love it. Not for me. five months of peace is just what I want. Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... Well, that sounds fine to me. Only in a very general way. Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic. Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks. Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours. Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman. I'm Jack Torrance. Mr. Ullman?It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point. Your money's no good here. What'll it be, sir? It's good to see you. Good evening Mr. Torrance. Women! Can't live with 'em. Can't live without 'em! I hope it's nothing serious. How are things going, Mr. Torrance? Thank you for saying so. Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance. What'll it be?Good evening. Forest Service. All right, sir. I'd be glad to do that, sir. Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes? Good evening, Mr. Halloran. What can I do for you? Good evening. Forest Service.Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes? We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long. Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack. The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter. This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef. Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance. Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in. Oh... Oh fine. Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away. Oh... Has your luggage been brought in? Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. Is your family having a look around? Good morning Jack. I hope you haven't been waiting too long. put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened. Well, obviously some people can be shut in together over long periods of time. The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are Well, my predecessor in this job I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970? been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job. Great... How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it? can of itself be a problem. That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation... Physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation. ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold. Well... Oh, it sure would be Let's see, where were we? Yes. I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May. Susie. JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee? Well, that's very good time, very good. Please sit down a minute. Have any trouble finding us? Very nice to meet you. Oh, well - come on in Jack. Yes? Yes. By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here. Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible. How're you getting on? Hi. Thank you, Susie. We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably. Oh...well this is our gold ballroom. As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel. This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter. All the best people. even before anybody knew what a jet set was. We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars. Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs. This is our Colorado Lounge. Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment. Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first. What time does the plane leave? Jack is a schoolteacher. Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through. Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.Well this ought to be quite a change for you. What line of work are you in now? Pleased to meet you. Fine. Eight thirty. Fine. How do you do?She'll be fine. Hostages? Anybody been hurt? Jimmy, how's the - Everything on it? You do? I'll try to remember that . . .

I didn't think I wanted to. You don't have anything to be sorry about. How could I . . . Oh come on, that's ridic - Lois, I . . . Lois, help! I can't -- I can't swim -- ! What?? How could you win a crazy bet like -- You've been under a lot of pressure lately - No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand -- Who ???? Whoever, I Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel. Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're -- Superman? Oh, was he here? I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean? No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed? Lois, you're amazing. I don't know, they look pretty happy to me... I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements. Sleeping arrangements. A "complimentary corsage." But this should be exposed. They get kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says. Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that. 'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents. It is kinda romantic. Really? Maybe I could try -- Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones? Actually, yes. I do? I don't? One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them. Uh. . . Lois, what are you doing? Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know. Lois, I usually do. No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous. Gee. But -- What?? Does Lois know about this yet? But . . ..that's terrible! Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to -- Uh...home...How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days. What's a curl? What'd he say before? He saw a girl?Are you okay? Tourists, about twenty of 'em. So far the hostages are unharmed. Yeah. I'll check. Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane? Maybe we just don' t know his game plan. A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.It's beautiful. Why didn't you go before we left?

I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off. DELETE IN CUTTING Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got. The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it. Does she know about it? She's in it! That's why they call 'em terrorists. Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of -- Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?! Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio? Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been the last twelve hours? Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?! I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and now he decides to pull a disappearing act? He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen. You do, don't you, Kent? Give it another ten minutes. If we don't -- Hell, I'll tell him. Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns. Kent, I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.You'll find out, General! And when you do . . . I wish I knew. -- Oh, God. I'm the man they're protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory? I think he said a "curl." Artemis? Do you read me?Yes, but will you honor it? There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists? And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have. Um. . . .we have made this guarantee. In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.Yes. But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father -- you had each other. Can I never have what you had? Yes, but it's not all I feel. Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance? Oh no. I really like it sometimes. And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you. I never did this before . . . I have to tell you. Dinner. Oh yes. I'm sorry, I just never do much about that. But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois. So -- I hope you like it. Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home. Until now. You must be freezing. Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this -- Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole. Too late, Luthor. Too late . . . I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . . Luthor, you poisonous snake . . . I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . . Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.What do you want? We will bring him to his knees! He has powers as we do . . . He flies as well, then . . . Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer! The son of Jor-El on this Planet? We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have. Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance. Beginning with this one. Put down Lex Luthor ! Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way? What more? There is something more you want. The greed is written on your face. Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it? He ran in fear from us . . . Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod! Who is this . . . Superman? Zod. Zod. Who is this imbecile? Where is he? It will. Starting with your own. Did you really believe we would give up our advantage? We must combine our strength. Don't worry. I will draw his fire. With a few of my own. He... cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People . This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness. And so I was yesterday. And the day before. Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss. Stay. I will come to you. So this is the planet Houston . . . And I will lead. Then we must go there too. To rule. Finally - to rule! And then you shall have what you want. Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers! Free!
