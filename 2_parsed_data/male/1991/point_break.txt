EVERYBODY on the floor! Fuckin' shake it! I wanna say just two words to you, asshole, SIMU-LATION!!!  Johnny- fuckin' Utah.  Guys like you will do anything to win! Anywhere?  You don't care? Day One in LA, special agent Utah. You may have been top two percent of your class at Quantico but you have exactly zero hours in the field here.  You know nothing... You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't. Eating solid breakfasts, Utah? All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes... This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world-- That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent? You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage. The dolls love this baby.  It brings them luck when they rub it -- right between their buttons. Angelo, we need a bigger tape. Just read the goddamn number. Still a 46.  Maybe we can cinch it down, wear a girdle-- Screw you and this holistic fitness crap!  At least my arms don't flap in the wind. Okay, Pappas, let's put on the blindfold.  Wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom. I've been in the field 33 years, fired my piece 23 times in the line of duty, and I got no idea what a blind man fetching bricks has gotta do with being a Special Agent! Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something. Here he comes.  Hold up a fish, he'll take it right outta your hand. Hey Shamu, this is your guy. Pappas.  Angelo Pappas. Welcome to Sea World, kid. The little hand says... ... let's rock and roll. Use a gun, go to heaven. EVERYBODY FREEZE!!  That's right. ALL TELLERS step back from the counter!  Hands on heads!  MOVE!! Everybody else on the floor!  Do it! On the floor, let's go. SUCK LINOLEUM, BITCH!!  You got earwax?! Just stay cool.  Everybody stay cool.  Heads down.  Eyes down.  The money's insured-- -- it's not worth dying for. Another 45 seconds of your time. That's all.  Then -- Whoa, Tricky Dick! Twenty-seven banks in three years. In and out in 90 seconds.  Nobody ever gets shot.  We're talking solid professionals. Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers. Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy. Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish. The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid. Hey, Pappas, you tell the kid your theory on the Presidents? Just take the tape, Cole. They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it. What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here? Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while. Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years. That's the point, isn't it? Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp? Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay? Sure.  No problem.  How about your office?  Your office need vacuuming? We could do that too. Excuse me. Cute huh?  They love to fuck with us. Don't tell me, let me guess.  The switch-car was stolen this morning... They vacuumed and 409'd the interior, did the windows, emptied the ashtrays... Yeah, the usual drill. Sweat secretions in the seatbacks? You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it. Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one. Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right? You watch your fucking mouth! Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here! Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway. L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean. So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero? The fucking punks are surfers. I'm tellin' ya, kid, it's in our face.  Lookit the tan on this guy. Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products. The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em. Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction. Now lookit the dates on the robberies.  This is strictly a summer job for these guys. Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer. The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to finance their endless summer! "Best for your stick", huh?  This might not be enough.  I better get two. Johnny, it's the only way. Look.  Look at them out there. They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech. It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be? I think you gotta hit them straight on! Outta the way, you dick! Move it, kook! You dinged my board, kook!! Politeness counts, ASSHOLE! Kid, maybe this ain't your sport. This is your surfer contact? Female.  Blond hair.  Green eyes. 5'6".  119 lbs? This is great.  She ties some guy up.  Nude.  Leaves the scene and fails to return for 24 hours.  No convection. Next!  Oh, no. What do you want? I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here. Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink? I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37. What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right? This gonna take long? Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone. And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty. Stop here. Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it? Do it again. I'm not with him. It's closing out completely.  Let's call it. That's Bodhi.  They call his the Bodhisattva. The modern savage.  Guy's even crazier than you, Johnny Utah. C'mon. Brah! Hey Tyler! The fuck you doin' man?!  You fuckin' crazy? Chill, brah.  You know who this is? Johnny Utah.  Ohio State, all- conference. Rose Bowl three years ago.  Right? Johnny fuckin' Utah!  Fuckin'-A! Yeah, I remember that game, man. You were on-fire.  They could not stop your ass. Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter. And that's why you never went pro? Mmm.  A lawyer, huh? Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right? Like totally rad stick, dude. Gnarly, man... hang ten... cowabunga... surf patrol... rip it up! How was the beach? Surf conditions okay? A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls? What? Where is Pappas? Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me? What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car? Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon. Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year. Guy got his jaw broken for it. Hell, what're we waiting for, let's go pick the guy up. Guy's the Toxic Avenger. No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp. When you two are done makin' out, I need to talk to you. Hey, I ain't no butt-bouncer, dude. We're from the valley.  Mall babes 'n shit. I just want to know if you surf here a lot. Shit yeah, like totally everyday when it's jammin'.  What is this, fucking narco entrapment or what, dude? Not exactly, dudes. Naw, this isn't it. He moved. PCBs, selenium, titanium, arsenic. The percentages look right.  Here's a match. Surf's up, ace. Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all. This the guy? Yeah. No. Waste of time. We're just going to fuck you up. Johnny?  You there? The dude can fight! Back off!  Now!!  Just let it go! Stay outta this, Bodhi! He's with me.  Now back off. Seriously.Just do it! You alright Warchild? Fuck you. Bunker. Yeah?  Why? Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold it, ladies.  Give it a rest. Let's go. Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep walking. Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10, 12, running with a car stereo? Stole the fucking CD too, you believe it? Thanks, buddy. The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here. They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it. No. So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world. De nada. Come with Tyler.  She knows. Ten seconds you're out of sight. Unbelievable. Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay? Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers. Cold pizza?  It's great for breakfast. He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning. He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride. Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed. Catch of the day. People are expendable to Bodhi. We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different. Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something. Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover. ... Okay, so you're in the face, it's twenty-five feet straight down, your balls are about this big. And the whole thing's moving, right, roaring like you're stuck to the front of a freight train.  There ain't nothin' like it, man.  The ultimate rush.  Forget about sex, it doesn't even come close. You lose it right then, you're history.  The fish'll be pickin' you outta the coral. Thanks, brah. See, it's all dynamic, it's all in motion.  You can't just stop and walk on in to the beach if you don't like the way things are going, y' know what I mean?  You gotta ride it out man, all the way. No, Bells Beach, Australia. The set was northwest.  Jacking up like a fucking mountain of gray glass-- I made that one mistake you pray you'll never make-- You shoulda fuckin' seen it... it was like he fell for-ever.  Then the curl crashes down and he's gooone-- Not tragic to die doing what you love.  You want the ultimate thrill, you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price. Fuckin' A. Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies. I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it. Hey, Bodhi. Johnny has his own demons, don't you, Johnny? Feel it? Gentlemen, it's time. Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows. Let's go, Utah.  Time for a little stealth mission. Gaping barrels!  Way overhead, man! Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are. Yeah, but are you crazy enough? Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave. I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win. The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see. This one's got your name on it, Johnny. Let's go. You had enough? Look at you. Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you. See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy. You don't have to. Those are cold. You're late. Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up? Good of you to join us, hotshot. Watch it.  I told you, not on the hairs, goddammit. Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it? Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling. Here Scooby!  Where are you boy? Here Scooby!!  You furball piece of shit. Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big. ... and the guy next door said he saw it go into your backyard.  My wife'll kill me if I lose the little bastard.  Me, I could care less. Whole house smells from it's liftin' its leg all the time... Something's goin' down, man.  This ain't right. No, man, it's nothin'.  It's nothin'. Will you shut the fuck up!  Check the windows.  Do it!! You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look? Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him? There's two guys by the back door. Ducked down. Oh, shit.  Shit!!  We're fucked, man. That fat fuck comes through the door I'm gonna pump him up.  Swear to Christ, man, I'm gonna blow the dude up! FBI, gorgeous.  Now let's take a look around-- Move it, man.  Let's get the fuck out of here! Speak into the microphone. It's always been lasers and paper targets until today, right? No difference, Utah.  Just a little more to clean up. It's alright.  You did good today. Oh shit. You know what this is?!  Two keys uncut crystal meth! You think I like this haircut?  My wife wants me to stay at Ramada -- I been working on these guys for THREE MONTHS!  Finally -- finally-- -- I get dickwad in there wantin' to play wheel of fortune so I can find out their supplier! This is agent Dietz, DEA.  He's got a record of your suspect's movements every day for the last three months. All I wanna know is how are these guys supposed to be holding up Tarzana City National on August 2nd, when they are in Fort-fucking- Lauderdale August 2ND!!! Not an easy thing to do, is it, Utah? Nice tattoo, Dietz. C'mon brah, there's a righteous swell.  Let's go!  Let's go! He does this. Come on, Utah.  Everybody's out there catchin' all the good rides. What's wrong Johnny? You're like a different person. Hey.  You okay?  You look like you saw a ghost. Forget about it, kid, They're ghosts... Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something? Hey, babe.  Get on over here so the big dog can teach ya how to bark. Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay? Listen, uh... if you're okay, can it wait till tomorrow morning, kid, This Zen master surfer. Did he rob it? Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report. Alright, look... banks are closed. Nothing's gonna go down tonight, right?  So we'll be on these guys like white on rice... first thing tomorrow morning.  Okay?  Tomorrow. Okay? They're on their way to Maui. Jesus Christ, kid!  The banks don't open 'till nine. Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard. Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are. Time for lunch. That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two. Two meatball, one tuna on wheat, two lemonades.  Total's seven eighty four. Damn, I could eat the ass out of an elephant.  I shoulda had you get me three a these.  What T-Bird? Jesus Christ!!  It's them! Come on, kid, get in the car! Jesus! They took a left at the next light! You even watching the road? Where are they, man?  I don't see 'em.  We lose 'em? Nice fuckin' work, hotshot. Christ! Emergency sanitization!  Here we go! Let's go!  Move it, Ronny! You want me, there's only one way. Nothing? Go home, kid.  Get the hell outta here.  Get some sleep.  You look like shit.  They get anything even resembles your guy, I'm on your beeper.  Here.  You like feta? Johnny... All I wanna know is one thing, why didn't you just take the shot? Betadyne doesn't hurt. So what'd the other guy look like? But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away? Johnny, what is it with you?  You have that look again, it's like you're about to tell me something and then you don't... or you can't. What's going on? What?  What do you want to tell me? A lawyer!?  You lied to me! Look, Tyler, I can-- Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it? You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?! Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell! Hi, it's me.  Leave a message. Howdy brah. C'mon, get your gear on, we're rollin'. Here. Hey, what happened?  Ya cut yourself shaving? Naw, this is different, Johnny. This is something totally different... you're gonna love this. C'mon, let's go, let's go.  Time's wastin', brah. Life's sure got a sick sense of humor, don't you think so Johnny? News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place. I was picking up some bucks cause we're leaving town.  Bizarre, huh? If I'd waited a day I'd been right in the middle of it.  Kinda sorry I missed it.  I'd liked to've seen them. Banks are insured, brah.  Long as nobody gets shot, it's really a victimless crime.  Just gotta scare 'em a little, would be my guess. Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with all those guys wearin' body armor these days, know what I'd carry? .454 Casull.  Most powerful handgun on the planet.  Muzzle velocity of 2000 feet per second.  Twice the kinetic energy of a .44 Magnum. 'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight. Whoa.  Careful.  You got the muzzle pointing right at me, brah. It's a special day, Johnny U.  A very special day... Ever done this before? Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump. Yeah, I noticed you limping. But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land! It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar. I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me? Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine. Hey... you don't want Bodhi's, man. His pack-jobs suck... they only open half the time.  Take Grommet's, man. My man! Utah, you copy bruddah? I'll take that as a yes. Whip it out dudes!  Cheap sex with the cosmos! Ten thousand feet.  Let's do it. Come on Johnny.  Get in here! Relax, brah.  I got you, I got you. You diggin' this? Purty-thirty and we're meat waffles, folks.  See ya downtown! You gonna pull? Don't screw around man, pull it! One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord! Okay! Ya see... I told you Johnny U was gonna be just fine! C'mere.  There's something you need to see. Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play. She's a wild one, isn't she... Special Agent Utah? Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second. She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see... ... six hours from now. Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there. So that makes us partners, doesn't it?  Because now we both have the same goal... to get me where I need to go.  Right? See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade. Get the plane down to Santa Monica and top up the tanks. Let's go.  Let's saddle up! Okay.  All I'm askin' for is ninety seconds of your life, Johnny. That's all. It's basic dog psychology, brah.  If you scare them, get them pissing down their leg, they submit... you control them.  If you project weakness, you draw aggression... that's how people get hurt. Fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true.  You project strength to avoid conflict. Peace through superior firepower, babe. Here, you need this.  You can't be comin' through that door with your dick in your hands, right? Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U? Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master? Ninety seconds, man, door to door. A small price to pay for someone who loves you. She does you know.  It's not her style to fall so hard... I don't think she did with me. Sorry, Johnny.  Guess you don't get to be president. Rock and roll! Everybody freeze!!  Don't move!! Do whatever they say, Terry. Don't anybody fucking move! We gotta bug out, man!  We're eatin' it bad on this one.  Let's go! Goodbye, Johnny. He knows his goddamn rights! Jesus, kid.  I knew you were getting too close to these guys. Gimme the goddamn key to these things, Cole.  Christ! Don't take those off.  Just leave them on!  Your partner's an accessory to murder.  You realize that? Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah? Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in. Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind-- Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't? What that? Respect your elders. Let's go kid. Figured you did. But you're not alone. Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you? And let my policy expire?  Sorry. I say when it's over! Back in the hotseat, campadre. Kid, get outta the way!! GODDAMMIT!! I ain't flyin' you guys to San Phillipe man, forget it.  Not now-- Thanks for telling the nice FBI agent where we're going. Get in the fucking plane. We're gonna ride this out, all the way, Johnny.  You and me.  Let's go. Look, we been in Mexico the last half hour... can I quit mowing the lawn here or what?  I'm getting more brush in the wheels than I usually like, you know what I'm saying?! Yeah, get some height.  Take her up to eight thousand on this heading. We're gonna pop up on their screens. Doesn't matter now.  We're almost there, man.  Here, let me help you get your gear on. I'm cold. You're gonna be fine.  Just fine. Johnny, toss me that money bag will you.  Easy does it. Hey, Johnny's just trying to psych you man, forget it.  Just keep thinking about all those senoritas nursin' you back to health.  Come on, amigo, let's get you set for the jump. Rosie, Rosie, this is Air Force One, do you copy, over? Why should I? Rosie, listen carefully.  Surgery is canceled, is that clear?  Repeat it back to me. I know it's hard for you Johnny. You want me so bad it's like acid in your mouth.  But not his time. Let's go. You lose, campadre. Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it? Naw, you pull it! Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with? Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four... Three seconds... two... one... Wild ride, huh? That pesky knee, huh?  Too bad. You had me worried there, for a second, Johnny U. Gonna close early today, mate, 'fore the bloody storm hits. John, they're here. D'you see him, Mr. Utah? Now, look, I know you used to be a federal agent up in the states and all that, but you're a citizen now, so just find him and we'll handle it from there. Jesus Almighty, the bloody sand's shakin'. Totally closed-out.  It's fuckin' death on a stick. And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah. You never were... It went bad, brah.  Real bad. I just felt it was time... Time to dance with the universe. I could never handle a jail cell. You'll do this for me, won't you Johnny?  Haven't I earned this much? Thanks, brah.
