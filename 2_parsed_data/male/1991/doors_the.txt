The movie will begin in five moments  The mindless voice announced  All those unseated will await the  next show  We filed slowly, languidly into the  hall  The auditorium was fast and silent  As we seated and were darkened  The voice continued  "The program for this evening is not  new  You've seen this entertainment  Through and through  You've seen your birth, your life  and death  You might recall all the rest  Did you have a good world when you  died?  Enough to base a movie on?" Hey Jim, It's your birthday man,  whaddaya say we try this another  night... Kill the lights a little more, will  ya John? Hey man, how come the Doors aren't  in on this? No music, No Doors. Let's roll... Is  everybody in?... Is Everybody in?...  Is everybody in? The ceremony is  about to begin... WAKE UP!!!! HAS THIS DREAM STOPPED!!!! Let me tell you about the heartache  and the loss of God Wandering  wandering in hopeless night Indian's  scattered on dawn's highway bleeding  ghosts crowd the young childs fragile  eggshell mind... ...me and my mother and father and  grandmother and grandfather were  driving through the desert at dawn  and a truckload of Indian workers  had either hit another car or just --  I don't know what happened... Indians  were scattered all over the highway  bleeding to death. ...but it was the first time I tasted  fear. I musta been about four, like  a child is just like a flower, his  head is floating in the breeze. ...The reaction I get now looking  back is the soul of the ghosts of  those dead Indians -- maybe one or  two of them were just running around  freaking out and just leaped into my  soul -- and they're still there. ...from the Texas School Book  Depository. We repeat. President  John F. Kennedy was shot a few minutes  ago in Dallas! ...taken to Parkland Memorial  Hospital. There's no word on the  President's condition. Mrs. Kennedy  is... Hi... Waste of time... I followed you... from the beach... ...cause... you're the one... Later. You got a name? Mine's Jim. Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim... Who the hell was that? Nietzche said "all great things must  first wear monstrous and terrifying  masks in order to inscribe themselves  on the hearts of humanity". Listen  children -- to the sound of the  Nuremberg night. Have you ever seen God? -- a mandala.  A symmetrical angel. Felt? Yes.  Fucking the Sun. Heard? The music.  Voices. Touched? An animal. Your  hand Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water  and wine SSSSssss... ego trip man, c'mon! Hey man it's great, don't listen to  em, it's non-linear man, it's poetry  man, everything Godard stands for. This is pretty shocking stuff Mr.  Morrison. And I might say indulgent.  Naziism and masturbation, when used  for shock value, are not art. But to  be constructive, let's start with  your intention. What was it? It was a bore!! That's what! Hey it was better'n a Warhol picture. A guy sleeping for seven hours... ...is less pretentious! There was no  political consciousness. Naziism  is... Hey hold on man! You guys are the  facists! It takes genitalism to absurdity  man, just cause the squares here  can't dig it cause the film school's  still so square... Oh c'mon man, give it a break. Boo!  Beatniks go home! Take another  mushroom... HOLD IT DOWN!!... Mr. Morrison --  what are your feelings? I quit. Hey man whatdya expect, an Oscar? You can't quit, you gotta voice.  People can't dig cause they don't  understand yet. If you're an individual, if you're  too good, they wanna cut your dick  off. Look what happened to Orson  Wells. You quit now, they'll yank your  deferment in no time and they'll get  you for Vietnam man. Three more months  you graduate. Be cool, you never learned fuckin  patience Morrison, you want everything  at once. They didn't get it. So make your  films and fuck what they think. You know what I think? Yeah whadday you think? You really want to know what I think? Yeah yeah, whatddaya think? I think we gotta get really ripped! I tell you bout my baby 'bout five  foot four from head to toe She came  to my room Just 'bout midnight She  makes me feel so good She makes me  feel alright You know what I'd like to do to you? You really want to know what I'd  like to do to you? Wanna hear the scream of the  butterfly... Hey Morrison! Can we have a couple of beers. You're  not even an asshole man -- you're a  semihole. She came to my room  She came on my floor  She came on my bed  She came on my face  Ooooooh I want to wrap your legs  around my head baby baby and her  name was Gloria COOL IT JIM, COME ON COOL IT. FREEDOM!!! DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALL HE'S GOING OUT! HE'S GOING OUT! HE'S GONNA JUMP! GET HIM BACK IN! DEATH OLD FRIEND!! Come on, come out for a walk, it's a  pretty night. Can I stay with you tonight? We could  talk 'till dawn. I just don't want  to be alone. Okay. I promise. I bet you never expected life could  be this hard. And you're still so young. I wonder where we'll be ten years  from now? Come on. He's the medicine man who starts in  a peyote trance. And he gets everyone  in the tribe going and they share in  his vision and it heals them. It's  the same in all cultures -- Greeks,  Jesus. Some Indians say the first  shaman invented sex. He's the one  who makes you crazy. Uh no. I just write about it. What turns  you on? Is it? I don't know. I think you're  alive by confronting death -- by  experiencing pain. It's only thru death that you know  life. Jesus, medicine men heal people  by sacrificing their own life. I think life hurts a lot more than  death. When you die the pain is over. I bet your dad's a school teacher. I don't know. Military Yeah, about 8 times. Two. "...but one, the most beautiful one  of all dances in a ring of fire and  throws off the challenge with a shrug" I wrote it for you. Om om... No bliss! No bliss! Hey Ray, try acid man, it's  guaranteed. Morrison... Aw shit. Last trip I  thought I was going through hell's  digestive system. Something painted  by Hieronymus Bosch. I never had a bummer on acid. I like naturally high man. Whatever works. Making movies at MGM  yet? Well I saw the head of production  and I said Godard doesn't use scripts,  he improvises with his camera and he  said, "great who's Godard?" We gotta take the planet back,  reinvent the Gods, make new myths. Right on. I thought you went to New  York? Never got there. Went out to the  desert and uh... got lost y'know.  Days. I been living on Trick's  rooftop. Got stuck on this chick... Whatcha been doing? Writing. Poems. Songs. Songs? Lemme hear one. I can't sing. So neither can Dylan. "Johnny's in  the basement mixing up the medicine,  I'm on the pavement thinking about  the government". But he's got the  words man. That's what they want. Let's swim to the moon un hunh  Let's climb thru the tide  Penetrate the evening  That the city sleeps to hide Let's swim out tonight love  It's our turn to try  Parked beside the ocean  On our moonlight drive Wow!... Y'know man those are hot  lyrics -- really hot! ...could you write the music for  that down, if we went over to your  place, could you write that on your  organ? Are you kidding! I could fly. You  wrote that? You got others? A bunch. It's like I'm taking notes  at a rock concert going on inside my  head. I actually hear the music --  the spirit of the wine y'know,  intoxication. Man. You got a voice like Chet Baker --  haunted! What the hell happened to  you in the desert? Let's get a rock  and roll band together man and make  a million bucks. ...be great wouldn't it? It's the perfect time man! Two of  the guys outta my band are really  into this. I meditate with them. You  know them... Robbie and John. We  could have it in the can in three  weeks. Hey why not, I could write the songs  with you guys. The Stones did it outta the London  School of Economics for Chrissake.  Things are about to explode man. You  can feel it in the air. Vietnam's right out there. Sides are  being chosen. People wanna fight or  fuck, love or kill, everything's  gonna flame. The planet's screaming  for change, Morrison. Make the myths  man!! There oughta be great orgies man.  Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece,  he made all the women mad, leaving  their homes and dancing off in the  mountains. Great golden copulations  in the streets of LA. Hey, do you know her? What do we call ourselves. "Dionysus"? I got a name. What? The Doors. The Doors? That's the most ridiculous... ...you mean the doors in your mind?  Like the Huxley book. "The Doors of Perception"? Acid... Yeah sure mescaline experiments --  reducing the sugar flow to the brain.  Great book. It's from William Blake actually,  the line -- "when the doors of  perception are cleansed -- things  will appear as they truly are..." -- infinite". It's great, Jim. So where do we start? How do we start?  Where are the girls? Rehearsing. You're moving off the  rooftop and in with me and Dorothy. The day destroys the night  Night divides the day  Tried to run  Tried to hide  Break on thru to the other side That's really square. Let's hip it  up. Jump on your cues. Tighten it up. Stay with the beat  Jim. You're dragging. Let's try it again, come on. I'm  just getting into it. I still think the lyrics are weird  man. I still think it sounds like the  bottom of a fishbowl man. Then you write one man! We need more  songs anyway. We all gotta go back  and write. I been working on something goes  like this... A minor. "You know that it would be untrue  You know that I would be a liar  If I was to say to you  Girl, we couldn't get much higher"  F sharp... chorus  "Come on baby, light my fire  Try to set the night on fire..." Okay man there's some good changes  in there. Got any more lyrics? Some. I call it "Light My Fire". I  figger if I'm gonna compete with  your stuff it's gotta be about earth,  fire or snakes. Don't underestimate Death. Yeah but it sounds like the Byrds  man, we're not folk rock man. How  'bout trying it with a Latin beat. I thought we could do the usual verse  chorus verse chorus and We don't need a bridge. Yeah, we could maybe improvise a  couple piano and guitar solos over  it "The time to hesitate is through" Du du duh dud dada . . . "No time to wallow in the mire  Try now we can only lose  And our love become a funeral pyre  Come on baby light my fire" Pretty good! Pretty neat!! Nice groove, John. Chaka chaka chaka,  then bula burump bula ...you're right, it could take a  coupla long solos, that's wild man,  like Butterfield did on "East-West" --  really hip. Y'ever heard Coltrane's "Favorite  Things"? Yeah -- maybe stretch it out and put  it in 4/4 on bass, 3/4 on guitar and  snare. Why not! A minor to B minor. Jazz!  That then is jazz! But it needs a  hook. Something. Give me some space.  I need some space. Leave the room  guys. Come on! Go! Guy's obnoxious, man always bossin'  people around! I thought we were  equals! Aren't we? That was great Robbie. Whaddaya  thinking about when you play? Don't know. Mostly the fish in my  fish tank. Hey whadya say we take some of that  Tijuana acid and see what kinda  trouble we can get into tonight? The chicks always go for you man. I  get the dogs. Then we'll start a religion or plan  a murder or go to Tijuana. Whatsamatter with you man, what about  Pam, you got the morals of a coyote. Why you wanna sleep with her John,  just to bug me? Hell NO! ...means "hell yes". She likes you  man, she really does and y'all should.  What's a rock and roll band for man,  if you can't party all night and do  bad things? Sieg Heil! Okay here it is. Bach and Rock. Count  it off John The music was new black polished  chrome and came over the summer like  liquid night. IDs! IDs! Can't get in without an I forgot my list. We chased our pleasures here  Dug our treasures there  Can you still recall the time we  cried  BREAK on through to the other side Turn around Jim! Come on let 'em in. I found an island in your arms  A country in your eyes  Arms that chained us, eyes that lied What shit, "day destroys the night",  "crawl back in your brain", "go  insane". What do people wanna pay  money to hear that shit. The greater the suffering, the more  terrible the events, the greater the  pleasure Jerry. They want it, it's  catharsis. Like the ancient Greeks. We're in Los Angeles punk, how would  you know, they like your pants,  they're not listenin' to you, what  the hell they see in you I... But they understand Jerry. All our  real desires are unconscious and  unseen. . . ...you're the weirdest fuckin' guy I  ever... You love us? I love ya. You got two more shows to  do. ...I got some real tight record  company connections, just leave it  to me man, I'll take you guys all  the fuckin' way, you blew my mind  out there. Yeah right, but what about the music? Hey the music? I love it man, that's  why we're talking right? Some of  it's a little on the dark side though.  Ya know ya oughta get some tunes  like Herman's Hermits stuff -- "Mrs.  Brown you got a lovely daughter".  That shit goes right to the radio  man. Uh huh. Well, how 'bout gettin' us  some real equipment? Listen, I sign you guys to a five  year management contract and you got  it all. Equipment. Demo. A truck  WITH roadies. Three, maybe four  percent record deal. Wherever ya  want to go babe, trust me, I'll get  you there. Whatd'ya say? We'll have a band meeting. The four  of us do everything unanimously or  we don't do it. The musketeers. I'm touched. But  lemme tell you something -- loyalty  don't pay the bills. Think about it.  Call me tomorrow. What a sleaze! Man, Jim's gotta start  facing the crowd if he's gonna be  the front man. He's just getting his confidence. He never does what we rehearsed.  What's the point of... How does it feel? Great, but... Jim, how old are you? Ah, twenty one... Jesus, you're a gold mine, I'll make  it quick and to the point and if you  repeat it I'll deny it -- drop these  guys, I'll put you with some real  musicians, your voice, your looks,  that's what'll sell records, we'll  make a million bucks. A year. Goodbye.  Call me. I'm right. He gives Jim a  card and goes. Pam disgusted with  the type, Jim laughs, likes the guy. I like a man wears his soul on his  face. "Whiskey's" next, I can feel it in  my bones. I still think the lyrics are weird. Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted  to fuck me, I could feel it for the  first time! Right on stud. But you better watch  out for the guys. Guys, I'm serious about the desert,  we still gotta deepen man, we gotta  take some peyote -- all of us  together, we got one more stage to  go... I don't know man, fucks up my playing.  I been playing music for 10 years  man and this is the first time in my  whole damned life I ever played it. Are you satisfied? Will you get off my case! I'm never  doing acid again. Too many bad trips  man. It's not acid John, it's peyote.  It's a bonding ceremony. It's got to  be more... more... more... I'm into TM man. I promised my guru... Who's on now? Yeah, Arthur Lee's cool. You mean the Marx Brothers of music,  we could blow 'em away. The Doors... We're up the street at  the Fog. Oh yeah what would you do for money? So you don't have a phone number?  What do you mean you don't have a  phone number? I don't have a phone. Well I don't know. What's your name? Caprice? That's the dumbest name I  ever heard. Hey! I am the Lizard king. I can do  Anything! Raise your hands if you  understand! Alive, any of you alive --  let's take a poll -- how many of you  know you're really alive!! No one? Raise your hands c'mon man...  let's go. Everybody having a good time? ...awright, pretty good, it gets  better. WOA!! It's fast. When the serpent appears, his head  is ten feet long and five feet wide.  He has one red eye and one green  eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles  long. As he moves -- on his scales  is written all the history of the  world, all people, all actions, all  of us our little pictures on the  scales, God it's big! -- and it's  eating as it moves all the time,  devouring, digesting consciousness,  power, a monster of energy! We must kiss the snake on the tongue,  if it senses our fear, it will eat  us instantly. But if we kiss it  without fear, the snake will take us  through the garden and out the gate.  To our freedom -we must ride this  snake. To the end of time. I think I'm fucked up. I'm not  thinking right. You're fucked up John. Go with it,  confusion is the sound of creation. You should see your eyes right now,  you're death. Look at your eyes --  you're crazy man, you look crazy.  You scare me. No no no John John. God is crazy  too. God is part insane as well as  sane. Not in control all the time.  Dionysus was the God of the wine. He  made ecstasy but he also made madness.  Madness is all right. That's what  you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's  that joint? I get scared thinking of all the  choices inside. I could go. I could  stay. I can live anywhere. I could  die now if I wanted. It's limitless  choice... and no one cares. Die Robbie. What the fuck! I love you. I'm in pain man. I want something  from the peyote. I feel the universe  functioning perfectly but I'm still  perfectly locked inside myself.  Instead of Oneness, I feel total  Isolation. Aloneness. Fear... Pain...  Jim, all I feel is pain. Pain makes me feel more alive Ray.  Pain is meant to wake us up. People  try to hide their pain but they're  wrong. I feel Lust. I want to fuck everything  I can, and I know it will never be  enough. Pam wants you. You're a good Catholic John, you  want it so you can feel guilty about  it... Fuck death away John. I feel Fear... so bad I just numb  out all my feelings. I'm afraid of  my father, I'm afraid of Yahweh... I  wish I could play my guitar. Maybe you should kill your father  Robbie. He tried to kill you. Kill  him! I'm so fucking scared. But you're Alive! It's beautiful!  Fear, pain, lust, we've got to know  all our feelings before we can come  out the other side free men. Don't  feel ashamed of yourselves, don't  let society destroy your reality.  Our freedom's the only thing worth  dying for, it's the only thing worth  living for! I'm not gonna make it man. I'm scared  Jim, I'm still scared. Blindness is  coming on. Then use us John, use our strength,  it's us four now, a tribe of warriors,  everything we have comes from the  same source, the great Creator of  Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the  snake. . . I promise you I will be  with you till the end of time. My wild love went riding... mmmmmm.  She rode all the day. She ride to  the devil. And ask for him to pay...  shooo shoooo ...she went to the desert she went  to the sea Joseph we did see... ...I'm lying to you. I am scared. Jim, where are you going. I'll be back. I gotta go alone. ...you are a prince among white men,  yet you are a warrior among us. You  are ready now. Go out "walk with the  pain of the world, travel to the end  of the wind" -- and change it for  all men as you were born to do. The west is best (2)  Get here and we'll do the rest  The blue bus is calling us (2)  Driver where you taking us? The killer awoke before dawn  He put his boots on  He took a face from the ancient  gallery  And he walked on down the hall He went to the room where his sister  lived  And he paid a visit to his brother  And then he went on down the hall... And he came to a door, And he looked  inside "Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want  to kill you". Mother... I want to... AAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH Come on baby take a chance with us NOBODY'S GONNA FUCK THEIR MOTHER ON Kill the father, fuck the mother,  kill the father, fuck the mother --  that's what I'm into! That's what  I'm into! You -- MORRISON! You're fucking filthy  twisted perverse punk, get back to  your fucking sewer!! You have the face of a pig man. JERRY JERRY... He was talking about  Oedipus! GREEK TRAGEDY!! It's ART!! FUCK ART!! GET THE FUCK ART OUT!!! NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE DOORS -- TAKE A LONG LOOK OLD MAN. WE ARE THE FUCK YOU... YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD! Come on Jerry, cool it, cool it...  he's a kid, it's a song about dying,  changing... We'll never work again man. The Mafia  controls all these clubs. Oh sure, hi. Yeah? Hey, the guy that did Butterfield! Bertold Brecht, cabaret and rock.  Give me a fucking break. You guys  are amazing! Let's go make a record. Hey, is that asshole gonna pay us? Hey Bruce, you feel it? I'm having big fun. I got goosebumps Jac. This is history  going down here. An album of killer  music in six days... six days...  unreal! Come on baby, LIGHT MY FIIIRRRREEEE!!! Pretty good! Pretty neat! The time to hesitate is through  No time to wallow in the mire. Try now we can only lose  And our love become a funeral pyre  Come on baby, light my fire  Try to set the night on I don't mind dying in a plane crash,  a smile on my face. I just don't want to go out slow --  brain tumor, botulism. I want to  feel what it's like, cause death is  only going to happen to you once. Right this way Mr. Sullivan. They're  called "the Doors". They got the  number one single in the country --  "Light Your Fire". "Light Your Fire"? Is that sooo? They look pretty grungy but we're... You're gonna cut it! The kind you get in hotels. I'd rather stay the same color. What about me? ...here in Detroit, 42 people dead,  more than 2000 injured... 1400  buildings burned, 5000 people have  just lost their homes as Detroit  joins more than 100 cities torn by  riots this hot summer! No wonder "Light My Fire's" number  one. The biggest mistakes in my life have  been haircuts. Boys -- meet Mr. Sullivan Hi boys, heard your song "Light That  Fire" ...think you're great... good luck  out there. Oh thanks Mr. Sullivan. Well the guys at Network have told  us they have a small problem with  the lyrics "girl we couldn't get  much higher". You can't say "higher"  on network so they asked if... you  could say, "girl we can't get much  better"... can you dig that? How 'bout, "girl you couldn't bite  my wire". I don't think Standards and Practices  would... Look, you boys don't forget to smile  now. Don't be so sullen out there... Uh well, we're kind of a sullen group,  Ed. Groovy! Uh you boys should know Mr.  Sullivan is considering you boys for  four more shows. You dig? Well? What -- are we the Beatles now John? It's only a word man. The Stones  changed... Hey Ray, why don't you change your  name to Sid or Irving Manzarek or  something... it's only a word y'know. It's my words. I don't care, let's  just jam. Now here on our stage direct from  Los Angeles, California, ladies and  gentlemen, The Doors! What's that?... oh Jesus!... get off  it!! Where's he going? You know that it would be untrue  You know that I would be a liar  If I was to say to you  Girl, we couldn't get much higher  Come on baby light my fire He said it! He said it! On National  TV You can't do that! You can't do  that!!! You blew it you little shit!  You'll never play Ed Sullivan again. Come on baby, light my fire  Try to set the night on FIIIIRRRRRE! I don't know... I guess I should see  a doctor or something... maybe I  should go to someone of the straight  Jungian philosophy. It's so scary up there. To be adored.  Isn't that irony? Teenage death girls  want my dick -- a mere clown -- not  my words. I'll never wake up in a  good mood again... Lament for my  cock, a tongue of knowledge deep in  the feathered night, gives life,  soar and crucify, I seek to know  you... You should marry an insurance  salesman. We weren't built to last. You really know what I am Pam? You  know what poetry is? Where is the  feast they promised us? Where is the  wine -- the new wine -- dying on the  vine? Y'see -- I lied to you. I really  love Fame. 'Cause you're in the room. Maybe you're the cause! I mean I don't have this problem  with anybody else. No!!!!! Mommy!!! Get mad! Yeahhh! Love my girl! Yeah,  go fuck the other guys. How many  white guys have you fucked Pam? 10,  20? Black guys what? You like Chinese  dicks? Mongolian penis? 30? How could I do that HA HA HA!! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME! I'D DIE FOR ANYBODY. CUNT CUNT CUNT. I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY. SHADDUP WILLYA. I'M TRYING TO THEN MOVE TO MIAMI YOU SLAVE!!! You were saying? ...will you die for me, Pam, a clown,  a despicable clown?... a mere  despicable clown? ...I need a home. A place to hide. ...how could we make a home?... where  there's sanctuary? ...we're in Africa, we're just  animals... I wanna stay inside you  all night baby... let's fuck death  away, now fuck death away... What are your songs about Mr.  Morrison? Uh love death travel... revolt. We  all write the songs, we're interested  in anything about disorder, chaos,  especially activity which seems to  have no meaning... I think when you  make peace with authority, you become  authority. Can you define that a little more? Yeah you can call us erotic  politicians I guess. Do you really consider yourself a  shaman Mr. Morrison? ...a scapegoat maybe -- I take on  the audiences' fantasies, obeying  their impulses. When the impulses  are destructive, I'm destructive.  It's kinda like sucking the puss out  of a rattlesnake, something like  that. ...like a medicine man or witch  doctor? Jim said to me once, the history of  rock and roll's like Greek drama or  caveman stories. The audience comes  to see ancient rituals in ancient  caves. Their souls in jeopardy.  They're not watching any longer,  they're participating -- and  everything's in play, your life,  your death... Is that why they scream so much? Mr. Morrison, how do you feel about  being called the "ultimate barbie  doll". I guess when you say something like  that, it's a shortcut to thinking. Then do you "think" about the dreadful  reviews your new poetry book has  gotten? I guess they didn't understand. And it's true you financed it's  publication? Have you bothered to read the poetry  ma'm? You keep denying that anything  good can come from L.A., I mean isn't  that kind of a provincial attitude?  That Bob Dylan's the only poet cause  he's from the East Coast, but you  won't even look past Jim's goddamn  looks at the words man! Hey c'mon Ray, hate should be allowed. ...but what really are your songs  about Mr. Morrison? You preach,  "saving the planet", "making a new  age" but how does drinking, taking  drugs, this boozy sort of apocalyptic  stance at the world influence young  people in a positive way? I like that -- "boozy apocalyptic" --  you're a word man, but how does your  newspaper influence young people to  think about Vietnam? Who's sending  the soldiers over there to die? The  establishment -- right? Your newspaper --  right? That seems to me a lot more  dangerous than the stuff we do. Do you believe in drugs Mr. Morrison? Did you know Nietzsche said, "all  good consciousness, all evidence of  truth comes only from the senses"?  Hey you wanna arm wrestle? Come on,  you look pretty tough today. C'mon,  I'll take you all on. And alcohol? Is that considered part  of the shaman's wisdom? Part of the clown's wisdom -- it's  kinda the American way. You know we  spend more on alcohol and tobacco  than on education. Are you by any chance in a trance  now Mr. Morrison? Do you hurt? What? What hurts you the most? What are you doing? Uh... got tired of the barbie doll  look. It hurt. Are you serious? About? Y'know when people are joking,  I find they are dead serious and  when they're dead serious, I find  them funny. What do your parents think about  what you are doing? Actually, I don't really remember  being born. It musta happened during  one of my blackouts. But they must've expressed some  feeling? Well, to be honest they're not living  anymore so I don't like to talk about  that. Could you at least tell us how they  died? Oh, it was a... horrible car crash...  in the desert in the fifties,  Arizona... ran right into a truckload  of Indians... Navajos, they were  lying out on the road, all bleeding,  and I was with my Grandma and Grandad,  we were banged up and all... and I  was looking at my Dad and he was  lying there... but his throat was  severed and there was air coming  out. I'm sorry. I have the feeling I'm being put on. Y'all believe what you want to  believe, you will anyway... but it  does kinda show you what excites  people? Fear, pity, horror -- all those good  things that count. It's sorta I guess  like being on the edge of an orgasm,  y'know... that mystery just before  you come. When? If? Should I? Will  you die for me, eat me, this way,  the end... Great! A new thing. Wow how old is this? The Craft? Wow! You Patricia? Who would've  guessed? What? Where do you get the blood? No... I don't like... cutting myself. I'm gonna burn you down. Nobody'd ever look at you again --  'cept me. I'd scar you forever. AWRIGHT! AWRIGHT! Mooooooo!!! Where are the Doors. We do everything together. I am the snake and you are the lute You must meet Andy Warhol, Jim. He's  more than an artist. Andy is art.  Bright people in America wonder --  does Andy imitate life, or does life  imitate Andy. The meeting of two  kings. Yes, Come. Hi Jim, you are great... I see you  at Ondine's with Bobby and Jimmy.  It... Yeah... hey what's your trip? Saw your gig at 'The Scene'. Hot...  very hot... You strung out? Here.  Try this. Love your movies man. What a great  penis... Come on, we're splitting man.  Dorothy's waiting at the door. We'll  get a bite at Max's and... You can't leave. Where's your will  to be weird man? Get outta here man. This is fucking  weird man. Right this way Jim. Andy's in the  bedroom. Don't go, y'see Norman Mailer, I  hear he's here? Yeah can we meet him, he's great...  just like he is. You wanna meet him? I don't know... did he know who you  were? Yeah sure, he's cool, come on, he's  your hero! Nah... later... I like the Doors, I like the Doors,  I like the Doors. I like outer space. Hey where's my joint? There's this chick sings with the  Velvet Underground, Andy's band. She  says she can drink you under the  table. I'm Nico. It's boring tonight. Some  of us are going downtown to a new  club. You want to come? ...elevate your taste in trolls man. Vodka? Race you. Your death... Wanna go?... Come on let's go. She looks too freaky to me. Wait just a minute. Come on there's pussy Robbie. Hey I met this chick Lynne, she wants  to be alone. Come on Jim, let's go. Don't you guys wanna meet Andy Warhol? Tell you the truth, I can live without  him. He's a freak. Let's get outta  here. We got a show tomorrow. Come on man! I thought we were gonna  be a band, the four of us -- and  party all night, rock and roll! I could never keep up with you Jim.  I couldn't make the music. Don't go. Don't leave! You can't  leave. I don't know what will happen.  It might be Death. Come on Jim, this isn't our scene,  these people are vampires. We gotta  stick together man, the four of us.  Let's make the myths man. Right here Jim, right here. Andy's  waiting. You know what you have in  common is uniqueness. Nico! Well, it was such a big opening, we  just had to go to Philadelphia,  y'know, you were supposed to, mmm... Andy! Andy! ...but so many people showed up, the  paintings were getting crushed, so  they took them all down... um, it  really looked great y'know... maybe  uhhh... ...the walls. The blank walls. Andy  was the art. Should do a show. Just  walls. Today it's really about people,  not what they do. It's the astronaut  that matters, not the voyage, the  actor, not the movie -- how do I  say, it's the trip, not arriving. ...you know what Andy says, some day  everybody's gonna be famous for 15  seconds, but it won't mean anything. That's too short. I need a coupla  hours. We'd just love to have you in our  movies Jim, you're so beautiful,  you'd be so good, you mmmm, here...  this is for you Jim. Edie gave this to me and said mmmmm,  I could talk to God with this. But I  don't really have anything to say.  So... mmmm now you can talk to God.  Oh hi! Morrison! Look, the Fire Marshall's not gonna  let the show go on. Either you go  back to your seats, you go to the  aisle, you don't do that -- no show! "Lord Byron"? Really. You think? You  like the poems? These are the kindest words I've  ever heard in my life. No one has  ever understood. Thank you. Maybe I should always fuck my critics. Let's do it, here, now... with the  sound of the crowd. Like Nuremberg,  wild German fucking. I'm begging! I'm begging you! About what! What's your problem with fathers!  They're dead, both of them, I told  you. What'd he say? That was really stupid.  Why didn't you just ask me. You're a fuckin' cunt. You could  ruin his career if... I don't want to talk about it. Hate  is a very underestimated emotion. You're wrong. What they want I can't  give... my death -- ripped to pieces --  do you feel their power? I want to live, Patricia. I don't  wanna die. Patricia... Patricia... Whatcha doing there? Uh... nuthin' Okay, outta there both of you. No  one's allowed backstage. Let's go. Hey, I'm with the band man. It's  cool. Take it easy. Let's go. NOW! You're both under  arrest. Hey, eat it man! Mace! Shit! Why'd you blind me man? You blinded  me! Hey all he said was... I'm going to have to issue a warrant  for his arrest. Why don't you leave him alone lady,  he doesn't need more shit in his  life. Make a grave for the unknown soldier  Nestled in your hollow shoulder  The unknown soldier  Practice as the news is read  Television children dead  Bullet strikes the helmet's head  It's all over  The war is over! OH YEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! Well the men don't know  But the little girls unnerstan'... When all the good people are trying  to sleep  I'm out there making my midnight  creep  Yeah, cause I'm a backdoor man  The men don't know  But the little girls unnerstan'... I wanna tell you 'bout something  that happened just a few minutes ago  right here in New Haven. This is New  Haven isn't it? New Haven,  Connecticut, United States of America? HEY MORRISON, is the West really the  best or are you just stoned on  weeeeeedddddd?????? "Light My Fire". Sing "Light My Fire".  Yeah. Give us Light My Fire!... We want Mick Jagger! Take your clothes  off Jim. Show it to us! We want the  Lizard King! Well I was with this girl backstage,  y'know. We got to talking and we  wanted some privacy, so we went into  this shower stall. We weren't doin'  anything y'know jes' standing there  and talking. ...and then this little man came in  there, this little man in a little  blue suit and a little blue cap... And he said -- "Whatcha doin' there?"  I said, "nuthin'" and he said, "Well  you better get outta there or..."  "Or what" I asked him... And he started pushing me and I pushed  back and he didn't like that so he  reached back there and got out his  little can of mace. And sprayed it  right in my eyes. And blinded me.  Why? Cause I was alone in a room  with a lady doing what he would like  to be doing if he could ever get it  up without a gun. In the United States of America.  Land of the free. Home of the Brave  man -- in God We Trust right? TURN Say your thing man! Young man you've gone too far. The  show's over. You're under arrest. They're gonna beat the shit out of  him man! GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME SLAVE! YOU'RE SLAVES. YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF Hey whatcha got here? A boy or a  girl? What do you care. You're gonna fuck  him anyway...

Stand clear, who the hell knows what's  living in there? You finished? You sure you're  finished? Haven't you forgotten  something -- the consolation prize  they gave ya for taking your cock  and balls? The guns. Why don't you  use em you withered dicks! You shit- eating red-neck chickenshit bastards,  I hope this makes your worthless  lives... You better kill me cause I'm gonna  come back and fuck everyone of your  daughters... LET JIM GO!!! MORRISON! MORRISON! WE GET OUTTA HERE! GO HOME. GO ON NOW! MOR-RI-SON! MOR-RI-SON! MOR-RI-SON! JIM JIM JIM JIM JIM JIM... He could go all the way man! In five  years he could be in the White House.  Another JFK. I drink so I can talk to assholes.  This includes me. Let's just say I  was testing the bounds of reality --  that's-all -- I was curious... I  kinda always preferred to be hated.  Like Erich Von Stroheim in the  movies... the man you loved to hate...  it's meant to be ironic, courage  wants to laugh. Y'know it's  essentially a stupid situation. I go  out on a stage and I howl for people.  In me they see what they want to see --  some say the Lizard King, whatever  that means, or some black-clad leather  demon whatever that means... but  really I think of myself as a  sensitive, intelligent human being  but with the soul of a clown which  always forces me to blow it at the  most crucial moment... a fake hero... a joke the gods played  on me... it's okay, I accept the  joke... and smile. Death old friend,  death and my cock, I can forgive my  injuries in the name of wisdom,  luxury, romance. Words got me the  wound and will get me well. All join  now in lament of my cock, a tongue  of knowledge in the feathered night.  Boys get crazy in the head and suffer.  I sacrifice my cock on the alter of  silence. Hey Jim, how 'bout hitting a strip- joint? It's getting late and we can... Nah, later... Now listen to this I'll tell you  about Texas Radio and the big beat  soft driven slow and mad like some  new language reaching your head with  the cold sudden fury of a divine  messenger let me tell you about  heartache and the loss of God  wandering, wandering in hopeless  night out here on the perimeter there  are no stars out here we is stoned,  immaculate... but I tell you this:  No eternal reward will forgive us  now for wasting the dawn.

Come on baby, y'know it's a good  thing for Ray and Dorothy I think  women are such noble creatures --  they carry on your name with dignity  after you die. I think women basically have a comic  approach to life -- I mean how can  they not when they look up in the  dark and see a dangling penis, seeking  entry. It looks like a face y'know --  little beard "Hi mom" I wanna get inside you. Look around. "Do the funky chicken, do dah, dah,  funky chicken do da da "love my girl" -- Let's go wild child, let's get out  there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe  and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam,  rock and roll ...all the poetry has wolves in it,  but one Pam -- the most beautiful  one of all -- dances in a ring of  fire and throws off the challenge  with a shrug 'cause I'm the poet and you're my  muse Get some drinks, man.

Dead President's corpse in the  driver's car  The engine runs on glue and tar  C'mon along, we're not going very  far  To the East to meet the Czar... ...we worship the ancient forces of  Nature, the Triple Goddess, the Great  Mother and the Lord, the Horned One...  when the vow is taken ...it is a blending of souls on a  karmi and cosmic plane that affects  your future incarnations on this  planet. Death does not part -- only  lack of love -- and the vow is forever  in the Goddess' sight. Run with me, run with me  Run with me, let's run  Some outlaws live by the side of a  lake  The minister's daughter's in love  with a snake Who lives in a well by the side of  the road  Wake up girl!

You know you've always been good to  me in bed Judy. And it was nice of  you to bring your friend. I want to  keep seeing both of you but it can't  be all the time y'know. It would be  a night every few weeks or so. That's  just the way I am, I'm not dependable.  I can't be a boyfriend. Would you do  that? I mean could you handle it?  That way? I don't want you to get  hurt. ...do you love me? ...Well, just think about it awhile.  Call me when you get your new  number...

So what are we going to tonight Paul!  67 takes! It's stale! Alright, let's try something else. I wanna sing blues. This stuffs  getting too self-conscious. Cause it's my song man? Let's sing "Rock is Dead"! You're  all a buncha slaves... "Oh come all  ye faithful." Shut up Jim! I don't understand! I  don't. What are ya doing! I love you  like a brother, I do, but why are  you fucking this up. It's a perfect  radio song for chrissake! No one  wants to hear the blues anymore!  Think like a singer, you're the only  baritone crooner we got left...  Sinatra, Elvis, Crosby, you're as  good as they are, but WHY ARE YOU Catchy, you sold it to a commercial? For that? How much did you get for  it? Now, Jim... HOW MUCH? You figured? What the fuck is this  Ray? It's not like a big deal Jim, the  song's already been commercialized,  the money was great. Robbie wrote  the lyrics and he didn't mind, neither  did I, neither did John... we gotta  get to TV. What?... are you saying? Are we the  Doors? One for all and all for one?  Do you know what you're saying to  those millions of kids! "Just kidding,  not real". That's what you're saying. Oh come on man, you think just cause  you're the lead man in the band you  can run the whole show. You think I was kidding Ray? Hey John, those are interesting shoes,  you like those shoes? Yeah I do. Good. Then do you want 50 of those  shoes? No. Then what do you need more money  for? I'm dying Ray. I wasn't kidding.  Maybe you were. But I'll tell you  something, it's not about these  desires you have man, or money, or  these records, it's about breaking  through wasn't it? You just lost  something man. We all lost something boys. We lost  something. I don't think so Jim. There's a bigger  picture here. There sure is. In your fucking face! Just kidding... Hi Pam. Just watchin' some TV. I know. I know. It's alright honey, it's gonna be  alright. You're my girl and that's  the way it's always gonna stay. So, let's keep that money machine  rolling. Come on guys... Right on Jimbo. When I was back there in seminary  school  There was a person there  Who put forth the proposition  That you can petition the Lord with  prayer  Petition the Lord with prayer  Petition the Lord with prayer Where the hell did she go? Can you give me sanctuary  I must find a place to hide  A place for me to hide... Can you find me soft asylum  I can't make it any more  The man is at the door Catacombs, nursury bones  Winter women  Streets and shoes, avenues  Leather riders selling shoes Successful hills are here to stay  Everything must be this way  Gentle street where people play  Welcome to the soft parade All our lives we sweat and save  Building for a shallow grave The soft parade has now begun  Listen to the engines hum  People out to have some fun  A cobra on my left  Leopard on my right Calling on the dogs (5)  When all else fails  You can whip the horses' eyes  And make them sleep  And cry. Why does my mind circle around you?  Why do planets wonder what it would  be like to be you?  All your soft wild promises were  words, birds,  Endlessly in flight  Being drunk is the best disguise  As the body is ravaged  The spirit grows stronger Let's send out for some pizza Jim. Nah, how 'bout some tacos when we're  through? The world on fire  Taxi from Africa  The grand hotel he was drunk a big  party last night back, going back in  all directions sleeping these insane  hours I'll never wake up in a good  mood again  I'm sick of these stinky boots  Do you know we are being led to  slaughters by placid admirals?  And that fat slow generals are getting  obscene on young blood?  Do you know we are ruled by TV? Oh great Creator of Being  Grant us one more hour to perform  our art and perfect our lives  The moths and atheists are doubly  divine in dying  We live, we die, and death not ends  it  Journey we more into the nightmare  We're reaching for death on the end  of a candle  We're trying for something that's  already found us... A hot night in Miami January '69 --  every space in the auditorium is  consumed... unfortunately the Doors  have long since sold out. They've  become an act. Morrison "falls" off  the stage at least every other  performance. "The Soft Parade" album  only confirms the plasticity of their  approach. Songs like "Touch Me" and  "Follow Me Down" are not the Doors  we once knew. So the question is:  Why am I here? Are funerals  entertainment? He ain't gonna show! I know it man.  We should fuckin' go on without him. Bill's with him. They're an hour  away, he'll get him here. More! Four more all around and up and down! Don't be so melodramatic Bill, it's  not fun anymore. I can't fly sober. I care. Come on Jim, we'll get fuckin' laid  in Miami. You're an awful little guy to be  talking like that. Chump change, we're working for chump  change. I got an idea Bill, you're fired. Listen to 'em! They're not coming  for the music anymore. They're coming  to see a fuckin' freak show! You think it's easy for him. He moves  left he's got vice squad, on the  right narcs -- and the audience just  waiting for him to get busted. He wanted it! Not us. I just don't  fuckin' get the point anymore. I  never did I guess. Y'ask me he's  just become a drunken fuckin' asshole  that's what. And he's gonna take us  down with him. Compassion was never your forte man. Don't lecture me Mr. Philosopher,  you never felt a fuckin thing in  your life. I loved that man. I loved  what he was. It ain't the old Jim that's for sure.  I think he's living for everybody  else man and somewhere along the way  he's lost his own self. The wine man, the ancient wine. The  ancient wine. What? Something he once told us. About  Dionysos. When the madness took  over... If your name is Rita, then yor ol  man must be ol man Rita!! That ol man Riva, he just keep rolling  along! Ma ol lady had one of those but she  calls it a diaphragm when I'm eating  her out! Nah, it's a douche bag on a dixie  cup. Great tits. C'mon Paul, you can get us some heroin  man. No I can't and I won't. Why not? Cause I don't want to participate in  anything that would accomplish your  goal? Oh and what is my goal Paul? Death? "Death old friend". Wrong. I just want the pure beauty  of absolute zero and sing the blues  man -- do nuthin, go nowhere, just  be. With that waistline Jimbo you got no  choice. What's wrong with being a large  mammal, a big beast like a tank. I  feel great! Yeah. What's wrong with being fat. You mean "Crawling King Flab"? Rock  is cock babe and your rock is dyin'. Rock is death! There is no longer  belief. Hey, I'll write poetry and  direct movies. And what are you offering? Sex? You  can't get it up. Salvation? You can't  even save yourself. Come on Jim,  you're not gonna be remembered. Miss?... Some love. They'll still be talking about Jim  when you're a walk on Baker. I'll  make you a deal. When you do  something, I'll criticize it. I think you both should take your  heads out of the toilet bowl. After  "Soft Parade" You need an album  sweetheart. You should take it outta your ass. The first two novels come along they  love you, next few they slam but if  you stay around long enough, one day  they say, "hey he's part of the  national psyche". Screwdrives-her. ...if you live long enough, don't  kid yourself Jimbo -- you're all  alone out there, Jimbo, cept for me,  cause you're too wacked out man,  they're scared, you're too fuckin  crazy. I wasn't mad, Tom. I was only  interested in freedom. Bullshit! You're bored, you're not  free. You tested all the limits,  fame, fucking, money, -- whatcha  gonna do now Jimbo! When the music's  over, when you're too fat and ugly  to get on a stage, whatcha gonna do  for act three -- puke on Heaven's  door? Listen you two bit fuckin actor, you  underestimate the audience. You think  they all want a better job, a house,  two cars, money, that's what you  think but you know what they really  want, Tom, in their lives, what they  really want -- Tell me. ...something sacred, that's what  they want, something sacred. Fuck you ignorant devil's asshole  slave! No you. Something sacred. My cock is  sacred. Suck on that! I don't eat shrimp. Incoming! ALL RIGHT!! If you young men don't  change your attitude right now, when  we get to Miami you're going to be  arrested. Yes, sir. YESSIR -- you asshole. As captain of this ship I'm placing  all four of you under arrest. The  FBI will... For what! What'd we do! Read me my rights, motherfuckers...  motherfuckin bulls! I took 'em out!

I'm not going out there man! JOHN, C'MON!! Look at him! I'm not going out there  'till I get some sorta guarantee  he's gonna stay in line. I've had it  with this shit. Whatsa matter, scared Johnny boy? JOHN!! STOP IT!! COME ON!! You're pushing death Morrison.  Everybody thinks we're drug addicts  cause of you Morrison. We the Beatles yet? We took drugs to EXPAND MINDS ASSHOLE,  not ESCAPE. I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE Hey John y'ever eaten human flesh?  When we get to New York, I know this  chick... Come on man. I'm not going out there! We'll talk tomorrow, we'll settle  it. Just do it tonight man and... ...just a touch Robbie, it's the  funkiest stuff, you'll play like an  orgasm tonight... No man come on, I don't want any. ...just a little lick, come on trust  me... for old times, the four of us,  let's get together one more time,...  the Doors man... Please. For me.

You know the day destroys the night  Night divides the day  Try to run, try to hide ...you are charged under four counts  with lewd behavior, simulated  masturbation, public drunkenness,  profanity, and public exposure. I can't believe this is happening  I can't believe all these people are  sniffing each other & backing away,  teeth grinning, hair raised, growling,  here in the slaughtered wind  This is it  No more fun the death of all joy has  come Your Honor, I would like to bring to  the Court's attention the contemporary  Broadway musical "Hair" in which  cast members disrobe and appear naked  on the stage. Inadmissable evidence. Your Honor... any difference from  the Miami nightclubs where comedians  frequently incorporate profanity  into their acts Inadmissable evidence. ...there has not been one shred of  evidence: 300 photographs and not  one shows a thing; not reliable  testimony, nothing but hysterical  heresay ...this is a major First Amendment  violation by the Police and  Politicians of Miami. Every witness  they've brought has admitted under  oath to not actually seeing the  client's genitals -- except one who... ...Well, you gonna get rid of it?  Fucked up people y'know, crazies,  unwanted Indians just throw it in  the river. Patricia, wouldn't it be better to  have a kid with someone who wanted  to be its father? It'd be a monster. I got this trial dragging on me,  Patricia. I couldn't support the kid --  I can't afford it and I don't want  the responsibility right now. Come on Patricia, I was stoned... it  seemed like the fun thing at the  time. You want 'em? Then it'll be your kid. If you want  the abortion I'll pay for it and  I'll come up to New York to be with  you when you have it. Yes I will. Please don't say those things to me,  Patricia. ...endorsed by President Richard  Nixon! The immoral conduct of degenerates  such as Jim Morrison is an  unacceptable insult to this country  and the principles for which it  stands... Well uh, it's designed to wear you  down y'know... when that rap sheet  says the "United States of America  versus You" it takes you down day by  day, specially when no one really  gives a shit about, y'know, the First  Amendment that's on trial here...  Nobody says anything about that,  it's just uh did you take your pants  off y'know, I mean that's not what  it's about, it's about freedom, that's  what it's about... but who cares,  right? Freedom exists in a schoolbook. ...but the promoters are cancelling  your shows, will this affect the way  you play? Well, I can only open doors, M'am. I  can't drag people thru 'em. I'm no  savior. But you've called yourself a shaman? Did I? Well, I'll tell ya, my words  stand a far better chance of being  around a hundred years from now than  my waistline. James Douglas Morrison, I hereby  sentence you to sixty days of hard  labor in the Dade County Jail and  for public exposure I am sentencing  you to six months of the same, after  which you are to serve two years and  four months of probationary time. Probably a bath too... Jesus Jim, this guy really despises  you. ...didn't invite us to Woodstock.  Twenty other groups but not... "The band you love to hate". We can drag this appeal out for years,  we can keep you out of jail. You're drinking with number three.

Won't take long man, it's the best  one since "Days". We added rain to "Riders", come on. Ugh! What's that! It's you. Forever young... Oh it's beautiful... Thank you Uncle  Jim. I gotta admit -- that ain't bad for  four guys who weren't even talking  that day. You really gonna live in Paris man? Yeah John, be anonymous, write a  book: "Observations of an American  While on Trial in Miami". I still think we got a couple of  great blues albums in us man. I'm pinned man. Everything I do they  got a category for it, y'know.  Freedom's gone. Hey, I'm gonna miss you Jim. I'm  gonna miss the feeling of playing  music with you. You can always whip the horses' eyes.  You, John, miss me? More than you think asshole. Well far as I'm concerned, Jim, I  made music with Dionysus man. We had  some moments on stage like no one  will ever fucking know. Yeah, yeah -- and you lay off those  drugs Rob. We're gonna play again  some day. Jim -- "do not go gently into that  good night. Rage rage against the  dying of the light". So what are you gonna be when you  grow up? I wanna be your wife I don't know, can I afford you? Pam  kinda wiped me out with her dress  store y'know... I'll make my own dresses and you'll  see, I'll be the best wife. You know I've never been happier.  Not as much of a rush as I used to  be in y'know... this is the strangest  life I've ever known. Gotta plane to catch man? O?... splittling headache from which  the future is made. Is Pam really there in Paris waiting? Sure. The Count's there so where  else would she be? Gotta try to start  over, without all the hassles, y'know.  I think we can. I never knew what you saw in that  nightmare chick man. Well she is kinda flakey -- like me.  I mean she's just so vulnerable about  everything. It makes me sad man. But she's always kinda believed in  something about me y'know -- her  little picture of me as the unsung  poet -- and it's a fantasy I kinda  dig y'know, 'stead of the one I live. I don't know man, I don't wanna sound  like your old man but you're only  27, you're living like you gotta get  it all in, you gotta slow down man,  you did it, you broke thru to the  other side. We didn't break thru Ray, we just  pushed things a little. When you  really break thru, there's nothing  left. No music, no Doors, no God,  nothing -- only a will to power. I don't believe that. You were an  American prince, man -- with overbred  genes -- No! What could've been Jim? You  could've been President. No man! What could've been Jim? We  stood here on this beach on the edge  of the Pacific that crazy summer day  in '65 -- and we knew, you and I, we  knew we were at the edge of the mind.  we were there, man. One planet, one  globe, one mind. Consciousness, we  raised it, we were there. And now what? Now? You've made me into Ishmael. I am  the last survivor of the Pequod. And  I exist only to tell the story of  Ahab who fought the black whale. It was white Ray. You gotta stop  harpin' on that day. I was so ripped  I can hardly remember it. Hey, what was that poem you once  wrote about two chicks on the pier? Come on man, I gotta fly. Come on. Just once. In that year we had a great  Visitation of energy  Back in those days  Everything was simpler and more  confused  One summer night, going to the pier  I ran into two young girls  The blonde was called Freedom  The dark one Enterprise  We talked  And they told me this story. Well, didja get all that? You done good, Jim, go now -- rest Yeah, I got it Jim. Aw right. Let's get some tacos! Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles  California -- The Doors! ...have you seen the warm progress  under the stars?  Have you forgotten the keys to the  kingdom?  Have you been born yet and are you  alive?  Where is the feast we were promised?  Let's reinvent the gods, the myths  of the ages!  We need great golden copulations Well, I'll tell you a story of  whiskey, mystics and men  And about the believers and how the  whole thing began  First there were women and children  obeying the moon  Then daylight brought wisdom and  sickness too soon... the moon is a  dry blood beast  We have assembled inside this ancient  and insane theatre to propagate our  lust for life and flee the swarming  wisdom of the streets we live we die  and death not ends it Bird of prey, bird of prey  Flying high, flying high in the summer  sky  Bird of prey, bird of prey flying  high, flying high gently pass by  Bird of prey, bird of prey flying  high, flying high  Take me on your flight I will come again down from the wild  mountains ALRITE YEAH YEAH
