That's right! There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now. Forget it. I'm out of it. I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,, Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover. Meet the pilot. I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close. Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process -- Oh. I can't, honey. I'm on a roll here. I can't ... but the output went to shit after three seconds. I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies... I'm sorry, baby. This thing is just kicking my ass. I thought we had it with this one... We should abort. I was scary stuff, radically advanced. It was shattered... didn't work. But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of. All this work is based on it. They told us not to ask where they got it. I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know. I didn't want to know. They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne... It's gotta be from the other one like you. Do you know about the chip? Please... let... the kids... go... No good. Alright, yeah. You're right. We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here. Everything! I don't care. Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do. I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay? My God. In the bathroom. Danny, can you get them for us?I order you not to! Don't do it. Please... don't go -- No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us! No! Will it melt in there? Is it dead? What? Where you going?! Remember what I said, you can't... I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?! Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people? I don't care. We've gotta stop her. Drive faster. Yeah, gotta be! Miles Dyson! She's gonna blow him away! I guess, yeah -- Oh shit!! "No fate." No fate but what we make. My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind. Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves." Alriight!! My man! Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it? You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts. Yeah. I guess so. My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984. But right now he hasn't even been born yet. Man, is messes with your head. Where's that other bolt? Thanks. Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess. I see her crying sometimes. She denies it totally, of course. Like she says she got something in her eye. Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad. You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other? Not even of dying? Yeah, I thought you'd like this place. We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean. Yeah. Smile. You know. People smile, right? Watch. And that's another thing. You could lighten up a bit, yourself. This severe routine is getting old. Smile once in a while. That's great! See, you're getting it. Yeah, or "later, dickwad." Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out." Like that. Or you can do combinations. It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby". No, no, no. You gotta listen to the way people talk. See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that. You say... no problemo. How long do you live? I mean, last? Does it hurt? Cool. Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone." Swear. Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right? You just can't, okay? Trust me on this. Whattaya mean, why? 'Cause you can't! Listen to me, very carefully, okay? You're not a terminator any more. Alright? You got that? You can't just go around killing people! Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy! Prove it... stand on one foot. You have to do what I say?! Oww! Why'd you do that? Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me! TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now! Oh, great. And what happens to her? We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that. For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns. Then there were some other guys. She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from. So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader. Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho. Didn't you know? It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that. But everything she said was true. We gotta get her out of there. Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me? Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes? I need a minute here, okay? You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches? Max. You sure? Can I stop by my house? Where we going? Radical. What does that mean? So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you? Yeah? Who sent you? This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal? Holy shit... you're really real! I mean... whoah! You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside? No way! Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right? Yeah, she's a total loser. C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say? Actually, no, she's a complete psycho. That's why she's up at Pescedero. She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested. Easy money! Gimme that Phillips right there. SHOOT!!!! Ready to rock? I got it. Piece of cake. Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue. She's still tense. We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening. Right? I know, Mom. I know. It's okay. It'll by okay. We'll figure it out. Uh huh. Mom? You okay? Yeah. Drag, huh? Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while. 'Cause if you won't, nobody else will. But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that. Alright, it! We need it! No! Don't kill him!There's not much time left in the world, Sarah. Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves. Don't quit, Sarah. Our son need you. It's John who's the target now. You have to protect him. He's wide open. I love you. I always will. I know. This is a dream, Sarah.Open the goddamn door! You broke my arm! You see, Sarah... here's the problem. I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear. I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today. I see. So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up? But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press. I see. Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines. Now you think they don't exist? And what it that?Let me try mine. No one must follow your work. Now listen to me very carefully. Do you have bandages? It must end here... or I am the future. I have to go away, John. I'm sorry, John. Yes. Throw it in. Terminated. We don't have much time. Drive for a minute. Trust me. I'll deal with the police. Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war. The T-1000 has the same files that I do. It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house. This is tactically dangerous. Dyson. She intends to change the future somehow. No problemo. No. Pain causes it? Why do you cry? You will. Torque wrench please. No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete. Then it doesn't matter. No. Excellent. It is in your nature to destroy yourselves. Smile? No problemo. Chill out, dickwad. "Hasta la vista, baby"? Affirmative. A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell. I sense injuries. The data could be called pain. Everything. What? Right. Why? Why? Of course. I'm a terminator. That is one of my mission parameters. You told me to. Negative. She is not a mission priority. Typically, the subject being copied is terminated. Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her. It can't form complex machines. Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts. It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes. No. Only an object of equal size. Anything it samples by physical contact. I'm right here. I'm fine. What's the dog's name? I would. Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there. We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities. You are targeted for termination. The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever. Liquid metal. Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy. You did. Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time. My mission is to protect you. I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton. Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101. Yes. No. There is another chip. Take your kids. Go to a hotel. Right now. Don't pack. Let's go. I must be destroyed. The CPU from the first terminator. I have detailed files. Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here. Yes. It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia. Basically. The Skynet funding bill is passed. The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defense. Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug. In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems. All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned, Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record. In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor. The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation. No. My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer. But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone. Correct. So do you. Unknown. Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.No shit? So she's pretty cool, huh? Where'd you learn all this stuff? Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead. Everybody, you, him... everybody... you're all fucking dead! On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too! Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it? It's not just a dream. It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!! ... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see. Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --Relax now, Sarah -- I'm sure it feels very real to you -- Please continue...
