You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry. Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives? Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell. He can't hear you. Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub.... I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand... ..."catatonic stupor"...condition rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...She likes me. She said for me to call! No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me. I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've... Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl... I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...He's not here. Can I help you? He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her. Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy? You a friend of Parry's? I tell him no visitors !!! Where you comin' from?!I'm a man with a mission, Jack. Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine... ....Thanks...You're a gem. Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean? That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud. Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn... No...no...we can't...we can't.. A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight. I wanna go...Just let me go... Leave me alone...I wanna go... Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE! NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me. Leave me alone!! NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!I think.. I...I realized...I love you. How have you been? Then what do you want to stay with me for? Listen ! We both got something out of it, all right! All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight. I didn't know. I just said all I want is some time. No. ... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't... Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans. ... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little. No... it's just... No, I... I think we should talk about this. What? No, it's not... Come here... Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don't know where to begin... Thanks. I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned... ... There's coffee if you want... He says if I want to get back to work, no problem. He wants me to come in and talk and... and... that's it ! My agent. I called my agent. You were great. Thanks alot. Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you. You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out? What do you think? Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner. Say!....Anybody up for Chinese? Have you eaten? Would you like to come along? Well talk back. He won't bite you. He just needs some clothes? And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry.... I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe... Forget it... It's a stupid idea. See, I told you! All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him. I... You're not going to understand this. Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I... He's not a moron. I was not with a woman last night. I was out with Parry. ... Forget it ... Goodbye ! What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh... I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second. Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia? I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home. I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed? I tell you something, Anne. I really feel like I'm cursed. ... You have a little... uh... something on your face... You still believe in God? I'm not seeing anyone else. I really was attacked. I... I stayed at a friend's. Listen, I -- No, I'm fine... really... Two kids tried to set me on fire. I was attacked. I'm sorry. Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes. Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented. It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb. Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own! What if I was a relative? But..How could that happen? Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right? He'll snap out of it? Parry? She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate... Yeah, Edwin, sure ... and Pinnochio is a true story... Edwin! Wake up! This is a fairytale... Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin? Yeah, I know the place. It's one of those chic yuppie gathering holes. So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us? I'm... just looking for Parry... Tragedy? No... He is supposed to live there? Uh... basement I think... Remember. One chorus and out. Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day. Are you going to be all right? Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process? Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go? Where? Maybe we can. Uh...Where...where do you want to go? No ... No please ...! Yes... I... I agree... I... I was just leaving. I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT... How un-sixties of you. I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran. Want some? ... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to? They're putting me on film tomorrow. You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood. About dinner as a concept or about dinner with... Raoul ? Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel. Tonight! How's tonight? Well, since you're a member, we could... You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... Yes. They're free. Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies... Well..um...you get an official membership card... Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry? You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?... Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot. No! I told you ! You won a contest ! You get a VCR with the membership. ... For a short time until you get your own. Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out. See if you're interested. Well there.... What's the difference? A list. Your name was picked. All of them... Which means you have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue. Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies... Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not? Hello Lydia? No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks... Lydia. Lydia what? Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain... Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in... Yeah.....Hey they're moving.... Am I doing that? Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner. No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen. No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together. In a bar called Hellfire. Will you stand still so I can do this! Parry ! Close your pants... Sure... Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything... Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere... Parry, you don't have to earn a woman. It's the twentieth century. What? YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!! ..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here! NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts. This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it! You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern. .....What are you doing? Yes. I think that's very fair. Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people. It's such a great song. Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do...do you want to stay here? Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him. Parry... The Red...? You're totally gone, aren't you? SAW WHO!!? WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!! You're totally gone, aren't you? WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ... You know none of this is true - PARRY the Grail, the voices... Jack... There's a part of you that Come on...what are knows this isn't true. saying... I know who you are... I know who you are.. or who you were. You're acting really- You don't belong on the No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent Jack... man....you're a teacher... Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?... I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC! I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a fly on shit... I'm not. Believe me. I'm scum. Will you shut-up!!! Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.? No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble. I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there! Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job... All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail. You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing. I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him. But I gave it to you! What are you doing? Give that back! No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself. That's O.K. Here's another twenty. Will that do? I mean, what's it going to take! Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money. Why did you do that? What's her name? Do you follow her every day? Parry! I'm not married. Thanks... You can keep the doll. Parry... I'm Jack. Listen, forget the shoes. I'll just take a cab... Uh... I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows... I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man. I really appreciate what you did for me. It was a very brave and noble thing... Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile. And I'm not The One... I'm not any One... The Holy Grail? Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue? Him...? The Little... A quest? Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante... Uhh... I'm drawing a blank. I'm not... Now, where are those shoes... I'm the one what? The Little People? What ?! Where -- ? Hi... Where are my shoes? No... thanks... Listen -- Where am I? If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh. Have I died? This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation. I need a drink. Please don't hurt me?.....Me neither. Good. You believe this drunk? People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood. It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets... You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood. You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot! OWW...MAN... Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin! You advise us! OWWW....What are you nuts?! Fuck you. You a fag too? It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.Yep! Right on it! Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me... Why this is outrageous!... I'm shocked. With a child bearing body like yours... ... why a man would have to be out of his mind! This food's delicious. You're a wonderful cook. And you have a lovely home. Got any more bread crust? It was a crime. Come on now...You can't sit here. It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up. Beautiful night huh? I know! I'm still scared. ...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen. What are the other reasons? Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh? I'm sorry....I'm just so excited. You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet? Holdin' my penis... Is that what your girlfriend does for you? Happily married, probably. Maybe, when we get the Grail... I can't ask for her...I have to earn her. Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God... ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail. Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him. He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool. Are there any questions? Bingo! Who are you talking to Jack? Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on! Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild. Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something? It's a classic. Who? Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be. The Red Knight! Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared! He knows who you are! He's afraid! I can tell! So what? You going to help me? That's why the Little People sent you. Just like magic. You're a real honest to goodness good guy. You're a true friend . I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY... ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!! ...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this. Isn't he fabulous!? Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me. I don't need a job. I have a quest. Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail. O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -.... Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness. You really want to help me? Well what am I gonna do with it? Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars! Can I take you to lunch? No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack... Fifty dollars? Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack... I don't know. Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten. "Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee".... Funny -- you look married. Thanks a mill -- And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack. Give my love to the wife and kids. I know... Parry. See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it... But I can't get it... He's... Oh, please... you're embarrassing me. I know! You can't imagine how surprised I was. Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side. God... I'm the janitor of God. They work for Him. But I need help and they sent you. No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no... I'm on a very special quest. Take a guess... Let him guess !! Tch . ... Do you know who I am? ... I've got a right to say something. I mean, you're tying my hands here! They say you're not ready to know. Oh shut up !!! They said you're The One. Do you know what the Little People just told me? Sshhhh! What !? They're -- -- What? My name is Parry. My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry? Breakfast? A fruit pie perhaps? Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha... Great place huh? I know a great place. ...UH...WARREN! "OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you! You won't be alone for long. Are you all right? Nothing! They can do nothing! Gentlemen! You're out numbered son. I advise you to let us go. BINGO! Tell the man what he's won! Fag..a fag you say!? ... "Curst wolf! Thy fury inward on thyself Pray and consume thee!" Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!... Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey! ... It's not just from tonight. I've known you for a long time. I see you come out of work every day. I walk with you to lunch. I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in... I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore... ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you. I love you. I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss. But I'll be back in the morning. And I won't be distant. And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee. Will you stop!... ... I'm in love with you... No, I... No. Oh no, I want to. I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night. I have a confession to make? So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now... ... I'm not coming up to your apartment. That was never my idea. Well, no wonder. We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part. Excuse me... I don't drink coffee... I don't drink coffee... What are we about to do? I never say anything I have to. Well, it's enough for me. Don't say that. Tell me more. I want to know everything. Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail. We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place. Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances... It sounds exciting. Yeah. ... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman. Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands... How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery. In subtitles. How about the "Hell Merchants"? No just Parry.God, I have no idea. She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea. I'll call her. Oh, Lydia! What girl? I didn't notice.
