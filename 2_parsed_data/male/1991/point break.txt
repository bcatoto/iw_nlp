You never were... And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah. Wild ride, huh? Three seconds... two... one... Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man. Do it! Come on, you want to do it. You're gonna die, Johnny. Five more seconds. Four... Go on, Johnny. Pull it. But you gotta drop the gun, first! Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with? Naw, you pull it! Pretty radical, Johnny. Even for you. Why don't you pull it? Why should I? I say when it's over! And let my policy expire? Sorry. Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you? But you're not alone. Wild, ain't it?! See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I. We make our own rules. Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master? Sure you can! You may even like it... it's a killer rush. You'll see. Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U? See! That's what I like about you, man! You're just sharp as a razor blade. Sorry, can't do it, brah. He's on the road. And where they're going there's no phones. Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do. I hate violence. See, that's why I need Rosie. I could never make this thing work, myself. No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once. We shared time in this world. But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism. Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness. Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes. Nothing I can do, unless I get there. She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything. At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see... ... six hours from now. Whoa, whoa!! Think it through! I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second. Insurance policy. Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah. Press play. Okay! One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord! Don't screw around man, pull it! You gonna pull? I'll take that as a yes. Utah, you copy bruddah? My man! Then we'll earn it together. Here, take mine. I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me? It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer. One last speedstar. Yeah, I noticed you limping. But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all. We're not gonna land on land! Pure adrenalin, right?! The ultimate rush. Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump. Ever done this before? 'One shot stopping'... good, very good. I like you, Johnny. I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win. I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it. Check out the weight. News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday. And I was just there the day before, cashing a check. See... look. Assured Trust... same place. The only way to win out here is to surrender. You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see. I've watched you once or twice. You surf like it's some kind of street fight. You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. Always trying to win. Football's a man-made game. You keep score with numbers. But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. Just you and the wave. Yeah, but are you crazy enough? No, Bells Beach, Australia. Only make bets I can't afford to lose. Only way to be 100% committed. Come with Tyler. She knows. De nada. No. So I was up the beach. I saw it going down. you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world. They're punks. Nazis. Their brains are wired wrong. They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical. It's mindless aggression. They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it. The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild. The other two always hang. They think they're some kinda death squad around here. Mmm. A lawyer, huh? Too bad. But at least you're surfing now. So your life's not over yet, right? And that's why you never went pro? Something happened. You got nuked in the last quarter.Three men dead. One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah? Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me. Yes, your approach to this case bothers me. And yes, you bother me. You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!! Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me? What? A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls? Surf conditions okay? How was the beach? You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah? I don't know why they sent you to LA. Must be an asshole shortage. That's right. And we nailed over a thousand of them. We did it by crunching data. Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis. Nobody had to tackle a car once. You getting the signal, special agent? This is us. Bank Robbery. And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world-- All the food groups? Avoiding sugar? Caffeine? I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness. We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes... Eating solid breakfasts, Utah? You know less than nothing. If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't. What that? Yeah, sure. Why not? You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place. Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind-- Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo? Okay? That's the point, isn't it? Cole and Munoz. I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while. They found the drop car up on Mulholland. I want you two to go work it.Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him? You sure he isn't out back? You mind if I go take a look? Have you seen a little dog? Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing. About this big. Harp, let me tell you something. I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't? Look, Harp. Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk. Let me ride him in. Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp? Cole and Munoz? I been on this case for two years. What? Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here? Kid, get outta the way!! Figured you did. Nothing? They took a left at the next light! That place up the street has meatball sandwiches. Get me two. Time for lunch. Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay? We cover the bank, whatever. You and me. That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are. Sure. No problem. I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious. Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard. They're on their way to Maui. Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report. Did he rob it? This Zen master surfer. Johnny! Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know? Hey, where the hell were you all day? You gotta at least call in or something. You okay? Nice tattoo, Dietz. Awright. Get into position. I'm rolling. Cole and Munoz are going in the back door. Babbit is backing me. So I want you at the side window by the hedge. You're strictly backup, got it? Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up? He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning. Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers. Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight. Okay? Thanks, buddy. Patience hotshot. Patience. It'll be subtle, if it's here at all. No. But let's do it, anyway. It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp. Guy's the Toxic Avenger. Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon. What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car? I think you gotta hit them straight on! It's all balance, right? And coordination. How hard can it be? They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language. You can't just walk up to these guys. You've got to get out there. Learn some moves. Get into their head. Pick up the speech. Johnny, it's the only way. Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer. Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction. The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em. Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample. Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax. So I became a wax expert. There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products. The fucking punks are surfers. Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway. L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean. So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents? Be a big hero? You watch your fucking mouth! Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here! Forget about it, kid. They're ghosts. Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it. See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right? They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public. Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right? You through, Mr. Wizard? Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it. Hell, it's only 7:30. The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one. The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid. Reagan usually drives. Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance. When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish. And I mean vanish. Never go for the vault. They never get greedy. Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers. Welcome to Sea World, kid. Pappas. Angelo Pappas. Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.I asked them to give me a couple minutes... I'm not FBI anymore. Jesus Christ, Bodhi! SHIT!! Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself! No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!! What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order. Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose. Do it, man, you owe me that much. Let me hear it before you check out. The guy you killed was an off duty cop! If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land. They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it. Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over. You gotta tell me where she is. Where's Roach? Good guess. There's a gun on you right now. I'm not armed. Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!! I can't do this. We're wasting time. You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go. Talk. You're a fucking dead man-- What's this? You first! You do it... you first! After you, Alfonse. I insist! Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah! We gonna jump or jerk off? You gotta earn trust. So, who... uh, who packed my chute? Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday-- Once. One shot stopping. How you figure? Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated. A flaw I'm working on. I know that part. Tell me something I can use, here. I gotta be fucking crazy. So what's the biggest? Waimea? Don't you gamble? Where? Gonna be some people at my house tonight. Maybe you can make it. Thanks for stepping in. You always talk like this? You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you? What's their program? Friends of yours, huh? Not yet. Two years of surgery. I missed my window. Limped through law school instead. Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way. Take your hand off my shoulder right now. Caught my first tube this morning. The correct term is babes, sir. Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech. Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean. Babes. A little mushy. Fine. Not so far. Zero distortion, sir. 1322 last year in LA county. Up 26 percent from the year before. I take the skin off chicken. Sir? Yes, sir. NOOO!! Angelo! Don't fire! I know where they're going. Nothing. You sure?! The hell are they?! Angelo, it's eleven thirty. I say we don't call it in. Under no circumstance are we to call this in. I say we call it in. Get some backup. But you gotta do it. Harp won't listen to me. No way. Not yet. Come on. Angelo... I'm right this time. We can still win this one. Wait, wait. Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit. Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit. You see? Summer's almost over. They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. The next day at the outside latest. I got a feeling. Yeah, or cashing a check. Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out, right?! Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right. He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House... ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan. ... so I started tailing him. Angelo, we gotta talk. Aw shit. Got it. I'm ready to rock, Angelo. Where you want me? Right here, partner. When did Harp say they'd have the warrant? ... Felony B and E, three months in juvey. Better. Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent. I'm lovin' it. What about the brother? Great! Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile. Okay, Dad. No, but there are four guys back there you might check out. Big zippo so far. How about you? The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right? And surfers are territorial. They stick mostly to certain breaks. If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this? Angelo, pay attention. There's gonna be a test afterward. Lab is showing traces of toxins. PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic. It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf? This was your lame-o idea in the first place. You gotta back me up on this. Got it... Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet. Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned? Ask a few questions. ... Four months. June to October. Mmmm...same the year before. Thanks for the tip. I needed this knowledge. Sex wax? You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo? Candle wax. Car wax. Mustache wax? Could be anything. Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach. Gets sand in it. Wipes it off with a shoe. Shoe scuffs the counter. Oh well he must be a surfer. Yeah. What's your theory? Sorry. So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity. Well, what're your ideas on these guys? Surgical. Look at them separate the dye packs. Dick and Ronny know their jobs. Smart. You burn time in the vault. They don't go for the vault? Good move. Punk. Quarterback Punk. The shit they pull, huh? I work bank robbery. Guys I'm after are surfers. I needed you, at first, but not-- Tyler, put the gun down. Never saw him, was your basic hit and run. You're kneeling on my hand. Ouch. No. I'm sorry. I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry. I... I gotta go. Warm them up. I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling. What? Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a minute. I can barely do this in broad daylight. What's goin' on? What are you talking about? Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva". Meaning you were expendable. Oh, oh. That sounds personal. Who's the girl? Nice place. Sure. I came out here from Ohio a month ago. Never saw the ocean before. I didn't think it would effect me so much. Like I'm drawn to it, or something. I want to do what you do. It's the truth. Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right? But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals. And I hadn't been living my own life. So I wanted something for myself. Something that maybe didn't make any sense. You know what I mean? No, no. See, all my life I've done things for other people. In high school I played football because my old man expected me to. Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did. Football scholarship. Graduated Phi Beta Kappa-- Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck. I'm serious. I need you to teach me. Shrimp and fries. Bye. I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him. My name's Johnny Utah! Hey! Uh, how do I get back in? Well, I saw you and--
