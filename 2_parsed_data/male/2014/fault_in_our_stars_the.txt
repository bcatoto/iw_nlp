She's depressed. I may switch you to Zoloft. Or Lexapro. And twice a day instead of once. Hmm? Have you been going to that Support Group I suggested? If you're depressed -- -- support Groups are a great way to connect with people who are... On the same journey. Just give it a chance, ok? For me. Who knows? You might even find it... enlightening. ... we are gathered here today - literally - in the heart of Jesus. Who would like to share their story with the group? Jillian. 15. Lymphoma. Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma. Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started a few years ago, when I was... Who else would like to share? Hazel? And how are you doing Hazel? Maybe now I'll play a song... Wanna see a movie? This is a really good show. Of course we can, we're your parents. Hazel, you need to get out of the house. Make friends. Be a teenager. You don't take pot. Who would like to begin? Isaac, I know you're facing a challenging time. Perhaps you would like to say something... Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye cancer. It's looking like another surgery in a couple weeks. After which, well, I'll be blind... Not that I'm complaining or anything. I know a lot of you have it way worse but, still, I mean, you know, being blind's gonna suck... ...My girlfriend helps. And friends like Augustus here... So... yeah. That's what's up. And does your friend want to speak? Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a touch of osteosarcoma bout a year and a half ago - lost this baby as a result... But really I'm just here at Isaac's request. And how are you feeling Augustus? Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend. Perhaps you'd like to share your fears with the group, Augustus. My fears? Oblivion. Oblivion? Yeah, see... I intend to live an extraordinary life. To be remembered. If I'm scared of anything it's... not doing that. Would, uh, anyone like to speak to that? Hazel! That's unexpected. Literally. I thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus. What's your name? No your full name? I didn't say anything. Because you're beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people and I decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. Particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon. Hey Alisa. "Always" is their thing. They'll "always" love each other and whatnot. Must have texted "always" to each other at least four million times this year. Let's watch a movie. No I mean now. Hmm? I've got a car. There is that possibility. Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk. Whole thing? Hamartia? They don't hurt you unless you light them. I've never lit one. It's a metaphor. See? You put the thing that kills you between your teeth. But you don't give it the power to do the killing. I failed the test a couple times. Most amputees can drive with no problem but... yeah. Not me. Tell me about it! The fourth time I took the test... it was going about how this is going... and when it was over, the instructor looks at me and goes, "your driving, while unpleasant... is not technically unsafe." Total cancer perk. So what happened to you? Wow. So are you back in school or...? Why not? A college girl! Well that explains the aura of sophistication... We're here. My parents call them "encouragements." (rolling his eyes) Don't ask. Hey guys. This is Hazel Grace. How's it going, Just Hazel? Downstairs if you need us! I used to play. These are mine. And these. The rest of it's just cancer perks. I understand. You ok? So what's your story? Not your cancer story. Your story. Interests, hobbies, passions, weird fetishes... Don't tell me you're one of those people who becomes their disease. I reject that out of hand. (beat, Hazel shrugs) Think of something you love. First thing that comes to mind. Ok. What's that? Does it have zombies? Stormtroopers. Sounds horrible. Interesting. What's it about? In that case... I am going to read this horrible book with the boring title that does not contain zombies or stormtroopers. And in exchange... ... all I ask is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game. Your hands are cold. Ooh Hazel Grace... I love it when you talk medical to me. Would you like to be excused? I am, however, with Isaac. Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse? Isaac! Focus. On. Me. How fast can you get here? (calling to Isaac) Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is coming downstairs. A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode. You look nice, by the way. Seems Isaac and Monica are no longer a going concern. He just wants to cry and play video games. It doesn't hurt to talk to him, however. If you have any sage words of feminine advice... "Pain demands to be felt." She didn't want to do it after the surgery. Said she couldn't handle it. I'm about to lose my eyesight and she can't handle it. I kept saying "always" to her. Always, always, always. And she just kept talking over me and not saying it back. It was like I was already gone, you know? "Always" was a promise! You can't break promises. Right, sure, but you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway. That could be an "encouragement." Isaac...? Here we go... That's it! Punch that thing. I've been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis but I have been waiting until I could form a coherent thought in re: "An Imperial Affliction." I can't stop thinking about it. The only problem is the ending. It's torture! I mean, I totally get that she died or whatever - Anna. But there is an unwritten contract between author and reader and I think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract. Yeah like her Mom. Sysiphus the Hamster... Have you tried contacting this... Peter Van Houten? Sad. Hang on. (turns to Isaac) Isaac! Pillows don't break. You need to break something. Go to town, my friend. I've been looking for a way to tell my Dad that I kinda hate basketball. Think maybe we've found it. Feel better? That's the thing about pain... it demands to be felt. By all means. Hazel Grace. So I read it again. And I just kept feeling like... like it was a gift. Like you'd given me something important. On the other hand... we need closure, don't we? Yes. We need to know what happens to Anna's family after she dies. But he never wrote back. Because he's a recluse. Utterly unreachable. "Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence received this 6th of April. "I am grateful to anyone who sets aside the time to read my book..." I found his assistant. I emailed her. She must have forwarded it to him. (Hazel is stunned) Shall I continue? "I am particularly indebted to you, sir, both for your kind words about `An Imperial Affliction' and for taking the time to tell me that the book, and here I quote you directly, `meant a great deal' to you." "To answer your question: No, I have not written anything else, nor will I. I do not feel that continuing to share my thoughts with readers would benefit either them or me. However thank you again for your generous email. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten. Hazel Grace, could I, with my meager intellectual capabilities, make up a letter from the great Peter Van Houten? Indeed. Go check your in-box. Not bad. Bit pretentious. But then again, Van Houten uses words like "tendentious" and... "bacchanalia" so I think he'll like it. Guess so. Ok... Ok... Perhaps "ok" will be our "always." Ok. She hasn't even visited. Fourteen months we were together. What kind of person... Is she gone? Did she really just say "you'll see?" Doesn't pun your disability. That is huge. I mean, seriously, is this my freakin' arm or a dartboard? Three - no condescending voice. I don't know. To be honest, I think a hell of a lot more about Monica than my eye. Is that crazy? That's crazy. But I believe in love, you know? I don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love. Don't you think? Gus was here earlier. Mmm... that's better. Just use your wish. What'd you do? Not Disney. Tell me you did not go to Disney World. (Hazel looks away) Hazel Grace! You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World! (hands in the air) Oh my God! That is the saddest thing I've ever heard! Now I'm embarrassed. How can I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes? What? Is that a Rik Smits jersey? It is indeed. Man, I loved that guy. Hi Hazel. How would you like to go on a picnic? I'm great Mrs. Lancaster. You're a survivor yourself? (taps his leg) Didn't cut this fella off for the hell of it. Though it is an excellent weight-loss strategy. Legs are heavy! How's your health now? N-E-C for fourteen months. That's fantastic. I'm very lucky. Son, you have to understand... Hazel's still pretty sick. She will be the rest of her life. She'll want to keep up with you - she's that kind of girl - but the truth is, her lungs -- Every last one. Probably why I'm still a virgin. See this? This circle is virgins... And this... is 17 year old dudes with one leg. "Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout. And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And tulips. Sandwich? Dutch cheese. And tomato. (she takes one) The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry. How cool is that? A skeleton being used as a playground. Speaking of which... You're probably wondering why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey. Hazel Grace, like so many before you - and I say this with great affection - you spent your Wish... moronically. Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here. You were young. Impressionable. The Grim Reaper staring you in the face. And the fear of dying with your one true Wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didn't really want, for how could little Hazel Grace, having never read "An Imperial Affliction" ever know that her one TRUE wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile. If you were smart, you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self. Good thing I saved mine. Got it in exchange for the leg. And I still have it. I'm not gonna give you my Wish or anything. But I too have an interest in meeting Peter Van Houten and it wouldn't make much sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book, now would it? (Hazel's eyes widen) I talked to the Genies and they're in total agreement. We leave on May third. Because Hazel Grace... I found my Wish. It wasn't - thank god -- The good news is... no tumor growth. No new tumors in your body. We're all so relieved. Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing? Better, thank you. Much better. They won't let me in. Family only. I'm sorry -- No I get it. Will you just... will you tell her I was here? Of course I will. Gus. Why don't you go home, get some rest? So we're gonna do nothing? Gus again. I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep. I see your point. That is one sad swing set. You do realize... trying to keep your distance from me will in no way lessen my affection for you. All efforts to save me from you will fail. Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we Grenades. I get it. One day you're going to explode in a huge ball of fire and everyone close to you will die in your wake. There's already two people in your life you're going to destroy. Why add a third to that list. Am I right? We have got to do something about this frigging swing set. "Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home." That's why. In case you were wondering... that's why I like you. (beat, off her look) You're so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are. Friendly. Do you like him? But you don't want to hook up with him? Amsterdam! I love you. I'm so proud of you. Always a pleasure to see you ma'am. Hello, Hazel Grace. Ok. Sir, you can't smoke on this plane. Or... any plane. (cigarette in his mouth) I don't smoke. That metaphor is prohibited on today's flight. "Flight attendants, prepare for departure." We're flying! Look! Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS She is. I'm not. Americans? Indiana. They steal from the Indians but the keep the name, yes? Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the rings of a tree. It gets older as you get closer to the center. I'll be right down the hall. Thank you ma'am. Wow. You look gorgeous. Ok. Do you know what Dom Perignon said after he invented champagne? `Come quickly,' he said. `I am tasting the stars!' Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like a menu or will you have the chef's choice? The chef's choice sounds lovely. (the Waiter nods) And can we get more of this? We have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends. Thank you for coming to Amsterdam. Thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa. Belgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion. Yeah? That is just... We don't speak Dutch! She says, "the beautiful couple is beautiful!" I want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person so I can take it to Vegas and marry it. Thanks. First time wearing it. Oh no. That one's not nearly this nice. (off her look) When I first found out I was sick - I mean, they told me I had like an 85% chance to be cancer-free. Great odds, sure. But that meant a year of torture, the loss of my leg, and still a 15% chance it might fail. So right before the surgery I asked my parents if I could buy a suit, like a really nice suit, just in case I didn't make it. That's what it is. Are we on a date? God? Angels? Afterlife? Absolutely. Oh for sure. I mean, not like a heaven where you ride unicorns, play harps, and live in a mansion made of clouds but, yeah, I believe in something. Something becomes of us. It has to. Otherwise what's the point? I refuse to accept that. I won't accept it. I'm in love with you. You heard me. I'm in love with you. And I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you. (shrugs, matter-of-fact) Sorry. More stars? Just the check, please. No, sir. Your meal has been paid for by Mr. Van Houten. Who's ready for some answers! As opposed to other days...? Maybe he can't hear over the music? Mr. Van Houten? Who the hell's "they?" Which of you is Augustus Waters? Yours are the first missives to which I've replied and look where that got me. Scotch? Augustus Waters? It's 11am. Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and soda. She thinks I have a drinking problem. So you like my book. Did you dress like her on purpose? I do not have a drinking problem. I have a Churchillian relationship with alcohol: I can crack jokes and govern England and do anything I want to do. Except not drink. Incidentally, thank you for dinner last night. We bought them dinner last night? You've come a long way so... what is it I can do for you? Uh-huh... How familiar are you with Swedish hip-hop? But presumably you know Afasi Och Filthy's seminal album "Flacken." Um... Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla' immediately. Who the hell speaks Swedish? The important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling. Are you messing with us? Pardon? Is this some kind of performance? Rudolf Otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you. And I say to you, my friends, if you cannot hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic response to fearfulness, then my work is not for you. (raising a hand to silence The tortoise has a ten yard head start. In the time it takes you to run ten yards, the tortoise has moved maybe one yard. And so on, forever. I assume that answers your questions. I don't know what's going on. And yet you seemed so intelligent in print, Mr. Waters. (under his breath) Must be all that cancer in your brain. I'm not interested in talking about that book. I said I'm not interested -- Nothing happens to them! They're fictions. They cease to exist the moment the novel is over. I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid of them, please. (Lidewij doesn't move, he turns back to Hazel) I won't indulge your childish whims. I refuse to pity you in the manner in which you're accustomed. Of course you do. Like all sick kids, your existence depends on it. (on a roll) You are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed, the child who believes there is life after a novel ends. And we, as adults, we pity this, so we pay for your treatments, for your oxygen machines. We give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough -- You are a side effect of an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives. I cannot tell you. I cannot -- Lidewij. I'll have a martini please. Oh don't be ridiculous. I'd like you to leave now. I would like you... to leave. Have you ever stopped to ask why you care so much about your silly questions? Hey. It's ok. It's ok... (beat, an idea) I'll write you a sequel. (she cries harder) I will. Better than any shit that drunk could write. With blood and guts and sacrifice. You'll love it. You did not spend it on him. You spent it on us. I know... I know. Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory. I'm not going anywhere with that monster. You're a champion. That's enough -- We're at the top. That's it. It's above my knee. It tapers a little and then it's just skin -- My leg. Just so you're prepared -- I love you too, Hazel Grace. "I can't stand up, I'm too drunk." "Standing is for fools!" Shall we? There's something I have to tell you... Just before you went into the hospital... There was this... I felt this... ache in my hip. I had a PET scan. It lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel... The lining of my chest, my liver... everywhere. I'm sorry too -- I should have told you -- Apparently the world is... not a wish-granting factory. Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time. It's ok. I'm ok. Ok. What? I don't suppose you can forget about it, treat me like I'm not dying. Would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now? Mrs. Waters told us the night before you left. I'm sorry Hazel. What's that? I don't know, Haze. I always thought being an adult meant knowing what you believe... ... that has not been my experience. Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're not in my head is the only problem. I hate to one-up you but... seems my entire body is made out of cancer now, so... Whoa, I'm taken. (to Hazel, re: Gus) Did you write his eulogy yet? Dude. What? I haven't asked her. Oh. Oops. My bad. I need speakers at my funeral. I thought maybe you and Isaac... but especially you -- Hey! Would you be kind enough to whip something up? You guys are adorable. Not a word. I've stopped thinking about it. Moving on. There's a new girl in Support Group with these humongous - I'm blind but I'm not that blind. Hazel Grace! Do you happen to have four dollars? Is it there? Oh it's there. She's in the house? Who cares where she is? This is not about her. This is about you. (sticks out his hand) Hazel... I didn't hear anything. A little to the left. My throw was to the left or I should aim to the left? Aim left. Lefter. Yes! Excellent! And throw hard. Bullseye! Really? No you missed it by like 20 feet. (hands him a THIRD) Try one more time. Keep throwing, keep throwing! Are you Monica's mom? Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done an injustice and we've come here seeking revenge. We may not look like much. Between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes, and two and a half working lungs. But we also have two dozen eggs. So If I was you, I would go back inside. Oblivion. I know it's kid's stuff but... I always thought I'd have a grand story to tell, you know? Something that would run in all the papers. I always thought I was special. Yeah but... you know what I mean. What? Don't get mad -- You're right -- You're right. I'm sorry. (pulling her back down) I'm sorry. It's a good life, Hazel Grace. Hi. No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do not call 911 or my parents -- I'll never forgive you -- Don't, please. Please just look at it. I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I lost my pack. Or they took it. I don't know. They said they'd get me another one but I wanted... to do it myself. Do one little thing myself. No, Hazel, please! (to himself, shaking) I hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this... Read me something. Do you know any poems? Read it to me. Is that it? Excellent. Do you think you could find yourself at the Literal Heart of Jesus in 20 minutes. Hazel, listen to your mother. Hazel. You of all people know it's possible to live with pain. We didn't want you to feel Hazel Grace, you look ravishing. You're late. I wanted to attend my funeral. By the way, will you speak at my funeral? Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure, I thought I'd - well, not to put you on the spot, but I thought I'd arrange a pre-funeral. No time like the present. Would you believe they leave the door open at night? As well you shouldn't. "Augustus Waters was a self- aggrandizing bastard. But we forgive him. We forgive him... not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked, or because he got 18 years when he should have gotten more." I'm assuming you've got some time, you interrupting bastard! I mean seriously... (back to the speech) "Augustus Waters talked so much that he'd interrupt you at his own funeral. And he was pretentious. Sweet Jesus that kid never took a piss without pondering the resonances of human waste production. And he was vain. But that comes with superhuman handsomeness." "But I will say this: when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to piss off, because I don't even want to see a world without Augustus Waters." "And then, of course, having made my rhetorical point, I will put my robot eyes on because, I mean... robot eyes!" "So anyway, Augustus, my friend... Godspeed." Thank you Isaac. Goddamn it, Gus. Hey don't swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus. Shit! Ass! Balls! Can I get a hand here, Hazel? Hazel Grace, it's down to you. I think we're ready to begin. Augustus Waters fought hard for many years. His battle was a courageous one and his strength was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us... What a load of shit, eh kid? Let us pray. We need to fake pray now. Now I call on Augustus's close friend Isaac to say a few words. Of all the things I've lost in my life, this hurts the most. And now we'll hear from Gus's... special friend Hazel Lancaster. Could I hitch a ride? Just to the bottom of the hill. The internet. The drinks are free drinks in First Class. Omnis Cellula e cellula. Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite a bit in his last -- I would hardly call him a fan. He despised me. But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral and tell you what became of Anna and her mother. So here I am and that's your answer: omnis cellula e cellula. "Life comes from life." You don't want an explanation? You remind me of her. She was eight, my daughter. She suffered... beautifully. For so long. Just like her, yes. Not when she died, no. I was insufferable long before Anna, my dear. Grief doesn't change you, Hazel, it reveals you. And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry for everything, for being so rude to you two, for ruining your trip -- Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You asked me to tell you what happens and I wish I could do that. I wish that I could. But I can't. No one can. No one knows, Hazel. They don't talk to us. Unless... I'm so so sorry. It was a privilege to love him, though, wasn't it? Gives you an idea how we feel about you. Do you know if it hurt or whatever? It just seems so impossible. Are you angry? Me too. (a few beats) Gus really loved you, you know. He wouldn't shut up about it. It was annoying. Did you read the note or whatever from your author friend? We talked at the cemetery. Said he came all this way to give you that. Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus did. That's what he said. Gus had written something, sent it to Van What? I do it all the time. Go. Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person but a shitty writer. You're a shitty person but a good writer. We'd make a good team. I don't want to ask you any favors but if you have the time, and from what I saw you have plenty, please fix this for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel. She asked me to write one and I'm trying, I just, I could use a little flair. See the thing is... we all want to be remembered. We all want to leave a mark. But not Hazel. Hazel is different. Hazel knows the truth. She didn't want a million admirers, she just wanted one. And she got it. Maybe she wasn't loved widely but she was loved deeply. And isn't that more than most of us get? When Hazel was sick, I knew I was dying. But I didn't want to say so. She was in ICU and I snuck in for ten minutes and sat with her before I got caught. Her eyes were closed, her lungs were intubated... ... but her hands were still her hands, still warm, and the nails painted this dark blue back color and I just held her hands and I willed myself to imagine a world without us and what a worthless world that would be. She's so beautiful. You don't get tired of looking at her. You never worry if she's smarter than you cause you know she is. She's funny without ever being mean. I love her, god I love her. I'm so lucky to love her, Van Houten. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers. Ok, Hazel Grace?
