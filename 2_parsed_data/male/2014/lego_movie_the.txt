No one knows where it came from. There had been others. Mysterious relics of another world. But only one with the power to stop the world. Many vied for its dark magic. A few brave souls endeavoured to hide it from those who would use it for ill. Until finally, thankfully it was lost to history. Ours is a story of a world that knows not where it comes from. That cannot imagine what it is capable of. Perhaps you can relate. I know I can. Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this place? Must have been a bunch of lazy hippies, sitting around a table agreeing with each other. The Kragle... What a lame boyscout thing to say! You're standing before the most powerful object in the world and you don't want to use it? You're a real nerd, Indiana Jones. And what do you know of them? Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French for ciao. Gemini. Find the Chosen One. Okay. GO! NOW! Mom! It's always clean! What's the point of having my own apartment across the hall from your apartment if you're going to check up on me like I still live at home? Mom. I've spent my whole life here. I need to go out there and follow my dream of fitting in and being like everybody else. Mom, please! (changing the subject) Mom... I had the dream again. That's the guys who drew a face. / What a weirdo. / He doesn't know how to follow instructions. / He's not invited to my birthday. I just want to be normal, Mom. You mean it? Are you crying? Promise. Of course. I never do. Always. Love you, Mom. It's another beautiful day in Legopolis and on Empura Radio. Reminding you don't forget to re- elect President Iamnotarobot for President of the City on Tuesday. Now, for the 258th consecutive week at #1, here's the No News Gnus with their hit "Everything is Awesome." Yeah. I love this song! And so does everyone else! Hello. What'll it be? I'm Emmet. You creative types! So delightfully sardonic! I push one of two buttons on a machine. I would hardly call that creative. I would call that following instructions. But it says Kreative right on your shirt! With an extra "kreative" spelling aberration! I totally don't get it! Alright, kid. Here's the rules. Ooh, great. Stay on your feet-- Mmm hmm. Stick to the instructions-- Uh huh. And don't get creative! Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve! It's Sean. The pieces get sent down from corporate bundled together with the instructions. Take the one with your section on it and follow it to the letter. Keep track of all the pieces. If you lose one of the special ones it'll seriously drive you crazy. Today you'll be putting together an artists' loft. Is it for an artist? Oh, no. It's for an accountant. Oh, great. Pretty soon, the whole city will look like this. All part of some big master plan from Central. Wow... What if I mess up or lose my place or something? Just do what everyone else does. Keep your head down, follow instructions, and you could get promoted. Central's got some big project coming up overseas. Overseas? I don't know. I'm not big on travel. Whatever, kid. One more question. Thank you. For making my dreams come true. Is that a question? So. I think I know why I like that song so much. Why's that? Because everything is awesome. Oh yeah. / Good point. / I never thought of it like that. Kid! What the heck is that?! Oh, uh. I don't know. What? That's not the instructions. I don't know what happened. I was just looking out at the clouds, and-- It was an accident. We got a loose brick! Code Danger! Code Danger? What's so dangerous? Oh. Loose brick! Loose brick! Stop that building! --unbelievably sorry. I am honestly the last person who would do something like thi-- --eriously, a model citizen. I got straight As. I vote! Even in the off-year elections, for school board and stuff-- --swear, I'm not special at all. Just ask my mom! I'm a totally average normal person! Oh yeah? What size coffee do you drink? Super grande. Dammit! I can't break him. You don't need to break me! I'm just a regular old totally I'm Emmet. What's your name? 17. ...we're still following the story of the construction worker who got a little creative on his first day on the job. The subject was described as looking and acting exactly like everybody else... Police have taken the nondescript suspect into custody, and he is being held in the city jail. Mom? What are you doing here? But, that's breaking the rules. You told me never to do that. What? But I did something really bad. Mom. You taught me to be a person of principle, and I stand by my principles of doing whatever authority tells me to. Sure. Wh-- what are you doing? You can't protect me my whole life. Mom, I'm going back to jail to repay my debt to society. A society that I would like to be a part of. You have to trust me! I'm my own person. You have to let me grow up and make my own choices-- Maybe if you didn't mother me so much I'd have been a little better equipped. Ever think of that? Ugh. You know what you are, Mom? You want to really know? A real pain in the elbow! LEAVE ME ALONE! Mom? Mom!!!! Where did she go?! What's happening?! How did you-- My mom got kidnapped by ninjas then a lady turned a mailbox into a motorcycle and now we have to catch up to them! Oh, hi, Larry. Get in, I guess? What's with the purse? It's my mom's. You know what we want. Do we? Mom! I'm sorry! Don't worry, I'm going to save you! Stop, Emmet! You're going to screw everything up! No, I'm not! How do you know my name? What the FLIPPING FLIP IS You're breaking the speed limit, you know. Not to mention several other laws, as a well as a few other things that are not written into law per se, but are accepted social practices. Emmet. Lucy? Are you a DJ? So, uh, how have the last seven years been? So. I have a lot of questions. Well, so far... Why did those ninjas take my mom? Why are there ninjas? Are they robotic ninjas? Where have you been the last seven years? When did you gain magical superpowers? Why did you change your name to Gemini? Sounds pretty foofy if you ask me. Also, have you been following me around this whole time? Because that's pretty weird considering last time I saw you was when you dumped me for absolutely no reason. You guys used to date? Nice. Oh try all of 8th grade! Burn. How do you do that? I never have any ideas. Oh, thank goodness, the police are here. Never mind. Get what? The Chosen One? What the heck is that? Wait, you mean me?! I keep telling everyone- I'm just a regular guy! Oh. Really? You're sure I'm not the Chosen One? But-- how-- she has cankles! Okay I did not understand a lot of that. So. What's happening? Mom! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. She's gone. I can't believe she's gone... because she tried to protect me...? Send everyone you can out hunting for that kid and whoever is trying to help him. You hear me?! He's wanted... broken or together. I need a coffee. Who exactly are these evil forces my mom was trying to protect me from? And why are the cops in league with robot ninjas? I'm just getting warmed up. The Black Falcon? Empura? I love their stuff. My mom. My mom? No. The only thing she had that was worth anything was her purse. She takes it with her everywhere. Unfortunately it's now melted to my arm. Ow! Well, I guess it's not in there-- November twenty-second. You remember? What is this thing? It's... beautiful. And by that you mean my mom. One will come from land afar, With hand besmirched in shape of star. One to confront a great forsaker, And build a bridge to meet the Maker. This one will make the world right, But first there'll be an awesome fight. Who is my Mom. And if it weren't for me, she'd be here and everything would be okay. What was that? Where are we going?! The MasterBuilders council? Then who? Can't you do it on your own? You were all like, heh-hoo-hiya! Well well well-- You're not going to cross the city limits, are you? Everyone knows you're not allowed to go Out of Town. It's dangerous, uncharted and no one should ever go that's what everybody says. Can't we just explain the situation to President Iamnotarobot? Come on. He's just very fair skinned. It says "Iamnotarobot" in his very name! Besides, he's way better than Councilman Strawman. That guy is the pits. What's na�ve? My mom gave it to me and I'm not giving it to anyone unless their name is My Mom. Well then I guess I am. Well then go ahead and do it I shall. Okay, okay. Who are those guys? Where are we? Where are all the buildings? And coffee shops? Who are they? So he controls all these worlds? The Black Falcon will see you now. Doris! Did someone get you a water? "You'll never get away with this!" What a clich�! You don't even know what it is I'm trying to get away with. Maybe you should listen more. Truly? Because listening and hearing are not the same thing. Excellent. Behold, the Kragle! Very good. But there's a lot more to my plan than that. Check it: Here is your typical family. You there. Move your arm a little higher. A little higher... NO NO NO that's too high!!! Ugh you are all PATHETIC LOSERS! Perfect! Wonderful. Don't move an inch. You see how hard it is for me? I have to make all these plans and rules and enforce them on people. It's whack-a-mole. I get one thing perfect, and then another thing gets messed up. Ay ay ay I get so tired! Sure I do. There's one right way to do everything, and I know it, and everyone else is wrong and is trying to screw me up! Until now. You. Introduce yourselves to me. I'm sorry? Like, you say to me "Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, and this is my wife Mary and our children Mark and Lisa." But you just said it. Well, just-- you say it now. Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, this My wife Mary. My wife, Mary. And our children... And our kids-- Children. And our children Mark and Lisa. All together now. < SIGH > Hello Black Falcon I'm Dale, this is my wife Mary and our children Mark and Lisa. Well, hello, Dale, Mary, Mark and Lisa. I'm Black Falcon, and I'm very FREEZE TO MEET YOU! Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA! And it's totally permanent! Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to that call, he's going to get his butt kicked. He'll fit in, alright. Into a coffin! I would, but I'm pretty sure he has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in your apartment, and it's not on you. But your son seems to have interesting taste in handbags. So, just to tie up all the loose ends, I'll have to kill him and take the MasterPiece so the prophecy will never come true. Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do what I want regardless. I'll simply use my very special electromagnetic machine to extract your thoughts and steal your ideas like I've done for all the other imprisoned MasterBuilders. Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!! Is it much farther? What's that supposed to mean? Who could live here? Hello! What? Hi! I see. Lovely place. Thank you. I am deprived of my sight, but my hearing is so acute that I can still perceive the physical world using echolocation. Like an old bat... Precisely. I see with my ears. Now, how can I help you, extremely tall and fat stranger? My mother has been kidnapped and it's all my fault. Mmm...Hard pass. Not interested. Oh my. That is grave news indeed. But I'm afraid I'm retired. I'm sure the active MasterBuilders are more than adequate. I guess I'm not redundant anymore. Why is he being so weird? The Black Falcon was my student. They were probably right. You taught my parents... Your mother went into hiding to protect you. Your father never had a chance... That's flattery, my dear. We both know you're only here because you have no other place to go. We're here because we don't know what to do and you might. Sir, all I've ever wanted was to get along with everyone and be a part of the world and now I don't know if there's going to be a world to be a part of. That is, unless you help me fix it. And I bet if you do, they'll forget all about what they used to think of you. I wish I could, young man, but he has the Kragle, and he has the Chosen One, and if he has the Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece. And without that, there is no-- The Kragle is the most powerful relic of the Maker. Who is this Maker you guys keep talking about? The Maker. The being who put us all together and watches over us. Only by following the inspiration of the Maker can one become a true MasterBuilder. Okay that sounds super weird. It is, but then all the best things are. And what's the Kragle again? Every so often, the Maker drops a piece down to us that is unique, unlike any other. This crystal table is but one example. Some of them, in the wrong hands, can be weaponized. The Kragle, if harnessed, could-- --destroy the world? Yes. The Black Falcon has taken your mother, the one person who can stop him, and imprisoned her. If we can travel across sea and land, penetrate his heavily- guarded fortress, unkidnap Master Doris, and bring the MasterPiece safely to her, she can use it to destroy the Kragle, and set the world right. Oh is that all we have to do? That doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I forgot to mention, I am saying this with a sarcastic inflection. We need to assemble a team of all remaining MasterBuilders hiding throughout the lands. We'll scour the countryside high and low, overturning rocks, hiding from sentries, avoiding the major roads and air.. Or we could send out a mass email to the MasterBuilders list, and have whichever ones are remaining meet us at the midpoint. Better. And then, we sail for the Land of Unused Parts! Anybody got a ship? How long has your boyfriend had his own ship? I just think it's interesting that you're attracted to someone with his own vessel. Fairly superficial to date a guy with his own yacht. Huh. Not what I expected. Really not what I expected. Wow. Okay. That's-- okay. That was a long time ago. That's surprisingly gracious-- Alright. Sure. Alright. Sure. Thank you for your clarity. What's our move? Lucy. Welcome. It's Emmet. Ah. You got your sea legs, yet? Yes. What are you doing? Making. What's it for? What is anything for? It's what we were all meant to do. What the Maker has fated us to do. Okay, here's what I don't get. If our lives really are predetermined by some all-controlling dude, what is the point of doing anything? OW! Why did you do that?! The Maker fated me to. Or you did it yourself because you're a crazy person. Ah. Now, you're learning. I could just never make something like that. How did you even get the idea? I didn't. I just opened a window for it to fly through. Birds are, incidentally, one of the most creative of all the animals. They build nests. Create elaborate courtship rituals, make gifts for one another. And of course, their beautiful songs. Teach me. Open your throat and make a  sound. No. Teach me to do what you do. How can I teach you something you already know? It's already inside you. You've walled it up, but it still shines through. That terrific disaster you caused at the instruction site? That was no accident. I'm not sure I follow... They say every night the Maker puts a blanket over the world, a blanket with tiny holes. Some call them stars, but I call them MakerPeepers. MakerPeepers? MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a time, before you were born, when making new things came as naturally to everyone as breathing. The world was messy and wild, and that made it beautiful. But then, everything became rigid and prefabricated, so everyone just stopped thinking of new things. Making has been outsourced to Empura. The Black Falcon has paved over the world that was. And yet, somehow, light still shines through the cracks. Oh no! Wait! It got out... Isn't that marvelous? You have an idea, and then off it goes! That's them. Man your weapons. Full steam ahead. Fine. Full row ahead. What are they doing? Collaborating. But we'll sink! I don't get it-- What do I do? Like for an attic? Well... Arrrrrrrr. Nothing? But they were right here. Let me see that... DAMMIT! Hey Lucy, you gotta see-- Where are my dang keys? Finn, have you been playing in here? No. You sound like you are lying. Are you lying? No. Okay, this is my very special area, where I play with something Uncle Ted, why don't you have a girlfriend? Because you need money for girlfriends. Although they refuse to admit that. Although they admit it implicitly when they leave you for a banker. Why don't you have a job? Look, you can do anything you want with this big bin of parts, okay? Just promise me you aren't going to play in my special areas anymore. Okay. Is that a real okay or a fake one? Real. Okay. That's my man. Legotopia. The last free kingdom in the universe. Thank you. Does the Black Falcon know about this place? It's been hidden for ages by the fog and its remote location. Plus they have elaborate security measures. Who goes there? Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex- girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man, a pirate head, and a loud dog. We're here to save the world. Well, I've never heard of you, but come on in! Hi! I'm Karl, and Welcome to my Krazy Kastle. Krazy with a K! For Kreativity... Exaktly! Why did you build all this stuff? Well...Why not? If you can conceive it, we will achieve it. Build anything whenever you feel it. You know we really don't have time-- Invent a game, like Roller Cricket. Or buy Bullfighting Tennis tickets... Just wide! We only teach art and music in school so kids feel unencumbered. No spelling, reading, science or math, we just make up all the numbers! Make any idea thought or spoken. Rules were meant to be broken! No, rules were meant to be followed. We have everything and nothing and something's all we've got. Why, you ask? What you should ask is... Why not?!!!! You guys are really weird. Cool, man, thank you. This is crazy. You can't have a society without rules. I mean, your castle doesn't look very structurally sound at all! Who is this guy? Emmet, these people are not MasterBuilders. They do not create with purpose, they create just to create. But they can also be very inspiring, because the only way to accomplish the impossible is to break the rules of what is possible. I wish that made sense to me. It will if you let it. (turning to Karl) King Karl, I wish we came to you with better news. As do I. The others arrived just before you, which gave us a chance to rehearse the song. Follow me. Meet your team. Hey, I'm Batman. Got the email. On my Batphone. Which I invented. Gets emails. On a phone. Hello. DUPLO! DUPLO! No. But he wants to help. DUPLO HELP! I'm a MasterBuilder. I built a lot of gadgets. Want to see my gadgets? I'm also a MasterBuilder. Cool! I'm Benny. Benny "Blue" Chu. Where are you from? I'm from space. There's not a lot of oxygen up there. One time I was fixing my ship in space and there was a crack in my helmet. They say I should've died or gotten Space Madness but I didn't die. I'm here, right? Ha ha! Have you seen my spaceship? I rebuilt it but it doesn't fly for some reason. Um, maybe if it didn't have two fronts and no back, and it didn't have five wings. I love wings. Wings are great, right? What? Where? Oh, no. There's one more. My co- pilot Moppy. He's really organized. Hi Moppy. Hi everybody. Did you meet my friend Benny? He's the best. That's too nice of you, Mopper. He can really help you with your quest. Well, I don't know. He gets real lonely sometimes. Moppy! It's true. He was all alone in space. He tried to look for his space friends but couldn't find them. No one is left but me. Him. What did you say you do again? Oh, I'm a Space Cadet. First Class. Ah. We are all that remain of the once proud society of MasterBuilders. Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's not a MasterBuilder, he's just the son of one. And Lucy, who is still an intern. Hello. Along with a blind man, a pirate head, a crazy spaceman, and Batman... Together, we form a fellowship of the MasterPiece. A shining beacon of possibility, and the only thing that can counteract the power of the Kragle. If we can get this into the hands of the Chosen One-- Or didn't you know that as a former student of MasterBuilder academy, the Black Falcon was cc'd on your mass email? I'm sorry, I had to let them in. Tsk, I know. Turns out Legotopia had run up like a bunch of debt. Something about lots of spending and no revenue. Empura promised to fund the whole place. Honestly, I'm super sorry. This guy is supposed to be inspiring? More like conspiring... with a bunch of mean jerks who have my mom! You're just as bad as them, you big mean jerk! Come on. Guys. Where are you taking them? Not to the dungeon, right? You said-- Do I look like a medieval constable? No, they're going someplace much worse. Take them to... the conference room! Okay we're good to teleconference. Just, point the camera at you. No, the other way. There. That's close enough. Sir. Black Falcon! Prepare to meet the Maker! What? Like a crystal ball? Mom! I'm coming! I won't let you down. Any more than I already have! Mom! No! These are all the lands I control! They are perfect! And they are going to be that way forever! Now that you can't mess any of them up! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You're a MasterBuilder, too? I dabble. You were right. I'd rather be poor and free than comfortable and stuck. Back up! Repeat. I need back up. Bring it on. Prepare for battle! On my mark. (into C.B.) Charge. Charge! Retreat! You have to go. We can't leave you here. It's my place to be here. Go! Everyone get in my spaceship! Over there! DUPLO HELP! I built that chair! Check it out. That's my chair. Pretty good. Well, it was my idea to get in the catapult. Where'd this thing come from? No idea. Hey look at that over there-- My chair!!!! I say we camp here for the night in this creepy Old West Ghost Town. Can't sleep. Kind of still upset about everything, you know? Well, I got in a fight with my mom that caused her to get kidnapped and the whole world is about to get frozen, if you must know, unless you were asking that sarcastically, which I now realize you were. I hope so. I thought you said I didn't have a creative bone in my body. That's nice, thank you. You know what you are, Lucy? A real pain in the elbow. What? Thank you? Think of how I felt. My mom trained me to follow the herd. To lay low. All I ever wanted was to fit in, to have friends. And the funny thing is, maybe I was trying too hard, but, my whole life, I never did have any real friends. That's the most dramatic time in anyone's life, right? It's what made The Black Falcon such a world class dingaling. Yeah. It's... beautiful. Yeah. I do. Yeah. Okay. Finn? What did you do to the spaceship? It's in pieces! I told you not to play with this and you broke it! It took me years to build all this! 74. And what's it doing in the Old West Town? And is that Batman? It doesn't belong here! I'm sorry, Uncle Ted. I just wanted to play. Well, life isn't all play. Sometimes it's serious and it gets screwed up and you don't feel like playing. You just wish for once everything was in the right place. Okay. I don't suppose this is the restroom? No. Definitely not. (then, stopping him) Hey, Can I ask you something? I keep having these strange dreams about a squishy bumpy giant-- Visions of the Maker. Quite unusual. What does it mean? Do I have a fate? We all have a fate. But MasterBuilding is about channeling the power of the Maker, and taking that fate into our own hands. I guess it could mean what you choose to make it mean. Why do you always talk in weird riddles? I just want answers. Then why don't you try building something for yourself? I'm sorry, that's lame. Not bad. You're learning now. No I'm not. I'm just copying what you did. A dilettante borrows. A true artist steals. That makes no sense! And all this does? It's okay. I have a plan. This R2 unit had the plans for Empura Tower stored in its memory bank. Looking over it last night, I noticed the tower follows the same construction principles as the condos I was building back in Legopolis. Wait. How about this? What, is it because I'm blind? Check this out: 78. Creativity in groups is hard. Or we can just wing it. Well, I don't know, I've lived alone a long time, and sharing space with you is a new thing for me...no it's not like that... Hey, we didn't order any-- The Black Falcon's office! My office is bigger. He'll get a flipping massage alright. Language! There are kids here. Who are these nerds? We, uh, can't move. They're alright, baby. I miss you, mom. Me too. This is really sad. How can you keep living like this? Well, yeah, we can't be together. We can't touch or see each other. But in here-- and if I could, I'd be pointing to my head-- I'm not stuck. In my brain we're sharing a delicious meal together. They can freeze you. They can tell you what to do. But they can't stop our secret weapon. Ideas. Now go give `em hell. Wait. Batman, give me your Batperiscope. Now at least you can see each other. You have grown a beard. It's very nice. Is there something in your throat, sir? Very much. At your service, commander. Sir? Yes, sir. Yes, sir-- ow! Mom... It's me, Mom. I've here to save you, so you can save the world. Rodrigo Falcone. My old student. It's time you went back to SCHOOL! RUN! The old dog still has a few tricks. But I guess your friends didn't tell you that I was flanked by like a hundred soldiers. Now! Get the rest of them! It's Kragle-frozen! Batcrap! Mom! Hurry! No! We can't win this. We've got to hide and make a new plan. Take these perps to the Black Falcon's office. The rest of you, follow me. Looks like we'll be playing a little game of hide and seek. Did you really think you were going to come up here and save the day? You're a follower, my friend. You don't have the stuff. And you. You must be real proud of this one, huh? He's a credit to the family. Just like his talentless father. Mom, I'm so sorry. Just- tell me everything's going to be okay. Mom... Why didn't you -- why didn't you teach me what you knew? I know you're the Chosen One, but-- I just wish you had let me choose for myself. They got promoted... But you didn't do anything. Look down there. That does not look good. I've got a plan. We'll come back for them. After we stop that Kragle. Can we go in the blue one? There they are! I fly better in blue. No! Re-open the door! Everyone in ships! Go! Every time!-- Bahahahahahahaha!! What is? Describe it to me. I feel really really left out! The world is ending. Go down to the city! What are you doing? Calling for help from my space friends! Alright, you don't have to be mean about it. < SIGH > Of course. I think a big dinobot is freezing everything with mucusy sneezes. I don't know. Complain? I mean, it's not like we can do anything. Wait a minute... I don't know exactly. I'm just going with it. No offense. Who the heck did that? Do I smell something burning? It smells like a tire fire in here. Ow! Mom. Go. Do whatever you're supposed to do! Do what? What can I do? A what? You play golf? You like me? Neckbeard likes me? But... I'm not the Chosen One. Nuh uh. This. I don't know. It just came to me. You have channeled the Maker and chosen your fate. You have chosen to be the Chosen One. Whoa. That was weird. What the heck is that?! Wow, that thing is really big. Quick, everyone! Run behind it! Get away from the mist! It's a b-- So...not square. The Maker. It's all real... What the heck are you?! What the heck are you?! I'm a person. I'm a person. You on the other hand are a giant squishy beast. You're a talking toy. This is considerably less cute than I have been led to believe. So ugly... What are these?! AHHHHHH!!! Calm down! Where did you come from? Did you build that? Yeah, but it's seriously messed up. Are you the Maker? The what? FINN!!! What? Are you seeing this? Yeah. Two Makers? How did this-- what is-- my sets, The guys. They needed my help. Against what? Against the Kragle. The what? The Kragle. The thing that is freezing everything together. Oh. Krazy Glue? Good Lord. What? I'm using this to glue my set together. So it won't get messed up by the kid. But then-- it can never change. Exactly. It's the only thing in my life that's perfect. 102. I can't find a job that doesn't make me hate myself. My girlfriend dumped me for a rich trustafarian... dingaling, is what he is, and I'm watching my sister's kid while she has a fun time partying in the Hamptons with her annoying brood of hot girlfriends who won't have a thing to do with me, and the only thing I have in my life that makes any sense, that I have any control over is that perfect world right there. But... nothing is perfect unless it can change. You can make something, you know, and it can be great, for a while, but then... then someone maybe adds to it, makes something new out of it. And that keeps happening until it becomes something that a single person could never envision. Truth is, creating alone is never as good as creating with others. See. No. That's not true- because with others, they don't see things the same way, so-- I know. You want to control everything. I get it. But if you succeed, in the end, all you'll ever have is what you've got. What else could I have? Who knows? That's the best part. Use this. What is it? What is it? It's the ca-- Cone of Power. It's called the Cone of Power. Okay. The Cone of Power. Put it on the Kragle to stop it. Yeah. Try that. Thank you. It was nice to meet you both, disgusting squishy giant Maker creature and smaller, messier giant Maker creature. Nice to meet you. I should go save the world now. Let's play. Hello! Thanks for dropping in. I hope we're not imposing. There's too many of them! Guy! Look up! My space friends! They got my message! Anything for you, Benny! I could build such a better ship than that. The connection between a mother and son is a powerful thing. On the contrary. It's connections like those that give the best chance to survive... Mom... Wow. Just... wow. I guess that makes two of us. (WHAM!) I love you, Mom. (CRACK!) Lucy? How did you do that? You're right. I don't belong here... I belong here! Rest in pieces. 109. --oy! Thank God! Something totally foofy.
