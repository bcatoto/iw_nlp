That's nine for the Twins, Astrid lags with three, Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with NONE! And Hiccup is... nowhere to be found. Hmmm. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3. Scared him off with the big talk, didn't ya, Stoick? It's time, Gobber. Righty-ho! (aloud, to the crowd) Last lap! This is your big moment. Have a nice flight! Get `em, Astrid! Well played! Hahaha! (gloating, to the crowd) That's my future daughter-in-law! That's thirteen! Astrid takes the game! And Drago don't take well to excuses. Any sign of him? Ah, he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now. You sure you want that kid running the village? You can still delay your retirement. Oh, he's ready. You'll see. Haha! There he is! (to Gobber, proving his Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay. Something you're itching to tell me? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 20. Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So... Forty one? Forty -- Absolutely! You got it, sir! Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too small when it comes to serving your people. Excuse us, Grump. Grump! You let the forge die down again! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21. That's it, Grump. You're going up for adoption! One of these. And this... -- There you go! Go on. Have away. Another one?! Oh, really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops? Y'know, you two are gonna get yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one of these days. Not everyone appreciates this way of life. Gobber's right, son. Best we keep to our own. Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time -- (sing-songy, under his Bludvist? Drago Bludvist? You heard the man! Lock it down! No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24. Because Drago Bludvist is a madman. Without conscience or mercy. And if he's built a dragon army... gods help us all. Get them into their pens! Quickly! No. We fortify the island. Peace is over, Hiccup. I must prepare you for war. Some minds won't be changed, Hiccup. Berk is what you need to worry about. A chief protects his own. Hiccup! Uh... Eret? Not good. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 30. We're here to RESCUE you! Anyone else? That's what I figured. You. Saddle up. We're going home. Of all the irresponsible -- Years ago, there was a great gathering of chieftains to discuss the dragon scourge we all faced. Aye. We laughed, too... Until he wrapped himself in his cloak and cried out, "Then see how well you do without me!" I... was to only one to escape. Men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with. Hiccup... NO! Lead the others back to Berk. I've had enough mutiny for one day. Ruffnut! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 34. (whispered, shaken) Hiccup? Could it be? After all these years? How is this possible? No. You were only a babe... Boar-headed! Just like his mother! She could never stay put either. Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were back in the day... well, not much has changed, actually. You know what he's like. He won't give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him... Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury's around. It's a Night Fury! Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 39. Valka, run! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 44. Hold on! Valka... Do we go back? Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him steady! Give me some backup here! Drop the ropes. (quiet, to the dragon) You belong to me now. How many? -- Hiccup? Dragon master? I ALONE control the dragons! First there was one rider. And now all of Berk. And YOU led them to me. And get rid of him. Easy now. The same way we're getting you out. All clear! Toothless. Come. Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way. I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup. Yeah, just add it to the pile. Uh, you might want to take this one. Oh, boy. This is why I never married. This and one other reason. You're as beautiful as the day I lost you. Warn the others! Our son's changed Berk for the better. I think we did well with this one, Val. Well, y'know... I didn't marry you for your cooking. (to Hiccup and Grump) I hope not. Her meatballs could kill more beasts than a battle axe. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 65. I've still got a few knocking around in here. Ha ha! Slow down, son. It's a lot to take in. Oh, I love this one! Remember our song, Val? I'll swim and sail on savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. And gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 66. No scorching sun, nor freezing cold -- will stop me on my journey! (catching himself, If you will promise me your heart... And love... But I would bring you rings of gold. I'd even sing you poetry. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 67. And I would keep you from all harm, if you'd stay here beside me. C'mon, Hiccup! To love and kiss, to sweetly hold. For the dancing and the dreaming. Through all life's sorrows and delights, I'll keep your love inside me. I'll swim and sail through savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. And gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me! I'm still going... I'm done. Ah... I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 68. For you, my dear... anything. Will you come home, Val? Will you be my wife once again? We can be a family! What do you say? Great! I'll do the cooking! Thank Odin you didn't listen to me, son. We never would have found each other. Val! It's all right, it's all right. We're a team now. Now what do you want to do? Aye. You got it! Come on, son. Whatever comes, keep hitting the mountain! We need to draw the alpha out. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 70. Ready the traps! Take `em down! Heads up! Dragon Master. The alpha! Now we have a fight! I've waited a long time for this! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 73. Then it's a good thing I brought a challenger. Come on! Take down the alpha! For you, my dear... anything. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 74. Val, do you think you can stop them? You... I watched you burn! It takes more than a little fire to kill me! Stoick! We've won. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 75. Now finish her! No! Hold on! Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber! Right behind ya, Stoick! This... is the great dragon master? The son of Stoick the Vast? What shame he must feel. Or tear them apart. You see, I know what it is to live in fear. To see my village burned, my family taken. But even as a boy, left with nothing, I vowed to rise above the fear of dragons and liberate the people of this world. (grinning, smug) Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons. Clever boy. NO! Let ME show YOU. What...? Hiccup! Come on, Gobber! Okay, change of plans. No dragon can resist the alpha's command. So he who controls the alpha, controls them all. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 78. Witness true strength. The strength of will over others. In the face of it, you are nothing. Hiccup! Move out! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 81. This... is... very dangerous! Some might suggest this is poorly conceived. So what IS your plan?! Heads up! Your chief is dead. No one can protect you now. Look, it's Hiccup! What? You certainly are hard to get rid of. I'll say that. He is not yours anymore. He belongs to the alpha! But, please, oh great dragon master, try to take him. He will not miss a second time. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 88. How are you doing that? No! Do something! Take control of it! Agghh! Or is it? No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight! (to the defecting dragons) What's the matter with you? Never! Come on! Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy! Ooh. The chief has come home!
