We don't get many ladies in here. So your husband approves of you working? "Separated"? You do understand this is a furniture company? Your stuff is cute. How much? I'll give you one. Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a hell of a compliment. Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro. C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow! You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it on thick -- you're not gonna break it! I poured myself into that painting. It's thirty-five dollars. Excuse me, Ladies. You're better than spare change. You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap. Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work... What's your name? Mm, no. I like you, Margaret... "...Ulbrich." You know, Margaret Ulbrich, you're undervaluing yourself. Lemme show you how it's done. Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul! "Nah"?! (he grabs a PAINTING) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting?? Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. I misconstrued the situation. Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr. Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the eye. Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. Est-ce que tout va bien? Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander?? And I don't even have to pay! I'm set because I gave the chef a painting. You know what he said? "Nobody paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!" Best time of my life... Well you have to experience these things! Grab 'em!! I wanted to be an artist, so I just went! Studied painting at the Beaux- Arts. Lived in a Left Bank studio. I survived on bread and wine... Damn right! Of course, walkin' away from the bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. I had to quit my job. Leave my wife. These choices aren't easy... You shouldn't knock your work. I'd give an eyetooth to have your talent. You can look into someone and capture them on canvas! You paint people! (he gestures sadly) I can only paint -- things. My street scenes are charming... but at the end of the day, it's just a collection of sidewalks and buildings. Whew... Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard. Er, you can't rush inspiration -- Don't worry. She's not bothering me...! There's something I gotta ask you. What's with the big crazy eyes...? Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of proportion! Walter? Hey -- Walt! I thought that was you! Oh! Uh... er, hi, Don. Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail. Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday. Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! I -- I didn't want you to know... I'm in commercial real estate. YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running! Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. An amateur. What's wrong...? You're a perfect mother. Marry me. (he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense! But just think of the fun we'll have..! And I'll take care of you girls. Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend. Because you're a princess... and you deserve to get married in paradise. I knew you'd love it. Well, I don't know about forever. But maybe... I can arrange another week. What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. The image has no visual center of attention. Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes. Well... I'm not allowed to say... Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please don't come in here... Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute? Walter. In polite society, the word is "appointment." You're gonna love my stuff today. Haven't I seen that one before? Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. This is the Sixth Arrondissement! I don't understand. You lived in Paris for a week. How can you still be cranking out paintings? It's all up here. (beat; a sentimental Well, it's not going up here. Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz! You're too literal. Hey, Art isn't fashion! Yes it IS! People want Kandinsky, or Rothko! They don't want goopy street scenes. Would they want... this? Good God! You've entered a new period. No... they're my wife's. Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans. It's Expressionism. Surely you recognize it. Well -- I'm just glad you two found each other. So... what do you say? I say, NO! It's not art. Not -- "art"?? It's like the back of a magazine! "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel and win the Big Contest!" How dare you! Lots of people would like this. Well, nobody who's walking through the door of this gallery! Now please! Clear out this clutter, before the taste police arrives. We'll never break in...! Because there's a CABAL. A secret society of gallery owners and critics, who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito, deciding what's "cool." They're like Freemasons. No, worse! McCarthy, in his hearings: "That painter, I anoint. That painter, I banish to nowheresville!" Heh! You're livin' in fairy land! People don't get to discover a thing. They buy art, because it's in the right place at the right time. Hey, Banducci. I love the music tonight. It's a gas. I'm Walter Keane. I'm a painter. I was looking at your walls, and they're pretty plain. No -- I'm an artist. I used to be based on the Left Bank. But now I've relocated to the "States," and I'm looking for an... exhibition venue. Okay! I respect that. You're a businessman, not a charity! So how 'bout if I, uh... rented your walls? Yes! The paintings are available for public viewing daily, from 7 to 3! (an awkward beat) Er, no. 3 a.m. It's in a nightclub. (he hangs up) Maggie! It's promotion time! We gotta lay the racket! Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes sir, how may I help you? I'm, uh, just looking for the john. Look at that child. She's so sad. Is she poor..? She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. (she peers at the signature, then turns) Are you "Keane"? Yeah. Well you're a hell of a painter. Why, thank you...! Thank you so much! Your work is very powerful. There's so much emotion in those eyes. Is something wrong? Huh? Uh... no. No. I just didn't realize you meant... the waif. (beat; he CHUCKLES) Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece... You wouldn't know it from that broom closet you parked me in. "Location, location, location..." It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT! I'm -- I'm sorry. Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him. You're right! I know. But... I was already in a bad place. I'd had a couple... and earlier... I let some guy think I painted your Big Eye. It was a misunderstanding. And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale. Don't give me a hard time. I'm just grabbing my stuff... I'll see you in COURT, you son of a bitch! I'm suing you for assault! Slander! False arrest!! Yes sir! Whew. That was quite a load of horseshit you gents were layin' out there. Dick Nolan. The Examiner. Hey pal, don't lose any sleep. I eat this stuff with a spoon! It gives me something to type about, in my column. (he laughs, relieved) I thought you only did celebrities. Well, Banducci's famous -- and you hit him! So you're a celebrity, once- removed. Buy me a drink? Huh? Uh, sure -- Gary! I'll have a Ward Eight, in a frosted high boy. My friend'll have the same. (he beams, then turns) So! Walter, tell me about your work -- Well, when I was in Paris... Jesus, not those! I mean the little hobo kids. What do you wanna know...?! Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT! What a night! I sold out all your Big Eyes!! They adore you! Cause of that article, the joint was PACKED. And then, a famous journalist showed up, and -- I need more paintings! Now! Of course! But, this is opportunity! Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack team: Me schmoozing up the club, while you're back here, doing what you love! ...yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet said they're the windows of the soul. You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big. I've always done it that way. If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out. Baby! Hey, uh, what are you doing here? I I was... trying to close the deal -- I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter -- Shh, QUIET! Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? What's the difference?! Not all all! But it's not about ego! You wanna say you did the street scenes? Fine! I don't care! Say a monkey painted it! Ah, honey! I just wanna share them with the world! Would you rather have your children piled in a closet... or hanging in someone's living room? Hey. Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man? Mr. Olivetti is enchanted with the painting. He would like to know... who is the artist? I am! It's a delight to meet you, Signore! Buon giorno! Have you been an art lover for long..? I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't it striking? With its juxtaposition of girl, cat, and stairs... and its almost Flemish use of underpigment... Baby! Baby! Can you believe it?!! We made five grand!! Five THOUSAND dollars...!!! And that wasn't even one of your good ones! No. No no! One of -- OUR good ones. (the spirit of generosity, he hands her a CHECK) Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT! Aw c'mon! The paintings say "Keane"! I'm Keane, you're Keane. From now on, we are one and the same. On behalf of the children of the world, we present this painting to Mayor Christopher! In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia! The Purple Onion. 9:30. Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation. Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, "The Lion and the Child"! Joan said "Marvelous"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! (he CLAPS his hands) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening. Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! He digs real art. Your art! It's beautiful. You're beautiful... Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this! No, dear, I'm afraid you're confused. I painted that one -- You have a good eye, sweetie. I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. You know, the style she USED to paint in. No, no! Please. We don't chase people away. What is troubling you? Why would you do that? Is your husband that kind of person? But what of the child? Will this lie bring harm to her? Well, the modern world is a complicated place. It sounds like your husband is trying to make the best of an imperfect situation. You were raised Christian, so you know what we are taught: The man is head of the household. Perhaps you should trust his judgment. I think it's creepy, maudlin and amateurish. Exactly. I love it. We got in early. We own three. Thanks, doll. Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene? (he gives her a kiss) Give a hand to my beautiful wife. Without her, none of tonight would be possible! Your husband's quite a talent. Do you paint, too? I'm curious about your technique. How long did that piece take to execute? That? Oh, wow. Probably... months. First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils. "Oils"? But isn't that acrylic...? Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain! So where do you get your ideas? What do you mean? I mean -- (confused at this confusion) Why are they... images of children? Well, er, I've just always loved kids. Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter... I remember when she was a baby... Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. You know? It doesn't capture your feelings. So that's when I started painting her... Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics! To protect them from such atrocities! Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. Sometimes grownups need alone time. Is that the ice cream truck? Why don't you go get yourself a fudgesicle? Whew! Out of this world...! Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. She has a college fund. Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. Take a break! Is that a tear...? You've gone deep! I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? Is it the highlights? I owe you an apology. I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity... but they have a real strength. I'm trying! Ah, you know me. See -- this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art. Yes! But... what will I say?? Meaning -- what compels me... to paint... these paintings?? Cute. Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. You want heat this winter? Help me out! What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?! I grew up, surrounded by six sisters. I grew up in an orphanage? I grew up... in a world where adults had vanished, and children and kittens ran wild over the desolate landscape! Well, because... I lived it! I experienced it! Well -- NO! Of course not. It was after the War. There was destruction everywhere... I traveled the Continent. The ravages were horrifying... Good afternoon! Delighted! (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass) How many sales today? And then... we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE! Whew! Something smells in here. You should open a window. I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner? When's the last time you washed your hair? (he notices the turned canvas; he's intrigued) What do you got back there? Lemme see. "The world"? Baby, it's me! (stepping forward, a bit I'm your number one fan. But we're husband and wife. We shouldn't have secrets... It's a completely different style. It looks like you. How am I gonna explain that? That seems a bit confusing. "Keane" means me. Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes? Was Dee-Ann here?! Did Dee-Ann see this painting?! You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? We've committed FRAUD! Janie thinks I'm in here, painting. That was the honeymoon period! Jesus, you're so fragile. So you're now called "The Painting Keanes"? Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities! I had no idea Margaret painted. Yeah, we don't talk about it. Sadly, people don't buy lady art. The bar's over there. Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. I even steal a few tips from her, now and then! Behind every great man is a great woman. True true. So Margaret, where do you get your ideas? ModiWHAT? The Italian joint? Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column -- Let's stick to the family angle. Get a gander at little Janie over there! What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine. Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for. Make it sound good. Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes! Lily, honey, how are you?! Really? Did you get in a fight? Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it? Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun! Walter... you never told me you had another daughter. Didn't I? Sure. Lil's from my first marriage. That's Lily. I'm sure I mentioned her -- No! Her mom's just going to Vegas for the weekend. I'm supposed to have her once a month, but I don't make her mom enforce it. She's a sweet girl. I put up with your daughter. I never said a peep. I'm sorry. Sorry! Please... let's just try to get through this. Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat... Really? It's very evocative. ...Sensual... "MDH"? You're so... mysterioso. Er... seven? Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? (he PULLS HER ASIDE) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? You want just one number in his head: The sales price! Two nuts that fell from the same tree! It's insufferable. Why are we starving, while they print money? Because that nut's a genius! He sells paintings! Then he sells pictures of the paintings! Then he sells postcards of pictures of the paintings. I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes. It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity. The customers won't notice... Christ. It's a movement. What the hell's going on here?!! You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done! There! You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!! Get outta my house! My big house! Go back to sellin' your coat hanger sculptures on Fisherman's Wharf! I don't want her ever invited here again. M-Maggie! What're you doin' up? I had a helluva night. Worked three or four clubs. (he winks, loosey-goosey) Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town! Straight from Taipei! I think we should present her with a painting -- get Dick to flack it... Or the heck with Dick. I met a new guy at UPI... You think? I dunno -- I thought you could whip off a doodle of Chinatown. With a cute little kid, sort of a big- eyed slanty-eyed thing... Yeah? Maybe you're right. She probably doesn't have a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace. "Cenic"...? Uh, what's that? Huhhh? (spinning his lie) Urgh... oh! CENIC! (he laughs crazily) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me "Scenic"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard "e," I became "Cenic." (unyielding, scrambling) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics! You sound crazy! For God's sake. You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!! I studied art in Paris. I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand Chaumiere. I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters... I wanted... I so wanted to be an artist. But -- it just never turned out good. What are you working on? I figured out a solution to our problems. Teach me. Show me your tricks. Then you can pass off the Waifs, and we won't be lying anymore. Sure! Why not? Y-you're right! But you know me! I'm a quick study. And I've got the basics... So...? What's first? It's a -- Keane. YEAH YEAH! Point taken. I'm standing here naked and humiliated in front of you. Look... can we just do a crying child? Huh? C'mon, it's a head -- The child is this old! You're trying to make this difficult -- How's SALES? How many posters are back here? Does the printer owe us more? Do we owe him?? What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse? For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for? Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife? Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up?? What's it all mean? Why are we put on this earth? A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...? It's not even mine! It's one of hers. This doesn't change anything. Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. Start puttin' my name on the MDH's. Quiet! Lower your voice -- NO YOU WON'T! Or -- I'll have you whacked! If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler? Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess. It's life imitating art! A crying Keane! Look, I don't deny I need you. You're the one with the gift. Right now there's a shot... God, I'm shaking I'm so excited. The New York World's Fair. 70 million visitors. Opening day, I unveil my MASTERPIECE! Exactly! What have I been missing all this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa... Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch... but where's my defining statement? Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he was hittin' a homer, when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel? Posterity, baby...!! And here's the best part. It's for Unicef! Unicef is sponsoring the Hall of Education. Aw, we can finally give back to the children of the world!! Because it has to encompass all children. All races! One hundred stricken faces! Marching to infinity! The ultimate Walter Keane! At least that's what I told Life Magazine. Oh, a publisher says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book. You know, classy: "Tomorrow's Masters." So they need my... uh, early portfolio. My artistic evolution... (a bit off-balance) I know you're being sarcastic, but these are all good ideas. Berlin war orphans... early self-portraits... Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee," per se. We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife... Though technically, we didn't invite submissions. Mr. Keane just contacted us directly! Stop. Let us appreciate this moment. This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. Inside this house are the movers and shakers. Kennedys. Rockefellers. Until today, we've always been on the outside, looking in. But when we enter... we will belong. You are one crazy bitch. So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. Thursday, our book goes on sale! Aw, why are you always so miserable? Well, I'm gonna enjoy my afternoon! Mrs. Teasdale! Walter Keane. I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree. Hey, Keane. Have you seen the Times? Er, no. Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely -- I think you should read the Times. (a seething fury) What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud! Is he here? Er... yes. Which is perhaps why it would be best for everybody if you -- What are you afraid of?? Just because people like my work, that means it's automatically bad?? You have no idea! Why does a man become a critic --?? Because he can't create! You don't -- Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like! To put your emotions out there, naked, for the world to see. What's wrong with lowest common denominators?! That's what this country was built on!! I'm gonna sue EVERYBODY! I'll sue that pansy critic! And the World's Fair! And -- Unicef! Yeah! I'll take down Unicef, and all their precious little boxes of dimes! But I can't sue you, can I? (in Margaret's face) You were the ultimate betrayal! You FAILED me with that painting! You crossed over from sentimentality to KITSCH! You like making me look bad?? You enjoy people laughing at me??! Lemme in, you BITCHES!! Ow! You got all that paint and turpentine in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up! You're gonna blow like an atom bomb! Boy, you were sure hard to track down. Thought I might never find you... (a menacing chuckle) I'm a little agitated. I got the strangest papers in the mail today. Aren't you acting too rash? Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. The bloom is off the rose. But I'm looking out for both of us. What about Keane Incorporated?! We're a professional couple. Like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. Whew. It hurts to hear you say those words. I sure hate that it's come to this. Well... I SUPPOSE I can agree to a split -- as long... as you assign me all rights to every painting ever produced. Really?! Uh -- okay. And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream. It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. Surely you understand? You want me out of your life, here's my term: You'll have to paint me 100 more waifs. 100 more Walter Keanes! Hello. We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief. We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind. Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general? But we're not selling anything. We're just here to share the good news. Yes! Exactly! That is the good news! Bad things in the world are a sign. They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand. Do you know what it says in Timothy It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted. Then they're wrong for you. Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one. Because our beliefs are supported by the Scriptures. Jehovah is the God of truth. Honesty leads to self-respect. A feeling of well-being. Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly stole my act! "The Factory"? I had a factory before he had a soup can! Ah! It's my art supplies. Who would WANT credit?! Holy mother of GOD! Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down. I don't know... Walter. What she has said is pretty inflammatory. But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee! Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like a But... how could she... Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage. Hell, she busted OUR marriage! Sleeping around with whatever trash she could find!! I-I, but... why would Maggie do this? She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots: Jehovah's Witnesses. I really don't know much about them... Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom! Just rise above it. And which part of that is untrue? Seventeen million dollars! The art world is abuzz! Is it possible that the decade's top-selling painter can't even paint??! Or is Mrs. Keane simply a bitter ex- wife, trying to steal her husband's fame and fortune? Today in Federal Court, lawyers present their opening arguments in the case of Margaret Keane vs. Walter Keane and Gannett Newspapers. A trial that could produce the largest libel and slander award in Hawaiian history. Mr. Keane! Are you at all concerned about the charges? I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to have the mighty Gannett News Company watching my back. I expect to have this whole trial dismissed by noon. Truthfully, my only concern is that somebody get this woman some psychiatric care. She needs it! Margaret Keane is a public figure. And as such, she has to prove that our newspapers published statements, aware of probable falsity. But there is no evidence that our editors could have known that the assertions were untrue. We would like to submit 692 articles and interviews in which Mrs. Keane credits Mr. Keane as the painter of the so-called "big eye" children. How many years back do these go? Mrs. Keane has been making these statements since 1958. This is a very strange case. These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the confusion... It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. So -- the charge against them is dismissed. Thank you, Your Honor! Good luck, Keane. "Good luck"? W-where the hell are you going?! We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander. Just dance your way out of it. Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name! Let's PROCEED! I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world -- Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time. Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. It's hard to keep this all straight... Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story -- Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent... So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme? (like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath. S-sorry. Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant. What an outrageous statement! I demand we strike that from the record! (he SLAMS his fist) Overruled!! Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial! HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it. I'm sorry for the emotions. I'm an artist. Maybe. I call as my witness... Mr. Walter Stanley Keane! Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "big-eyed waifs." Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings? Why -- I created the children. The choreography is not necessary. Just sit down and testify. I've had a wonderful life. I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities... (he gets misty-eyed) But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what mattered... it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world. It all began in Berlin. After World War II... ...the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. Imploring me, begging me... "Do something!" "Do something." ...and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me... ...Kim Novak... ...Liberace... ...Wayne Newton... Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life." I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobile You're done. B-but, I'm not finished -- Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense. We can stay here until we grow old and die... but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word. So... mistrial? NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint. Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough? Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours. Mr. Keane? I'm... setting the mood. Getting the... muse to strike... Well, your muse has 58 minutes. Mr. Keane! Are you all right? No -- it's -- Ah shoot! My old shoulder injury just flared up. I've got a bad muscle -- I've been taking medication for the inflammation... I -- I don't think I'll be able to paint today. What are you going to call the painting? The jury found in favor of Margaret Keane on all points. She won on charges of defamation, emotional distress, damaged reputation -- What a group of idiots... a quagmire of incompetence... This doesn't change a thing! Margaret! Do you feel vindicated by the high award? Margaret! Could I possibly have your autograph?
