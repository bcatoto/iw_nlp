Then that's it! You mean the guy from the old wine commercials? Forty-six Yoyodyne employees. Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38. All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date. Who're you?There's another one we owe 'em. Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car. You wanna take the chance, Casper? Nothing to apologize for, Casper. You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight. Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--? They'll be worried. There's a Harley behind those bushes. Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula. We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it- Arachtoids. From Planet Ten. It's an antidote. A formula. Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises. Ever since that phony phone call from the President. Look at this. What is it? I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think. Look... Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me. I'm hotter than flapjacks. Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor? I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case. Smells fermented. Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher. See 'em? They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield... We will, old fried, we will. Arachtoid. Just 'grazed' you, huh? You okay? I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne. The deuce you say. That crate! That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals. Go back to the bus and reroute the call. And his soul black as the Ace of Spades. Have you warned Professor Hikita? Then what? Same one you had yesterday? I'm starving...somebody, help. All accounted for? Where's Penny? Whorfin? Does he know we're coming? Dead. Damnit! What is it, Tommy? It? Who does? Planet 10? The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy? The invisible body? Let her out. In my custody. I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. Everybody ready? How do we look? Do we look okay? Not really. This is pretty important. Anybody we know? Now! Pull up! We did it! Holy shit, we did it! Pull up! Does this thing have guns, John Parker? At least tell them I'm trying! Tell 'em something--! The door's locked. What is this thing? A fighter? These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker. But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow. And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill? No way. Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster. It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out... Got a casualty list? John Parker, tell them we're doing our best. Stall. Don't shoot! To get my guns. Stole his body? When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped? Of course! What else? Orson Wells? What about Doctor Lizardo? What? How do you know that? Figures. Anybody seen my scope? Penny--?! Are you all right? Stay here, I'll be back. It's too dangerous. Absolutely. Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself. Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right. I gotta go. We're on borrowed time. Never. I wish he was. He's real enough. She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night. You don't wanna know. Where's my damn ammo? Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here! Don't go to pieces. I haven't got time tonight. She was killed, Penny. Open up or I'll shoot it off. You keep an eye on it. Who does? It's a crazy mixed-up world. Just do the best you can with what you have... Adopted. I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me! Another 'you'? Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody? Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you? No, I don't. Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance? I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me. She was the Queen of the Netherlands. Who? Pretty terrible shot. Who were you really trying to kill last night? I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness. Everybody okay up here? This song's for Peggy. And all you others out there a little down on your luck. He offered you money? Nobody's a nobody. Why're you crying? What's wrong? Did you say..."Peggy"? Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name? Raise your hand...where?A thermonuclear holocaust, sir. These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary. ...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President. Not too terrific, sir. I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire. Hello, Mr. President. How's my favorite patient? Any tenderness?They're stealing my chopper! Not me. No way. She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--? Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo. Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal. And my son, Scooter.Damn John Whorfin--! John Whorfin will kill us! Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back? A black thermopod here? On Earth?! Why, John Gomez? Why?But John Whorfin said kill her. You look! It's not here! Not here! No Overthruster! I have a radio fix... What? A black ship? Where? A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.Now, Buckaroo Banzai? Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai. I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai. We're going down! Onto the runway! Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai. I failed flight school. They will never surrender. They will fight to the end.Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar. It's unusual, but no cause for alarm. Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem. Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command. They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed. No, sir. I think the flint...Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey! But then it all just turned out to be a hoax. November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st! Halloween! Don't you get it? Orson Welles! New Jersey? So we'll help. Let's get crackin'!New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire. Quite a guy if you want my opinion. It's Whorfin, Buckaroo. Line 3. Where's the professor? Sam's dead! Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab... Buckaroo--! Sorry-- It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here. It wasn't to talk to the head honcho. Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey... Let her out? She's a killer. Running a little late, Buckaroo. Hey, any lock can be picked. So what's he up to? I look great. Let's rock 'n' roll. She wants a picture. Buckaroo, you got a minute--? Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer? Asshole probably got lost. Any sign of Buckaroo? Cause Buckaroo needs me here. Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands. Where do you hail from, Doc? Hey, so was Mr. Wizard. Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once? It's Peggy to these eyes. Same nose, same hair. Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right? Pictures don't lie. It's a spittin' image. Pick those up, Reno. Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno. She's just a damn road hugger, Allison. Plus the man can drive. Bet I do. That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat. Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you. Unscheduled surgery. He'll be waltzing along momentarily. What're you doing tonight? Whadda you need Buckaroo for?You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo. We know each other pretty well, I think. A what? You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo. That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo. What's it like out there in the real world? World Watch One. Direct incoming transmission. Should we be on Code Red? Jammed--? By who? Whom by? What's happening with my call to SAC? Buckaroo, come in...over. How does this damn thing work? Can anybody figure this lighter out?Planet 10? Antidote to what? Whose disguises? It's your hand, Buckaroo. What? Buckaroo! What the Sam Hill! We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces! Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped... Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft. The creatures? They attacked you? They tried to possess you?Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go... So I was right. That's nice to know... Apache? You're a welcome sight... Yeah. Just grazed me. The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster... Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems? You think they're mixed up in this? What crate? Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor! And try the President's private number at the hospital. Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here. He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane. The professor told us they threw away the key. The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension. Almost fifty years ago. Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other. But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy. His hair was orange... First thing I did. Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours. Vanished. Thin air. Got a half a tuna sandwich.Just their side. What're we gonna do with these people? They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em... They're armed for bear, Buckaroo. Check out those radiation levels. And they got Penny! Look! Where're you goin'? ...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded... ...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up! And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for... They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10! And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield. Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women. Can you play that thing? Course he's alive. He's Buckaroo Banzai. Government work. Had my own think tank. Got tired of thinking-wanted some action. Seen plenty of it too. So will you if you stick around. Nigh on ten years. Been through a lotta scrapes together. We're waiting for the Jet Car. Billy's bringing it. No! Ditto the professor- Why me? The name's Reno. This here's Perfect Tommy. You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius. Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way. Doesn't look anything like her to me. I didn't drop 'em. Why me?
