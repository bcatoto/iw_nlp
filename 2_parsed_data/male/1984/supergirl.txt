Maybe it was just an accident. Is this Nigel's doing? No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains. Western Europe. I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.She's right. They'll string her up. No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs. Turn it against her. It's her shadow-self! Her dark side! She has hostages. Yes. Just one kiss. For old times' sake. Before you go... Wait. Don't leave me. In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there. I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring... She'll forget about us eventually. Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available. Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think? But what if---it wasn't real? You think so? And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike... What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song... I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it. I'm not mad at you. Hi. That makes it worse. Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said. Away. From you. Like turning off a light. I don't love you any more. She said it wouldn't last. Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and--- You can't just abandon me. Alone. It's paradise . We could be very happy here. Terrific. If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school. You're not afraid are you? Let me kiss you. There's one sure way to find out how you feel. What do you feel about me? You don't like me? You hate me? Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e. Why not ? I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives. I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news. Let's talk about us, not her. I used to work here summers when I was a kid. Come on, let's ride. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Where Superman's from? Krypton? Like it? They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre. This is my favourite place in the city. I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower. My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms... That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you. You're alive! She didn't kill you! When can I see, you again ? Don't leave me. Let me out. I have to talk to you. What's happening? Wait...don't leave me in here... I did. I'll mention it upstairs. A little. Hmmm? Why the empty cage? Well...I guess I can't. Supergirl? I don't know. You seem afraid. Yeah. You vicious-- If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again. I'm wise to your tricks, lady. No! I don't want your help. Nurse! Help ! Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion. Why should I believe you? I know it. They think I have a concussion. Oh no, not you again. I'll drink to that. Well, just one. What is it? What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire. I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service. Well, there's several ways to go .What about my proposal? Hey, where you going? Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but... Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you. You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.The scoop of the year! Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy? It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions. Can I give you a lift? Gosh, what do you suppose .that is? I knew it ! He's working on a hot scoop ! Where is your cousin Clark, by the way? Can I quote you? How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- - Do you have any theories about last night? Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business. Why didn't you tell me? You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time? I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens. I heard stories. I don't think you wanna know. I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute. Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for treason! Did anybody notice you? How do you know? Oh, sure. -- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?What? Me? Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner? No plans for the weekend, Linda? Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here. What can I do for you? Don't you believe in knocking?Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart. You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power. You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena. Nothing's wrong with my skin. ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that? You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft. I have to talk to you. You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning. Balefire on you, Selena! You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate. Cigarette? You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months. It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them... It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three. I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second. It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff.... I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone. You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon. It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you. You see, a tree is a living thing. Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this. Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space. Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school? It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went. It's going to be a tree, I think. Goodbye... Too late. Too late. Save yourself. Yes, mustn't stop. What's that? Never saw anything like that. You can use the wand. Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring! Going to try. Didn't say I could. Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they? Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth? Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question. No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think. No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it. But it's impossible. There is a way. No, that's not true---there's well...no-- There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here. Of course, my dear. What can I do? Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad. The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools. What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time. No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness. What? Palace? Hardly. Criminals. Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people. It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces--- Shouldnt've done that. Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself? This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
