Women! Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it. Where's the women, man? We gotta have women. Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads. You're kidding. Yeah. What is it? I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion? Hey, man, congratulations! Man, you're losing your audience. Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France. Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you? Hey, you guys, what's going on? I'd like to jerk and press those babies. When do the girls get to the party? What time are we supposed to get to the hotel? Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters. She's mine! You've had it. I'm gonna get you. Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be. Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone! Low mileage... Handles like a dream. I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie. I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap. I love that car. Great car. See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche. I'm ready to make you another deal. I don't want any trouble. Rick, I want to talk to you. He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would. Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools... Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart... Seventy-five hundred. Five thousand dollars. You dump her and I'll give you cash. I want Debbie. And... Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere... Yes I did. Mr. Thomerson. Yes, sir. 1002. The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down... Right. Hey, shut up. Okay, sir. Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise. What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you. Thanks for the advise, sir. But how can I do that? I've tried to change her mind. Yes, sir, I am. Thank you, sir. Sure have... Hi, everybody. Am I late? I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy. That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me. You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel? Angry, Deb. Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb. No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy. You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me? You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough... It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas. Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh? Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it. I think I screwed that one once. Well... hope she'll be very happy. Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying? Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.That's more like it. This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere. Why? What are you... Screw you! Your whores never showed up. Jumbo, where the hell are the women? Okay. Nice to meet you both. Park View Hotel, Room 1002. So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop. Rick, I really think I'm in love. Yes. Screw that. I'm going to see what the hell happened. This place should have been wall to wall tits by now. What's going on? Let's have a toast. Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married? Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement? Let's go. Screw you... Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting. Hi, guys. Milt? Sold. 45 minutes. No problem. I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel. I'll take some. I want women. You're a pimp?Give him the works. Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls. Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash. I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got? That's it, prick lips. They left an hour ago, pink nuts. What are you talking about, asshole? They'll be up there in a half hour. Let's see your bread.That's it. I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends. I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch. Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody. It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs... It's Bullwinkle. Ha, ha, ha. I couldn't find any razor blades. I'm trying to slash my wrists. Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party. Yeah, I guess so. No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now. I just want to be alone. Guys, I think I'd rather stay here. She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man? My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit. Right. You want to share it?You're all under arrest. Open up! Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys. It's on the tenth floor. This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?Fine. How's everything going? Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is? Hello?All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes. Take hold of yourself. What room are they in? Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened? Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling... Shut up, I'm talking here. Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage. Well, tell the asshole to shut up. So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me? Keep me informed. If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed... ...I'd take more persuasive action. It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there. Cole, I don't want you to give up on her. I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick. Nice shot. So, Cole, you been practicing your game? Not at all. We're just finishing lunch. Any time, Al. Great bathing suit. A real turd. My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch... Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am. Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable... No sob story is going to change my mind. Rick! First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life... Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions... Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes. Rick, I want to cut through the b.s. Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it. All right, who serves? No, Brett, I... The phone made me do it! The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck. In a second... And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words. No. Let's at least finish the set.I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes. Chulo, one thing at a time. Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living. What? Rick's got an important announcement to make. Good. Is that all the coke in the place? Larry, you and your wife got problems? So, Larry, how have you been? I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons? Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture. Mrs.? How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...? You got it. What's with her costume? Debbie. Guess who's here? Another surprise guest. Reach out and snort someone. I'll stop him... You stall him. What are you going to do about it? And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree... Hey, you guys... Take care. Very. Still drawing a blank. Got me. I don't know. I'm proud of you, lad. How'd it go? That's the old Rick! Right in there, pal. I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please. This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet. Rick, I'm concerned. I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now? So long, Father. The best table in the house. My gift to you. C'mon. I insist. Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody. This isn't right. Then it's on to the real thing. We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"... What's the matter? Where the hell is he? Where'd she go?Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro. Okay... This is it... I'm getting married. I've decided not to run for President. We're going for a little liquid refreshment. Fan out and look for them. Cole, what the hell are you doing? Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy? Maybe it had something to do. So does Debbie. Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie? The car for Debbie? I'm very happy for you two. The best. Ooh, be still, my heart. Oh, come on, just a little. Ah, Cole. I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service. Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now. Thanks, Dad. Cole, go away. What is this person's story here? I'm marrying Debbie. Not interested. No. What's Debbie's blue book value right now? Cole... Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding? Bond... James Bond. This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout? Are you okay? You're on. Great. Now, what do you want to do about it? See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand? You don't believe me? Okay, fine. I am committed. I love you. I don't want that. I want to be with you. Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly. C'mon, I knew it was you. How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker. Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap. Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her. Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave. Did I promise that? I don't remember that... Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady. This is it, lady. Last stop. Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... We're going to the chapel and we're... Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness. Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland. Good... C'mere. I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right. About what? What's the matter? Oh... I got something for that. Huh? Wha... Oh, those. Why do you ask? No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home. Yes, but looks are deceiving... Not in this case, however. Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. Well, what do you think? Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me. Don't worry... it's supposed to do this. It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished. But a fabulous cook. This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on. Gary, how we doing, big stallion? I didn't know you were into that. Hookers beat you up? Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you. Guy paints a beautiful picture. It's true. Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner. Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will. Because I love her. What can I tell you? All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is. Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody. Gary, you're quite an animal. It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful... Hi, guys. We brought back a friend. No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party. Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up. You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor? What the hell are you doing? Really? You okay? Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean. All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest." C'mon, Larry. Be good for you. What do you mean, it changes? Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while. Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck. Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid! I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job. What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later. Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002. Are any of those right? Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E. The end. Oh, no! Welcome, welcome, one and all. Feel free. Mr. Thomerson, I... I'd love that. Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience. Can't I just maim it a little? Oops! I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom. My Debbie? Who? I'm saved. Let's party! What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing. How about this, a Trojan donkey. Who's your friend? Now, don't get into any trouble. C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business. He look familiar? How 'bout this? What's this? Who was that? Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister. If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics. Oooooo. Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens. About what? I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure. I think you'll enjoy this table. Under the table! What the hell is that? I'm not really hungry. Don't you love it when old friends stop by? Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican. Olivier's in that, right? Nothing... Let's get crazy! Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight. She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce. Great. I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing? Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help. Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect? Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break. That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood. Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay? True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already? You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky. Right... Think it over. Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book. You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak. I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment. All right! I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero. You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together? Can you believe how perfect it fits? Maybe I did... I don't remember. I don't know.Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party. Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts. Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next. Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first. Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action. You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that. Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me. Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular. I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once. What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out. How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
