Forty-niner and his daughter Clementine.  Oh my darlin, oh my darlin... Clementine Clemen- Let me see your drivers license. Post ten-eighteen. Post ten-eighteen. From out of town, hmm? What's you got  in the trunk? oah...you don't want to look in there. Give me the keys. AHHHHHH! Oh my darlin Clementine, you are lost  now gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine. Do Do Do De Do De Do De Do De Do Feeling  Do De Da Do De Do De Do Feeling seven-up.  I'm feeling seven-up. Feeling seven  up. I'm feeling seven up. It's a crisp  refreshing feeling crystal clear and  light. America's drinking seven-up and  it sure feels right. Feeling lucky seven. Kevin stop singing man. Feeling seven eleven. Hum. I wasn't singing guy. I'm standing right next to you and you're  fucking (flippin) singing. Cut it out. Jeeze. Why so tense guy? Otto? Mister Humphries! You were late again this morning. Now  normally I'd let it go but it's been  brought to my attention that you're  not paying attention to the way you  space the cans. Many young men of your  age in these uncertain times- Otto! Are you paying attention to me? Hey! He's talking to you! (Basta!) You gotta love getting fired from your  job in a big way, Otto. What are you laughing at? Louie, throw  him out too. Come on you  worm. Get out of here. How you doing dude? When did you get  out of the slammer man? Huh? okay What? Ow. Cool. Ow. Dammit. I'm supposed to  be the host here. Ow! Debbi honey. I got you a beer. Turn the fucking light out.] What are you doing? Nobody supposed  to be up here. This is my parent's room.Dude, nobody supposed to be up here,  this is my parent's room.) Don't want to talk about anything else.  We don't want to know. We're just dedicated...to  our favorite shows. Saturday night live,  Monday night football, Dallas, Jeffersons,  Gilligan's island, Flintstones. ] Hey kid! (Honk) Hey! Hey kid! Hey! Hey!  Are you hard of hearing? What do you want? You want to make ten bucks? Fuck you, queer.(Shove off, pervert) Now waita minute wait a minute kid you  got the wrong idea. Look my old lady  is real sick and I got to get her to  the hospital, okay? So what? Take her there. I can't. I can't leave her car in this  bad area. Look I need some helpful soul  to drive it for me, okay? She's pregnant.  She's with twins. She could drop at  any time. All right? Well, uh, how much are you going to  give me? Fifteen bucks. No. Won't do it for less than twenty. Twenty-five. Follow me in my old lady's  car. Itï¿½s right here. okay? All right... Where's, uh, where's your  old lady at? Never mind about that. Right now we  need to get both of my cars out of this  bad area, allright? Come on. (baby crying) Papa! (?) aqui. un gringo  (en la calle con su coche) Let's go. You know damn straight what I'm talking  about. It's sitting right out side.  It took me two weeks to get this money  up so I can come and get it. Are you going to give me my car or do  I got to go to your house and shove  your dog's head down the toilet. You damn right it is. Say moma what's happening? You want  to take a lift? Shut up Plettschner. Honey I don't know, some alley uh. Hey  kid! What? Hey what street was the Cutlass on? I don't know. What happened to your  old lady? My old lady? Oh shit (shoot)! I forgot  all about her. Well she'll take the  bus. She's a rock. Hey come on in. Marlene! Marlene! Yeah! It's Otto. That's what it says doesn't it. You're all repo men. You know kid, uhh, usually when someone  pulls shit (stuff) like that my first  reaction is uhh I want to punch his  fucking (flippin) lights out. But you know something? You're all right! Right Lite? Got any messages for me baby? Somebody pissed (puked) on the floor  again? Could be? What do you say kid were always  on the look out for a few good men. Screw (stuff) that! Ain't going to be  no repo man. No way! You find one in every car. You'll see. Come in Officer Labeef do you read me? Chuck will you stop fooling around? I have the stats on that car Officer  Labeef. Ten-forty Baker What could have done that to him? Gasoline?  Napalm? It happens sometimes. People just explode.  Natural causes. What? Suspect presence on west coast confirmed.  Do not notify police. Night watchman in Pomona. Yep. Asbestos worker. City of industry. Yep Yep! French fry maker Agoura. Ha Ha that's  absurd. Yeah? Well you think it's funny huh?  There's fucking (lots of) room to move  as a fry cook, man. You know I could  be manager in two years? King! God!  (egad!) You know Kevin, I had this wild fucking  (flippin) dream the other night. I bet. It was with you and me and we were working  in this sleazy shithole (shabby) motel  down in Miami, Florida. And we were  bellhops and we were sixty-five years  old. It was so real it was really real,  realistic. And then what, you woke up in a puddle  (cold sweat)? Fuck you! (drop dead) Fucking (you) jerk. Where you going asshole (snotnose)? Away from you. Mother, father. Got anything to eat? Occasionally we get a letter from a  viewer that says now the only reason  Reverend Larry comes on your television  set is because he wants your money.  And do you know what? They're right!  I do want your money. Because god wants  your money. So I want you to go out  and mortgage that home and sell that  car and send me your money. You don't  need that car. (continues in background) I couldn't enjoy it any more mom MMM  MMM MMM This is swell. Dad? Hey Dad? What is it son? Do you remember that you once told me  along time ago. Well not too long ago  but ummm. That you told me that you'd  give me a thousand dollars to go to  Europe if I finish school. Well you  know something? You were right. About  finishing school that's ah that's what  I'd like to do. But umm I want to know  if I could have the money first. Like  now. [You know I really love you Dad  I've always loved you. You too mom.  What do you say? I don't have it anymore. What?] Well what about me? You're on the honor roll of the chariots  of fire. Same as us, Otto. It was a  gift. From all of us jointly. So how much do I get paid, twenty-five  buck a car. Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding,  you work on commission, that's better  than getting paid. Most cars you rip are worth two or three  hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar  Porsche (german pronounciation) might  make ya five grand. It helps if you dress like a detective,  too. Detectives dress kind of square.  People think this guy is a cop. They're  going to think you're packing something.  They don't fuck (mess) with you so much. Are you? Am I what? Packin' something. Ha. Only an asshole (a jackass) gets  killed for a car. Guys who make it are  the guys who get into their cars at  anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up  at four. That's why there ain't a repo  man I know that don't take speed. Speed huh? I'll call you back! (hangs up) Flippin  general telephone. C'mon. Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired  a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk.  I shall not cause harm to any vehicle  nor the personal contents thereof. Nor  through inaction let that vehicle or  the personal contents thereof come to  harm. That's what I call the repo code  kid. Don't forget it etch it in your  brain. Not many people got a code to  live by anymore. Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those  assholes (that) over there. Ordinary  people I hate 'em. Me too. What do you know? See an ordinary person  spend his life avoiding tense situations.  Repoman spends his life getting into  tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink. Tense situations kid. Get into five  or six of them a day and it don't mean  shit (zilch) anymore. I mean I seen  men stabbed and it didn't mean shit  (zilch). I've seen guns. Guns too they  don't mean shit (zilch) but that's when  you got to watch your self. Here I'll  handle it pal. Uh settle down. Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day,  it doesn't mean shit (zilch). Wasn't that Otto? You gotta watch yourself. (takes off  mask) Have a nice day . . . night. This is what I call phase 2 ace. If  the dealer don't have the keys, you  call the truck. And it is a heartbreak  to be sitting waiting for the truck  and the giblet comes out and drives  it away. Once you've got this baby on  the hooks, she's all ours. Oh no you don't. I'm nipping this in  the bud right now. You are not going  to take this car. I know my rights.  There is absolutely no way you're going  to take it. Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman? Obviously not. I'm Arthur Pakman. Luann  is my daughter. Now you're going to  have to take this matter up with her. Well don't think I haven't tried, sir,  but she hasn't had the decency to call  us in months. I mean, I've skipped trace  this car all over town. Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn  car isn't working anyway, and I know,  I know that's why she hasn't paid you. Well, she could have called us? Look,  all you've go to do is call my branch  manager, I will abide with whatever  he says. I. G. Farben. . . What do you take me  for, a moron? If I go in there, you're  going to take this car away. What, and lose my job? The law requires  that I stay right here until you call  my branch manager. That's the law? That's the law. I'll be right back. There's going to be some bad shit (stuff)  coming down one of these days kid. Oh yeah? Where you going to be? On the  moon? Ung Uh, I'm going to be right here heading  north at a hundred and ten per. In this junker? Cool car. Uh Oh! The Rodriguez brothers. Motherfucker just flipped you off. Roll the window down.] Roll the window  down. A donde vas, pendejo? A chingas tu esposa! Hey Bud, hey Bud, who's your new girlfriend? Watch it mother fucker. (Girlfriend?  watch it melonfarmer!) Hey fuck you pussy punk. (flip you,  you punk.) Want me to take them? Wo! Hey! God damn dipshit Rodriguez gypsy dildo  punks. I'll get your ass!dang blamed dumb suck Rodriguez gypsy  devil punks. I'll get your can!) HAHAHA WOW! That was intense. Repo man's always intense. Come on let's  go get a drink. Gee bud. You never told me it was going  to be like this man. Cops and robbers.  Hahahahah. Real live car chases. Hahahahah. Shit (shoot)! Debbi! If you say our names we'll have to kill  all these people Archie. They all ran away. Awful quiet in here. It's too quiet. So who are these Rodriguez boys. Rodriguez brothers. Lagarto and Napoleon.  Two notorious delinquents currently  responsible for at least thirty vehicles  in the field. Scumbags They ain't scumbags. They car thieves  just like use. There's Miss Magruder. You want to go  for it? Good gag, you pull this one a lot? Only on the women. It never fails. Excuse me? Miss Magruder? I have something  here for you. Ow! Ow! Ow! Motherfucker! (mother...)  Ow! Ow! Ow! Christ! I'm blind man. Lite?  Lite, where are you man? Ruthside Peason brokerage consultant.  Fucking (flippin) millionaire six payments  behind. I've never understood it. What's that? The fucking (flippin) millionaires.  They never pay their bills. See you  at the yard. Let me get this one. No. I'll handle this one. Mister Peason  is carrying a permit for a pistol. Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me that. Don't underestimate me ace. Hey! Hey! You want a ride? Hey babe  need a ride? Pick it up! Look at you. You pick it  up. You know yourself you were wrong. Well what were they doing out in the  middle of the street? They weren't in the middle of the street.  That not the middle of the street that's  the corner. Go on you pick it up. What? You pick it up. Haha, no way. You still want a ride  or what? No I don't. My name is Otto. Yeah it's one of them. I am not. I'm a repo man. Itï¿½s a repossesser. I take back cars  from dildos (deadbeats) who don't pay  their bills. Cool huh? What are you doing? Really why? Ow! What the hell are you doing? What's going on? What's this? It looks like sausage. HAHAHAH How do you know that? What are you going to do with them,  put them on Johnny Carson? Ehw. What's that? I don't know dear.  But it is alive. It seems friendly though.  Aw look it's curled up. How cute oh  no. Maybe we can take it home it doesn't  seem to have any. Oh yes let's. But  no! No matter how appealing do not let  strange creature in you house. We all  know strange creatures are on the increase.  Many of them do seem furry and adorable,  but beware we don't know from whence  they came. Be safe. Be safe. Report  strange incidences today. (continues  in background) United fruitcake outlet. Sure Ummm I don't know. what do you  think? Ah want to go out with me again  sometime? Hey great. Terrific. Here's your shit  (stuff). Fuck (Flip me). Girls pay to go out  with me. All right? What, here? Fuck (flip) you. Man we've been looking for this little  red devil for a long time. Just act  natural. Nobody knows if itï¿½s your car  or somebody elses car. Now you work with that. You give it  a try. All right? Let me give you a hand we donï¿½t have  a whole year to find it boy. Got it. Lets get out of here. Put your seat  belt on. Put your seat belt on boy! I don't ride  with anybody unless they wear their  seatbelt. It's one of my rules. Put that damn gun down boy. It ain't  no toy. I walk into someone's place of work.  They shit (plum) scared. They know I'm  not a cop. They think I've come to kill  'em and I would. I'd kill anybody who  crosses me. You know what I mean? Do you like music? Sure. In that case you're going love this. I was into these dudes before anybody.  Partied with them all the time. Asked  me to be their manager. I called bullshit  (no way) on that. Managing a pop group  hey that ain't no job for no man. You read that book I gave you? What book? Dioretix. Science of matter over mind. Unh uhg You'd better read it and quick. That  book will change your life. Found it  in a Maseratti in Beverly hills. A lot of people don't realize what's  really going on. They view life as a  bunch of unconnected incidences and  things. They don't realize that there's  this like lattice of coincidence that  lays on top of everything. I'll Give  you an example, show you what I mean.  Suppose you thinking about a plate of  shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like  plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out  of the blue no explanation. No point  in looking for one either. It's all  part of a cosmic unconsciousness. You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in  the hippie days? I'll give you another instance. You  know the way everybody's into weirdness  right now. Books in all the supermarkets  about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how  the Mayans invented television. That  kind of thing. I don't read them books. Well the way I see it it's exactly the  same. There ain't no difference between  a flying saucer and a time machine.  People get so hung up on specifics.  They miss out on seeing the whole thing.  Take South America for example. In South  America thousands of people go missing  every year. Nobody knows where they  go. They just like disappear. But if  you think about it for a minute, you  realize something. There had to be a  time when there was no people. Right? Yeah. I guess. Well where did all these people come  from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The  future. Where did all these people disappear  to? hmmm? The past? That's right and how did they get there? How the fuck (hell) do I know? Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah  you got it. Time machines. I think a  lot about this kind of stuff. I do my  best thinking on the bus. That how come  I don't drive, see? You don't even know how to drive. I don't want to know how. I don't want  to learn. See? The more you drive, the  less intelligent you are. You know I think I saw one of those  things once. One of those UFOs. I mean  it was really it was kind of kind of  scary. I saw all these colored lights  and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights  like I never heard before. I mean it  was really weird. Bud. Yeah? Do you think all repo men follow the  code? Of course. Well I mean you see a lot  of fucked (messed) up cars come in but...99  time out of 100 it was the customer  who fucked (mucked) them up. Assholes  (Damn fools). I'm offering a thousands dollars for  his Falcon. You know what that is Napoleon?  It's a bribe. Who the hell is this? Napoleon? Who  the fuck (hell) are you calling? It's a grand if you show me where his  car is Napoleon. Hello? Prick (Jerk). Sixty-four Chevy Malibu. Twenty grand. Waiting! We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene. I'm not going anywhere. Now how come this junk is worth so much?  What's in it? Drugs? Got all night amigo! Los Hermanos Rodriguez don't approve  of drugs. I'm going to get your . Don't care how long it takes, dildos  (jerks). Repo man's got all night every  night. Hey Leila! All right, um, this is Otto.  The guy who gave you a ride and stuff.  I heard something about that car. Huh? Oh! Take off your clothes. Oh yeah? Me too. Says who? Heh, I guess that means no.] See that motherfucker (melonfarmer)  only thinks I don't know what's going  on, Lite. As soon as I find that Chevy  I'm going indy. I'm going to buy myself  a tow truck, a couple of pitbulls, and  run a yard. Sit around and watch everybody  else do the work for a while (change). No way you can do that on twenty grand  man. The hell I can as long as you have good  credit and my credit is spotless. The hell I can't, as long as your credit  record's good and mine is spotless.) If I find the Malibu, you won't see  me for dust, I'm going to move to Mendecino  County, raise me a bumper crop of tomato  plants. Credit is a sacred trust. It's what  our free society is founded on. You  think they give a damn about their bills  in Russia? I said do you think they  give a damn about their bills in Russia? They don't pay bills in Russia. It's  all free. All free? Free my ass, what are you  a fucking (flippin) commie? Huh? No I ain't no commie. Well you'd better not be I don't want  any commies in my car. No Christians  either. I'll deal with you later. I've got a  customer to attend to. You too. Hi! I'm Kevin. Vacuum sir? Need a vacuum sir? Have you any machines? You don't want to eat from a machine.  Look, there's a nice Del Taco across  the street. They've got enchurritos  and everything. But I do want to eat from a machine.  Vended food contains all the necessary  nutrients for survival. Taste damn good  too, by golly. And plus, on any given  evening, the machine that last night  gave you cheetos might dispense instead...  Doritos. Yohos. Oreos. Tosquitos (tostitos?).  Or Lorna Doones. Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones. Oh hey! You want me to check the trunk?  Scuze me. Hi! I'm Kevin! Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don't  you remember me? I was here yesterday.  Heh. Listen I think I left a book of  matches over in your office over there.  You want to go and check for me huh? Sure thing. Hey thanks a lot buddy. Any thing for you babes. All right, you're beautiful. I love  you. I'll be right back. What?? It's really very simple Mrs. Parks.  You don't want me to take your car and  I don't want to take your car. Now I  said to the boss I said ah Look! I do  not want to repossess this ladyï¿½s car. Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really  on the line over this one. I could lose  it right away. That's terrific. Really terrific. Well, uh, gotta get going here. The tea? Yeah, it was terrific. Thank you Uh excuse me. Hey it's cool. It's cool.

It's too hot in here  man. What the hell's going on? So fucking  (flippin) hot I think that shit in the  trunk is going to melt. I think we better  take a look, all right? Go get us two sodas. All right, as soon as I check the trunk. We're just the mules, comprende? (Andale')... Marlene! We've found the car. Come on you guys! Get the lead out. Aw be cool dude we got more. Come on. Come on. da-dee-dee-dee-dah-dah  dee-dee... (continues to the tune of  The Ride of the Valkyries) Yeah well that's not the only thing  Marlene. This car is hot. No. No I mean it's hot really hot. Yeah, we're sweating like pigs man. It's from someplace. Ah Roswell, New  Mexico Me fight in a war man? Fuck (hell) no  way! Nobody's got to do that shit. Not  in this country. A new I.D. don't cost  no more than a pink slip. You know what  I mean? Something wrong? You know Marlene? Man she's pretty hot. Otto my man. I jumped on that action  from day one. I found out where she  was coming from. See ya back at the yard. Have fun. Oh shit (damn). Holy shit (smoke). Lite!  . Lite! Lite! Lite! Lite! Open the door.  There's a maniac in there.

Well I don't know I mean that's pretty  severe. Jesus Christ. (Holy cripes!) Hey! Blanks get the job done too. You repo men, you guys are all out to  fuckin (flippin) lunch. Let's get out  of here. I can't hear you. I'm using the scrambler. What? Happy face! You want a ride? We ask the questions. Huh? Why are you looking for the Malibu? Illegal aliens? Ahhh, heh. Did you ever think about  joining the CIA? Boyfriend?? Otto Maddox male Caucasian 21 18 Jingle bells. Jingle bells. Jingle all  the way. Oh what fun What's going on? Who done what? Oh some dude it doesn't matter. Oh yes it does. Repo man don't go running to the man  Marlene. A repo man goes at it alone. Yes sirree bob. John Wayne was a fag (freak). What did you say man?

Jesus Christ (Holy cow) bud. They're  winos, they don't have any money. You  think they'd be bums if they did? You want out? Do ya? No! What's a matter with you? Don't you  like your job anymore? Not too happy  in your job? I mean I feel like were  not communicating any more. When we  first started out I though I could teach  you something share something with you  for Christ's sake. Answer me! (heard in background) I'm picking up  the dead. I'm putting my hands around  this dead body. I'm, I'm carrying his  limp torso to the truck. And he feels  like like he has only been dead a little  while but... ott, ott... What line of work you in? re, re, re.. Rock'n'roller, eh!? I used to be a musician  myself, college days. Of course it was  folk songs and protest songs back then.  (begins singing, badly) We shall overcome,  we shall overcome... (stops singing and scratches ear) Did  you ever feel as if your mind had started  to erode? No. Ever been to Utah? Nuh-uh I go to Utah every year. Friend of mine,  was a designer of the MX missile race  track basing mode. A hundred thousand  miles of railroad track on a big loop  through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Bombs  were going to hide in locomotive sheds.  That way the red team would never know  exactly where they were. I still go  out to Utah, just to think about the  way things might have been. Sir. I represent the Helping Hand Acceptance  Corporation. Radiation, yes indeed! You hear the  most outrageous lies about it. Half-baked  goggle-boxed do-gooders telling everybody  itï¿½s bad for you. Pernicious nonsense!  Everybody could stand a hundred chest  X-rays a year. They ought to have 'em  too. When they canceled the project  it almost did me in. One day my mind  was literally a-burst. The next day  nothing. Swept away... But I showed  them. I had a lobotomy in the end. Lobotomy? Isn't that for loonies? Not at all. A friend of mine had one.  Designer of the neutron bomb. Ever hear  of the neutron bomb? Destroys people.  Leaves buildings standing. It fits in  a suit case. It's so small no one knows  it's there until blammo. Eyes melt skin  explodes everybody dead. It's so immoral  working on the thing can drive you mad.  That's what happened to this friend  of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's  well again. What kind of car does your... does your  friend drive? Chevy Malibu. And you do the same type of work? Didn't I tell you? I can't tell you  what I do. I'm classified. This is really a nice old car. Why don't  you let me drive? What do you mean? Well I don't know. I mean...uh! Don't  you feel funny.? Why should I feel funny? The two hemispheres  are fundamentally at odds. Hemisphere,  Hemisphere. You know it's strange. I  do feel funny... What is this? Hey Oly. You're wife's hanging all over  Otto. Um. Have you see uh bud anywhere? ...another wonderful Christian opportunity.  The Reverend Larry... Hey there hero. Get the money yet? Not yet. Oly's going to get it for me  though. I just signed the papers. Whu, what do you mean, what papers? Beats me, just some, uh, contract or  something. Didn't you read it? Well, no, just, uh, standard practice,  uh, contract... Melonfarmer Oly! ...oooh, shoot. What, is that not a happening deal? Hey ace. Wait up. So you want to talk about it? Talk about what kid? Why you're so damn mad at me? I'm not mad at you.  damn. I'm not.  I'm not mad at you. All right O.K. I've been thinking. Now that we've got  some money and Archie's gone, don't  you think it's time we we settle down?  Get a little house. I want you to have  my baby. Well I don't know. Every body does it.  And it just seems like the thing to  do and... Let's go do the job. Duke! Debbie! What what are you guys  doing here? What's it look like ace? I'm going to kill him. I'm going to  kill him. I'm going to kill everybody.  ha-ha-ha Drop it motherfucker (melonfarmer). Oww shit (shoot). Debbie Ah. Ah Do You, uh, do you think  it's too late uh for us to get romantically  involved? Wait! Wait! Stick with me. I'll make  you a repo wife. Otto? Yeah I'm here man. The lights are growing dim. I know a  life of crime led me to this sorry fate.  And yet I I blame society. Society made  me what I am. That's bullshit (nonsense). You're a  white suburban punk, just like me. But it still hurts. You're going to be all right man Maybe not. Yep he's dead all right. No doubt about it. He's a goner. Man. Don't touch the body, don't touch the  body. Sorry. Telephone call for you agent. Don't bother me now. But Agent Rogersz, it's the Gipper. Look. Booth's setting him on fire ...fail to register for patriotic chores.  So, please call this toll free number.  Praise the lord. There is no redemption  for the unredeemed, no escape for the  fair weather patriots. No salvation  from the boiling blistering fires of  eternal damnation. Now these are the  end times. Because in these days there  shall be hell in time. Man shall be  lovers of their own self rather than  lovers of God. Haven't seen you in a while, Son. No escape... No salvation from the blistering files  of eternal damnation. For in these days  there shall be hell in time, there shall  be war and more war, and earthquakes  in diverse places... What kind of men? Well, what did you tell them? Did you  tell them I was sick? We told them the truth, son. Gave them  your address at work. Money shall run out and the people will  line up at the banks and there won't  be anything . . . these prophecies are  in your bible. The same one that you  have in your home. Now I want you to  get up off of your sofa and put that  beer down and go wherever it is in your  house pick up that book and turn with  me... Where's the car baby? That Chevy Malibu  baby. Where's the car? Jeeze. Why? What? Let go of me! The Malibu. Yeah? No way Marlene. My car's gone and we're going to get  to the bottom of this. Not in my face. My Face! Hey Fletch. Coffee break. Good evening Otto. This is agent Rogersz.  I'm going to ask you a few questions.  And since time is short and you may  lie, I'm going to have to torture you.  But I want you to know it isn't personal. Look Ah this isn't really necessary.  I'll tell you anything you want to know. Good! Where is the Malibu? I don't know. Somebody ripped it from  the yard. Increase the voltage. No one is innocent. Proceed. Ah yes! Look at them. High heels, hair  nets, those ridiculous trench coats.  They're pathetic. But agent Rogersz, they're getting away. That's all part of the plan. Marlene? What's going on? Hey, I know you. You're the one that  run into my trash. Shh! Shhh to you too. Out of order. Take the stairs. Otto? They're going through it all the and  they won't pick it up. Oh tell you it comes to something when  they expect you to pick it up. How are you doing man? Look about the other night. I'm sorry  I split. I know I should have stayed  with you but ah it's like when I was  a kid you know I I had this set of big  wheels you know. Shit (shoot). (starts to get up off  of the bed) Praise the lord. Go. Go. Go. Come on. Let's go. Dude slow down. All right don't shoot come on all right  all right Chicken shits (stuff). braak-braak-braak Where's the Malibu? Don't even ask because I don't know.  I mean I don't have it Marlene doesn't  have it you and your crazy friends don't  have it. So that only leaves... Where is he. Where the fuck (hell) is he. Later! Here's another weird one. Reports are  coming in about apparent hail of ice  cubes south of downtown. Scientist are  at a loss to explain the freak showers  of tiny cubes of ice. That's some weird fucking shit (filthy  stuff) Eh Bud? What's going on man? Shit (damn)! Eleven years of repoing  cars and what have I got? Shit (zilch)! Bud listen to me. You're sitting in  a car worth twenty thousand dollars.  Look look we we turn it in we take the  money and split it sixty forty. You  and me.
