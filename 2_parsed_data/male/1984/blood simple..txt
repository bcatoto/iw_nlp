And how many room got TV, Dusty? Sure don't. Tell him the channels, Dusty. He needs a room, Dusty.Lubbock? ...Friday? What? I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor-- Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now. I don't know. Motel... Abby-- Back where? What's the matter? ...You know that car? Well now you do. I told you. I like you. ...What're you gonna do in Houston? Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you... Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him. Uh-huh.I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years. I own the place. We don't seem to be communicating-- ...So what're you doing tonight? So how long have you know Meurice? You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is. Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line? Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual. You've got a very sophisticated palate. If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra? What're you, a fucking marriage counselor? ...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing. Then what'd you come here for? Fine. Suit yourself. ...Having a good time? I don't particularly want to talk to you. What "what"? ...Count it if you want. Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways. ...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine. Of course. Jesus, I don't believe it... ...What did you do with the bodies? Dead, huh? Got something to show me first? Listen, what is it? Is it done? Yeah... ...What? Yeah. Is it... ...What? ...There's a big-- For the money. So, uh... this wouldn't interest you. What do you think? I didn't say that. Well? Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here. It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get. It's not strictly legal. Got a job for you. Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over. No. It just made them feel better. How long did you watch her? You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for? What did you take these for? ...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar. Meurice... No. I think I'll stay right here in hell. The point is we don't serve niggers here. That's not the point. This. What's this? Deuce in the corner needs help. Don't throw that out. Pour that back. Red Label. What's this? How would I know? Has Ray come in yet?You don't look too good. You sleep last night? ...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead. What?! Did Ray tell you that? ...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved. Abby... ...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired. Well I do... Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink? Abby. What's the matter? Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday. It won't? I am? Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from? What night is it? Hold it, hold it. What's tonight? We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty. Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty? ...I thought you were dead. Going home? Where? ...I'm very careful about that. What's the point? Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it. What. Right. Right. What. Right. Sorry. You said the usual-- I don't know, didn't he call? No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night? Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short. ...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility. You shouldn't have taken the money... No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar? For what? Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office. Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea... Howdy stranger. Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free. Tuesday is ladies' night. What day is it today, Angie? Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT? Enough to light Las Vegas for how long? How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but-- Where was I?I think someone's watching. With your gun?... What do you want to know? Isn't that what you want? In the trunk. All right... ...Who? ...What was that? ...That's what's important. ...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker? Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead... ...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart. I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important... Yeah. ...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads. Yeah. I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right? I said you're bad. You're bad. Abby-- I don't know. I better get off now. I don't know. It's early... I love you. Abby... you all right? ...You ever get tired? ...Mm-hmm. Thanks. What'd he say? Uh-huh. ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly. Yeah? What happened? ...Well I'll be damned. ...Huh? Door's locked. Nothing there. You wouldn't be putting me out. You can sleep on the bed if you want. If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch? Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he? On the phone. Was it for you? Who was it? I just gotta see a guy. See a guy. You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there. Why d'you wanna leave all this? Your husband. Yeah. I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine-- You owe me for two weeks. Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit. Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What? What's that? ...Why? Got a problem, Meurice? Thanks Meurice. Is Marty here? Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.Ever durned one. See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option. Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot. I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax. I reckon I can hear him... ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.Nah, I trust ya. ...it's too damn risky. I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder... Nobody knows you hired me? Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful? It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better. So it would seem. Just the ten thousand'll be fine. ...What kind of fish? Ya catch any fish? Ya catch any fish? Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money. I want you to go fishing. The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money... I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you? I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple. You're an idiot. Well what? You want me to kill 'em. ...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret? Yeah? Well how irritated are you? If the pay's right I'll do it. ...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it. ...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love-- ...Anything else? Now that don't make much sense. Most of the night... Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit. ...Just doin' my job. What do you mean...
