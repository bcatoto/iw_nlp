Dr. Jones. Nee chin lie how ma? You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones. For this special occasion, I ordered champagne and caviar. So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you found Nurhachi? You have insulted my son. Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi. Aren't you going to introduce us? This is Willie Scott. And this is Indiana Jones, the famous archaeologist. Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me and is about to deliver him -- now. Well -- I thought archaeologists were always funny little men searching for their mummies -- Aaahhh! I was only kidding, can't you take a joke -- ? Lao, he's got a knife! Look at this!  He put a hole in my dress from Paris! Sit down! To your health, Dr. Jones. A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is poison.  You just drank the rest of it. There is an antidote for this poison.  You give me Nurhachi -- I give you the antidote. The poison works fast, Dr. Jones. Where is Nurhachi? This Nurhachi's a very small guy. At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor! So, what's the big deal?  Let me see it -- You fool! Ow, you're hurting me, you miser- able little hood! Hey, he's not a waiter... Not this time, my friend... I followed you on many adventures -- but into the great Unknown Mystery, I go first, Indy... Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you will soon join him. Who cares?  Where's that diamond! Excuse me, but I believe that's my diamond! Aw nuts! Wow!  Holy smoke!  Crash landing! Okey doke, Indy!  Hold onto your potatoes! For crying out loud, a kid's driv- ing the car?! Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of gril! You don't look very good. Check!  Gotcha! Look at what you've done to me! I'm a mess!  My lipstick's smeared, I broke two nails, I've got an aw- ful run in my stocking -- ! What're we going to do?!  Where're we going?! Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han -- Don't worry, Indy.  Short Round number one bodyguard now! I'll take the extra ticket. Where's this plane going anyway? Siam?  But I'm not dressed for Siam... No, no, they're all right! Let them through please. Dr. Jones, this is positively the last time our airline can hold a plane for you.  Now you must hurry! So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer? I'm freezing.  What do you mean, tag along?  From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me. Lao send planes to kill Indy! Wake up!  It's the drug he drank to stop the poison -- Please to remain calm.  We start passing out parachutes now -- You got to be kidding!  No!  No, I can't! Wait -- who's flying the plane?! Nobody's flying the plane ... Jones!  Indiana Jones! Put it on!  What's wrong with you?  You've got to jump! No, can't leave Indy! Give me that parachute, I changed my mind -- No, this last one!  It's for Indy! There's nobody flying the plane! Come here, lady, hold this and shut up please! I get it! You got it! Oh oh -- big mistake! Are you crazy, a lift raft?!  We're not sinking, we're crashing! Wait for me! Indy? No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead. Oh no...I ripped my dress.  Where are we anyway? Holy cow -- India?  How do you know we're in -- What'd he say? What do you mean -- how? Dream -- nightmare is more like it. I hope this means we're going to get some dinner. God, I am starving, but I can't eat this... I'm sorry, I -- here, please. You will rest here before you go on. Indy is taking me to America. Sanju will guide you. On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot. You will go to palace there. No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again. It is Pankot Palace that kills my village. The evil starts in Pankot.  Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country. They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village. Took what? It is why Krishna brought you here. No.  We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone.  It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace.  To find siva- linga -- and bring back to us. Indy, they make out plane crash? To get you here? Yes. Long ago -- before my father's father. I don't understand how losing one rock could destroy this village. Is it really powerful? They say we must pray to their evil god.  We say we will not. Their children? You will find them when you find sivlalinga. They do not listen. No, you will got to Pankot... What'd he say now? Sankara... Whoa!  Easy now -- nice elephant... I ride with you, Indy? Oh boy! This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left. They don't cry about you.  They cry about the elephants leaving. Figures... They got no food to feed them.  So they taking the elephants away to sell them. Pankot?!  I thought we were going to Delhi!  Hey, wait a minute! Can't somebody take me to Delhi?! I don't want to go to Pankot! Indiana!  Damn it!  Why'd you change your mind?  What did that kid tell you last night?! I think you need this more than me. What're you complaining about, this is expensive stuff! Here you go, lunch time! Indy, look! Those are very big bird. They must be pretty dumb to drink that awful-looking water. Stark naked?  You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach. Somehow I feel safer in here. Indy!  Help me! A snake! A SNAKE!! What?! It's got me !  Indy, help me! It's pulling me deeper! It's curling around me!  Damn it, stop talking and do something! What's wrong?!  Indy please help me! What?! Just one arm! PET IT??!! THE WHAT?! Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me! It's starting to let go! It's letting fo.  I think it's -- I think it's going to sleep! Thanks for nothing!  I hate snakes! You come to America with me, and we can get job in the circus -- you like that? Where'd you find your little body- guard? He'll be okay.  He's a good kid. All these fires -- you expecting more snakes, Dr. Jones? Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got. Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, in- credibly rich prince. Oh really? Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones? What's that? What does the writing say? That's Shiva?  What's he giving the Priest? You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village? Fortune and glory...sweet dreams, Dr. Jones. I'd be safer sleeping with that snake. Did you see it?!  It was one of those bats! God, what else is out there...?! Just try and control yourself. Indy, look! Why are we stopping here? What you look at, Indy? What's the guide talking about? He hasn't said a word the whole trip. He's afraid of something. You mean we have to walk the rest of the way? -- shot at, fallen out of a plane, nearly drowned, squashed by a snake, attacked by a bat -- I smell like an elephant! I tell you I'm not going to make it! Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner... Hi...(hi)...(hi)... I would say you look rather lost. But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home... Dr. Jones?  The eminent archae- ologist? Hard to believe, isn't it...? I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford.  I Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot. Welcome to Pankot Palace. How'd you like to run into him in a dark alley...that one's kind of cute...I could see myself married to a prince like that... The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible. You should have been there... I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice. Is that him? He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken". No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father. Oh -- good.  And maybe the pres- ent Marahajah is a little younger? And thinner? They will escort you to your rooms now.  You will be provided with fresh clothes.  Tonight you will be dining with His Highness. Dinner?  And with a prince?!  My luck is changing.  But look at me -- my god, I've to to get ready! Eight o'clock in the Pleasure Pavilion. It's sort of like being in heaven. She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub. We are fortunate tonight to have some many unexpected guests.  his is Captain Phillip Blumburtt. Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives". The British worry so about their Emprie -- it makes us feel like well-cared-for children. Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's  wife? His Highness has not yet taken a wife. No?  Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman... I think this Maharajah is swim- ming in money.  Maybe coming here wasn't such a bad idea. Finally! His Supremem Highness, guardian of Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah of Pankot -- Zalim Singh. That's the Maharajah -- that kid?! I've never been so hungry in my life... My god, sort of grusome, isn't it...? His Highness wants me to welcome his visitors.  Especially the renowned Dr. Jones from America. Suddenly I'm not so hungry... A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think? Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century. But you're not eating! I uh -- had bugs for lunch. There are no stories anymore. Their stories are just fear and folklore. The local peasants are just as superstitious.  You're very ob- servant, Dr. Jones.  But you're beginning to worry Capt. Blum- burtt. Give me your hat... What for? I'm going to puke in it... Dr. Jones, it our country a guest does not usually insult his host. There, you see, Captain.  A rock! I think that's enough  of this nonsense, Dr. Jones... So you have something, you know, simple -- like soup or something? Looks delicious! I wanna go home... Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors.  I seem to re- member that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist. And didn't the Sultan of Madagas- car threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his coun- try? Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones. I have heard the terrible stories of the evil Thuggee cult... I thought the stories were told to frighten children.  Later, I learned that the Thuggee cult was once real and did unspeakable things. I am ashamed of what happened here so many years ago.  We keep these objects -- to remind us that this will never again happen in my kingdom! Ah, dessert! Chilled monkey brains! I have seen this thing.  What is it, Dr. Jones? Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip! You will show me how it works please. That is wonderful!  Please teach me how! That little Maharajah think he big stuff. Next time I flatten him!  Did you see his eyes? Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy!  Then he talk in this real scary voice! Yeah, that's what happened... Not leftovers? Oh, it is real food...it's beautiful. You're nice.  Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave? Yeah -- and nothing else. That shock you? You mean like love rituals... Primitive sexual practices? You're dying to come into my room, aren't you? Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones? We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open. Dr. Jones -- ? Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes... Five minutes, Dr. Jones... Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things... He's not coming...I can't be- lieve it... Well... No!  I'm not going over there... Sleep tight, Dr. Jones! I could've been your greatest ad- venture... Don't worry, Indy!  Where are they?! No -- don't you see -- crawling -- Get -- the -- bug -- off! Uh uh -- me neither! Oh no -- oh no!! Please -- oh please, I'm going to die!  Get it off! What did I do to deserve this trip?! It went under.  Hey, I feel wind, Indy. I'm packing!  I'm getting out of here right now tonight! What does it mean, Indy? I don't care if I have to walk to Delhi, I'm -- hey! Wait a minute!  What're you -- where're you going?! I don't think we suppose to be in here, Indy... I step on something. Indy, the floor -- there is some- thing alive! Holy smoke -- I'm scared, Indy! Hey -- where are you?! Indy, I found a -- Indy -- ! What?! Willie, help!! Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty again! I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh!  What's that?!  There's stuff all over the floor!  I can't see a thing! It's all wet and icky!  Aaahh -- things are moving!! Please, Willie! There's bugs!  Bugs all over! Help!  Help me! OPEN THE DOOR!  LET ME IN!! A what?! I can't find any lever!  Help me Indy! There's a hole!  I found a square hole! I am -- it looks horrible! I can't, Indy!  I can't! Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving! Willie, help us!  Hurry! Get is off me -- get it off! You left me out there!  What in the hell were you doing in here?! I want to leave this place right now!! What is it...? Oh my God!  He ripped out his -- he killed him! Jai ma Kali, jai ma Kali! Jai ma Kali,  jai ma Kali! Let's go!  Let's get out of here! Why they glow like that? Diamonds...? Wait -- what're you doing? Down?  Down there?!  Are you crazy --! You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory! I keep my eye peeled, Indy. Oh hell, where's he going? What're you -- ? Keep your paws off, letch! Run Willie! No!  Run!  Go get help! Indy -- you knocked out when you fall.  You okay? This is Nainsukh -- from the vil- lage.  They bring him here to dig in the mines. What they do to you now? How? You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones. There were five stones in the beginning.  Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you... No.  They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest his the last two stones down here in the catacombs. They dig for the gems to support our cause.  They also search for the last two stones.  Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful! You do not believe me?  You will, Dr. Jones.  You will become a true believer. Your Highness will witness the thief's conversion. You will not suffer.  I recently became of age and tasted the blood of Kali. Hold him! You will learn to obey because you are powerless! I control you now! You told me that a whip could be an enemy to its owner.  We shall see!  Turn him over! As Dr. Jones suggested, I have been practicing. The British in India will be slaughtered.  Then we will over- run the Moslems and force their "Allah" to bow to Kali. And then the Hebrew God will fall and finally the Christian God will be cast down and forgotten. Soon Kali Ma will rule the world! Oh my God, you scared me!  Listen, you've got to help.  We found this tunnel -- No -- you can't go!  Something aw- ful's happened.  They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been -- We found a tennel that leads to a temple below the palace!  Please, come with me, I'll show you! Miss Scott, you're not making any sense. I'm afraid they'll kill them!  We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out! It's some kind of cult!  And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for. I sense the fumes of opium in all this.  Prehaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai. What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend!  I saw it!  I'll show you! Oh, Indy, you got away!  Tell them what happened, they won't believe me -- They think I'm insane.  Tell them I'm not, Indy.  Please -- help me ... What? I want to go home... As she slept, she undoubtedly had nightmares. I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain. Indy?  Did you walk to them? So now they believe me. Then they'll send the soldiers down into the temple... I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you. You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you... Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory.  He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power. His eyes -- they go out. The pain -- the pain makes him wake up! Indy!  I can make Indy wake up! Indy! You understand what he tells us? Your friend has seen and she has heard -- now she will not talk. Indy!  Help me!  Indy?! This will prove your devotion to Kali. Please, God, don't let them do this to me -- help me, Indy! No -- no! Indy -- ! No -- Indy -- wake up! Wake up!  It's just a nightmare, Indy!  Wake up, please Indy! Indy, you back? No, Indy, no! We got to help Willie! Look out -- ! What're we going to do? What're we going to do?! I can't! Behind you! What happened? What's wrong with him? I got one!  Indy, I got one! Indy, look out! How you like bing pin cushion, Mr. Rajah-ha-ha? Please -- pull it out! It was the black sleep of Kali... They made me do evil things... may lord Krishna forgive me. Get down here, Shorty!  I got us a ride! Come on, let's see hoe hand your head is! Please -- listen -- to go out you must take the left tunnel. Thanks pal. I'm going to try to find the English soldiers. Good luck. I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry! Willie, come on! You do pretty good for a girl! Indy!  Hurry! They've stolen the Sankara Stones -- they must be stopped! No, Indy, it's left tunnel. Read you loud and clear, Indy! What?! What above the curves?! Indy, look out! What're you doing?!  We're going too fast!! Anymore ideas...? Indy!! Oh no! I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to flirt with death... What's that?...Indy?! Oh... shit... Some short cut! Nothing to it -- follow me! Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff! Indy -- looks out behind you! You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones. Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I don't believe you would kill yourself! Your friends will die with you! Give me the stones! Willie, look! No, the stones are mine! I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted. And the diamond hidden inside... We know you are coming back -- -- when life returns to our village. It's a real miracle. Now you see the magic of the "rock" you bring back. And they don't even know what it really is. You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've got- ten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about. Oh no, I'm finding a native guide who knows the way.  No more de-  tours for me, thank you Dr. Jones. If you think I'm going to Delhi or anyplace else with you, after all the trouble you've gotten me into...
