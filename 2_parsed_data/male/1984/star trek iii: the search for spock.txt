Transwarp at your command, Sir! Tractor beam, aye! Enterprise maintaining full impulse power... All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.What's going on? When do we get paid off...? Sure - whatever games you wanna play. Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant. Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning... I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!Sir, the shields... Non- responsive. Nothing on my scanner, sir. For an instant... A scout class vessel. I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it. Still no response, sir. Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel. Aye, sir. Nothing. As before. Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us. Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir. Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel. Message acknowledged. All units will be informed. Shall I alert Dr. McCoy? Will we get another ship? Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there. An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter! Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge. Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir? Aye sir, coding now.Thank you... Sir ! Not from here, no. Why don't we beam it up? I don't believe it... It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...! I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it -- I went wrong. It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours. Hello, sir. It's David. No!... I'll do it. Give me your phaser. Whoever they are, they're getting closer. I still don't... I don't understand. Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable. I'm sorry. The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now... This planet is aging in surges. If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never! My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands. It was the only way to solve certain problems -- I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix. Not exactly. Why don't you just call for help ! How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet! You mean, we're stranded down here?! Saavik... My god, what happened to them? Later. Let's go... What is it? Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise. They were fruitful, and multiplied. . .. Spock's tube... We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms! I'll handle that later. Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've got to find out what it is... There shouldn't be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix. Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement. Short range scan. A photon tube...! There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan. Underground deposit? It's a little early to celebrate. All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk! It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic! Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four. This is where the fun begins, Saavik!On screen. Locate. Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here... Dr. Marcus, it's your planet. All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around. Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that? What is it? In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits. Could it be Spock's? We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for -- I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel. Go. Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions. Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination? Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next? Yes, Saavik, go ahead... We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous... Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb. Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur? "... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik. You said there wouldn't be any.Scotty...? Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu. Could be Grissom. Patch in the hailing frequency. U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please. What did you see, Chekov? Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan? Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals. What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...? Chekov, break radio silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban. Response? You did great, Bones... Just great. Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now. No reply, Chekov... Continue on course... Calm yourself, Bones. Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge. Yes. He has a long journey ahead. I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait. Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed! Mr. Chekov -- ? David, I don't understand... David!... What went wrong? David... Sorry I'm late. Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station! How many more? What's wrong? I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks -- Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up... Good shooting, Scotty. Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass. Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems -- Scan for vessels in pursuit! The doors , Mr. Scott! Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott. Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please! Mr. Scott? Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally. My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not. Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas. Be tolerant. Mr. Scott... Your reputation is secure, Scotty. Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters. Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four? Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again? My God... And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock? But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for! What? What are you saying? Goodbye, David. Is there anything we can do?! What happened...? This Vulcan -- is he alive? Saavik... Is... David with you? You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?! Yes, yes, Spock... Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many. You would have done the same for me. Yes. And I know you. Mr. Sulu, you're on manual. Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in. Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below. Go, Sulu! Come on! What about surface life signs...? With some on the planet... Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey? Fire, Mr. Scott! Red alert, Mr. Scott. Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say? That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu? See! That shimmering area. What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov? Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott? Mr. Scott: as good as your word. Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu... FULL IMPULSE POWER! I'll need it, Sulu. The word is no. I am therefore going anyway. She's to be decommissioned. Very well. Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please. Will you be able to handle that...? Good evening, Commander. Everything ready? That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd stay there... They say it's exhaustion... We'll see. My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs... Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control. Hmm.. Very odd. Scotty. Progress report? Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries? You're right. Thanks for the drink. Yes... I hear you. I just had to try. Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, please ! I can make them understand!! Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship. As surely as if it were my own! Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help... Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility. Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage -- May I ask why...? Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began! But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis... Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise -- Indisposed, sir. Welcome aboard, Admiral. Don't be a fool -- give me your hand! Give me your hand and we both live. If we don't help each other, we'll all die here! You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself! Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk. But, why? You should take the Vulcan, too. No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out. Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal. All right, damn you! All right! Give me a minute to inform my crew. Wait! Give me a chance -- David?... David! Who is this?! How dare you -- Torpedoes coming in -- ! I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in! If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul. What I have done, I had to do. What about Spock? What you ask is difficult. What must I do? Bones!... Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?! Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way! But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated! ... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes. ... Spock... ... The needs of the few... ... Yes... Yes... Of course...! Then, how -- Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me! But -- why? Yes, I was... I -- saw no future -- Then you know how bravely your son met his death. Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies... Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here... I think you know my crew...Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... Give me Genesis ! Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it! Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it... Genesis, I want it. Because you wish it. No. Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby... No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute. There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too? Surrender your vessel! Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners. Who I am is not important. That I have them is. I will let you speak to them. Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you. On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace. Report status! We are Klingons ! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks! I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew. Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily! I trust my instincts. Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking. They know we would die first. Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there. Good. This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for. I ordered no interruptions. Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too! Station! We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will act for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power! Share this with no one. So! Speak! Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I... That -- is the real dishonor. They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away. Killing his son was stupid ! It made Kirk willing to die. I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself... Put him on screen! Study him well. Wait!... Wait... Steady. Continue on impulse power. I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.The closet ?! Have you lost all sense of reality? Well -- what are we going to do about it?! But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d... Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God! Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two. A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space. You amaze me, Commander.But surely, our mission has not failed -- ? We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information -- Sir, may I -- My Lord... what are your orders? My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer. 500 Kellicams! 1,000 Kellicams, closing! Firing range, sir. Range: 3000 Kellicams. Yes, my lord!Any time. Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away. Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis! No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding. Yours...?! Now wait a minute! This business about Spock and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand? Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules! Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject. That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis! Genesis?! Whatever for? Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over... Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves. Where's Doctor McCoy? Welcome home, Jim.But at what cost? Your ship... Your son. I am not sure. Only time will answer. Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is -- You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you must . You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace... One alive, one not. Yet both in pain. Yes... But -- how...? I see... and I understand. Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn. Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near. I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper! ... Or the one. ... The needs of the many outweigh... He asked you not to grieve... ... He spoke of your friendship. Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind? He would not have spoken of it openly. Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit. Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan. You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him. "Met his death"? How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future! Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report. I will speak with you alone, Kirk.Just him, sir! They've knocked out the damn automation center. I've got no control over anything! Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so... Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird. Aye, sir! Aye, sir! Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now. Sir...? I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word. As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her. I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have. Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker? Eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two. I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.The ship... Out of danger...? Why would you do this...? My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me. I know you... Do I not?Execute! If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock... And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam! Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power. Status!It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters! The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir. We are clear and free to navigate. If I read this right, sir, we have full power. Close... There -- Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly... About a dozen officers and men. Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...! ... A cloaking device? I think it's an energy form, sir... Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in. We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant. Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed. Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space. Aye, sir, Warp Speed... ... We have cleared Spacedoors. Count on our help, sir. The word, sir? ... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise? On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.They outnumber us, my Lord -- How can you tell that? Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner. We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams. But sir! Federation Starship approaching. I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want -- There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek. Sir, may I suggest -- Success, my lord. Understood, my lord. Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
