At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown! I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade! Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!His Grace is very angry with you. Indeed. Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.You have leave to try. And how will you make him keep it? Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat. I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him. Hardly. No! I won't have him back. Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now. I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come. How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take. Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune. Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio! I've come to dinnnnnner! Don Giovannnnnnnni!Behold! Hey! Behold! He's adorable! Be careful!Well, look at them. Do you like this, Salieri? Yes? Really? Of course not. Oh? Why not? I don't think you understand me, Court Composer. Well. There it is. You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea. Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart. And the result satisfies. Yes? I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view? Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth. Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue. Well, I'm glad to hear that. Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say? And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri. Ah-ha! Let's have some fun. Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice. Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in? May I try it? What a charming idea. May I see? You are cattivo, Court Composer. I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him. You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade. Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight! I have no idea. Ah, love again. I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece. Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here. Would you tell me why? It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true? Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true? Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre? Ah! By all means. What is it? Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man. Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna. Excuse me, but how old are you? Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry? Enchanted, Madame. My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect. My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer? Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? How shall one say, Director? Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate. Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably! Yes, indeed. What? On one hearing only? Ah-ha. Yes, where? Well, what is it about? Tell us the story. Why so? Did we vote in the end for German or Italian? And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you. The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg. No, no, please! It is not a holy relic. You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old. He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no? Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good. Yes, what about him? Well, what do you have for me today? Well. There it is. Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain? Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre. Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you! Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance. Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully. Sir - Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him. But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding. So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time. And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day? But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of! When, may I ask? I see that you're expecting. Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.' She does. She says I sleep all day. Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden. Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving! I never saw this girl in my life. Is this a kind of joke? Mine? I'm tired of this game. Please play without me. I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son. No, really! Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me. Why didn't you mention it in your letters? You don't have secrets from me. Why not? What's that? Composition doesn't pay. You know that. How many? Yes. How many pupils do you have? They say you're in debt. That's not what I hear. How is your financial situation? Don't you have a maid? Do you always live like this? Is she not here? Am I not welcome? I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.What do you mean? These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it. Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you? Certainly! Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore. What?? No, she's fine. Oh - excuse me! I'll be right back. What? Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage. No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy. If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me. Humiliated? Why what, sir? Go back to bed. It's killing me. I can't write it! Give me two more weeks. Please. This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I? No. Don't answer it! You'd think I was mad. I'm not telling you. No one. Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand! Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki. Oh, Stanzi. Why not? Half the house! Half the receipts! Stanzi! What? Salzburg. We were just talking about Salzburg. If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with! Yes, my love? We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl. Stanzi! Oh, damn! Well, ask her! What does she want? What? How can you be so boring? Tea! Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa. My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter? Yes! Sssh. What is it? Tell me. What's the matter with you? Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving. Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them. Don't be stupid. Well, don't do that again! You borrowed money from your mother? Oh yes? You always know everything. They'll come anyway. They love me here. Oh, leave me alone. Of course. Yes. Tish-I'm-tee. Tish-I'm tee. What's that? Ui-vol-i-tub! Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram! Em iram! No, this is serious. Say it backwards. Em iram! Em iram! No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards! Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick! Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years. Why? People fart backwards. Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards. Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway. We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg. Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are? I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back. Thank you, Madame. Come on now - courage. Play me something you know. Who was your teacher? I'd like a little wine, if you have it. Really? Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it? Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not. Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives. Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it. But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on. On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that? But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love. Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics. Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy. Well, yes, I admit it is. Who told you this, Majesty? Yes, Sire. May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him. Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour? Thank you, Sire! Twenty-six. Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether. Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady. Which few did you have in mind, Majesty? I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less. What do you mean, Sire? So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty? And German? It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire? I think so, Sire, yes. Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head. In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio. It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a - Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto! Majesty! Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo! Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely. Oh, thank you. Your Majesty! Father - No one calls you that. Papa! Are you playing a trick on me? Papa, is this your idea? But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty. Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! This is just a game, Papa. Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa! Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did. Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted. It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is! It's a secret. Oh, let's not talk about it. This one will. I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition. Yes. Pupils? Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie! What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here. It couldn't be better. Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself. She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me. Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see. I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi! Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see. Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa! Why are you here? I will. Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is? What? That's right. Yes? Well, we can. Because there's nothing to see. No. Yes. What? Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you. Put it down! Leave that alone! No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio. German! Animals? I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it. I liked the horse. Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you? That kind of music should be punishable by death. Well? Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room. Sssh! Stay here. Sssh! Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir. No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours. If a man cannot earn, he must borrow. Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead? Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction? Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music? Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir! Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. How long have you been playing, Fraulein? Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg. I'm afraid I am. Madame. And which one of them do you want me to teach? I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me! I am so ashamed. Would you stay with me while I sleep a little? We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa. Do you want to rest a bit? Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now! Do you have it? And that's it. Do you have it? Yes, and on 'dictis'. C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis. Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed. Show me. Do you have me? Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this. Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant. With the tenors. It couldn't be simpler. Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. The first bassoon and tenor trombone - Fourth measure, second beat - F. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right? Sing it back. Third measure, second beat starting on E. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. Do you have that? Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, second beat. Ma-le-dic-tis. G-sharp, of course. Common time. The Fire. So now - A minor. Suddenly. We ended in F Major? Strange! A fire which never dies. Burning one forever? Do you believe in it? So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that? Where did I stop? A Mass. A Mass for the Dead. You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write. But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed. Would you? Actually, you could. Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred? He knows. He knows! Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it. The man. He's here. No! No, it's him! I'm too young to be so sick. The doctor thinks I am. But - I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things. Do you mean that? This is only a vaudeville. I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did. You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you. Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa. No, no. I have to get back. I have - What happened? Is it over? No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can! I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time. How long will you give me? How much? Who are you? What dead? Who is dead? What work? Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri! I never knew that music like that was possible. How could it not, Excellency? How could I not? Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio! Oh no, the honour would be all mine. I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that. It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come? What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all? But what is it they don't like? Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn. Thank you! Oh, thank you. Oh, Excellency, would you? It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work. Oh no! My wife took it out in time. Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry! I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him? It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it. I can't say. Really Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty? Ah. Italian? Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it? I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret. Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe! Do you have a daughter? They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend! How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all! No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why. Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage. But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess! Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity. Whom did they choose? Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please! Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted? So you see, this post is very important to me right now. She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know. Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now. It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree? Did you like it, then? But this is absurd! Love, Sire! A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things. Mio caro Adone. I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours? Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director! What are you doing, Herr Director? But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story. Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding. Certainly, Herr Director. Just let me tell you how it begins. But, Your Majesty - Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care. Exactly. I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately. May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that? Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not! Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music! They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid. Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians! Who is on this committee? No, but I'm the best. Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post? Is the Emperor angry with me? Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl. What is this, Herr Chamberlain? Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends? Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous? Baron! Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent! It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely! Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.What are you talking about? Why? Now? Where? What is it?Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute. No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God! What difference does that make? I poisoned his life. I did. The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands. His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you? Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers! There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture. Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me! All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him! No? Was Mozart a good man? Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God. Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray! It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them. He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered. Do you believe it? And do they believe it? Ah - you've heard that? I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is? Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing? Well? I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this? Then you must know this. Where? How well are you trained in music? I do not seek forgiveness. Are they? Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you? Leave me alone. What do you want? So? About what? What do you want?Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough? What do you mean - now? I can't wait. Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck. What? Who the devil are you?Extremely clever. You were sublime. Well, what does it matter to you? What? Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina. You might be disappointed. Perhaps. My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk. A Turkish brothel. A brothel. In a harem. Well, do you know where it's set, my dear? Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one. No. Yes. Oh? News travels fast in Vienna. Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip. Good morning. Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here. No. I was assisting him. He asked me. He asked me to stay. He needs me, ma'am. I was at hand. Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home. What? Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price. It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight. Isn't it obvious? Some service deserves service in return. No? Alone. Come back tonight. Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his. It is miraculous. These are originals? Originals? Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like. Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband. I see. Then he didn't send you? Really? I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe. I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest. I understand. How charming. But why did he not come himself? Frau Mozart? Madame. How can I help you? It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid. Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson. As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well! I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies. Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician. Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming. Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart. Sire. I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes. Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. You already commissioned an opera from Mozart. An interesting idea, Majesty. But - Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour! Your Highness. Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn. My pleasure. Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario! A-flat, Majesty. You do me too much honour, Sire. Majesty. It's just a trifle, of course. I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention. Are you sure it's an opera? Opera? Opera! Is he working? Is he working? Where? What medicine? Why? What has happened? Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you? Where does he work? Yes what? Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you? Really? What is it he's writing? Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all? Do any pupils come to the house? Bene. Bene! Bene! Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl? Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker. What have you got for me today? Let me see. Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning. What for? I'm not leaving you. I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try? Oh no. I'm not tired at all. Yes. You go fast! Yes! Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'? That's wonderful! I think so. And that's all? Also identical? First bassoon and tenor trombone - what? Please! Just one moment. Yes. I think so. Yes. What time? Yes. Confutatis Maledictis. Come. Let's begin. Oh, yes. What? Consigned to flames of woe. The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra. Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work? Of course. My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure. Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way? Finish what? What man? Who? Shall I answer it? What? Are you ill? I do. Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me. I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that. No, please. You mean she's not coming back? Where is your wife? I'm taking you home. You're not well. Are you neglecting my request? Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon. I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well. A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one. A Mass for the dead. I have come to commission work from you. You flatter me. Yes? Did my work please you? Mozart. It was good of you to come. Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang! I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me. I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap? I think it's marvelous. Truly. Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four. I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully. With all my heart, Mozart. But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor. How fortunate. You burned the score? Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours. Really? Why? Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter? I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do? What exactly are you working on? Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind. Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone. Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly. Ah, how exciting! Tell me more. I'm afraid not. Of course not. How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful. It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means. You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty? An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth. No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity. Herr Sommer. My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late. I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled. Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't. I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course. So you are. How is your pretty wife? Herr Mozart, what brings you here? How could I not? Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations. Yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes, Majesty. Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that. Ah! Really? Yes, in the third act. Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera? About the ballet. Incredible. Never mind. I've seen the manuscript. Yes. Exactly. Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera. I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director. Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes. No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him. I agree, Baron. Come with me. And stay in the room. What does he want? Show her in. Then go to bed. Excuse me, my dear. Who is she? Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly! Yes. And congratulations to all of you. It was superb. Bene. Of course. Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest. Well, he's sleeping now. Better not. Yes, I am looking after him.In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat! Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height. Who the devil are you? What do you want? You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi. Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem? I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous! I'm paying these people. Do you realize that? Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting? I hope so. I need it immediately. Where's our friend? Am I interrupting something? Ah. Well. Ah, I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts? So let me see it. Where is it? Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes. Why not? Can I see it? What? The vaudeville, what'd you think? Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished? What is this? Wolfi! So there you are. What do you say? Of course! What else do you think they speak here? I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German. I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle. 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those. Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them. Yes, well, it's all good fun. Sublime! Utterly sublime! What did he say? What did he say? Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi! Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh? I'll call tomorrow. And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times. Well, tell him we were here, won't you? But he's all right? Can we come in? Herr Salieri.Behold! Hey! Behold! Adorable! Be careful!He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting. That lady is back, sir. She didn't say. But she says it's urgent. Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.Oh my son, my poor son! My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it? But not his body. No, you didn't! Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him. Yes. What? I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should. My son, no one can speak for God. God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know. You cannot say that! Did you try? Do you hear me? Should I? Is it true? All Vienna has heard that. Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing. Oh, I know that! That's charming! I didn't know you wrote that. I regret it is not too familiar. I can't say I do. What is it? Here in Vienna. I know a little. I studied it in my youth. My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me. Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness. That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes. I cannot leave alone a soul in pain. Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely. In the sight of God that is a sin. You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you? I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.He's here. Your Majesty, Herr Mozart - Yes, sir. In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people. I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop. Herr Mozart - Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues. Mozart - Mozart - Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri. A little modesty would suit you better. Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna. On the contrary. Because His Majesty wishes it. What is what? Ah. Oh yes, yes. And that was? I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director? Did we? Well done, Sire!Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty. Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish? Surely you can choose more elevated themes? Mozart - Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine. My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre? I don't think it was really decided, Director. How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent. Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him? This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
