I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...  I don't want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.  How much do you know?  What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions?  Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that;  What else did you keep out of the papers?  Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.  Somebody hurt him?  Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.  No.  You look all right now.  I am all right.  Will it keep them out?  Yeah. ..  I have to.  Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...  Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?  Thanks for the lift.  I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.  That's right.  Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before. Can you add anything?  That's all we know about.        What happened to them?  Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.  To yourself...  I call him a monster.  No.       Lounds, give it a rest...
