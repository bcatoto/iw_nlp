Get the kit! R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this -- She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now. Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up. Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares... Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died. Okay, good. She's asleep. Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell. How long's this been going on? Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay? Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away. Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?Meanwhile...? You crazy? Hit him with what? What!? I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway. Me? Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream! How you plan to do that? Bring him out of what? Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?! You do? Who? I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept? Oh. Hi, how y'doing? Hello? Well what you reading it for? 'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'! I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens. They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears. Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills. They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right? You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming? Used to. Not anymore. Whenever I get nervous I eat. Yeah. So? Jesus, it's dark in here. Okay, okay. I think. Uh-oh... I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately. One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it. No. Slept like a rock. Haven't slept, have you? Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet? You okay? What the hell's going on!? Who was scary? Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway? So we'll guard her together. Through the night. In each others' arms like we always said. It's just a stupid cat. Jesus.Oh, Jesus -- Nancy! Hey! We got a fire! Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal? Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along. Sure, but... Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby. Nan, I -- Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs. Hello Nancy. It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep. No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag. He's dangerous. Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill. Decide to take a day off after all? What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night! What? You got a sane explanation for what he did? How you doing, pal? Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me. Tell her I'm not here, tell her... I don't mean her -- Terrific. What the hell was she doing there? What's the Coroner got to say? I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got? Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about. How you know that? Krueger? Who? Who did that?Like Rod Lane? Maybe god's punishing us all... Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room! Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams. Had to've done it. No one else was in there. Krueger.'Anything funny' like what? Uh, she just saw you, sir... She lived there. Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope -- Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene. Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --Do you think I did it? I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up... Because somebody cut her. While I watched. No. How the fuck do I know? I don't expect you to believe me. I told you. It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her. Someone else was there. I never touched her. The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure. Your old man thinks I did it, don't he? We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest. Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something. Good. No more nightmares for either of us then. No more fights? You feel better now, right? Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
