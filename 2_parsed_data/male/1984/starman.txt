 It's coming up... Slow down... There, right there...  Benny, God, take it easy...  I don't want to scare them away.  Smells smoke...  I told you.  There!! Up on the hill!!  Right in line with that burning tree.  I don't see anything.  It's there. The fog's thicker now,  but it's there. What do you think  started those fires?  Benny, there's nothing there.  There is. They came out of the belly  of the ship and then went to the  first terrace and flew down into the  houses.  Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...  You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling  us...  What's that?  What did I tell you?  Probably kids.  Probably...  Don't you think you should call a  backup?  No, we can handle this.  This is the police. Identify  yourselves.  There's one over here...  Stop!! Police!!  What happened?  I think I shot one.  Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?  You see anything, Mike?  This is the police. Identify  yourselves.  You wanna give me some help over  here.  Okay...  Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all right?  I don't think so...  Benny, this is me. I'm going to take  a look.  Don't leave me. I'm coming.  What the hell was it anyway?  Damned if I know.  Come on. I'm getting wet.  It musta been a bird.  How about if I drive now?  Major Aaron Bell...  Very beautiful country up here...  Not on the landscape. We're trying  to get a tube under the faceplate  for a reading on possible deadly  lifeforms but it's hard going.  No.  Wait'll you see it.  We had a flight of F16's play tag  with the spaceship over Michigan for  an hour. Then it shot straight up  and disappeared.  No, sir. Radar.  After I called in, I had a chance to  sit down with the three locals. They  swear there's another one that didn't  make the ship... It might be alive.  I've been investigating sightings  for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin.  This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another  one in the area that might be alive.  We've been visited. It's finally  happened and the sooner Washington  accepts that and starts figuring out  how we're going to deal with these  beings, the better off we're going  to be.  Look at the hands.  We better get it into the box. Come  on...  Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?  Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?  Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?  Is it for real?  There's no mistake? You're absolutely  sure?  Is there any possibility that it's a  hoax? Could you be mistaken?  Get the body out of there. Load it  on the Air Force chopper and get it  to Wright Patterson. They'll take it  from there... We didn't expect this,  Shermin.  We're going... Damn! We'll tell the press that there was  an accident. Chemical warfare spill.  That cover cannot be violated in any  way. Understand me, Shermin?  Major Bell here, sir. We have to  tell these people that we're friendly.  That this whole thing was a mistake.  Is anyone trying to contact the ship?  Shermin, I want you and Bell to start  looking for the one on the ground.  I'm going to the White House right  now. I'll try and get you everything  you need.  Contain it and get back to me.  Just what I said.  It was great to have you back... The  kids loved it. We loved it. You're  doing the right thing...  Remember you're required to have a  lesson planned tomorrow.  Iron channel message. Suit and rockets  destroyed. Radical mixture of this  atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed  chemo-ion response time to adapt my  body to this air. Am going to attempt  extreme transformation in order to  cross land mass to site of our  practice landings. If transformation  is not fatal, second message ball by  next darkness.  I wouldn't worry about it... There  might not be any little league  tomorrow.  I'm telling you they're probably  friendly.  Then why did they try and sneak in  the back door? Tell me that. Why  didn't they contact us first and  say...  UFO coming out of the grass.  Got it.  This is crazy. What were we going to  do if that had been the ship? We  have two thirty calibre machine guns,  three M16's and some handguns.  I've never once heard of anybody  being hurt by an extraterrestrial...  That's because the ones that were  hurt, died. They couldn't talk to  you.  No, but there sure were a lot of  people who saw lights in the sky  last night. Reports are still coming  in.  I've heard of blood being drawn,  sometimes they were taken for a ride  in the ship, a lot of times they  said they had sex... But nobody was  ever hurt...  But you decided those weren't real.  This one is.  Fox.  I've got something for you.  Recognize this?  It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent  into space on the Pioneer probes.  Houston found it in the  extraterrestrial's suit.  They must have picked it up in space.  We don't think that's necessarily  bad. At least it's a point of contact.  We'll get those answers when you  find the one you're looking for.  We've been back and forth on this  all day and keeping in mind the panic  that would occur if this got to the  general public, it's been decided  not to expand the search at this  time.  You have to. We're trying to contact  the ship. If we do, I'll let you  know immediately. Good luck.  You get the feeling we're expendable?  Wehave... Wehave... Wehave...  Wehave...  Wehave...  Dr. Bergen, George Fox here in  Washington. Can you give us an idea  of why they're here?  Please...  Please.  Please...  That way.  What.  Ah no.  What.  Steering wheel.  Gear shift.  Dashboard.  What?!  Police...  Steering wheel... gear shift...  dashboard...  Good.  That way.  Good.  What?  What?  What?  Pancakes.  What?  What?  You stupid son of a bitch!!  You could have killed us both!!  Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...  Hey buddy... let her go...  Hey, she doesn't want to go with  you. Come on.  Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My  mistake... I'm sorry...  I promise I'm not going to tell  anybody about this... None of my  business... I'm going to move now,  okay... You guys want to fight, that's up to  you... I'm leaving now... I won't say a  word...  Go.  It was only an accident that we  discovered them.  Twenty-eight years.  Yes.  It was kind of like clicking, maybe  a language wasn't it?  It was a man though... right?  Nothing up there... The grass is  matted down in a few places, but  that could have been anything.  It's the right area, that's for sure.  What happened?  Judy, that's stupid.  You know that's impossible!  Scott Haydn is dead. He died about  three months ago. We went to the  funeral.  R-r-S-s...  T-t-U...  u-V-v...  Cow... Dog... Pig...  W-w...  What?  When can we expect containment?  It's in a green Mustang?  This one has a weapon.  Why did you let it get into a  populated area?  Clarify that.  Repeat the last item.  Oh shit!!!  The United States of America. In God  We Trust. Ten dollars.  Money.  Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens...  Jennyhaydn... Money?  What?  Smile... good?  What?!  Minneapolis... Minneapolis...  Minneapolis... good.  No gas.  Gas good?  Go.  Closed?  What?  Who is he? Who is she? Who are you?  Who am I? Who are you?  Jennyhaydn.  I am...  From?  Space?  Gas.  No gas.  Who?  I am husband?  Shit?  Shit... shit... what shit?  Who?  No.  You. Mouth closed.  ...Gas...  No.  Do I need a key for the head?  Fill it up.  Howdy... can't get her out.  Gas.  I know how she feels.  Kid-nap-ped... go-ing W o-n...  Money.  What?  Money... candy.  Thank you.  What is... ...Coke?   I want to try it.  Good.  Shit!  What is kidnapped?  Kidnapped!!!  Kidnapped!!! What is kidnapped?!!  Jennyhaydn.  I am good.  What is that?  Horses.  What?  Iron channel message. Transmute was  successful. Have captured one of  them. It is taking me to the pick-up  point in a land vehicle. I think I can control it by mastering  its language, which is primitive and  easy to learn. Will arrive on time.  Wait for me.  I just came from a meeting with the  Security Council and in view of the extraterrestrial's  radical change and the fact that all  our efforts to contact its ship remain unanswered,  it was decided to issue a ten state  'all points bulletin' for Scott Haydn,  Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang.  The officers have been instructed  not to approach the people or the  vehicle but to contact you. You will  then move in and contain the subjects.  I'm afraid the situation demands  that kind of risk.  Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were  asking for help. What's changed?  We don't know what else to do. We  need results.  I'm gonna be here if you need  anything.  They're gonna let some local cop  blow him away.  Save us all a lot of trouble.  Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.  Bullshit!  You have no conception of this, do  you?  You jerk! You look at all the  sweetness and light and goodness you  think'll come out of this. You know  what's gonna come out of this... The  end of religion, the end of  civilization, the end of the earth.  We could become slaves, we could  become a colony of these things.  Don't you see that? Are you too stupid  to see that?  Bell wants us to get down on our  knees and bow.  No... I guess we never thought it  would happen.  It was yellow.  I will see it next time.  My... ...car will take me... ...up there... home.  I do not understand.  Yes.  Yes. Day... night.  Three nights... two days.  I need you.  No.  No.  No.  When we get here.  Jennyhaydn!  Hey!!  Where you think you're going?  Please.  Is that right? Huh?  Please.  Is that right? Come on. Answer me.  Were you trying to steal my baby?  Huh? Answer me!  Jennyhaydn!  Jennyhaydn!  Thank you.  Gate three. It's boarding now.  Have a nice trip.  Is that a baby?  A baby is a new person?  Do you have a baby?  Why?  Why?  But I must go here.  What is hitchhike?  'Salt Lake City, please. I do not  speak English.'  But I speak English.  I do not speak English.  'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak  English.' What is hitchhike?  Yes.  Last call for bus 33 to Vermillion,  Sioux City and Omaha... loading at  Gate 3.  'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not  speak English.'  The car will stop?  When do I get to Lathrop Wells?  Can I have the gun?  Yes.  Go?  Goodbye.  Jennyhaydn.  Please stay.  Ticket?  What?  Let's go.  I was afraid.  He couldn't even speak English.  What happened?  Who's side are you on?  No way he was going to get away from  me.  Where's that?... And it was one  person, one way...  Eyewitnesses are the worst. You get  two of them together. You got three  stories. You know what I mean?  Is there a reward in this?  Because I'm the one who called the  police, you know.  Hey, it's none of my business why  you're chasing a retard... You want  my opinion, it's the girl. She had  to hold the guy's hand all the way  to the car like he was a kid.  Hey... he didn't look like no big  time criminal to me.  Eh... the store tells you to call  when there's trouble, so they won't  get sued... But that shouldn't matter  if there's a reward, right?  That's what I thought. So remember  it was me because sometimes rewards  come late, you know.  I know. She bought him a ticket for  Lathrop Wells and put him on the  bus. He didn't stay on though and  they drove off together.  Maybe he's turned her into one of  them. They enter the crowd around  the helicopter.  It was a mistake.  No. My ship was doing a map of all  the suns and...  We were doing a map of the stars and  all the other things up there when  we saw a small ship. My... eh... we  kidnapped it. On it there was a map  that said how to come to Earth. This  was very important. Before then, we  thought we were the only people in  all the stars.  Yes?  We told our home, and the people who  tell us what to do on my planet said  to come and look but not to talk,  not to land, not to shoot. Just to  look from up there. We came and...  the driver of my ship...  The captain wanted to land to see  close and to get some things from  Earth to take home. The police came  and shot at us. One of the people  from my ship was killed.  I don't understand 'friend.'  He was a good friend... The captain  took the ship away fast and I was  not in the ship.  I understand.  What is hell?  He will.  Are you my friend?  I am your friend.  God is your creator. God is your  master. God is you savior. God is  the only reason that you exist. If  God...  Who is God?  Why?  I like this music.  Not all... but it feels like a kiss.  Yes.  I do not want to.  I am not a good singer.  You liked my singing?  What can I do for you folks?  Thirty-seven fifty for one person,  forty-nine fifty for two.  Sure.  Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card?  I'll have to run your card off now.  It's still the full price.  Jenny, look...  But I have never seen this before. I  am not complete.  You can park your car in front of  the room.  What did these two do?  All anybody knows is that they're  armed and dangerous.  Be a piece of cake for us to take  'em.  National Security folks should be  here any minute. Let them take care  of it. That's what they get the big  bucks for.  I want a drink. May I have two  quarters?  On the radio they say it's good.  The machine gave me two. Should I  put one back?  You can have one.  Are you angry at me?  They made us. Let's get 'em.  He's got a gun!!  Jennyhaydn! Jennyhaydn!!  One of them must be pretty badly  hurt.  Over here! They're over here!  You will be all right.  Iron channel message. Almost caught  by pursuers. This may hinder escape.  Wait for me.  You weren't that good.  I did.  We're growing very concerned back  here. There's no use pretending  otherwise. We're rapidly approaching  a 'condition red.' People are  beginning to ask difficult questions.  I don't care where you're from you  just can't disappear into thin air.  So far you've let it cross the heart  of America. For two days it has been  absorbing information that is  detrimental to our security. I don't  see the humor in that.  Is that what's affecting your  performance?  You just do your job, Shermin. We'll  make the policy.  Jennyhay...  ...nd. You are all fixed. I'm sorry  you were shot. I was a big problem  for you. Thank you for your help. I  can go to my ship alone now.  What the hell do you think you're  doing?  Stay right there...  Elmo's...  About five miles back.  Are there any more in there?  Where are you going?  Las Vegas, please. I do not speak  English.  Hop in.  I can only take you to Grand Junction,  but you'll have a better chance to  get a ride from there.  Where you from?  I don't understand.  Parlez vous Francais?... Habla  Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?  Good job, neither do I. What do you  do for a living?  I don't understand.  I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'  No.  Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as  a cook. That's how I make money.  I understand.  What do you do?  I make maps.  Hey, that sounds interesting. You  like it?  Eh... yes.  Make any money?  No.  You don't get rich as a cook, either,  believe me. I got a girl going to  college this fall. The wife had to  go back to nursing to help pay for  it.  Smoke?  She wants to become a doctor. She's  a bright kid. Hard worker. I think  she'll make it. But the damned  inflation's driven the tuition up so  high it makes it real tough on a  family like ours.  I got two other kids. I don't know  what we'll do when they get old enough  for college.  Everybody blames it on the oil crisis.  That might be where it starts. But I  think a lot of people are just using  that as an excuse to rip the rest of  us off. I see it every day in the  kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon  cans. The price has gone up three  times in the last year. And now the  cans are only half full.  Do you have children?  No.  They're damned expensive and a pain  in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't  trade having them for anything.  What do you think of America?  It is beautiful.  I don't know... I'm not sure. I might  have seen him up the road a piece on  my way in. He's long gone by now.  Ask inside.  I'm going to Des Moines. If you can  wait till I finish here, you're  welcome to ride along.  Operator... may I help you?  Sergeant Packert, Highway Patrol.  What was your name again?  Hold on.  All we know right now is that it's  east of here.  Ready?  My grandmother's rich.  Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.  In the cars, too?!  This is going to be a real drag. I  thought you wanted to go fast.  They after you?  Would be kinda neat if they were. I  think I could outrun them. Maybe get  my picture in the papers.  Well, here we are... You go down  that ramp there, you're sure to get  a ride.  Thank you.  And don't be shy about your English.  You speak better than a lot of people  I know. Take care of yourself.  Flash for all you good buddies heading  west on 70. Smoky's got a roadblock  just beyond Grand Junction... Better  dump your dope, they're going through  everything... He's right. I was just  there and I'm still sore...  Ah loves to be frisked! What are  they looking for? I'm holding. Any  way around it? Where are you? Oh  no!! There it is!!  I bet you we find your friend at the  roadblock.  We're ready.  Where you going?  Las Vegas, please.  We're going to L.A.  Sure. Get in. We can drop you in  Vegas or get you darn close.  I'm telling you, you're going to  find him at the roadblock, or right  after, or not at all.  Fly.  The five-fifty. We already passed  it. But it'll take him way out of  his way.  Why wouldn't he want to go through  the roadblock?... What did you guys  do?... I won't tell anybody.  Wait. Could I have your autograph?  I have nothing to do. I'd like to  help you.  JENNYHAYDN!!!  I told you goodbye. Why are you here?  This car will take me to Las Vegas.  I cannot go back.  If I don't meet the ship, my people  will go home without me.  I will go. But not you.  I don't want you to be hurt.  I don't think they're going to show.  The Cook said I speak good English.  I must meet my ship.  I feel better if I move.  Asshole!!  The cook.  I can't stay on this planet.  You promised you would get me to my  ship.  You promised.  You can stop. I will go on alone.  I can't stay here. I want to go home.  I don't want this skin. I don't want  to look like this.  I used the last one to jump off the  cliff...  I can't be late. I don't know if the  radio balloons work above your planet.  I don't know if my words went to the  ship. If I'm not there, the captain  will think I'm dead and go.  You are cold.  I do not get cold.  What?  Horses.  No.  Do they talk?!  I understand.  I gave you a baby last night.  They are beautiful.  You have been very good to me,  Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I  gave you one.  It will be human and it will look  like this. But when it comes it will know  everything I know and everything you  know. That is something from my planet  that I want your baby to have.  You will have this baby. If you want  it. If you don't, I can stop it now.  Shermin...  We have a new directive. I'm taking  over.  Washington thinks it's too late for  that.  You're not hearing me.  We'll do that. But how are we going  to hold him? He can change himself  into a man. He can disappear.  No, we don't.  You're a career intelligence officer,  Shermin. You'll be in the air with  us.  Is this gambling?  The cowboys were right. You can make  money fast gambling.  We should have. Let me see.  May I have twenty-five cents, please?  I want to gamble.  I understand. Thank you.  I know how to gamble now.  I want to get money for you and the  baby.  Inflation, tuition, college. Children  are damned expensive. I know.  Yes.  This is very interesting. We are  born knowing our history. We have  other books. But not a book like  this.  I understand.  Many of my people will not believe  those things are possible. On my  planet there is only one government,  one people, one language. I will be  asked a lot of questions.  I will say that we can be friends.  If you want to keep it, you can.  You want the baby to laugh at me.  Many, many days and nights...  No, thank you.  There.  The yellow one.  I will wave to you.  Oh, shit!  Mrs. Haydn...  This is George Fox...  You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm  in charge of this operation now.  Okay...  I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.  I don't want to hurt anybody. I just  want to go home.  If I talk to you, I will miss my  ship.  No deal.  I understand.  Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good.  I must go alone now.  I do not know how many times I can  do this.  If my ship is not here, we are in  trouble.  That's where we landed last time.  Right under that mountain.  Over there.  I can't shoot anymore.  Watch it. They're coming out.  End it, Shermin.  What?  Shermin!! Shermin!!!  Shermin!!!  Lock in.  I must go.  What do I do now?  I love you.  No.  Tell the baby about me.  Goodbye.  Thank you, Jennyhaydn.
