I don't think so... Don't you think you should call a backup? What did I tell you? There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses. It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires? Right in line with that burning tree. I don't want to scare them away.We should have. Let me see. It's still the full price. I'll have to run your card off now. Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card? Sure. Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two. What can I do for you folks? Have a nice trip. Gate three. It's boarding now.And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know. Take care of yourself. Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride. What do you think of America? They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything. Do you have children? You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it. Make any money? Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it? What do you do? Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.About five miles back. Elmo's... Stay right there... What the hell do you think you're doing? He's got a gun!!Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit. Recognize this? Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground. We're going... Damn! We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin? Shermin!! Shermin!!! What? No deal. You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us. No, we don't. We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear. You're not hearing me. Washington thinks it's too late for that. We have a new directive. I'm taking over. Shermin... You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy. Is that what's affecting your performance? So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that. I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air. We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions. I'm gonna be here if you need anything. We don't know what else to do. We need results. Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed? I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk. Oh shit!!! Clarify that. Why did you let it get into a populated area? It's in a green Mustang? When can we expect containment? You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck. We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time. We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for. We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact. Contain it and get back to me. I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need. Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin. Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken? There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure? Watch it. They're coming out. Okay... You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now. This is George Fox... Mrs. Haydn...We're ready. I did. Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter. I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together. Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow. That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you. This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns. I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow. Is it for real? You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that? Bullshit! Save us all a lot of trouble. Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...They must have picked it up in space. It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes. Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship? You have no conception of this, do you? Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool. They're gonna let some local cop blow him away. I'm telling you they're probably friendly. Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything. It was a man though... right? It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it? Yes. Twenty-eight years. It was only an accident that we discovered them. We better get it into the box. Come on... I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be. After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive. No, sir. Radar. We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared. Wait'll you see it. No. Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going. Very beautiful country up here...Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry... Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on. Hey buddy... let her go... Jesus Christ!! You crazy people... You could have killed us both!! I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?' Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living? Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch? Hop in. Where are you going? Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral. You know that's impossible! Judy, that's stupid.Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look. Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all right? No, we can handle this. Probably kids. Flew?! Oh, come on Benny... Benny, there's nothing there. I don't see anything. Benny, God, take it easy...That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know. Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right? Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me. Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid. Because I'm the one who called the police, you know. Is there a reward in this?I just retired. George... Do you hear me, George? I'm afraid we can't let you go. You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that. Then you're going to have to do it without me. That's the chance we have to take. You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him. I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you. We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time. What's all this for? Hello George. I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it. Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is... George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal. I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared. You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay. It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed... I don't like it, George... You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over... The extraterrestrial now looks like this. It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband. It's taken on a disguise. Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere. Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang... George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial. Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone. That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us. Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming? Then it's not an accident that they found us. What do you mean by 'contain?' Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing? We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here. Neither did I. None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva... I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and... It's real, George. Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells? Mrs. Haydn... Do you know what you were kidnapped by? Marc Shermin. Get a highway patrol unit over there. Is the man who kidnapped you there now? You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home. This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn? You get that, Lyman? Tell him I'm not here. Doesn't make sense. Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed? Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature. Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that? Give it a rest, Lyman. Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow. Get Fox. It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman. The police think he was high on drugs... Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'... How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet? I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday. To the same woman? You married, Major? I know, but... There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident. Oh, Jesus. People have made mistakes in these situations before. It could have been anything. Was there visual contact? There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then... Can you see under the faceplate? Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that? This has always been my favorite time of day. We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping him now. I wouldn't think so. You saw that? Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that. Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George. All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you. We can't let you do that. Hello...Thank you. It is beautiful. No. No. Eh... yes. I make maps. I understand. Goodbye. Tell the baby about me. No. I love you. What do I do now? I must go. Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now. I will wave to you. The yellow one. There. No, thank you. Many, many days and nights... You want the baby to laugh at me. If you want to keep it, you can. I will say that we can be friends. Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions. I understand. This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this. Yes. Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know. I want to get money for you and the baby. I know how to gamble now. I understand. Thank you. I want to gamble. May I have twenty-five cents, please? The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling. You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now. It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have. You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one. They are beautiful. I gave you a baby last night. I understand. Do they talk?! No. Horses. What? I do not get cold. You are cold. I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go. I used the last one to jump off the cliff... You can stop. I will go on alone. You promised. You promised you would get me to my ship. I can't stay on this planet. The cook. Asshole!! I feel better if I move. I must meet my ship. I don't want you to be hurt. I will go. But not you. If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me. This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back. I told you goodbye. Why are you here? Are you angry at me? You can have one. The machine gave me two. Should I put one back? On the radio they say it's good. But I have never seen this before. I am not complete. You liked my singing? I am not a good singer. I do not want to. Yes. Not all... but it feels like a kiss. I like this music. Why? I am your friend. Are you my friend? He will. What is hell? I understand. He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship. I don't understand 'friend.' The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed. We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship... Yes? We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars. No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and... It was a mistake. I was afraid. What? Please stay. Jennyhaydn. Goodbye. Go? Yes. Can I have the gun? When do I get to Lathrop Wells? The car will stop? 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.' Yes. 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike? I do not speak English. But I speak English. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike? But I must go here. Why? Why? Do you have a baby? A baby is a new person? Is that a baby? When we get here. No. No. No. I need you. Three nights... two days. Yes. Day... night. Yes. I do not understand. My... ...car will take me... ...up there... home. I will see it next time. It was yellow. What? Horses. Shit! I want to try it. I... What is... ...Coke? What? Money. No. You. Mouth closed. No. Who? Shit... shit... what shit? Shit? I am husband? Who? No gas. Gas. Space? From? I am... Jennyhaydn. Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? Who are you? What? Closed? Go. Gas good? No gas. Minneapolis... good. Minneapolis... Minneapolis... What?! Smile... good? What? Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money? Money. What? Pancakes. What? What? What? That way. Good. Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard... Police... What?! Dashboard. Gear shift. Steering wheel. What. Ah no. What. Please... Please. Please... No. I don't understand. I don't understand. Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English. If I talk to you, I will miss my ship. I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home. I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you. Wait. Could I have your autograph? Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody. The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way. Fly. I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all. Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers. They after you? This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast. In the cars, too?! Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going. My grandmother's rich.
