Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini. Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare. Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist here. <i></i> I beg your pardon? Sad commentary, huh? Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here. Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull. Olive or eyeball? Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica , right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking? Animals? What kind of animals?Thank me next time you see me. It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead. Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him. I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go? <i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind. If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die. Well - you'd need a body. I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I enjoy my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is so irresponsible . Why ?? Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all his idea. You were completely innocent -Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day. Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now... At the moment, yes. He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see. Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit. You're really gonna pop the question? And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like. Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get People and Entertainment Tonight to cover it. Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit. Less. What's the matter? A pi�ata. That's a great idea! ...In some weird way I respect that. Oh my God...you're proposing? Why? Being rich is not a trap . That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them. Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta strike . I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth! Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God - Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here... Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!! You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain. That's not going to stop his nightmare - Holy shit.Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice! Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want. The monkey, of course. It was his idea. It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker ! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan! Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...? Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ? Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got big plans for that body of yours! Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying . And you didn't hear it from me. Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, very few people have done it. Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of that schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be grateful ? Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should know. I'm his little brother. Me? Me , go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to that piece of - Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick. Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM. Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support? It's a special kind of party. A farewell party. Do you...get what I'm saying? Kid - didn't they tell you about this party? Uh huh. And? Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the house ! <i></i> This is an honor . We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like caviar , man. You da shits !!Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist. Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine. Move it. We got exactly five minutes left. Isn't that Lulu? Stu...LOOK! There's a thing here! There's a switch! Stu...Stu... I don't know . Oh, sure . Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment? OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here. You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick . For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!! Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it? Stu, you have my absolute confidence . �- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!! Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum�. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT? I'm so dumb! I deserve to die - Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT?? Stu... It's a party . Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that. Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass. Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper. Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket? I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic. The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your ass ! I'm reportin' this to my union!! FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING - Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment! My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before. Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me. You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could both be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't count . Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me. I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's nightmares . And of course, I need not add - Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then. I was, uh, just getting ready to leave... I didn't say anything. Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable. Stu Miley. Olive. - Where exactly am I? Uhh - martini? Chasing me - animals - horrible - Death! Thank you! Back? You're sending me back? Hey. Where's Monkeybone? Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now. DEATH!! Bend over? Coming from you, that's quite a compliment. Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour. I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her. I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare you right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again. You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos. So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big pi�ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em. My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - right now . <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me. I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night. Herb. I have to go . I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap! Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand. Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries? Julie and I - we were just gonna go... You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons ?? Monkeybone...!? But why me ? Why'd you pick on me ?? Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!? YOU SET ME UP!! NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY - Land of Death. How do I get there? Hyp, I'll do anything. Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to... You're Death's brother ? Maybe you could talk to Death! Nine AM! But that's - twelve hours . Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never... I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some... Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm - Tell me what? Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm okay . Until I can get out of here... Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me die . My tail itches. Baby...you're asking the wrong guy. How was it? I don't recall. Julie?... Hey, you are a looker. I'd better go report this... Are you okay?? Did we just - hit something? I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life. I might wake up. I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream? The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him. Look at this! He won't let us leave! Yeah, I could , but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better. That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be us . Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you. They don't love me. They love Monkeybone. Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th-- How am I gonna get past the guards? You can't do this! You'll get in trouble! Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her what Monkeybone is up to?? Kitty... my situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey. Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again. Nothing for him! He's being repressed. Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y-- You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me. It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone? You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you. What? IT'S NOT WORKING. Where'd he go?? He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you. Now we just gotta figure out how to get there. All right. You can come. No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing. <i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you. Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone. Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do. Well - yeah - but that doesn't... apply . It was different then. I was depressed . My life is great now. I'm in love! Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you - How'd you get in there? Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little... doodle . I've been stuck down here for months . Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna kick ass ! He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get to wake up ?? <i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!! He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come he goes back and I stay here? Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey. What union? THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK! <i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying? I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name? Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my species . I am not. And I don't gotta. Then you can learn to act normally. I had to! You have humiliated me in public for the last time .
