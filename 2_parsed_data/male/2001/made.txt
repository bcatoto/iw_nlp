Good luck. Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep. Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today. Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.We have snifters When served warm -- Snifter are for warm drinks --It's on West Broadway. I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though. Women? As far as...? Thank you, sir. It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms. Honestly, the suites are all about the same. All the suites are about the same. What, sir? Thank you very much, sir. Are you sure? Not on me, sir. I can take you down there. Yes, sir. Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315. Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you. ...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening. They were grabbing her fucking ass -- What are you talking about? No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks. No thank you. Yeah. Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben. What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang? I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did. Nobody's fuckin talking to you. No more. Bullshit. You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks -- I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone. Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late. What time is it there? Mommy's not home? Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy? Chloe? You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby. What's wrong, baby? Show uncle Ricky what you made. Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes? She's, uh, sleeping. Ricky, can you put on a seat belt? What'd you say? Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up. Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can. How could you let her see this? She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had. Max offered to stake me. I'll support you. I want you to quit. Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you! Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife! Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin. No way that cocksucker's driving you. Go. Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner. No coke tonight. Right? I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it. I feel weird asking him. Well, that's not gonna happen. Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if -- You talk to Max today? They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face. I'm ready. Who's watching the baby? If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around. Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy. I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy? A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered? No. What kind of bachelor party? So, what kind of gig is this? Honey? I don't get it. Your dance is over. Get your hands off of her. I said no touching. I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching. There's no touching. Where's Ricky. That it? How so? Where's Ricky? Where we going? It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives. Heard of them. Ruiz tied in out there? What do you mean 'troughed?' Yeah? No. Where is this happening? So what do we do? Yeah. What's that? Why isn't Ruiz coming? Shit. When's it going down? How bad is it? So, when's the drop. What's his name? He making the drop? Yeah. Where is he? Get away from her. She'll be out in a minute. You driving her? Yeah, sure. 5-5-1. Draw. I had a fight up at Sportsman's. I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant. There won't be a next thing. You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked. I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club -- You want -- Yes. Yeah. No. Okay. I'll think about it. It's not that I don't appreciate the offer... I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess... Yeah. Sure. He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear. He'll work it off. You told him you liked him. What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity. Ruiz knows about this? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I know. No. I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm -- I don't understand. Then what are you saying? So, that's it. I'm out? What? I'll work it off. That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom -- They were out of line -- Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line. That's why they call it the smart money. She was fast, huh? Pshhh... This one? Why? Me? No. Not really. Sure. Yeah. Where's the drop? What's the plan? A bad heart. Nah, man... Good morning. We get it. We're sorry. What drill? Taken care of? Aren't we waiting for Ricky? Yeah. Yeah? This Ruiz guy, what's his deal? 'Trustafarians?' Yeah. No. That's cool, man. No. Just the cross streets. Harlem? What is it, a restaurant? So, Jimmy, you know where this address is? Where is the Soho Grand? Nah. I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant. What's that? Bobby. Hi. I, uh, think that's us. Listen, man, we really gotta... It's important. Excuse me, we need to make a call. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it. Can you check? We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list? We're with Ruiz. I'll be a minute. I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in? Take us right to Kennedy. Now. Easy... You're not getting a gun. Where do you get this shit? Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed. I don't want to take any more chances. Let's just go now and wait. How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner. No more, man. This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy. Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school. I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me. They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker... Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room? I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks! What happened to the fifteen hundred? Eighty bucks?!? What do you have left? You're out of money? Why? It was six in the fucking morning. You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun? You wouldn't even know where to get one. I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him We don't need guns. I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins. Did you hear what he just said? Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now? The what? Let's do it. Nothing, man. Yeah. Where they gonna whack us? I swear to God, I'll fucking puke. Put that shit out... We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse. You gonna shank him in the shower? What are you doing. It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan. We're not getting whacked. He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know. He wants to see us now. Hi. It's Ruiz. Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye. What the fuck was that about? What the hell did you do? Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. What the fuck's going on? Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one. Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car. You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz. You fucking nuts? Where do you think you're going? Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop. Why you gotta make everything difficult? You happy? Yeah. You would think. Like I said, I don't know. What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy? I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot. What did I 'get?' Missing what? He didn't say shit. I don't know. His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade. You got something to say -- What the fuck is that supposed -- You just don't fucking get it, do you? You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you. Motherfucker... You sold it? I thought they stole it. No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are. What the fuck do you have to complain about? What the fuck do you... No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner. They asked who it was. Nothing. I told you what they said. They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth. Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime? It's on West Broadway. We can walk. We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month. I know you're not calling Jimmy. What are you doing? Who's gonna smell me a mile away? Oh really. Why's that? Don't worry about it. Just be smart. Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last. Great. On my fucking room. Jesus, man. Plus ten? How much was it? How much is it? C'mon, man... Who you calling? Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service. 'Cardiff Giant.' That's us. No. Look. There. Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go. I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max. We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call. Nah, don't bother -- What's the movie? Pretty nice. It's ours. Is that the woman from..? I don't know. Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore. She wants you to paint the ashtray. I'm not taking her to a bar. I promised Chloe we'd come here. See? Now everyone's got one on. What do you got there? C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket. Seat belt. How'd you unlock my phone? Nice work. I like it. I like it. I gotta pick up the baby. Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him. We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business. Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus. I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus. We look good this year. Sorry coach. You wanna go right now? Bullshit... What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow. No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity. You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job. He didn't say we need guns. We don't need guns. Come on, man. Not with the owners here. Shhh... Then why do you try to get in? I thought you hate that club. Bye. I will. I got no idea. I know the number. Yeah. I know the number. I'll page you. I'm not gonna bring it up to him. Don't be shitty. Don't be shitty. It's not losing record. Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1. So? What are you saying? What about boxing? C'mon... Bobby and Ricky. Tom. How's it going?Any time, bro. Sorry, man, but... He's not here. Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though. Ruiz isn't here. He's on the list. Hey. I'm half Lebanese. Maybe you wanna try the China Club. What? You see a Ricky Slade? How is it you're good? You on a list? The line's over there. Cool. You look good, man. You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting? What's up, man.I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else? Excuse me. Yes. Yes. Would you care for another one? Yes? You're up front. Everything's free up here. How much is what? I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage. It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes. Yes?I be off in a minute. Say again...? So's this. Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying? I'm on the phone. Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...I -- I -- I... Don't... Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber -- Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment? Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone -- But what about them? Whu --Then put my Martel's in a snifter. What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker? Yeah, snifters are for cognac -- Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time. I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with. This is it. That's it. He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there. Ricky's taken care of. Quick drop. In and out. And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge. They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case. Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants. Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it. He must have that shit troughed. Brooklyn. Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is? We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then. We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California. A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit. This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller. Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows? It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing. To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now. Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon. Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy. What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz? Excuse -- C'mon girl. Eat up. Yeah. What's up? Jess ready? I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight. Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money. What's your record at? Well, you look it. You win? It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been? I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?. Watch it... Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta. The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician. Just don't ask me no more shit. Stop. See you later. What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?' I'm not saying shit to neither of you. Don't drag my ass into this -- I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?' Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to. 'Strapped?' Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me. Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there. Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull? No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery. Couldn't make it. Here's the money. That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink. No, thanks, man. We got to head out. How's it going? Here... Don't worry, man. It's all for you. That shouldn't be a problem. Coke? What do you want? Sure. Anyplace in particular? You want another drink? No shit? Well, he ain't gonna be around no more. Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home. Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here. Word. Nah, man... Good morning. Yeah.Yeah, he's getting there on his own. Ricky's taken care of. Understand me? Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship. You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean? Depends what night. Spa? I can wait around if you want. Well, this is the corner. You don't know where you're going? Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem. Soho. Traveling light. I like that. Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked? You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right? Hi. I'm Jimmy. Different. Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians. The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand. No. What is it? I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff. Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell. You'll love it. You're from LA, right? The Soho Grand? Soho Grand, right?Thanks. We're square. Four fernet. Sure. You boys want anything?I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing -- Take a few days -- Yes. Goodbye. Not you. I want Ricky to answer. What is it? Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear? Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask? You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished. How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in. You vouch for him? I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me. That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van. Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky? Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth. We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop. Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent. I got a way we make everybody happy. Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say? Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out? It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you. Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep. I didn't say that. You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul. Not driving Jess, you won't. Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand. They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth. Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys. I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you? Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast. A million. Easy. Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today? It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze. Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it? You bet the ponies? You like the ponies? And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing. We're square. I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van. Goodbye. Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you. So tell me how it is. Tell me. You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming? What? You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you. That money is your per diem. Yes. You're going to New York. dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK. Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --See you later. Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is. Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway. Nightlife. Where's the hot ass? Where's the place to go tonight? No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty. What if I gave you forty? Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms. Is it the good room? So? Yeah. Take it. Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty. Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred? Is it a good room? Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here. What's 'incidentals?' Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay... Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !' I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here. So you're models? I don't get it. What do you do? You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything? So, wait, you're from where? No. I'll wait here. Dude, we were practically made... Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan. Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up? Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy. Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance. Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice... Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better. Three and a half hours? So what do we do? Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep. It's gonna be fine. I'm sorry... This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie. Calm down. What about it? You did? You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while. Eighty five. Eighty. No. You wanna see how fast I get a gun? Float me a hundred bucks. That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden. Wanna bet? All the more reason. I'm pretty sure we do. We need guns. Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house. Yeah. Let's look at the penguins. The penguin house. Let's check out the penguins. I'm your soldier. You want us strapped, don't you? Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us? C'mon, man... Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up -- I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked. Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is? We're getting whacked. Where? What's up? She was jonesing for me. I swear to God, I didn't do anything. Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub. Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do. Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk. Siddown, motherfucker. 'Sex and paychecks.' Look who's back? Want some champagne? Fine. You got that right. Work's over. I'm gonna party. Back in. Fuck this. You too? About what? So we're working? He woulda told us right? So is this the drop? Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas... Yeah. What vibe? Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him? Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it. This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else? You know this guy? I mean, that's what I heard -- You know he fucks all his girls, don't you? Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that. Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy. Sold it, stole it, whatever... Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van. Don't even start. This is bullshit, man. So they said more than the address. How'd they know who you were? Nothing else. They didn't say an address? What exactly did they say? Fuck... Well, I don't want to walk. You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it? As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that? What are you doing? Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about. We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit. But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already. Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay? Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy. Yeah, I guess. Forty-six. How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye. Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool. Shhh... Hello, room service? You sure? Maybe we should call for a cab. Oh, I'll represent alright. Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours. You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here. I'll get the girl. See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets. Holy shit. Can you believe this? To keep? She really liked the kitchen. Right here's fine. This paint sucks. The white shows through. Who's driving her? I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple. What? Did she say something? Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid. Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's. Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer. Jesus Christ, fine. Alright? No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer -- I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer. Shhh... Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there. You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four. It's not even yours. Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid. Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass. Who is this fucking Ruiz? What are we delivering? Fuck him. We'll kill Fairfax this year. Sorry coach. I'll beat your ass -- Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you. Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds -- Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity. He implied it. I think we might. We need guns. Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early... Fuck them. I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace. So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.' I'll page you with the number. Ask if he said anything to her. I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done? Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number. Yeah. Page me. You know the number? Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up... I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us. How am I being shitty? That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record -- So, it's not a winning record. So, it was a draw. You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max. What about it? Did Max mention anything about any jobs? I didn't do anything -- You want to come splash around. Well, come on then. It's back here. You want your surprise? I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel. What do you mean 'kinda?' And you grew up in Manhattan? Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list. Did you see that shit? Motherfucker. You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech? Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you? Cardiff Giant. Just check. Cardiff Giant? Yeah. Ricky Slade. Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean? Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man. Hey, bro. Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double. Where do you live? Where do you live? Yes. Drinks are free, right? The videos. Yeah, sure. How much are they? Ugh... Yeah, uh, what's the movie? I'm half Irish. Ow, shit... Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split. So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything? I'll tell him someone else told me. You really in trouble? What? Why am I bad? Why? What I say bad? He spoke to me. You want me to dis him? It means you got a gun? You strapped? How do you know it's not drugs? Where's Spa. I call 'em wiggers. A lot of Persians? I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is? You know my pager number? So you're our own private guy? So whenever we want... Yeah. Yeah. Is it nice? Ricky. Yes, sir. But, Max -- So, wait, what are we dropping off? You want... Why are you picking on me? Don't worry. I get it. I get it. Yes. What about my keys? Keys. Yeah. And where do we bring it? And the money. Where do we bring the money? We're going to New York? Can I borrow a piece of -- When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street. Why aren't you coming? Yeah. So, we're talking money laundering... The Red Dragon. Who's gonna outfit us? He has a cute what...? No... Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that? She poured it for -- We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything. It's a digestif. Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that. No. I'll take a strega. I'll get it. Dip? A rose by any other name would -- Well, word on the street is you're Welsh. And where might that be? Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live? So, you must be the Red Dragon.You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say? Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight. Tom, the Welsh dude -- I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it. Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon. Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas? Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house. Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears. 'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?. That's him. Now you all know the drill, right? Last thing I want is you with a gun. You think it's funny, motherfucker? You think this shit's funny, Ho? Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa. Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room. You rode? Thanks, man. You need anything, you call. Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you? Yeah, bring us four fernet. That's none of your fucking business. What? Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down. Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account. Outfit? What's he talking about? Four mimosas. You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up. What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right? Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass. What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne. Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right? Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif. What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?Cool. See you later. A little. S'up.Fuck... Right, right. The 'thugs.' Fine, fine. And you were...? Hey, boys. I... I just hired these guys to watch my back... I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count. Sorry about that. Where's your mate? Come, now. You just got here. Brilliantly. Care for a pint? Here they are, then. No, really, mate? Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around... I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants. A little Charlie, perhaps. I hear the China Club is a laugh. Does anyone want another? Pity. What's say we have a drink? Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either. No? And where is...? Who's up for a night on the town. Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know. I am. Scotland. Edinburgh. Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom. And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
