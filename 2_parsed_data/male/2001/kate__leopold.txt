You dance like a herd of cattle,  Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman  who lights up the room... simply by  leaving it. Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join  us downstairs after completing this  one-sided flash of wit? I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle  Otto. No one really listens to anyone  else. If you attempt it, you will  see why. You judge everything too severely. I  wonder what would happen if you were  to cast that critical eye inward? You do not wonder at all. You merely  ask in order to state your own  opinion. We are all concerned about you. Ahh, here it comes. Your life does not seem to have any  direction. At the age of 25 a man is  too young to do anything well. At 35  he is too old. Now is your time to  take action. Tell me, what is it you  want to DO with your life? I do not know. Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Wake up! This is your one and only  life. Every man has the chance to  make a difference. DO something! I am most grateful for your  surveillance and for your sympathy.  I assure you there is no need for  concern. I am as effectual and  attentive... as my position allows. Life is not position, Leopold. It is  action. I will see you downstairs promptly.  In the appropriate frame of mind. Go spread joy. You dance like an angel, Miss  Fairchild. You light up the room. I  thank you. Good evening. I do not believe I  have had the pleasure. ...Julia Carlson. I'm sorry. Will you excuse me? You are not from the area, are you? Are you? This is my estate. Really? Well it's not home but it's much... Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY. The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't  it? It is a scandal nonetheless. Miss Carlson, do me the honor? I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer. Truly I would be in your debt. Any  admonition would be erased simply by  presenting a partner as lovely as  yourself. No, no. Really, I... I suppose we really ought to sing  along. Oh, golly. Thank you for the dance. It was  lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful  for you. Not at all. It was most enlightening. I really must be going. I won't hear of it. No, I'm quite late as it is. I shall see you to the door... You're very sweet. I had a wonderful  time. Goodbye. Miss Carlson? Good God... What are you...? You frightened me. What sort of mechanism is this? Answer me! It's perfectly all right. It's... Listen to me. Please. Move very  slowly. Step out of the machine.  Step out and I'll explain whatever  you want to know. What is this? Who are you? Oh, God. Get out of there! Get out now! Miss Carlson... I... No!!! Shit!! Good God! Everybody stay calm... Lock the front  door. No, no, no. You mustn't touch him.  The consequences could be  catastrophic. ...All right. Touch him. Carlson...! Give me a minute... She's back. Kate. It's Carlson. Something went  wrong. I love Ronald Coleman. We've altered the course of history. What are we going to do? We can't  keep him here. Imagine if anyone  found out! He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig. We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked  will be responsible. Agreed? You'll look after him? Where...? What has happened?! Oh. Americans. I see... Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came  upon a formula utilizing Tachyons...  particles traveling faster than the  speed of light, which allowed us  to... fold time so to speak. Yes. Bend it between the cracks of  the dimensions. Now, while that wasn't the original  purpose of our experiment, we opted  to pursue it, well, privately, on  our own. Merely to discover if the expedition  were possible. As your presence here  confirms... we are very disturbed. The problem facing us is not only  HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you  see? Rest assured, no harm will come to  you. You'll be well looked after by  Dr. Coles. Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What  do you mean, get me back home?...  Where am I? Answer me!... Would you have me believe... I am  being detained, at present in the  HEREAFTER?... The time to come? It is the year nineteen hundred and  ninety-five. ...19...? You're insane! All of you! This is  impossible! Leopold, calm down! A voyage through time! What do you  take me for? Did you bring me here  by force? We're scientist, not seditionists. Let me out of here! I won't stand  for this another moment! Just listen to what we have to say! 19...? I insist on being returned home  immediately. I wish to speak with your employer,  Dr. Coles. You are not suggesting that you are  Dr. Coles? Miss... uh? A WOMAN of science? But a woman's brain cannot obtain  enough knowledge to posses a truly  scientific mind. Are you attempting to be humorous? Young lady, I... Surely it is not  expected that I remain here with you  indefinitely... Unchaperoned? Certainly not! The idea! My dear Miss Coles... Honey... Honey... For the tea. Thank you... Has it been decided  what it is I am to do while I am  being held here? ...At what time shall I WEE and POOH? Your father? Visiting? What? What did I do? You were against it. Hey!... Are you all right? You look  funny. Both. Why? Butter me up. Very. Kate! What about a hotel? I meant for me. You owe me nine. What am I supposed  to do all day? Kate, the entire point of being an  artist is that I don't have to work.  Who is this guy? Does he have a label? LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his  name? Then you owe me ten. Horrible! What is this? It is beyond help. Please serve the  next course. Is all food here this... textured? Mine's good. Please understand, I am used to a  different sort of preparation. Where  I come from a proper meal is the  result of reflection and study. A  recipe is merely a theme which an  intelligent cook can plan each time  with variation. Several courses are served. Menus  are often prepared days in advance,  timed to perfection. It is said,  without the culinary art, the  crudeness of reality would make life  unbearable. In Canada? In Canada. We have a saying here. "Shake and  shake the catsup bottle, none will  come and then a lot'll." How interesting. Since you're such an expert on fine  cuisine, why don't you make dinner  tomorrow night? It should be obvious to you that I  am NOT a domestic. You may take my  plate. I have my own, thank you. Who died and made me Cinderella? Young man, there is a distinct  impertinence to your voice. It's part of my charm. Suppress it. What is it? What is it?? What is it?? No, but I believe there is a rule  that says everyone has to have HEARD  of it. Dr. Coles, your brother Charles  attitude and demeanor are  unacceptable. If I am to stay on  here you must have a serious talk  with him regarding respect and  civility. In the kitchen? I don't believe this guy! I'm always NICE! He gives me the creeps. What was that crack about domestics? You're not going out with him, are  you? Kate, this is me. I've seen the guys  you bring home. Oh, all right! All right! All right! You know,... I don't know if I  mentioned it... but that is one fine  looking suit. I cannot seem to find the tea... No... No... No. Good God, no!...  Perhaps... I should like to read about modern  currency during my bath tonight. See  that the tub and basin are scrubbed  up. Remnants remain of this afternoons  shave. The fire brigade! This is insufferable! I refuse to be  spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled  about any longer. I have yet to  venture outside this cell. Before I  go mad a more suitable arrangement  must be found. A resolution? Dr. Coles! Changes are in order. Miss Coles, as we are to remain here  together, there are certain conditions  I insist are met and maintained. I  no longer wish to be peeped at,  mocked... Or interrupted. Jot this down.  Breakfast at 12. Luncheon at 4. Diner  at 8. A horse should be made available  from 1 to 3. Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about  your style of dress. I do not care  for it. I cannot believe it is the prevailing  taste for women to appear masculine  and unkempt. If this is the fashion,  have it altered. That is all for the present. CRUMBS, my dear! Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted  with many women in my time, yet I am  compelled to say that the modern  woman is by far the least attractive  I have ever encountered. Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough  Swirl or Peach? Any luck? My cholesterol level is up 70 points. Thank you, Kate... How're you managing  with Leopold? Nothing. I was just asking. Katherine Coles is the most capable  person we have on this project. If  anyone can handle the delicacy of  this situation, Kate can. Absolutely not. Are you crazy? This is the first  time all week my eyes aren't darting  to the top of my sockets every five  minutes. I don't know. An hour ago? He said  he wanted to take a walk. Is he being punished? Kate, calm down. What's the big deal? Who is this  guy? OH MY GOD!!! What're ya waiting for lady? An  invitation? $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct? You gotta problem with that? It seems rather pricey to me. So don't buy one. I shan't. So shan't! Yes, I... I would be happy to sample  one however I'm afraid I haven't the  finance with me just now. If I could  establish a credit with you, I will  have someone come round with the  funds tomorrow. You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a  hamburger today, is that it? I believe so. Yes. Get the fuck outta here. I beg your pardon? Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off. May I remind you, merchant, that I  am the customer in this establishment  and as such require your attention  and the utmost respect. I do not  accept this modern convention of  desecrating one's patrons with such  contemptuous disregard. Need I add that without our patronage  you would not own that unwashed  counter behind which you spew your  filthy mouth? Where do you get off? You don't even  have any money. Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing. Not in my store you're not. Do you intend to physically escort  me out...? Did you see what he did? Did you see  that? I wish to go home. No... I wish to go home. I don't know. It's just Leopold.  Like Cher. Or Goofy. Never mind they just walked in. Jesus.  You look horrible. It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look  horrible. I've something to say. To the both  of you. I... Nothing is what it seems.  After witnessing mere weeks of this  age it is painfully apparent I am  outside of my acquaintance... I don't  know how to proceed. I frankly... am  in need of assistance. I'm sorry.  I'm not very good at this. In the  event you have missed it, I am  apologizing. About time. Welcome back. I understand. It practically races  through mine. We'd better get to bed... That is... Oh, dear. You mustn't get too used to it. You'll  find life passes you by awfully  quickly. Thank you for... Well, goodnight then. Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was  merely... I didn't... I merely wanted to see... that is,  inquire, on your availability, for  an outing... My assimilation and so  forth. Yes, of course. Splendid. Are you certain this is correct? Now really. Isn't this better? Allow me. Sorry. Oops! Careful there. So sorry. Have you seen today's paper? But... Dr. Coles, why is it you are not  married? Yet people still marry? I suspect there is something wrong  with you. Perhaps it is the way you present  yourself. There is some sort of problem when a  woman reaches thirty and insists on  remaining single. What? It was an arbitrary number. I didn't mean it. I apologize... How old are you? I'm sorry. She is the woman to whom I was  referring. You see the problem? You have a lovely face. We'll take the dress. What is this? I'm coming. Astounding. How are you proceeding? The complexity of this equation is  astonishing? Can you really comprehend  all that? You're quite exceptional Dr. Coles. That is to say, you all are. May I accompany you? I am not certain I understand therapy. What exactly transpires during  therapy? I am perfectly able to travel homeward  myself. Really! I have finance and our  address. I shall take a cabbie. You are late. I insist. I am NOT a  child. Dr. Coles. I can't seem to... All right, kids. Pair up! Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the  music. Dancing should not be work. It should  be a vacation the body takes from  the mind. Let the music wash over  you. Repeat after me: I've got the muusic  in me. I've got the muusic in me! Keep telling yourself that. You didn't! Is she all right? Christine, this morning I spoke with  the head of funding. They're talking  about canceling the project. There's still time. Nothing has  happened yet that can't be undone.  We'll get her back. We'll put this  behind us and we'll get her back. Is there something on your mind? This is rather difficult for me. ...Uh huh...? I have been in the salon contemplating  the reception I have received by the  various tradesmen I have visited.  I've determined I am lacking the  dexterity of modern intercourse. Of what?? Social skills. Oh. I realize our association has been  rather distant and I bear you no ill  will. You can imagine my relief. The fact is... I need help. Why not ask Kate? I would appreciate the masculine  point of view. Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke. Well? Let's see... I guess we could  start by removing that great big  stick from up your... Let's start  with your walk. My walk? You don't walk right. You strut. Strut strut strut. You walk into the  bathroom it's like I'm watching a  parade. Walk across the room. I will not. I know you won't. You'll STRUT. You  asked for my help. Trust me on this. That's enough! Really! You walk. See? Easy. Relaxed. You try. That's better. Now, try to enjoy  your walk. It's a beautiful day. The  sun is shining, the peasants are  singing. Interesting? What the hell is that? What? Leopold, are you wearing a corset? Naturally. What'd ya say was the name of this  number? Tchaikovsky. Waltz of the Flowers. Pretty. Megadeath. High Speed Dirt. What in the world...? Sorry! We're so sorry. Are you hurt? Is this your child? Yes. I see. Just a moment! Pick a hand. My mother's name was Elizabeth. She's a beautiful child. You're very  lucky. What do you say, Elizabeth? Thank you. I understand pumpkin pies, pizza  pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone  would explain Eskimo pies. You smoke Camel's, you wear Old  Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew.  It's revolting. The pudding tonight is excellent.  Another thing I've noticed, everyone  is in a great rush today. Instant  Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick,  Minute Maid. You'll find there's  much to be said for moderation and  languor. Mmmm. Is it tapioca? It's marvelous. Well, I'm off. I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine.  It's this coffee house we go to. Who is that? Dennis is this really good looking  friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's  alive because SHE doesn't know how  to flirt. And he always picks up the check. Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you. What? Ahhhhh? If you'd rather I didn't go... Oh it's not that. It's just that  it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all.  I'm not sure you'd have such a good  time. A little ribald humor? I'm not as  big a stick in the mud as you might  think! I'd enjoy a gay night out,  kicking up my heels. Finish off your Parquet and we'll  go. There they all are. Now one more  thing. Throw the words "like" and  "you know" into a sentence whenever  possible. It's how people talk today. Proper speech does not cease to exist  simply because it is ignored. Please? Charles, you needn't fret. I have  the walk down pat. I will not give  myself away. Like. Oh shit! Shoot. What is it? Patrice. See that girl? The blonde  one? She's so inconceivably hot. She's very pretty. She's mine. Congratulations. Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her  first. I understand. Okay. I guess we should go in. I  don't suppose we could tell everyone  you don't speak English? Of course not. Let's go inside. Charlie! Where've you been? etc. Hi. Uh everyone, this is my friend,  Leo. Hey. Hey. Waz up? Waz up? How are ya? How are ya? Leo's staying with us for a while. May I? Help yourself. Thank you, my dear. Um?... ...I have nothing to say. You did not tell the truth about  Patrice, Charles. CHARLES?? What did I tell you, LEO? He informed me you were inconceivably  HOT, but I think you're lovely.  Exceptionally lovely. Thank you, Leo. Check please. Just drop it Leopold. But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I  am not interested in her. Hah! In any case the problem is not with  me but with you. You have no idea what it takes to go  about courting a woman. From what  I've witnessed tonight, it is  symptomatic of your entire generation. You are some piece of work, Leopold. Now I do not wish to get personal... But you have been of great assistance  to me and I feel this is one area  where I can be of some real help. I'm fascinated. Go on. Now, why was I successful with this  young lady and why did you so  miserably fail? What makes you think she likes you? Well she gave me the number of her  telephone and I assumed it meant... Go on. As I see it, the girl hasn't an  inkling of your intentions. And it's  no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry  Andrew. A what? A Merry Andrew. I am not!! Everything plays like a farce to  you. The more wit, the less courage.  I believe the modern woman desires  passion, protection, sensitivity. No  woman wants to be romanced by a  buffoon. Banter and repartee are fine but you  must add to that a different sort of  playfulness. You think I should pounce? I'm saying you must treat her with  respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude  pass. A woman of Kate's stature would  never respond to an artificial tactic. Kate? What? You said Kate. I did not. Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate? We are discussing your problem. Not anymore. You like my sister. Charles... She has trouble with men, you know. Perhaps she has not met the right  one. She has met the right one. HUNDREDS  of times. But she pulls back. She  cuts herself off. You turn around  and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx. One never can tell. Does Kate know how you feel? No... Have you made your intentions known  to her? No... Who's the Merry Andrew now?! I think  you're all talk and no action. What  are you waiting for? I do not know if there is a future  in it. Well Leopold, no one ever does... What's that? I see. It was very interesting. Yes. I did. Yes. Kate? Goodnight. Hi. I brought you some flowers. Charlie! Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering  if you would do me the great honor  of accompanying me to the cinema  tonight. And allowing me the privilege  of escorting you to dinner afterwards. It's beautiful. Gracing me with your conversation  and company would mean the world to  me. Um... 7:00? 7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then. Goodbye. Goodbye. It worked! Of course it did. Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea  what to do next! Charles. Leave everything to me. Not so fast, buddy. You're next. Good morning. I'm terribly sorry!! Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was  wondering... What it is you're working on. I see. Actually I meant the work  itself. Oh. I have never seen a woman work as  diligently and extensively before. It's quite a beautiful day, have you  noticed? Perhaps you would permit  yourself some time off and grant me  the privilege of escorting you around  the city this fine Spring afternoon. I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the  same. It is YOUR company I am seeking. I see. Some other time then. Maybe if you... I see. ...Perhaps it is a sign? Allow me. Is that supposed to be my hair? Do  you see how they think my hair looks? Aaand this represents...? I'd almost forgotten how beautiful  it was. Truly. Beautiful. M & M's, CBS, FBI. Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ. I don't know how you keep up with  it. I'm exhausted. I'll tell you what. Why don't I  prepare dinner tomorrow night? I  never have before. I mean even before  I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I  can't imagine what it'll taste like,  but I don't think it will be any  worse than your cooking. I see. Oh, I'm so sorry. Ah! Another time then. It's quite all right. The pleasure was mine. It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold.  Are you sure you can teach me  everything there is to know? Nobody's talking to you. It is very simple. I will be your  date. Just behave as you normally  would and I'll correct you along the  way. Now, escort me in. Now what? Pull the chair for a lady! Clod. Well, really! You're not shoveling coal into a  furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in  gently. Gently. Try it again. Well, sit down! Now don't burst a vein or anything,  but there are quite a few knives and  forks here. How do I know what each  one's for? Merely start from the outside and  work your way in. What kind of beer should I order? Beer! I WAS KIDDING! You look exquisite, Katherine. This is a tie I'm wearing. Yes. I know. Your bland date? Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't  use to many big words. You'll scare  the poor slob away. Hi. Kate? Kate, may I have a word with you? Yes. I DON'T like the look of him. Cad. I can spot one a mile away. I shall escort you out myself. I  will act as your chaperone. It is no trouble. But... Sit down. So. How am I doing? How am I doing? First date. You  pleased? You disappointed? I see. So. What did Jeannie say about me? 6'3. Thank you. Well, I work there... You've obviously never worked on  Wall Street. What else did Jeannie say about me? Have I told you how much I liked  your painting? Twice. If you get tired of hearing about  it, let me know. I have to admit I  was sort of surprised when you called.  I didn't think you liked me, Charlie. When I first saw you, I thought... What do you think now? She said you were enormously sexy,  had a great body, but you don't put  out. Would you say it's an accurate  portrait? So this guy wants to invest $50,000  in a stock that's no good. Here's  what I do... I'm telling you the guy was a DICK!  A total ASSHOLE! Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking  about. Hello? Bread and butter. You're back early. Did you enjoy  your date? Is it gone? How inconsiderate. Is he there right now? I'll protect you... Dr. Coles, would you grant me license  to dine with you tomorrow evening at  eight o'clock? Until tomorrow, then. You look beautiful. I know you like it. Tell me more. Have you had many jobs? Do you miss him? I think you are a remarkable woman  Katherine Coles. No, it is you who would be surprised. Kate... Good morning. Morning. Good morning. It's nothing. I will have to have a talk with her. Kate... Please sit down. Kate, I had never before been a  considerate man. I had, with  astonishing complacency, squandered  my life, waiting for some incentive  to force me into action. You have  made me see how rare our time here  really is. I am most beholden to you  Kate. And always will be. Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming  my wife. Shall I take that as a "yes"? I love you, Kate. Where I come from that's pretty much  the way it works. I have loved you since I first set  eyes on you. I cannot imagine my  life without you beside me. I want  to marry you, Kate and make an honest  woman of you. Do you not love me Kate? Then consider my proposal. I need you beside me. I will not  give up easily. Morning. Morning! Coffee? I would like some coffee. When. Uh huh. Public office is apparently still  the last refuge for the incompetent.  Show me a man who does not want his  gun registered and I'll show you a  man who should not own a gun. What  is a pee-pee girl? The Village Voice. After much  consideration, I have decided it is  time I join the work force. Perhaps not that, but I am determined  to acquire honest employment. Kate, my life back home was beneficial  to no one. I want my new life to  have value. I won't make the same  mistakes twice. I could conceivably wait my whole  life away. I will not waste any more time. I  must make a difference. Try our fragrance? Would you like to  try our new fragrance today? What is it? It is called, POISON. Oh! I don't think so. Have you got I beg your pardon? Elizabeth Taylor's Passion? Next aisle over. Give your mother-in-law what she  really deserves this season. Give  her some POISON. How long were you going to keep it a  secret, Kate? Were you even going to tell us at  all? Not sure? What can you be thinking?  You can't alter the course of history  and assume everything will be okay.  It won't be. He has his own destiny  to fulfill in his own time. He's going back, Kate. It's over. There you are. I've only been  hollering for the last... Kate? What is it? What happened? Kate... Are you all right? You don't look so fine. You'll miss him? Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy! Kate, don't do this. Please. It's  not right. Listen to me, Kate. Don't! Don't be  the ice princess. You are. You can't live your whole  life under a microscope. You've got  to tell him how you feel. You owe it to him. So I looked him right in the eye and  said, 'Ego is nature's compensation  for mediocrity.' I turned and I  walked. He never said a word... He  probably didn't understand it...  Kate? Are you all right? You're awfully  quiet. How was your day? When? No! Is that all? Who is this woman sitting across  from me? Tell me that you love me as I love  you. Let me hear you say it. I will not do this. I'm sorry. Good God. Look at you. You look awful. I went back to the restaurant. They  told me you went out looking for me  right after I left. I had a lot to think over. Just where I stand around here. Is that an apology? I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going. I'm staying here with  you. It is my destiny. It is my decision. I love you, Kate. The single most  miraculous event in my life was not  how I arrived here, but that when I  did, I found you. After much consideration I've come  to the conclusion I no longer desire  a large estate with a full staff and  ornate grounds. A beautiful wife, a small home in  the middle of nowhere, lots of  children, and fine schools with PMS  meetings every other Sunday. PTA. This is outrageous! I won't allow  it! The decision is not yours to make. Do you realize what you're saying?  You're tampering with fate,  preordinance, and God himself. We do that every day, doctor. It is  called CHOICE. Perhaps she does not wish to return.  Perhaps she's found greater happiness  in her new life. It happened to me. Dear lord. I keep seeing that poor woman's face.  She was terrified. Six months ago I wouldn't have given  it another thought. I wouldn't have  lost a moment's sleep. You've changed  me, Kate. There is no turning back. You don't realize what you're saying!  You don't understand the kind of  life you'd lead. What you'd be giving  up. I can't ask that of you. Come back with me. This is something I've wanted to do  for a long time. This will be very therapeutic. The time tables have been set. Just  strap yourself in and you'll be fine. You have only a twenty four hour  leeway before the machine is set to  return to us. You must find Carlson  within that time frame and get her  on board or there will be little  chance of her finding a way back. I understand. It's been a real pleasure. You have  a much nicer smile than Ronald  Coleman. The privilege was mine. Oh, my. See that you do. Four minutes and counting. Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye. Goodbye. I shall miss you Charles, more than  you know. I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're  the only one who knows how to program  the VCR... Take care of my sister. I will. You better. Take care of yourself  too while you're at it... So long. I will see you soon. You'll be with me all the time. Kate... I love you, Kate. For as long as it takes. I'll be waiting. It's time Leopold. 9 8 7 6 5 4... 3 2 1! I cannot in good conscience let you  go. It's out of the question. I can't be a part of it either Kate.  I'm sorry. We cannot guarantee your child's  safety. It's that simple. Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here? Yeah. You're Leo aren't you? You don't  remember me but I knew you when you  were yea big. Yeah. I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your  mothers. We had spaghetti at our house 4 times  this week. Kate? I came to see you, sweetie. We've just been getting acquainted. It's all right, Kate. I understand. You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a  lot of time to get your affairs in  order... And I warn you, it's nearly  impossible for an intelligent woman  back there. He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would  be proud. We're aware of your  situation but we felt when the time  came, you deserved the option. Who was that lady? What she want? Good night. He's old enough. He's happy. Mom, we're only moving to Denver. I know. Me too. Live happily ever after. Kate, it's time. Here. It's a letter for my father.  Tell him about me and... um, tell  him I love him. I want him to know  me. Mom, I want you to go. Go. Ready! 9, 8, 7... 3, 2, 1! I just love a starched white shirt.  It's so elegant. Thank you. Skeeky. Yes. You dance like an angel Miss  Beall. You light up the room around  you. I thank you. Thank YOU. Who is that dancing with Leopold?
