Where is it? Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that�s where he's headed. We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast. He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded. Here! Who's that? How low? It won't hold! Sure. Dr. Grant was. I don�t know. They set a trap They actually set a trap. About a thousand feet above it, actually. Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were. So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet? That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island. I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES! I CAN GET HIM! You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions. Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the... ALAN! We could co-write a paper. It looks intact. I don't remember that on InGen's list. Baryonyx? Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that snout. Is it a rex? I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin. Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along. It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling. No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM! They're here. It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology. Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment. How was your trip? Profitable?He loves you too. then we should... We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to. Where's Dad? DAD! What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs? We're safe! No. I couldn't see. You should. The lady you called, how do you know she can help us? Something must've scared them. But then you never get to go in space. I want to be an astronaut. Do you have any kids? Then we go home? Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get. Are you sure? I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start. Mine's new. Know what this is? I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself. Yeah. Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer. Found this, but the battery's dead. When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind. The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then. You're Alan Grant, aren't you? I read both of your books. They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out. In Costa Rica?A bird cage. Oh, my God. One way to find out. This is how you play God. Quiet! After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive? A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed. How many days have they been missing? And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals. NO! Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else. You're no better than the people who built this place. Billy, I can't talk to you now. We need to keep moving. KEEP GOING! Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish. We should take it with us to signal any planes. That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to? Not with that sail. Spinosaurus Aegypticus. They never got that big. How would you classify it? I don't think so. Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see... The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away. And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people. Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic. That does sound lucky. Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag. What? Absolutely not. Not if it can't dig. You rented an automated litter box. We'll be broke in four weeks. A well-accepted theory. Okay. Goodbye, Ellie. I'd better get going. The last of my breed. It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur. To a degree we never imagined. We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team. You remember the sounds they made? Raptors, mostly. Really? What do you do there? He used to know me. Hmm? The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles. No we're not. Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you? They look worried. Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash? You're right. It's strikes me now I never told her that. She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything. Bonitas. Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do. See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground. I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts. No. Although I've studied them in the wild. We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up. Why? We need to head for the coast. How much of this island have you explored? A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil. What did you think? Did you read Malcolm's book? The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common. It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks. Any weapons, radios? Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me. Which one do you prefer? You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too. On the island. Eric, your parents are both here. Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help. Billy! Back out! Move! But you never came across just one. There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there? You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive. No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island. I have never been on this island! Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane... What the hell is going on? What are they doing? This plane can not land! That's hard to believe. I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can�t fly low enough to see anything of interest. That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified... Hmmm. You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time. What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age. You mean it? He could have died. I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy. My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing. I'm trying! That thing took him down this way! We're not going anywhere, I promise. Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh? I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he... I don't remember I don't know. I don't have it with me. That one time was just the bumper. Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it�s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it. I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night. Am I right? It's not safe. Udesky. Eric! Are you here? I know you liked Ben. I had no right to... I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him. That's him. That�s Eric! Young adult. What did you say! What did you say? What? Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me. Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him? No, Dr. Grant says... Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory. You look good. People change. Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y. Sorry. We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that? Her new boyfriend. Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back. He says it's a bad idea! Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea! Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else. We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide. Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile... First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years. Eric! He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island. Right? I thought you were an expert. They couldn�t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down. Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top. I didn't know, there were two islands. Stan. Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing. It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use. Amanda! Well that's good. There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that. Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son. Sure you have. You wrote that book... We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before. Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green... Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy. Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government. No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you. Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something... I guarantee it'll be worth your while. Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
