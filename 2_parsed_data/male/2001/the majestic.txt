Well, then, as what did you go? Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party. Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony? Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party? Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive... All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now? Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl? We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this? Start with what you knew then. Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?" Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there? Good. Good. Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935. A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it? I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident." And what is the state of your memory now? Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory? Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true? Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right. Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix? Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson? Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"Mr. Appleton, you will... Go ahead, son. Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath. The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth. Yes. A prepared statement. Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct? The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton. We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee? Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?Don't mention it. Welcome home, Luke. Here we are. Ben, when's Delly due back? Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office? Exactly. Break it to her gently. Give the man a hug, boy! That's your father! Shhhhhh. Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory. What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here. A mystery or a damn miracle. And by god I can't tell which. Boy, you say you have no idea who you are? That right? No wallet, huh? Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers... C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou. Or the Bijou. Either one. The Jimmy Stewart picture? I remember that one. Saw it over at the Bijou. So, you remember that, huh? What's that? But what? You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?So... you do intend to fix the place up after all? You think it over. No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building. The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket. Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point. I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it. And that's just for the property, mind you. If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds. I just want the land. I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands. I don't think he gave it very much thought. And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou. Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back. Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.Thanks for the lift, Cecil. Well, son, you're home! Only one in town. Get in, son. Listen to me! The young man in there... Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there... Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here. Oh, God, I love you, son. I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it? Vultures... Anybody take it? Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel. Did you... did you... The film broke... Luke... what time is it? You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad." Ha! Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left. Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact... Beautiful, wasn't it? Oh, no, I... They're... Yes? Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly. You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball." Ernie. Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to. I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you... Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures. Yes? Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa. No, your mother did, then I did after she passed. I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too. Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start. This is the staff of the Bijou. They couldn't wait to see you. Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home. That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul. Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. C'mon, I'll show you where we live. Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to. Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight. We've been closed for a while. Wait'll you see the inside! Nine and-a-half years ago. You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two. You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead. Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby. Harry, son. Harry.Pete... Then I'll call you a cab. I wanna close up soon. C'mon, let's call her. Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up. Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy? Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender? You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening. Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him. The G-man? What. Pete. You think maybe you've had enough?I had it, a minute ago... Honey, I... I can't... it's the... It's possible. I'm afraid not. He looked right at your picture without batting an eye. But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him. It just takes a catalyst. He doesn't remember anything, Delly. Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone... Well... That always used to work. That's my girl! Did you...? How'd it go? Delly? In here. Tomorrow afternoon... ... oh my god... Mother o'god... Are you saying that he's... By all means. No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil? That's where you live. ... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me. Thanks. Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are... That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy. Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does. Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick." What is it? It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all. And you don't know your name or who you are, that right? Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before. Here, one of mine. Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean. Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in. Been drinkin' a bit, have we? Any idea how you got here, son? Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. I'm sorry. It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down. No, I'm not much of a dancer. You kids off to the dance? Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it... Evening, Luke.Take a hike. Am-scray. Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone. What's his rent? Wouldn't blame him if he was. Jesus. You smell gas? Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you? So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself. You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS. Well, that's not what they think. What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name? Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do. Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning. What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter? Not at all. Why not? Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer. When'd you quit smoking? Cigarette? No, of course not, why should you be sorry? You're the new Peter Appleton. You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. Very noble. That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets. Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden. Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's. Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President. But it'll always be someone. Count on it. Exactly. However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you. The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong. Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball? That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great. But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen. Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um... They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all. You can't testify. You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk. I know. A Purple Heart. Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix. They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know. Kid, that cuts no ice with them. You should watch what you say. So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization. Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is. "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters. Now, did you go to any meetings? Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did. Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?Delly, shhhhhh... Delly. I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father. And I'm not... I'm not Luke. Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now. Guess I must've learned. Thanks. That's... pretty frightening. How do you tell those two apart, anyway? Nope. Just filling in the blanks. No kidding. ... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on. Huh. That was nice of me. My what? They're not bad. Oh. I don't smoke? Have you got a cigarette? A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely. Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around. It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly. Oh. What? Oh... Were we going to get married? Do you have the... What was that? We were in love... weren't we? No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along. I'm sorry. You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that? What did... what did I want to be? Have you always wanted to be a lawyer? Whoa. So, you're really gonna be a lawyer? It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it. How'd they get it inside? Why me? City hall? Well... where can we go? Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome. I did? Huh! I do? Me too. What. I've seen you before. Your picture... Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt... A super market. Huh. That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...? Well, he loves the place. It's his home. We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work. Thanks. Good to meet you. Again. You're not going anywhere, Harry. A few. I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds. Did I what? I'm here. I know, I know... keep still. Jesus... Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start. ... what? Dad, I... Yes. Why don't you two get out there and dance? And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those? Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up. Well... You bet. I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up. Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry. ... Ernie. But I... Yeah, I know, but poultry...? "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?" "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs." "February 10, 1942. Picture 'Ball of Fire.'" Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here. Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here? You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has. Oh. What... what time is it? Who... are they? Mother. She's beautiful. Didn't you have any help? Why? Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed? Ah. Can't wait. Nine and-a-half years... When did I leave? Ah. Luke. Luke. I like it. And... what's my name again? Excuse me... what's your, um, your name? Can we get him to the hospital? Aren't you coming? Oh, you mean the suit. Harry kept all my old clothes. Fits okay, but it's a little big. What's wrong? Evening, Doctor Lardner. What? No, I... I can play the piano? That was beautiful. When was that? Oh. Yeah... me too. Of course. Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat. So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name? Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me. Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?" Is there a young Tim?That's my r-r-rent. T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army. They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war. We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here? Cat. Found me. No. I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure. Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are? All that matters is what you g-g-gave us. And you can't take that away now. You're wrong, Peter Appleton. You do belong here. Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that? Oh... Oh. Oh. They will. They w-w-will. They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back. Thanks. Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you! I see you got the telegram. Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong. Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you. Okay. What's the second thing? Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this. Damn... Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers... I wish you were coming with me. Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact. You'll stand by me? What about you, Delly? Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?" The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them. Thanks, I like it. I think. Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke. I know who I am now, and you don't. And... I don't like me very much. This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he? Yeah? I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me. Hi. That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member. I'm not refuting anything. No, sir. Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for? Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom... Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her. Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there. Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things? Yes it does. Yes... yes, I do. Mr. Clyde, I remember everything. Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory? Yes. Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there. Yes, sir. Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all. Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him. Sir, that is true. Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it. I... I need a drink of water. I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail. I'm a little hesitant to say. Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time. A statement? I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman. Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California. I do. I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out. I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago. The Bijou? I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it. "It's a Wonderful Life?" "It's a Wonderful Life." Well, this place sorta reminds me of something. No. But... Yes. 'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer. I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself. Nope. Can't. We're through. Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist. Sandra Sinclair. This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike. You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer? Too bad. He says I'm a communist. Zackly. You tight with J. Edgar Hoover? Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something. Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave. We live in a theater? Wish I could say the same thing. She's very pretty. Call me... Ishmael? I... no, I... I just can't... It's possible. I just don't remember. Thanks. I guess I did. I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it. No, sir. Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life? Oh god, oh, god, no, I... Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college... Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them. Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that. What do you mean? Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore. Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail. Not any more. Luke didn't smoke. No thanks. I'm not sorry for what I said. It's wrong, Leo. That's not the country Luke fought for. So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one. And I won't be a communist anymore. Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them. Yes. Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair! So, it is a blacklist. "Ashes To Ashes?" Yeah, well, that's enough. Why not? At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career! Exactly. I was decorated. Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes! What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one? I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist! Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway. No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying! Who the hell is this "they?" I... I don't believe this. I thought you... My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton. I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident. It's about me. Tim, I have to tell you something. The customers? I don't know... Please, sit. Sure. Come on in. I was just packing. Will you help me, Sandy? They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help. Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching. I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in? What exactly did you hear? You bet, honey. Thank you, Mr. Lawson. Yes. Very. The war... They all know you? I suppose. Thanks. Ancestors? No. Absolutely not. No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner. My girlfriend. If she still is... I already have.All right. All right. We'll see. Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way. Sir, are you a communist? Would that be Miss Sinclair? Who? Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are. Said as much myself, Doc. Can't place him, though. To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker. Well, morning's half-over. I'm off. Got any money? You hungry, son? Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max. Okinawa, I believe. Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy. 'Course they all know me. And I know all them. Town's got my name, don't it? You look familiar, fella. What's your name? Actually, my grandpap. But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it? Here.Huh? Oh, sure. Just pull the door shut when you leave. Huh? Thirty a month. Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency. He lose his job or somethin'? You think he's drunk somewhere? Hey, it's the best way to tell. Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
