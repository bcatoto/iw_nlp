You've got a lot of fucking gall. Thirty nine. Scratch the two, write in a four. I have a small window of time. Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting? Any thoughts on casting yet? Hey, listen, I love her. She's Sophia's best friend. I never said any of this, alright. I'll deny it on the stand... You guys are gonna have kids. That is so great. Maybe that's what this is all about. Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore. You know adults don't do this for a living. You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough. Sophia knew that intuitively. Look at Clair. Clair's a mess. Make sure she gets the epidural. Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be. "Life is but a walking shadow. A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film? Mac's a pretty great director, Joe. He's a woman's director. And nothing's happening. Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed. He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place. And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script. She can barely get the lines out. There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take. I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe. Something's gone. You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you. It's gone. I think she's scared. And that's death. I don't know what's going on. I don't care to guess. Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all. She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue. The movie. Poor Mac. It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you. The camera loves her. A great actress. Absolutely. And she's got great tits. And you've only just met. She's got great tits. It's going. It's going. Why last? What's that? I'm not that good. Absolutely not. Absolutely.We've heard lots about you. Oh. You're them. And you know our friends, how? Let me. I'm Jeffrey.They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns! Hm. Do you like fucking out of doors? Just every once in a blue moon, you know. Damn near. And a damn near perfect drug. I call that a perfect day. Let me heal you, baby. Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you. Do you want me to save you? Do you want me to save you? You're crazy baby. I love you. Forget it, Judy. Well it's fucking time. Time. Hey! Time. Judy! Time you guys. Hey!! Cal, my wife Judy. You have to sign your taxes anyway. Probably not. Anytime, sport. Give him a minute, Clair. He's okay, Clair. You wanna give him a little room? I don't think so. Hey! Would you? Ryan's novel? What was it? What the fuck was it? I'm ready. Beats a lawsuit. Just do what I say, alright? Before I forget. Put it on the bookshelf. Did he promise? Did you tell Joe to behave? That was the plan. And you're thrilled to have them. Did you invite them? There's still time to undo this. They're paying him scale. Not millions. Whatever you say. Listen, I love you. I worry because you don't. It's my job. I'm feeling guilty. I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground. You only made half your quote this year. What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city. The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning. The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat. I suppose. Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest. Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England. No small doing. We closed.Five years ago, I was at the party, remember? Scratch the two, write in a four. Leo. Leo's twenty-eight, Cal. October-ish. Leo? It was out to Jude Law. Jude passed. Leo? What? I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films. But those were all such great directors. Who, Sally? Oh, she's really enjoying it. I think. Is Mac okay? No, what? With great tits. I'm going to ask her if I can touch them. Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits. i can't wait to work with her. Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... The wisdom. She's an old soul. She knew that Shostakovich thing. Did you notice? She's a constant surprise. Isn't Skye amazing? And how's the diva doing? Can we... one at a time? Hold it down, and one at a time. You're last, Cal. The neighbors from hell. The kind that lay in wait. I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I? Wouldn't I? It has your ring. Had a little help? Jack. Did you compose that yourself? Leave us alone right now. Fuck you. Stupid tart. But she's alright. And? The suspense is killing me. What is it? So? Escape hatch. And Dad was having a go about the garden. Something was misplanted... You really need to be fucked. I should have damn well bought it. Well, we can't afford it. The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing. Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting? Four million. Shit, I forgot to call her back. She's off on a trip somewhere. Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold. When does he graduate high school? Ow! Gina, you obviously need to get fucked. I'm not so sure. Look again in three months. Please? Can I open it? That for us? Anymore. Fuck you. Will you make love with me? Oh, Sally Mae... I know. It's for the baby's crib. I know. Happy anniversary. That's under lock and key. Life gets messy. Ugly messy. But I don't understand you. And I don't think I ever understood Lucy. I don't understand throwing it away. How do you throw all that away? Any of it. I want it all. You guys want guarantees? I want the possibilities. And all kinds of crap comes with that. A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff. All the good shit. All the surprises. It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it. We'd have had amazing children, you and me. We'd have had a ride. You'd have surprised yourself. I'll never love anybody else, you know. Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it? No. I don't want to go tonight. I can't got tonight. I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight. Alright, good. Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now? I have no idea who you are. I'll never forgive you. I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I? I wasn't part of that decision. Did I occur to you at all? It's a fucking farce. It's a fucking farce. How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing. Do you have any idea what you've done to us? You're not ready. What?! You aborted our child?! You changed your mind. Don't do this! Don't do this. Don't push me away. This is insanity. Sally... Sally, for Christ's sake. Your director and your co-star of your current movie. Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally. Okay. If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore. And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in. That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally. Well there you go. I let you off the hook. You're one goddamn lucky actress. Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it. And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently. Hello? Last birthday was? Who the fuck do you think you are? The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life. Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally. It's a novel. Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy. That is not true. Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit. And second... Just stop right there, Sally. We've been through this. DO I want anyone else? No. Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life? I'm trying. That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love. It's whether we can live together... like this! All the time. Love? Otis! Sally, so I took a few pills. I went out dancing. I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you. I haven't lied to you. I told you about the people I've slept with. I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me. Sally, we're back, I love you. Trust that. Please let's not do this. Rave parties?! That's so typical - you would think it was called rage. Perfect! Jesus, Sally. You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier. Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate. This is a nightmare. We should have kept him upstairs. Otis!!!! Or shitty!! Otis!! Sally, calm down. We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical. He'll find his way back. Well he can't have gone far. Listen to yourself... Don't worry, it's alright. We'll find him. What's wrong with you? Oh for fuck's sake. Nobody uses that gate. I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays. No driving. That's the rule. I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time. Dolphins. Great. Whatever! You know how he gets. Well, he went absolutely bonkers. Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal. And that, my dear friends, is the day... I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake. Truce. Okay, knock it off. It's an unfair advantage. Panes is not on your team anymore. Two minutes. It's taken care of. Okay. Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum. Who'd like to go and find Otis? Otis! No barking! You can never be too early or too thin. I'll say as little as possible. I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna. I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really. Skye! I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually. You read the book again? Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again. If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park. Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right. It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. You want me to uninvite her? She goes on location tomorrow. Sally, I'm sorry. Look, I can't keep her on hold. Okay. I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you. It was the only chance I had to meet her. What? Don't get it. For good. We're great. No. I missed that. You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you? Not. Kiss the back of my knees. What did you get me? Accept a compliment. I love you. Most beautiful woman in the world. Happy anniversary. Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan? Sure. Come on, Panes... Has she called? Panes! How are you? It's Jerry's worst idea. He's the best dog in the world. They're both coming tonight. Not my idea. Mmm hmmm. Ah. And I you. Do I put you off? Joking. Not long. Don't I find what? Yes I did. No. Yes. It's a novel. Yes, she is. The novel. No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead. Oh. Well. Good. I love gifts. What did you guys get us? Thanks, I'll take that. Champagne? Oh don't. Everyone says that. Oh. You're serious. I meant Sally. God, I really need to jump about a bit. How's your film going? Thanks, Mac. And thanks for being so supportive about all this. I really love you, you know. Not particularly. Weird, isn't it? God I'm rally up. Do you feel anything yet, Mac? What? Oh yeah, the camera man? They gave me a list. Ah there's our snookums now. It was a mistake. This isn't a plot to do in Otis. Stop being such a bitch, Sal. Yeah, it was. For a writer nothing's sacred. No, nothing at all. Sorry? I like you. Come here. You must have been a baby. How long have you been married? And he doesn't smoke? A lot of cakes. That's a lot of those. I'm sorry. I think he's really angry with me too. Lemon it is. Lemon or raspberry? You're never too old for a lolly. I'm having one. Here, drink this. Drink lots of water. Hold on to this. Take deep breaths. Nice and slow. Would you like a lolly? Oh? It's easy. You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl. Let's go for a walk. Are you okay? Sally!!!! I need to leave you now. We're way past inappropriate. Scout's honor. Easy tiger. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm a total fucking maniac. Delete all that, okay? I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife. Oh shit. I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis. Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon. We hear dogs barking at night, too. And it's not Otis. Oh shit. I'm sorry. And your phone calls are nasty and abusive. And I've come this close to suing you for harassment. And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you. And you know, he really does not. Elitism? What? Very well put. Hm. No you're not. Oh. Uh-huh. Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux. I see you've moved up from the soft stuff. In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me. So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic. And it keeps changing. You're an interior decorator, right? Right away. Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan? No, he's absolutely right. You're absolutely right, Ryan. Dog talk must be banned. Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us. Can I get you a drink? This is an amazing present. What a sweetheart you are. I'm so happy you like it. I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends. How do you do, Skye?I'll be fine. Really babe. Give me a minute. What what's about? I don't know how to make her funny. Or I won't. I can't help her. I'm out of my depth. You don't have any clothes on. Not this time. I'm in mourning. It's an object lesson in grace. Wow! Look who's here before me! My leading man is on time for once. She already has. So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what? I'm fine, babe. I'm gonna take a little walk. I need a minute. Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close. Yeah, thanks pal. Hey. Thanks, buddy. I'm fine, babe. Man, I must really be stoned. Thanks, buddy. Are you always this much fun? It was fifteen seconds. Go. No. No. Let me tell you something. Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood. The sleep depravation alone. I meant Sally. Well, you know...good days, bad days. Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy. Anything I can do. Kind of. Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends. And great DP's I could give them a call for you. And you got Skye Davidson. Pretty big leagues for a first timer. Do you even like movies? You got your DP? You lose this? How's he doing? Jesus Christ. No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Time! What? Clair is a hovering mother.I'll do it. Coffee? What's a sign for that? She'll never call again. She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally? Oh, you know, I am. Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two? No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are. How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich? Would you, like, marry him? Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich? Set to the poem of Yetveshenko! Otis you crazy dog! Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon? My people are very hungry. I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know. Andre Zhdanov? How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov? Otis!! Shostakovich identified with the Jew. He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism. Oh yes, indeed. That was my clue, you see. The Shostakovich. That was my clue. The charades. I was impressed. Do you need anything else? Is there space here? No, never. Not at all. Come on in. What did I do? From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle... I guess. You don't need to thank me. Yes, you're a monster. You're my best friend. So tell me, how's it going? Um. Happy for you. Well, something's wrong. Alright. Well, that's something new. Why not? That's it? Yes. Fine? How's the movie going? Your movie. You are making a movie, aren't you? No, really, five thousand with your discount. I'm worried about your Galiano. Why don't you go fuck yourself? What does that mean? I'd cut off her red wine if I were you. I'm Levi Panes. Will you excuse us, Skye? It's time for Sally's meds. "Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here." I didn't hear me say tonight. "We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes. I hate you being alone. Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks." I wasn't finished. No. No, not like the last time. She was the rest of my life. "How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart." It's not ruined, for fuck's sake. It's one of your parties. Oh, okay, forgive me. Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake. Like your business managers? You see, that's worse. She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours. It could be worse. You don't know she's a bitch. She's even better looking in the flesh. Oh great. Not enough. Suicidal. It's much less codependent. It's a machine gun. I thought I'd kill myself.Did you see permits? Did he have a license? To code? Was it a contractor? Did you know the contractor? So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence? How long have you worked for the Therrians? What? Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog! Excuse me? Why? God willing. You're not serious. Ready to go? I don't need a drug. Are you making an ass of yourself? They're nothing like us. I'm not going to leave you alone. Yes. You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain? She didn't pull that out of thin air. It causes brain damage. You'd better drink a lot of water. Well, yes, actually. I'm sure you understand. Absolutely. You always wonder where your books end up. Why don't we use it? I didn't know you had this. Rose. Well today it was Otis. And you should keep him away from our yard. Because Sheila will defend herself. It's just very distracting when you're trying to work. At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes. I have it on tape. Yes.
