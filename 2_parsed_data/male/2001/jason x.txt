Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on. Alright, asshole. Oh, come on! Asshole that does not count as a kill. Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life. Pause play. Speaking of which, duck! You got lucky. Watch it punk, I'm armed.Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine. Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar. The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it reaches the core, we're done. Minimal. What? If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her. We don't have a choice! When the left hull goes, so will the right. THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship. Rizzo pull the fucking lever! What are you doing?!! Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize! Could you show a little compassion?! Goodbye old friend. We're not leaving Crutch! What do you mean, not enough time? Duck fuckers? Sergeant! Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room. Rizzo did. Explosive. We're blowing the walkway. Sergeant? We thought you were... Where the hell were you?!! Where have you been?!! Thorgan, pull us in. Kkinsa! Open the doors! Uh-oh. Thorgan, suit up. Let's move out! Two more charges to go. What are you doing back?!! Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on! Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there. I'll need system four converters. What are you gonna do, tell me? Rizzo! Can you hear me?! Shit! Everyone okay? Better let me. Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage. And you said high school was boring. Creepy. Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there. Suit up. And now we're all out of it. Hurry! I don't know! I'd say we have about ten minutes tops. Where is...? Thorgan? You coming?! Bring 'em all. Let's move! We could convert fission transistors. Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!Get out of here! Can't shut em' down from here. Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself? Bomb? Yeah, yeah. Well, what have you got to say for yourself? Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die! What? wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo! You just keep an eye out. Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs. You got that right. Not a chance. Yllo, what's your head count? Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time. My job. Jesus what the hell is that? Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two - I still think we should send for a team of real scientists. Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it. How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect? What if they're carrying? Did you even check? You're a teacher. My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . . Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here. We need weapons. Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down. I need to know what you know about this guy. I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us. Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on! Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead. I'm with you kid. Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!! Kicker, anything? Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do! You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!! Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt. Jesus, God! I'm pulling, damnit! Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down. Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo. Give me a break! What happened? Where is everybody? What happened?I don't have all day, kid. Okay, enough of this shit. Yes it does. He's not part of the program. That sucks. Why won't he go down? You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head. That's nine to four, geek-boy. Punk?Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing? Negative. Fuckin A... Roger that. Time to kick some ass! Oh man, what the hell happened? Leave him behind! Defense droids. I'm on it. Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door. Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out. Yo, Teach, what the fuck?See you then . . . doctor. If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here? Alright, I'm . . . No way . . . is this a joke? Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . . You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good. Delongpre! Out of time! Done? We made it? I don't know. Nothing. His mother? Can we blow it with just two? We can't lead him into the other hull! What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship? What's that? No. If the ship goes, so does Jaso. It's locked! Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out. We don't have time to argue! Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks. Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting! He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here. Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?! Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it. Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live. He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it. No, you're dead! You're all dead! Where is he? I get it. Old woman? Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you? I'm stuck! Delongpre, you don't even know me. I think so, why? I think I had some when I was eight. No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing! Okay, good tip. Eat me. His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work. Oh sure, all the time. Wait around on your asses all day. I'll need a distraction. You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it. Not so bad. I couldn't save them. They were all wrong. They couldn't control him. Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going. I thought you meant... So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up. What's this? Hey!! Hey. It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II? What if you miss? 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?! I guessed. Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die. Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work. Don't just stand there! Shoot him! Guys!!! The shuttle? Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. Last chance. Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something? I hope so. We have to get off this ship. Sergeant, we could use a big bomb. Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways? Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge? Boeman don't. You know I'm right. I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves. You killed him? Are there any other shuttles? I'm surrounded by idiots. Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie... Barbie from hell... Robot huh? I gotta go back. Damn! Close the door! I'll be right back. Then open the doors! Keep trying! I just know. Ssh. He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship. Three...two...one... How do you open the damn door? Guys, please come with me! That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee! More soldiers? What good will that do? You wanna die? Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all! Get him out of there! I didn't say he was alive. Jason! Can't you see? He did this. Are you finished? Jason? He's on this ship?! But...I...400 years? JASON?! WHERE IS HE?! 30? How long was I out? Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible. How did I get here, how did you bring me back? Where..? Who . . .? I'm alive. You brought me back. Guys, he's right behind us! Can we get through these? Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me. Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing. So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces? What have I done?! Idiots. Old Earth? Hockey player? He's not a ...This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program? Goodbye, my love. Done! As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance. Kay-Em! I'm coming, I'm coming. Hey! I'm not ready. They're back here. We're not supposed to do that. The hull's imploding! I think I broke my arm. Where'd you get the gun? You see that? Nice touch. Cool. He's trying to ask you out on a date. Oh, shit. He's going to see us. Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you? Just come on, I've got an idea. Kaboom. I'm on my way. I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing? Go-go-go-go-go!!!! Yuck. She's obviously dealt with this guy before. You're leaving me here alone? Would you? You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you? Hurry! She's lost it! You think it killed . . . Yeah, I guess not. I'm gonna spew. This is what it means right here. I missed you too. Kay-em you okay? Kay-Em we made it! You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you. Kay-Em, you okay? Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass. Good point. Sorry, sorry. Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming. Almost done. Come here, might as well fix that arm. Am I in there? Oh shit! There he is! The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back. Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden. It's okay. Sure but what good will that do? Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there. Yes! Exactly. What have you done? He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead! The hockey player? He a friend of yours?Sergeant! But I didn't see... Ok Sarge, what's your status? Yeah yeah. Got it. Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though. At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski? JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later. ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends. Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa. Wait a minute...I need... Fine, just stay out of my way. Hit it. What the hell are you doing? That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with. I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean? I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back. Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her. Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head! I am an expert! Get them in the lab! They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the shuttle. Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre? We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey. Shut up! She just wants this thing dead! God damnit! Will you stop doing that?! I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women. More time...shit, she's had 400 years... Well? She broke my fucking nose! I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do. It's time. We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report. Thank you. We've got a situation here! Just do as you're told! Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab. Just get us to the ship! Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found. Adrienne! Stoney! I'm missing two! Crutch? Jesus! Can't you knock? Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf. Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous! Jesus! Later. No! He's coming with us! Kicker! This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way. Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century! We're missing two of the kids! I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours? Hypothetically, how much are we talking? Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at. I'm sending you the files. We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found. It's okay, he just wanted his machete. You're crazy! 4You're not going anywhere. Scientists. Very intellegent men. They can deal with this sort of thing. Are we locked down? You're not going anywhere. That's ridiculous. You're overreacting. Azrael can you repeat that? Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive. Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking. He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity. That's right, now if you could... We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions. Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions... We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years. Nanotechnology. Obviously so.
