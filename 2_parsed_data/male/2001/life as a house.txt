With Dale. Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through! And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best! And he said he loved me! Dad's disappeared! I'm not cheating! I'm not looking! Marco! When does George get to come see his house? I checked everywhere. He's not there. He's not there. That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up. Huh, Mom? And video games after! Did you know him before you knew Dad? Sam! We can work. I wanna be with you today. Are you going to see Sam again? I love red! That's my favorite color! What color? Who are you? I don't think Dad wants you home. I would have anyway. Mom said I should.Months. After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit? Well, if it is, we have a problem. Mr. Stevens. One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height. He's filed to have construction stopped immediately. I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass? I hate to ask about a window. Allowed outside the enclosed area. An exhaust system or a window is code. Oh, yes. Bob Larson. Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen? Mr. Stevens?Well, it's the least I can do. Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work. I could maybe ask them if you could choose one. But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. They're a part of this firm. They inspire me. I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed. It amazes me. I would miss that too much. Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay. What can I do for you, George? Well, I feel better about this now. I didn't know there would be a quiz, George. Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor. What are you talking about? You love your job. Listen...maybe I can get you a year. Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there. Forty. Oh. That's too long. Maybe that's too long. Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects. It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do. All of us are typing and clicking, George. Whether we want to, or not. This isn't me. We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer. But you won't change. Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry? Peter Webber! Right. Quite the spotlight on that guy. Right...she married...what was he? How's your wife? how much weight have you lost? What are you on?I know what the deal is. Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid. Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer. It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends. All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude. My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod. Income village is the place to hook up with hump. The whole summer, man. Party in Tahoe.What did you think it would be? Let's shut up and not kill her. Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that? I've taken a lot of morphine. Oral morphine...for my back. Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing? You have to ask like that? You're a good girl. I mean drugs. I thought you said he was? Can you keep Sam straight? I had them in my pocket. My keys. What's today? Don't you have school? I'm living here while I build another house. Alyssa. Why? Are you his friend? He must. I'll survive. That would take weeks. To the patio and one north-facing window... And six inches to the height. I have the permit. It's thirty feet. If that's what it takes. I flushed it down the toilet. A sink? And if I enclosed it? A violation? I've been dreading you. Yes, it is. Thank you. I built my first model here when I was twenty. There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. Twenty years of my life. I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? Only the ones that really mean something to me. I've got one favor to ask. Good. I was hoping for that. For everything. It may sound that way, but I react out of fear. My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like. You haven't been listening, have you? From the day I started...to today. Can't stand it. I hate this job. I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead. We were probably in school together. You went to Berkley? How old are you? Maybe...? I've been here twenty years. I'm not. Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models. I did tell you, didn't I? That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today? He buys and sells the world. When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry. Now she's just hostile. Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry. Pardon me? I'm good, thanks. Hello? I forgot where I put my keys. My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what. You were the only neighbor I could tolerate. The plumber's due out on Friday. There are no windows facing my...exposure. He escaped. He's going back in. I don't wanna go, Sam. I never tried to get you to like me. I tried to get you to love me. I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it. We're all dying from the start. I just got picked for Advanced Placement. Yes. I wanted you here so we could have a few months together. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Something bad to force something good. The kind where there isn't really an answer. I wanted you here so we could have a few months together. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Something bad to force something good. The kind where there isn't really an answer. Are you taking them still? She seemed upset. You look better than ever. Absolutely. Have him put it on a separate line. At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses. After everything. I loved him too much. Everything would have been better if you had. You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother. I remember reading about her in the paper. They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that. I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him. To hide a black eye. I was just thinking about my mom. She wouldn't leave him. I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. I mean it was dark outside and in. But we never talked about it. I'm proud of you, Sam. If I asked you to stop, would you? What would you be doing now? I gave up on you. I wish you had told me then. I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you. So, I didn't. He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that. When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment. But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting. I know parts of who you are. That's not true. What are you now? What would you like to be? I know the feeling. I know. Why? Hi, Alyssa. Try it. It feels good. Do whatever you want with it. I don't care. All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together. Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are. This is the end of it, Sam. I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you. You know that great thing, though? Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is. Or it can just blow you away. Make you something different in an instant. It happened to me. I won't ever hit you. I don't want you smaller. I want you to be happy. You're not. Not here with me. Not home with your mother. Not up in Tahoe. Not alone. Not anywhere. You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes. In your sleep. In your answer to everything. You're barely alive. The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never won the game. Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words... My dad used to play a game. I never really understood what it was until after he was gone. Sit down for a second. The gloves on the table are for you. I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit. I might have a solution. A friend of yours is here. Well, until you know, you can't go. When are you going to be back? Where are you going? Hey...hey! You'll have money when you work for it. I can promise you complete privacy. I don't beg. I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati. It'll be fine. I'd blame you. I want you here. You'll have money when you work. I don't know. Your brothers are right. It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around. It bugs me. I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out. No you don't. Get the inkling, Sam. I'm getting tired of your attitude. Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing? I warned you yesterday. Goodnight. I almost saw Catalina. You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father. Think of it as a family tradition. You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam. I won't ever hit you. This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it. So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck. Now. Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too. And there's no make-up at my house. No glue sniffing. Huffing. No pills, no grass. You don't have a choice. You have everything? I'll get your bag. You'll know me by the time we're through. Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me? Because I live there. I'll be around to check up on you. Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime. Isn't that weird? I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years. Six years. I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me. A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to. I haven't been touched in years. I can die trying. Stage four pancreatic cancer. They haven't even pretended to offer treatment. You tell me, when would you start eating red meat? You know what mortise and tenon is? I'd build a house. Good for you. I don't let him. He just loves to. I want you to find someone for me. I need you to do me a favor. I haven't forced him to work. I only wet him down once. Why would he leave? Check the permits. It was built as a guesthouse. It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated. Ah! Oh.... Thanks for telling me. It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title. Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty. I aimed high. She's a little sad, is all. She needs to be alone, I think. Oh. Sorry. Three. Not a perfect day. I'm an idiot to have you up there. It's not my back that's killing me. So could I. What? What did he say? Left you? No. Mostly me. I didn't think you'd come today. You need to know what? Do I still love you? Let's not do this, okay? You bit my finger. I can't pick you up. I'll say a lot of things I've never said before. It's habit. That was the truth. What did I say? Going on? I can hire workers to help me. I'd rather you not be here. How much time do they get to spend with their dad? It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore. I'd hate to have them bored. Maybe you shouldn't come everyday. Oh, I'm worse. Much, much worse. Watch out for the smile, boys. Tell him how you made me fall in love with you. It's been a while. I think so. You're a good mother. I'll find something that won't kill them. You brought your kids? He won't use my shower. I don't get it. No, I'm...thanks. I took something. My stupid back. With your hands or your tongue? Hindsight. It's like foresight without a future. Go in there and lick his attitude. Oh...with his ear infection! Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though? Finished or unfinished? It's not breakfast yet. What is it? You head was pressed against my chest. I could feel your heart racing. And I remember I kissed your hair. The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves. It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was. Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good. It's been a long time. I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has. That I'm happy today. I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza? Which? But you hated four out of the five you did. What? We're fine. Turkey sandwiches. He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe. If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring. He can hate me. You can hate me. He can try to kill me while I sleep. You can call the police. You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me. He's my son. He's sixteen. That's it. Let's go. He's not spending the summer in Tahoe. Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me? I can't leave the house? I don't have a phone. Hey, hey! I want him with me. At least we'll have a house to show for it. Sounding? I need help. He's cheap labor. The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a toilet. We'll survive. Not for the weekend. For the summer. I'll be by Saturday to pick him up. When's school over? The garage. I love those doors. Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy. There's nothing anymore to stop me. I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house. I was parked in day parking. I need to talk to you. I wasn't thinking. Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think. Kurt's been feeding him. Four days. I left to think. A blueprint spool. I didn't think you'd know I went missing. I'm not talking just physically. Even your anger is perfect. You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life. Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up. You're loud today. Why does he have a lock on his door? He doesn't answer. Where is he? You let him pierce his nose? You should lock your doors.I could use the money. He already knows everything about what he can't do. You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want. She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen. I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing. She like figures things out on her own and then that's it. Don't even...I'm there. You got the money? Nothing. It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes. Been thinking?Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches. He builds models for architects. His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen. George just never really...aimed that high. Even with not hitting a rabbit. I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun. It was always like you were frightened. Quiet and boring. We've known each other since grade school. You've been good this week. And of course the Beck's, with the... From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today. Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn. The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure. Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day? God, you look like crap, George. It's my day off. I thought I'd help with the plumbing. I'm surprised he hasn't left. Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house. I know there's an explanation. At least your father tried, George. Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot. I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you... Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it! I can't afford dirt in this town. I live in Riverside, Goddammitt And you get to piss in the ocean. Left you this place. We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know. I liked your dad more than I liked you. Then you tell me, what just happened? What the fuck? What are you talking about? He said he heard hammering.That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me. I'll be in the bedroom. Where are the kids? Please don't leave me. I never asked for more. You live a fabulous life, Robin. I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me. That sounds pathetic, doesn't it? I was talking about our marriage. So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it? You can't go with me because of Sam? You can't go because of Sam? Good. That was the plan. We couldn't stand him and George needed help. What? Lois will stay with them. Or we can pawn them off on your parents. Sooner than the Fall. Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative? We should take a vacation. I'd be you. If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry. Should I? Is Lois still here? I'm starved. His father is a man. I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle. You don't look like you. Do it now! Take it off. Are you wearing eye shadow? Okay. No. I've missed you guys. You got a dog? Hey.We did a lot of the wiring too. He was there and then he wasn't! What are you doing? I don't even care if he ever comes back. Because Dad left? It's okay. I just wanted to know where Mom was? How many bedrooms will your house have? I guess I could teach you some things. Do you know anything about building a house? Why? It's not ours. It's George's. Hey. Dad's home, already? Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy! Yes, it is. Someone stop her! Can we really help build a house? All day again? Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early? Dad said it first. Queer. Why?Red. Do you guys feel like painting? He hasn't called? So put your plans of my room in the trash. Oh. What's that for? Floating to Catalina. I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. You'd hate him for the trick. You hate your father. Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours. On the handlebars or your shoulders? Okay. I guess. What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality. I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you. It would help me if I could kiss you. You're off, you know? You're way, way off. You're driving me crazy! Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire? I'm not gay. What are you talking about? It's freakish. I don't get it. I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look. What's the point of this? Hand me a towel. Hand me a towel. I don't even...what do you mean? I don't even know what that means. Why are you so stupid? I don't want you to! Hand me a towel. I'm getting out. I'm sorry. I'm just here to shower. He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it. Really? Not really. No. Kinda. He got busted? I can use your mom's. No thanks. Why? Really? Yeah. No. That's okay. I might not stay, anyway. I can't even take a shower here. He's a freak. He jumped into the ocean. I don't know. I don't know. I'm supposed to be in Tahoe. They're trying to make me spend the summer here. I'm leaving in the morning. Hey. I'm hungry! Where's my dinner? Who ate my dinner? Huh? Who's in trouble now? Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa. Is Alyssa here? We're getting out of the ground today. Thank you. Thanks, I'd like that. Thank you. Thanks for the shower. Not a shower. I'm sorry. Uh huh. Oh...okay. Oh...do you know when she'll be home? Is Alyssa home? You don't know what the deal is. There is no fucking deal. I never said anything. I haven't done anything. I'll ask. I don't know. Here. Well, congratulations! You fucking pulled it off! This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here? Trying to get me to like you. You lied to me! And you told Mom today? I still don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. What kind of problem? I still don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. What kind of problem? No, but I count them. In a sock isn't new, you know? I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what? Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain. And you're going through them quick. What's wrong with your back? I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left. Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside? That's so weird... After everything he did to you and your mom? Do you ever wish you had done it? I would have killed him. Why wouldn't she leave? Sun glasses? Are you talking? Don't be. And hide whatever that new drug is you have. I like it. I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying. Getting high, I guess. I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up. I'm telling you now. He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today. He's got nothing to do with me. What do you know about me? See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am. Nothing. What I'm not. How do you become something you're not? I like how it feels not to feel. I took some of your Vicodin. Hi, Mom. We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father. Don't. I don't want it. I'm not even listening. I'll have to pay him back. I was holding for someone. That wasn't even mine. Oh, so you're in the big shit now! Child abuse. People go to prison for what you just did to me. No. You can't make me do a thing. You're too fucking late. I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid. You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now! Did you got through my pants? Where is it? Oh, okay. I don't know. I don't know. I'm leaving. If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money. You can't promise me anything! You don't have anything to promise! You live in a garage! You don't have cable! You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer! You don't have a job! And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard. Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom? I'm not doing it! No one would blame me if I left! You're so predictable. I'm gonna take a walk. I need some money. You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out? Why? I hate turkey. No. Don't touch me! You can't touch me! What are you doing?! Probably in the bible. Are you totally insane?! I'll hate you forever. If you hit me, I'll call the police. Mom...please. I'm not going! Mom, tell him I'm not going. You already promised me! I'm not going! Who are you, anyway? I don't even know you. No I'm not! You live in Cory's parents' cabin? Why would you be there? To check up on me? It's just a joke. A stupid joke. I'm thinking it's too weird now. I wasn't sure. What's your deal with Alyssa? You got any weed? Does Alyssa know? No. The payoff. Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said. I'm sixteen years old. I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you? Who? Do you like red? Either do you. If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through? No. Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court. Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for. Maybe it's what I want. This is what he wants. Yeah. I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it. The door was open. Depends on what I'd give up on. There were no PG's. So I just gave them money to play games. I locked the door! Get out! I locked the door! Get out! What are you doing in my room?
