I am sorry. I don't even know what sorry means  anymore. I am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all  of us. Your's is a complicated, sad  world. And I never knew that. I was living  a life of simplicity, of purity,  when I was ripped out of my Eden and  immersed in this harshness. Some  would argue that the life I was living  was not a human life at all. And,  gentlemen, I don't have any clever  retort. I am not a philosopher. The  only thing I know is that I am sorry,  sorry for my expulsion from Eden,  sorry for my Lila rotting in her  jail cell, and sorry for Nathan...  rotting in his grave. I don't even know what sorry means  anymore. It's odd. When I was alive  I knew -- maybe it was all I knew --  but here sorry is meaningless. Love  is meaningless. Jealousy is  meaningless. Ambition is meaningless.  Everything that motivated my every  breath while I was alive is  meaningless now. I guess that's how I can be sure I'm  really dead. Jesus. Hey, no fair! Drop dead, Eric. Something terrible started to happen  to my body when I was twelve. My  mother said because of it I would  never be able to get a man, so I  should get used to the idea of  dedicating my life to the pursuit of  knowledge, or religion... or whatever. The doctor said... It's hormonal. Nature is a funny and  complex thing. It could get worse  with time. By the time I was twenty I looked  like an ape. I don't think there's anyone in the  world who doesn't know by now that I  was raised in the wilderness by an  ape. Well, to be fair, by a man who  thought himself an ape, but it amounts  to the same thing gentlemen, does it  not? My father escaped from a New Jersey  mental institution in 1963. He had been committed the previous  year after applying one too many  times at our local zoo for the job  of "apprentice ape." My father saw what the human race  had come to while he was... in  captivity. He felt something had to  be done to create a better world. He stole little me from my mother,  his ex-wife, and raised me, with  love and tenderness and respect, as  an ape like himself. Apes don't assassinate their  presidents, gentlemen. Until quite recently I believed myself  to be an ape, although I didn't know  specifically what type. Apes don't  think in terms of type. It might be argued, gentlemen, that  apes don't even know that they are  apes. In retrospect, however, I'd  say that I was a pygmy chimp. I have to say I always hated apes.  Of course I don't any longer. I don't  even know what hate means now. But  while alive, I hated apes. I blame  my parents. I mean, I don't blame  them. I don't know what blame is,  really, anymore, but I think they  influenced me in my ape-hating  tendencies. Monkeys! Look, mama, monkeys! I am not a human being! I am an  animal! Uh... We must never act like apes, son.  For you see, The ape is our closest  biological relative -- specifically  the pygmy chimp. A single chromosome separates us.  But you know what truly separates us  from the apes, what makes us better  than apes? No, papa. What? Culture. Civilization. Refinement.  If we do not have these as humans,  then we might as well be living in  pens and throwing our feces about,  masturbating in public... ...sniffing red swollen female rump... That's not real. Something about a mouse, right? Meditations on a Banana Slug was a  delightful read. As do I. They don't seem to be especially ego  driven, this is true. I have to say that I'm not there  yet. Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd  call it. I'm not there yet. I still  have many human characteristics. Yes. I suppose not. But still. One  would like to move along. To move  beyond. I love that you said that. It makes  me feel a bit lighter. I've been  rather heavy lately. Thinking about  my childhood. Realizing how much a  product I am of my upbringing. I've been seeing someone. A therapist. No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do  research. I'm a behaviorist. I work  with animals. Mice at the moment. Heavens no. My work now is... Right  now I'm teaching mice... well, table  manners, to be candid. Quite well, really. It's a lot of  work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly  positive. Right now I've gotten two  of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny  napkins of course. I hope you don't think me daft. It's  important work. It's part of a larger  sociological experiment. I'm federally  funded. It's my thesis that if table manners  can be taught to mice, they can be  taught to humans. The truth is most people don't have  table manners today. And when the  foundations of civilized society  crumble and disappear, civilized  society in its entirely follows  closely at its heels. Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all  sadly lacking from our daily  intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity,  meanness are the norm. Ergo if I can teach table manners to  mice, I can teach them to humans. If  I can teach table manners to humans,  I can save the world. I began going to a therapist when I  was in my thirties, because I felt  that I wasn't enjoying life the way  my friends were. After a time my childhood came up. Lord, we thank you for this bountiful  gift we are about to receive. Amen. That is the wrong fork, young man. I'll use the right one. I'm sorry. I  forgot. Too late. Go to your room. But... No "buts." Go to your room now. And think about what you've done. And do you think maybe this early  childhood indoctrination has something  to do with your interest in table  manners in the present. I don't think so. No. Why do you ask? You look wonderful. I'm on top of  the world tonight, Lila. Work is  going splendidly and my personal  life is ... My God! The fork! The fork! Tell her, Harold... It's just that... It's nothing. It's  just that the outside fork is the  salad fork. One goes from the outside  in as the dinner progresses. No biggie. I'm sorry that I became so upset. It's only that I really enjoy your  company and... Yes, and... Yes. Please don't talk with food in your  mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty  and it only mars your... I'm sorry.  I'm being critical. It's just that I have some  peculiarities, and... You do? I don't care. I don't care! Like what, for example? Lila moved in with me. Did I love  her? I thought so. But from my new  vantage point I realize that love is  nothing more than a messy  conglomeration of need, desperation,  fear of death, insecurity about penis  size, and the self-involved, ego  driven need to collect other people's  hearts. Not that I judge it. Listen, I don't want to be dead yet.  Is there any way to... No I suppose not. No biggie. Anyway, Lila moved in. We  had our problems, but we both wanted  love so badly, we turned a blind  eye. Actually, Mother and Father, you  look very, very old. You look  terrible. Son, your mother and I are doing a  production of The Gin Game at the  local community theater. We forgot  to take off our make-up. Lila's a nature writer, mother. Of course she does, mother. What are you doing in there? I'm sorry about my parents. I was simply attempting to keep the  evening light. You know that I feel  similarly to you about nature. Of course. I simply love the... naturalness of  it all. Why certainly! That's a great idea. Terrific. Can't wait! Shaving cream? Darling, did you bring the insect  repellent lotion? Oh, and the sun block? What SPF, sweetie? Perfectomundo! We are ready! Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to  have an insect repellent lotion that  also worked as a sun block? Think of  all the time one would save. I think I'll get Johannsen in  chemistry on that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit? Flares? We could call it "Quit Bugging Me,  Sunny." Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y. I love you so much. Then, gentlemen, one day I saw  something I hadn't seen since my  father died in a freak accident  involving a rotted log and four  thousand bees stinging his head... I  saw other human beings. They chattered  away at each other in what appeared  to be gibberish. Later I learned it  was English. Now I wonder if perhaps  my initial assessment hadn't been  correct. What? A deer? It might behoove us to turn back at  this point. If it's a person, why should we go  see it? It's not like it's nature or  anything. It's just a person. Sometimes people who live in the  woods don't want to be seen. They  live in the woods because they're  anti-social, Lila. We have to respect  that. This is the way to get ticks, Lila.  This is it. Bingo! Lyme Disease!  You've hit the nail on the head here. Oh for God's sa... I had never seen anything like it. It was an ape as I had never seen  before. Like me, yet different in  certain essential details. And all  at once I felt a heat pass through  me. My heart raced. Gentlemen, I  wanted to touch her, to caress her,  to be one with her. I had urges and  desires I could not explain. I felt  overwhelmed by the power this strange  creature had over me, and so I did  what any animal would do when it  comes across an animal of superior  strength... Oh my God! Is he dead? Please put  something on. You'll catch cold. It's cold. What do you suppose he is, a  survivalist? Feral? Don't touch him! He might be  diseased! He might... My God, rabies! I think we should go. Please. Before  he wakes up and, I don't know, eats  us, or whatever feral things do. Actually, I just had an amusing  thought. Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated? It's perfect! Forget mice! Actually forget guinea  pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also.  I'm on to stage five: The human  subject. Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa,  my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to  the top of the Behaviorist food chain.  He's going to make me famous. Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy  and naked alone in this tick infested  wilderness? Never to know the love  of a good woman, never to revel in  the pitter-patter of little feet,  never to read Moby Dick, or marvel  at a Monet, or just sit back after a  day of hard but rewarding work, smoke  a pipe, and wonder about the nature  of reality. Freedom's just another word for  nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote  Janet Jackson. Belonging to something, a person or  a society, is a basic human craving.  We are communal creatures. This poor  soul has no one, nothing... ...what is it that makes us human,  if not the knowledge that we are  indeed human? Think of this poor  soul's education as the greatest  gift we could bestow upon... Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw  him in the trunk. Good morning. Only three shocks. A chimp takes  fifteen. This is going to be tres  simple, no, Gabrielle? Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we? You decide. Today is your day. Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is  that okay? Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr.  Bronfman and this is my assistant  Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy  while you are here. How about some salad, son? Oh, Hi, Gabrielle. No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing  that. You're a terrific assistant. Well, I don't know. I'm actually on  my way to... No. Don't be silly. It's just... Not at all. Of course not. There there. Listen, you're the best assistant  I've ever had... Gabrielle. What are you doing in there? Hello? Oh, hi... Gabrielle! Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right. Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work! Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh.  Exactly. Excuse me one second, would you,  Gabrielle? Look, Lila, when I'm on a work... Your entire body? You have to shave? Like an ape? Don't quibble. You know what I mean. Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted! I have to think! I have to think! I don't get it. I don't get it. I  don't get it. How could I find myself  in this mess? This is a mess. This  is not a situation I understand.  This is a mess. How do I extricate  myself from this mess? Is my  girlfriend a man? I don't understand.  This is not part of any plan. She  deceived me. She has hair. But am I being fair? So what if she  has hair? Who am I to judge? I have  hair. But I'm supposed to have hair. I am  a man. Men are supposed to have hair. But poor Lila. Think of what she's  had to go through. The courage she's  had to have in the face of this  abomination of nature. I should love  her all the more. I should love every  hair on her body. I mean, she doesn't  mind that I have a mortifyingly  small... Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled  you. I came to think. God, Did I hang up on you? No. I just got distracted. I'm so  sorry. Oui. Now you've got me talking French. I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh? Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him.  The lights and all. When you were a little French girl? That would be good. Maybe we should just sit for a while.  It's very peaceful. Yes. Happy happy. I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all. I shouldn't say this, but you're  pretty, Gabrielle. It's  unprofessional, I know. Really? No. Not at all. You're a  very pretty girl. You should know  that. You should be confident. It's true. I wouldn't lie. So soft. So smooth. I'm sorry. It's just... Was that okay? I mean, was I able  to... satisfy you? Really? Wow! That's that's terrific  to hear from someone so... feminine,  so female. I'm glad you're female. Do you think our boy witnessed the  primal scene? Nothing, my darling. All is right  with the world. I saw it, gentlemen. I saw the whole  sweaty, passionate, ugly, beautiful  act, and to use the vernacular, I  wanted me some of that. And I think I understood from that  moment, that in order to get some, I  would have to do what they said. In  order to experience this primal,  basic, animal thing, I would first  have to become a civilized, prissy,  uptight human. I would have to become  Nathan. Excellent, Puff. Now, the lady you're  with excuses herself to go powder  her nose. Perfect. Perfect, Puff! Shit. Hi, honey. Good. Making progress. Everything's fine, honey. We don't  need to talk. Besides I have to work  late. Okay, we'll have dinner tonight. Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven.  Bye. What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed  to do? You don't abandon somebody because  they have a physical problem. Funny. I still feel guilt. Even dead.  One would've hoped... But alas. You  know, I really did love Lila. But  with her... problem... and then when  Gabrielle revealed her feelings. And  Gabrielle was so... conventionally  female. And she had an accent. I was  lost from that moment on. But  Gabrielle was right. I couldn't admit  it to myself, this shallowness of  character, let alone to Lila. Of course not. No. I'm just preoccupied. Yeah. It's nice. It's really good. Shh. It's okay. It's okay, Lila. You're what I want.  You know that. You're exactly what I  want. Sure. Of course. That's great. That's great. It's a great color for  you. So anyway, that's the nightmare I've  been having lately. Do you suppose it has anything to do  with Lila's unusually hairy body? No, why? Well, it seems that since Lila  broached the subject of children,  you've been on edge and I know you  have an issue with the, uh, body  hair. Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to  think about. That's very good. That's  what you get the big bucks, right?  Ha ha. I just think it might be important  to explore your feelings for Lila. I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful  person. And... she loves me! That's  no small potatoes. I mean she really  loves me. She's sacrificed so much  to be in this relationship with me.  And she's a good person. A truly  good person. How rare is that in  this world, eh? And how could I stop  loving somebody because of a little  physical imperfection, if it can  even be called that. I mean, God  knows I'm not perfect! What about my  eyesight? It's lousy, that's what!  Lila's not going to leave me because  of my eyesight. What about my penis? And how do you feel about Gabrielle? Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen. Bravo, Puff! Bravo! Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey? Gabby, what is it? Fine. Very well. My little French. What is it? Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort  things out. I love you so much, Gabrielle. But I don't know how to leave Lila. Now there's a butt, Nathan. ...the back door of a movie theater.  Yes, indeed. Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink. Thanks. Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied? My assistant quit today. Okay? He  was highly valuable to the project. I guess. Have you? Really? How come? Such as what womanly things? I let her sell her soul. I stood by  as she did it. It's inexcusable. At the time though I thought it might  help. When she came to work with Nathan,  she seemed different, gentlemen, I  don't know, somehow soulless. Bravo to you, Puff! Unnhh. Urgh. I'm glad... my assistant. I think he's ready. Oh boy! Now, Puff, we're leaving on the  electronic collar. I don't think  we'll need to shock you, but just in  case. Okay. That's fair. No, Puff! Bad! My apologies, madam. Shan't happen again. This is great, Puff. You're doing  fine. I'm loving this. It's such a treat  to be out and about. What a wonderful  invention a city is. The immense  buildings of glass and steel glinting  in the afternoon sun, the smartly  dressed women in their best summer  frocks, the colorful street vendors. Just spectacular. Great salmon.  Fantastico! You've got to give me  the recipe! My compliments to the  chef! Puff, no! It shan't happen again. I swear it.  I'm just getting my sea legs, you  know. Lila! Tell him. Thank you very much for that. I don't think this aversion therapy  is really necessary, doctor. I  understand the problem. Humor me, Puff. It's essential that  I am able to trust you to function  independently in the world. I bow to your expertise in these  matters. Lila? Good. You're doing fine. Excellent. You're doing very nicely, Puff. I'm  pleased. Great... Eh. Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert  tonight. Yahoo! Tomorrow, the acid test. Very well. Very well. Puff, why don't you order first? Uh, what's a Reuben, please? That's fine. That's what I'll have.  Corned beef is a good food. Puff, I'm proud of you! You did  remarkably well under difficult  circumstances. Did I? I tried so hard! I really  concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy! And because you did so well, we have  a little surprise for you. Extra dessert? Even better. Surprise! Free to come and go as you please.  There's some "mad money" in the night  table drawer. It's wonderful! Do you think I'm  ready? Do you really? I trust that you'll make good, mature  decisions. I trust that you'll do  the proper thing. Oh, I will! Your very trust has instilled an  enormous sense of responsibility in  me. I don't want to disappoint you. Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't  ever do what you really want to do. Got it. I'm going to go down and check on  Puff. See how he's holding up. Nah. You just relax. How's the book? I won't be long. Hi. It's Nathan. I just want to talk. Please. Just one minute of your time. I've got some things to tell you. Well, I think it would be easier if  I could talk to you in person. Well, I think... What? Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered  you. God, you're beautiful. No. You look so beautiful. I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I  can't stop thinking about you. No! That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the  one who gave him the idea for the  combination bug spray-sun screen!  Did you know that?! Of course not, that Swedish thief!  He's a thief of hearts! I love you, Gabrielle. Just give me some time to let Lila  down easily. She's a really nice  girl and I don't want to hurt her  more than is necessary. Can you ever forgive me? Hey. Yeah. Puff and I got into a big,  philosophical discussion. He's really  quite well read, considering he's  only been literate for a month now.  He's going to make us famous, Lila. Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying  his new digs. Shit. I've fallen in love with somebody  else, Lila. I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her.  I'm sorry. But that's what the hell  I did. Yes. Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human  heart is a strange thing. Lila... ...and so without further ado, I  give you Dr. Nathan Bronfman and  Puff. Thank you. Let's get right to it.  Here we have Puff the day of his  capture. And here he is today, a scant three  months later. Puff, why don't you say a few words  to the assemblage. It would be my pleasure, doctor. Distinguished gentlemen and ladies  of the psychological community, I  stand before you today, a living  testament to the amazing skill of  Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he  took me from crayons to perfume would  be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman  took me from playing with my own  feces, then to crayons, and then to  an appreciation of the complex works  of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and  Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive  masturbation to... And, so, goodnight, adieu, until we  meet again, au revoir. Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff? Come on, you two. Let's go celebrate! Now the tango. I think it went swimmingly today.  You two make an excellent team. To be taken from the depths of  ignorance and depravity and raised  to heights of culture and refinement!  This is the priceless gift bestowed  upon me by Dr. Nathan Bronfman. Terrific. We're all going to be rich  and famous. Thanks to you, Nate. Thanks to you, Buddy. And your  diligence and intelligence and  perseverance. And of course to you, my sweet, for  your... moral support. here, here. Is that a little boy? No, Puff. This man is a midget. In  actuality, they prefer to be called  "Little People." Isn't that correct,  my good man? This Little Person is actually a  fully grown adult man, Puff, believe  it or not, who, due to a genetic  anomaly, is miniature but perfectly  proportioned. Turn, please. Interesting. Now, my diminutive friend, what can  I do for you? What is this about? We have no money  on these premises. Please if you are  from some little person terrorist  fringe group... Lila? Lila, you don't intend to hurt us,  do you? But I like being human now. I want to be the way I was before. Nice night. I agree? What an enchanting picture you paint  of our future together. And so commenced my reeducation,  gentlemen. Lila taught me so much.  She was a stern but fair teacher.  And over time, I began to remember  the carefree joy of living in a pure  state of being. But something else  happened as well, something perhaps  distinctly human... I began to fall  in love with Lila. Boy, you look so good from this ang... I don't know. Something's missing. So, Mother and Father, how's Godspell  going? It's going famously, son, famously! I'm glad. I don't know. I want our boy back. That bitch. I worked so hard. We  worked so hard, you and I. He would've  made us famous. I know. And that's great. But it  would be great in a better way, not  a better way but a different way, if  I could find him and bring him back. I have some thoughts. I think that  hairy bitch is somewhere trying to  turn him back into an ape. You better believe they're dirty!  And smelly! And messy! And they don't  know their forks from their assholes! I'm going alone. This could be  dangerous. A little resistance would be nice,  damn it. No. Aha! No luck yet, my sweet. Aha! Finally. I've covered almost  the entire seaboard and parts of  eastern Ohio. Ugnh. Oh please, is that as articulate as  you can be after all the time I spent  teaching you? We've discussed  Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not  that you ever had anything very  original or challenging to say on  the subject. Unn. Down from the tree. Both of you.  Keep your hands where I can see them.  Don't want you pulling any weapons  out of your fur. Look at you two. You both disgust  me. Shut up! I gave you... life. I created you in  my image, Puff. I took you from this  primordial ooze and brought you into  the world of culture and art and  manners. And this is how you repay  me? By heading back to the ooze first  chance you get? I should leave you  here with Lila the ape woman. It  would serve you right, you ungrateful  piece of crap. But I'm not going to.  You're too valuable to me. Totally  selfish of me. You serve my purpose.  But if you had any smarts you would  realize that I serve your purpose as  well. Life is so much more delightful  when lived in a silk suit. Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I  don't have any interest in you  anymore. C'mon, monkey boy. Now! Puff, put the gun down. Ounpoo. Ungh. Let's be reasonable human beings  here. We're all reasonable human  beings, aren't we? Unka unka unka unka unka. Look, why don't you and Lila stay  here and have your natural life.  I'll just go on my way. You'll never  see me again. I have to talk. Is that okay? You did create me in your image,  Nathan. Before you I was a simple,  happy, complete being, in harmony  with the world around me. After you  I became duplicitous, cynical, angry,  anal, totally out of touch with my  surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I  became you. Lila has reintroduced me  to myself. And, incidentally, what  I'm about to do, kill you, is  something that would never have  occurred to me to do as a creature  of the Earth. Before when I killed,  it was for food or in self-defense.  Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge  is an abstract concept, Nathan. And  I learned abstract thinking from  you. No. Then Lila shot Nathan. Then Puff shot me. Then I died. That's  all I know. That's the end of my  story. Do I get to go to heaven now? Or is it... hell? Or... what? I just stay here, is it? I just stay  here and tell it again? And after  that? Again? And after... Yes. Yes, of course. I don't even know what sorry means  anymore. It's odd. When I was alive  I knew -- maybe it was all I knew... We bury the body. We disappear into  the woods. Nobody knows. Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear.  We'll never talk about it again.  We'll never talk again period. I  love you. I won't let you do that. I shot the  bastard. And I'm glad. Then I'll live for both of us, Lila.  I'll be the most free, truest animal  in the whole forest. For both of us. But first I'll live among them, just  long enough to testify before congress  about the waywardness of humankind. And so, gentlemen, that is my story.  I agreed to testify before this  committee because I hoped to convey  to the American public that there is  indeed a paradise lost. Human beings  have become so enamored of their  technologies and their intellectual  prowess and their fancy gourmet foods,  that they've forgotten to look to  the Earth as a teacher. This is  hubris, my friends. And my story of  destruction and betrayal is proof of  that. I will keep my promise to Lila.  I will shed this suit and go back  into the wilderness. I will live out  my days naked and free. Thank you, sir. Your story has touched  us all deeply. We will pass some  legislation addressing this problem. Thank you. That is all I ask. Good-bye, Lila. I take you with me  in my untamed heart. Yes? Mother? It's a pleasure to meet you, mother.  But I'm an ape like dad was... And I have to go back into the woods  now... forever. Yes. I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And  apes don't drop lines. Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes?  I'm freezing my ass off. Great. God, I've wanted you forever. Gabrielle. Like father, like son. Woof. Arf. As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not  sorry she killed him, if it means I  can have you. Is that a terrible  thing to say, my sweet? Let's go eat, I'm starved. Oui.
