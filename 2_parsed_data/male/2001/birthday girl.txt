And don't forget you owe me ï¿½150. You first. You have. You've actually fallen for this prick. What. You're what? You're with this creep now. What? What are you doing? A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby? What? Thank you. Yeah. That's not a burn. What's this? We'll stop then. Do you want to stop? What do you mean? There's over eighty thousand here.I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide. You can see why it's sensitive? To customers approaching the bank from the rear This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.Right. Hello. Uh... Yes. Right. Ch... Leave her alone. Just leave her alone. Oh Jesus. Of course I can't. Oh Jesus. I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus. I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there. I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...

Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him. Put the fucking kettle down. Good night. You can stay tonight. Fine. I thought you were leaving today. I suppose it's... I mean define your terms. No. It's not that. Tell me what he said. Tell me. What was that? Binoculars. I... When? What? Uh. Do you like England? No, no... You must have a visa or something... So how long will you be in England? Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food. What was that? So? No. Right. Right. So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins? Hold on. And... Yes. I know. I need to know who you are first please. What did he say? I'm asking what you're here for. What are you doing here? Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you? Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John. Right. What does it mean? It's a long way to go for a date. No. What? No. I know. Why? It's not mine either. Please. Whatever. Goodbye. You can probably buy them on the flight. Okay. Promise? Okay. Goodbye. Because it was a lie. Yeah. No thanks. Whatever. No. I think I better just go. It's alright. What's your name? I don't know. Except for Small Eyes. I don't want anyone to die. Nobody's that unhappy. I've got news for you. It's not working. You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog. Laugh it up. I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all. She's dead. It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes. What? Are you scared? Have you had any before? Do you know if it's a boy or a girl? Well what have you got? I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing. Thank Christ for that. Yeah. He's a smashing bloke. Then okay. So how old were you when you met him? Please, there's no... Oh. You don't have to say anything Get out. Get out You don't understand me. It wasn't what I wanted. I got what I paid for. What? I think it's my safest bet, don't you? Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die. I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again. Some... What does that mean? Sometimes which? So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what? Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff. So. What then? You just detach sex from everything.. And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency. And. It's wrong. Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money. So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate? No. Shut up. I'm not listening. I don't want to talk about it. Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too. Excuse me? Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed. Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks. Oh Jesus. So uh... Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock. Fine. So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name... What? Give me some money. Shut up. Have you got your passport? Have you got your passport? No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ? What? No you're not.. What? Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash. In every sense. If at all possible. I do. I want to very badly. In the world. You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world. Well as it turns out I did. Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me. I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison. That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy. I don't want to know. Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee. I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously. Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber. Of course. They go. Yes. Yes. What's wrong? Yes I know. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Syevodnya? I don't understand. Sorry? Uh... Are you a giraffe? Do you follow or should I speak slower? Good. Or should I speak slower? Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying? And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you? I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined? So. Is it different to how you imagined it? I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants." I'm pretty nervous. Are you? I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it. It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"? Right. Okay. Good. Is that everything? Cash. Thanks. Please check. Is it full? Please could you check. Is the flight full?How do you want to pay? You have excellent English. I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever. Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked. I paid for those guitar cases. When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid? I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week. No I don't. What for? Fifty thousand. Almost exactly. I'm so sorry. He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not. You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank. He wants the money from your bank. He wants a lot of money. He wants money. He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry. He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says. John. I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone. I understand. I'm so sorry To be indoors on such a day. It's crime. How is bank? It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something. Do you believe in love? You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love. He says why did you send to Russia for a wife. No. It is too judgmental. Oh nothing. Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war. "I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds. "I saw you waiting there, by the gate." She says she has a secret to tell. Classic! Thank God. She says 'Yes!' She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John! You're asking for my documents? Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth. I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you. So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are. Right. So I can say he smokes me. So. I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me. We better watch him. He's crazy. Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem. Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us. And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you. Good. Oh. We are Russian. He says he feels safe here. What? Sorry. You've lost me... You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates. How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
