And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You-- Screw you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is dry cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never-- Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is-- ...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion. Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh... ...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh-- Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point? Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer-- I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh? ...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh? Cash?! ...You bring a check? Right! Strictly business. No problem! Maybe. ...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh... Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well... Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya? Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance. Sure. Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee? You got the dough?! ...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop? Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber. Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage. That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on... It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage. Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul! A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?I'm not proud of what I did. But you . I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it. What kind of man are you? ...What kind of man are you? ...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell. Come on in. I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in. Please, Ed. Please, Ed. Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife! That's my capitalization on the Annex! My operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann. ...Oh, Jesus. He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us. Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious. The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount. $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I can do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is. I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus. Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store-- her store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed. Well, you know what that would do to me. Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows. ...Ed, I... Uh-huh. ...Say, where do you get those things anyway? ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day. Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop? She's a rare one. ...That's quite a wife you got there. ...Were you in the service, Ed? How ya doin', Ed?Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink? Ann-- Ann-- ...Yes? Yes? Yes, Ann? Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all. ...I'm so sorry about your loss. Ann. Will you come in? ...No, please. Birdy-- ...I guess I've been all wet. Huh. Yeah. Maybe... Huh. Ah... it's nothing. ...Uh-huh. I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony. Look, I'm no expert, but-- He didn't say that. Just see him, as a favor to me. I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words. I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand. You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest-- That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman. Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away. Sure... Sure, it's his house. ...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're-- Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards... Yeah. Hello, Birdy. Hello, Tony. Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good. Who? Yeah. Thanks. Hello, Rachel. ...You don't like the music out there? Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert-- I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the-- Did she make mistakes? I don't understand. Well? How'd she do? Well, I don't pretend to be an expert. Uh-huh. No. Uh... family friend. OK. All right. ...You're not gonna screw me on this? Look, uh... Creighton... Uh-huh. That'll be fine. It's OK. Yeah. Sure. Cash. Yeah. Way out of line. You're out of line, mister. ...Was that a pass? Ed. I'll have it in a week. And how do we share-- What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do? No. I--tell me-- I can get it, yeah. No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition-- I'm, uh, I'm--the barber. ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today? Huh. That right. Uh-- I, uh... Big Dave-- ...Huh? So you paid the guy? ...Dave? OK. Your place? But it's... Mm. ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave? Mm. How, uh... how did he know that-- Would he... it sounds pretty obvious. ...You know... who who is? How much to they want, Dave? Uh-huh. I guess it would be pretty awkward. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What is it, Dave? Specialty store down in Sacramento. All right, I guess. How's business, Dave? Mm. No, Dave, I wasn't. OK. Take your coat, Ann? My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years. Told what? Just coffee. ...Doris-- Honey... You don't have to tell me anything. Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider. You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer. You don't have to-- What happened to you? How are you? Honey... Congratulations, Gina. I didn't say a word. Mm. So? How's that? Who? Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties. Yeah, right. Where you going? Mm. ...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money? ...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway... ...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake... ...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris... ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe... I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave... So... who... who actually-- Yeah. ...I don't get it. ...I don't think so. I took Doris's keys. I don't know. I don't think so. I... just knew. A husband knows. He and Doris... were having an affair. I was with her. It was Big Dave's. I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money. ...OK. No. Of course not. She didn't do it. Sure, Walter. Thanks. Yeah. I'm OK, Walter, thanks. Uh-huh. He's the, uh... Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh... ...So, uh, who should I-- I'm fine. Thanks. So, who should I-- So-- He a good man? Yeah. What do I, uh... I'm fine. No thanks. Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home. Uh-huh. Yeah. I don't work here. My wife does. ...Huh? Sorry, I just didn't remember. That was something. I'm Ed Crane. That was quite something. ...Did you make that up? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's very generous. Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider-- Yeah. ...Nah. OK. I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt. ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt. No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away. I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing. ...You ever wonder about it? This hair. Frank. Yeah, yeah--go home. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie... Yeah. Huh? Uh-huh. Birdy... Birdy... I didn't mean to-- I don't understand. My wife ? Huh? ...We goin'? Doesn't bother me. Hello. Yeah? ...I'm Crane. No thanks, I-- Yeah-- Crane. Ed Crane. Hello, Walter.They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A rock , the barbershop. I mean, how long has this place been here? Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me. They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that. The hell with it, Eddie! I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together! Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches! This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together! Damn, I got a headache to beat the band. You don't got a headache? ...How you today, Ed? What the hell are you talking about? What the-- Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid. Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal? Whuddya mean? Yeah. Huh? ...You sure, Eddie? Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed... Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek? The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think. ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying? Jesus... Russians exploded an A-bomb. ...Ed? How d'ya like them apples? Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it. No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law. Second chair. He's a barber. Sure. Can Ed come too? Yes, sir. Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours-- We're just closing, friend.What'd he say? He's the dead guy. They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail. Huh? No. What'd he say? Does he understand? You'll go to the prison hospital. Uh... you're under arrest. Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious? Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow. Homicide. ...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth... Hello! My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner. Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries. ...You're Ed Crane? You also have an interest in the securing property? Mr...? 'Lo, Ed. Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here. Not an owner. Ah. Could you come with me please? Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned! OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?He said OK. Is that what he said? Under arrest for murder. As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious? His eyes are open. Are you awake?... Is he awake? Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya. ...Yeah, it's a tough break. Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent. Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh... They sent us to tell ya....and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women... ...who among us is in a position to say... ...a puny player on the great world's stage... Not guilty, your honor... Who? Who?! I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting this woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might know who! But we can't know what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is also a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier not to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't gotta know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, they don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. You explain it to me. Go ahead. Try. ...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, you'll have to tell us . Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who did serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to you to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch! And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money... Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth. Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all? Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back? How did you get into the store? Will anyone else say they knew? OK, how did you know? OK, we forget the blackmail. You killed him. How come? --don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got you , a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone. ...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you-- cooked by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene you had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a dame's weapon-- Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific. Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No? Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell you what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood? Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? You don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here. I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible. Ed, how're you holding up? Yeah, the best. Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money. ...Probity. Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here. No thanks, honey. Coffee, Ed? Taking it seriously. Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm... 'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender. Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless. OK. Boy. Jesus! Sure you don't need one? Oh, hell. Drink?Check out the rack on that broad in the angora. Uh-huh. Some beat, huh? Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
