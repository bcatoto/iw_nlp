No, Carter. The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong. And what the hell is Heaven on Earth? I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why? Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter? I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there. It's nine-thirty in the morning. Is it true, Carter? Are you in Hong Kong right now?Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor. Captain, you there? Hello? Shit! Is it because of the hookers, sir? You tell them there's no crime in being lonely. Two hundred cops? Was Mario Sanchez there? He owes me money. Did I say dinner? I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit. Hong Kong? I'm not in Hong Kong. I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station. How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner? I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari. Do they sell those here in the gift shop? Somebody cash me out! Two-hundred thousand dollars? Who wants a hundred dollars? How much is that? Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it? Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you? You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right? Are you a racist? Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black? What the hell is that? Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced. Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says. Where is he? I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests. I'm with the band. I'm the lead singer. All right, Kenny. Thanks. You're off the hook. For now. What? Yeah. We already been there. This is big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service calls 'em superbills. Banks can't even tell the difference. So tell me what you know. How'd you know? Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around. I'd like to see you try. Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate. And I got mine, meaning you. Nice how that works out. I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down. What?? Where'd you hear that? What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money? How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses? It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit. So what's your story? Yeah, that's right. How do we know you're not lying? Let me see your badge. Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you right now. Your friend's ship? Oh, man. I must've walked onto the wrong yacht. I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work. Red Dragon? You sure about that? Called? What's my ship called? Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson. I don't want to play games with you, Isabella. I like you. I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes. That's right. I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan. I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles. But hey, I understand. Make yourself at home, Isabella. Champagne, caviar, whatever you want. My ship is your ship. San Juan! You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo. How you doing, baby? My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria. C'mon, Lee. He's going to jail. You won, now just put the gun down. Lee, you okay? I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist. I got proof. See, I got a mini-bar key. That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted. I'd like to pay you for that laptop. Let's go. I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me. I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you. This is the only color they had left. Now get up! I said get on your feet! She is nice. But I am very tense. I'm gonna need a lot of massages. I'll take that one, too. How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink. She can do my feet. Any girl? Okay. Let's start with that one. No. It's my first time. Never leave home without it. Lee, this one's on me. You save your money. That's right. You're right, you're a smart guy. Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar. But this is an even swap. Pure genius. Lemme ask you something, Steven. And I want the truth. Is there any way I can date your daughter? Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz... Stevie, how's it going my man? Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot. Wait a second. You're Steven Reign? You're big time. You own all them big hotels. What are you doing in Hong Kong? I could use a little vacation. Some Kung-Pao? The Plaza Hotel? New York City? Come on, Lee. Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up. There must be something you want. They owe us, man. That's the least they can do. It's okay, I got lots more. About fifty grand. I won it at the tables. Your father's badge? No way, man. I can't take this. You take care of yourself, Lee. I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye. That your gate down there? I saw that. She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though. Walking away, never looking back. We made it, man. Lee, wait a second. It's not worth it, man. He's making you do this. Just GO! You go after Ricky. I got this. What?!?! No you didn't! Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth? Lee! I'll give it my best shot. I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene. When security comes over, you make your move. Wait a second. There's guards all over the place. You'll need a distraction. Isabella? Are you crazy, man? She almost got us killed. She's setting you up again! Dancing? I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo. Did she have a friend? Lee, what the hell are you doing? Wait here. I'll handle this. Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia. That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell. Couple? No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here. Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case. Follow me my Asian brother. Wait a second. We can't go in like this. Look at this place, we gotta look fly. We gotta Mac out. That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat. Lee. I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash. Don't you talk about my mama. That's more like it. Oh no you don't. Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee. I'll kick your ass from here to Compton. End of the line. Now that I believe. No Chinese man discovered electricity. Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity. Hello, Benjamin. I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box. Very nice. Go ahead. Sing your ass off. That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims? As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice. Are you serious? That's rough, man. If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy. Steamed dumplings? What about a little king pao chicken? You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No mu-shu? How was the sex? If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her. You thinking about that girl that dumped you? Fine by me. I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don't let everybody in. Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven? I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven? I don't believe in reincarnation. So I won't see you in the next world. I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me. We'll die in peace. You got that right. And we ain't brothers. Maybe we should just end this right here. We are not partners. Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead. It doesn't matter. I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me! This wasn't my case, Lee. Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central. I didn't have to help you. Look, man I'm sorry. I know you got a thing for her. For how long? Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides. What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody. How could you fall for that shit? I knew she was dirty. Snoopy is about six inches taller than you. I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance. You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me. I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly. They don't know that. What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview? I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings. You saw the way she was staring at me. Secret Service Agent Carter. This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy. Let me see it again? I wouldn't do that!!! Take it! There's people up here! I don't need a turn! Pick it up! She's walking back towards the door. No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone. Lee, she's wired... She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg. Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick. Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs? She just took her hair down. Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands. You better get that ice. Skirt just came off. She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy. Oh, sweet glory hallelujah... Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you. Gimme the binoculars. What's going on? Hot? I'm freezing my ass off. What did you say? Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen. Excuse me? Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive. I've seen it a million times. I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you? You pull a muscle or something? Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic. Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over. He'll be back soon. Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out. They still just talking? The same place you find all RichWhiteMen. Gefilte Fish. Lox and bagel. I love this stuff. Here, try it with a smear. Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming? You people were screaming your asses off. Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down. Because when the shooting started he was way too cool. See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!! Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked. Not bad. Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one. Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign. Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word. Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man. I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one. You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane. -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it. It sounds impossible -- Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal. Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first. So are you getting on the plane or not?! IT IS CRAZY! You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing... This is about your Daddy's death? Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me... This is about more than all that, isn't it? This is about your Daddy's last case, right? How the hell did Tan get away with it? Ask me if I give a shit. Forget it. You're not very good at this, are you? I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw. Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy. What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper? What the hell is going on here? Why the hell should you believe him? He had us beat up. Naked. That's nasty shit. What, leave you alone so he can cap you? Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth. Who? Detective Yu? Never met him. Who died? And you ain't black! Really? When's the last time you had some Mu-shu Let's hear it, Lee, when was it? Year of the rat? You're pathetic, man. When's the last time you had some fun? When's the last time you took a night off, had a date? My bullshit? I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords! Why you mad at me? You needed back-up, so I backed you up. I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards. Back to Heaven on Earth. I need my damn passport back. I'm going home. Goddamn you got a small ass. I'm a dangerous man. You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat. That's Ricky Tan? He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down. What's wrong? Hey! You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line. She said I could pick any girl I want. How you doin'? I am a tourist. And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold. Now start practicing and don't make me come back here! I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit. There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner. You're sorry. I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry. Just take me home. You lied to me. All I wanted was a little mu-shu. Shit. C'mon, get up here and help me out. What'd I say? You mean Tito. We had Toto for dinner last night. Man, are you crazy? You think that scares me? I'm from L.A. We invented gangs. We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it. We get royalties from other gangs. Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done. Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar? Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun. Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing. I knew you were lying. Are you kidding, they love me. I'm a star, Lee. A god to these people! Blend in? I'm two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going? Take this. It's a Magnum. You can fold it in half. Just relax and don't worry about a thing. I'll hook you up in there. You got condoms? You better take one. Your breath has been a little funky all day. Let me look at you. That's what I'm talking about. A real Hong Kong night club. You want an Altoid? Don't be messing with me, Lee. I will kick your ass. I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty. Not Mu-shu. Mu-shu. I want to see some women. Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu! Don't be giving me attitude, Lee. I've been here three days and we haven't done shit. We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl. I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu. I said that? Which word was "goat?" All I did was invite them for a drink. Did you see the way those girls drove off? I did you a favor. I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car. Fine with me. Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you -- What "revenge" is he talking about?Winner! Four, winner! Two-hundred thousand! Winner six! No, sir. No, I just assumed... Those are five hundred dollar chips.Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help. Wait. The band has been playing over an hour. Invitation, please.I knew it. The guy's name is Zing. He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza. One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week. I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing. Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills. I knew something was wrong. Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared. The whole thing. And they checked out. 100%. I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you? You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning. How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn. Shit don't happen I don't know about. Is this about the funny money? Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass. James, you see my kids back there? You know how much I'm paying for private school? How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather? I got my sources. Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James. I still have my lunch money from third grade. That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking. Never shut up. What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck? No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw. Master Ching taught me.Amen to that, brother. A little Mu-shu. First class. I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden. See the Knicks play. This money is evidence. No, Carter. I can't take this. What is this? It's okay. I can finally let it go. I guess so. Thank you, Carter. Yes. She's going home to New York. I need some ice. No problem. It's worth it to me. Carter... We have to get to the Penthouse. Ricky Tan is alive. Yes I did. I said MMMMMM! I did! MMMMMM!!!! Try to keep them busy for five minutes. No. I'm going to find out. It was Isabella. She says the plates are in the soft count room. Dancing? Carter...here comes the rich white man. Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune. Yes. We have lots of big men chasing us. What is Mac out? Let's go. Red Dragon. Vegas... You could never kick my ass. You mama's boy. You've been a good friend, James Carter. We're slowing down. This must be it. Yes he did. He also invented the bicycle. A Chinese man discovered electricity. Who's Benjamin? It's focus. Every opponent has a weak spot. You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike. They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head. I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something? Forget it. It doesn't matter. Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think I have a good voice? Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk. No kung pao chicken. Never. No mu-shu. There was no sex. She was very traditional. We were waiting until we were married. Mind your own business. No. I think we should stop talking. What's a Chinese heaven? Yes. We have heaven. Fine. See you in the next world. Fine with me. Well we're not friends. I'm not used to having a partner. Why did you help me? Shhh, my head hurts. She saved our lives. Are you okay? I am not third world ugly. Women like me, they think I'm cute. Like Snoopy. She never even looked at you. We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else. We can help you. I'm a detective in Hong Kong. It's a bomb. Get it out of here! Wait! There's people down there! It's your turn! I don't understand? What is it? What? Snoopy? I love Snoopy. I don't want to hear this. What's she doing? No. It's not right. She's getting undressed. I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice. You want some ice? Is it hot in here? Nothing. I said nothing. Slow down, baby. I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring. She's just standing around -- not doing much. She hated my voice. Said it drove her crazy. I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it. She finally told me it was driving her crazy. No. It was my singing. It's a long story. My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding. The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months. Carter, there's something I have to tell you. You were right about what you said in Hong Kong. All I do is work. Never take a day off. It's all I have right now. How do you know? He just left. Kissed her on the cheek. Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign. Maybe. But not like Asians. We never panic. You sound like that all the time. How do you know he's our man? Who? Follow the RichWhiteMan... Follow the Rich White Man? I should go back. Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor... Why LA? You said -- I cannot go to LA... What? I know. I know. I am sorry. I thought you'd think it was crazy. No, no, that would be crazy -- All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved. Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly. He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along. Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty. Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case. Good at what? No. She's a school teacher. Don't be talking about my mama. Or my ass! I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok. Remember I told you my father was a policeman? Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years. I'm okay, you go. Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? Not Yu. You! You. Carter? You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese. I have plenty of dates. It's my job! Stop! I'm sick of your bullshit! Fine. Go home. Who needs you. Where are you going? Don't look at my ass! I'm calling for back up! This is a very dangerous man. Over there -- that's Ricky Tan. Well, hurry up. What are you doing? My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time. Hello. Just follow my lead and act like a tourist. Carter...you ready to have some fun!? This won't take long. No time. There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed. I'm sorry. Try to land on your feet. You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking. No. You are a civilian. In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto. Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China. No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is. We must tread softly and keep our ears open. I'm sorry. This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover. Carter, get off that stage! Bathroom. I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in. No. No. Carter, would I lie to you? Of course not. My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight. Big party. Mu-shu? You're hungry? You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two. You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat. Those girls drove off because of you. That was my CD. Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD. I didn't know which side you were on. Are you okay? No. But I'll help you. How do I know I can trust you? Why don't you go get them? Just trying to make it look real. Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck. What's going on? Excuse me? And Hu Li killed him for the plates. Is this a payoff? Then you know I'm not walking away from this case. Do you still have the bills? Baby Duck? The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing? I'll take him. Thank you. Did you tell Sterling? All he wanted was some mu-shu. The Secret Service? Why? It's my responsibility. Any leads? If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you. Put the plates down. It's over. Tell me why they killed the customs agents. The police can protect you. Don't. You must come with me for questioning. Heaven on Earth? Master, I don't understand. A temple, where Heaven is on Earth? A mountain, where Earth reaches for the -- I know, Master, but... Ricky Tan? I need your help, Master. I'm seeking a man who used to train with you. He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal. Yes, Master.It's a massage parlor downtown. "Heaven on Earth." You will find your answers there. The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth. A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven. No. Your father. Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did -- He was the best I ever trained, you know. Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent. ...he kills for money. Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?Do you have it in you, Lee? Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father? Would you like me to tell you how your father died? Could you have your partner wait for us outside? It's no problem. But I must excuse myself, inspector. I don't think so... I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend. Enjoying your visit? I'm busy at the moment. Don't you remember? I'm already dead. I don't think it's over. There are casinos all over this country. Let me make you a rich man, Lee. Don't make the same mistake he did. You're just like your father, Lee. All these years hiding behind his badge. I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change. When you think about it, I didn't really kill him. I just put him out of his misery. There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor... Nobody can protect me. I'll make a deal with you, Lee. But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong. ... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now. I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did. My enemies are trying to frame me. There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose. My name has been written into the book of death. Despite what people suspect...what you suspect -- Lee, I've missed you, brother. I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A. I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case. I don't ever want to see you again, you got that? Quite a night, Inspector. Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone. You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation. Put a diaper on him, Chin. I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee. Who the hell is that? No. He will report to me. Do we understand each other? Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation. Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need. If you have information, it belongs to us.You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time. Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house. Vegas has been my town for 30 years. I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here? Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong. I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.Escort Detective Carter to the airport -- Let him find out on his own. I want the Hong Kong police handling this. Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol. Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight. Victoria harbor. If you don't want to... Are you okay, Lee? Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service. We think it's Ricky Tan. If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand. Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy. Two American translators were killed. That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our investigation. Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people... This is still Hong Kong.
