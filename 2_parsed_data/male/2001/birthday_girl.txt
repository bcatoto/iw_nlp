Hello. Hello, hello. Hello... I don't believe in perfect love. You  know, love that comes out of the sky  like a thunderbolt and uh... This is  ridiculous. No. No no no. Nope. Running. Reading. Going out. Staying  in. The countryside. Films, if they're  good. Thoughtful. Outgoing. Ambitious.  Well-read. Reasonably popular.  Balanced. Trusting. Quite attractive.  Outgoing. Someone intelligent, of course. Kind.  Pretty I suppose. But its not  critical. Someone with a sense of humour.  Someone you can communicate with on  the same level. Someone you can really  talk to. I think communication is  key. I think that by the time most people  turn thirty they know where they're  going. And where they've been. I suppose  they have some baggage stroke history. We all have someone in our past who  uh... one skeleton, if you like.  We've all got at least one person,  as it were, under the patio. Not  literally of course. I suppose I  only say this because I always thought  people who did this sort of thing  were... I had an image that they  were losers. Not losers. A bit sad.  But I think this is the modern world.  And I think really it's quite a brave  move. Quite a brave, reasonable thing  to do. Sorry can we start again? Nadia? I'm John. Welcome. Well. Look I didn't have a speech  but... Is that everything? Right. Okay. Good. We can talk in the car. It's about forty miles from here. I  don't know if you've looked at a  map, it's close to London but it's a  city in itself. A Roman city. It's a  nice house. I'm having a problem  with ants. I uh... It's the warmer  weather. I can't seem to find the  nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"? I just can't find a nest. The root  of the problem. I've looked  everywhere. What's the Russian for  ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry.  This is strange isn't it. I'm pretty nervous. Are you? I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem  with ants." I had this... As a joke but uh... So. Is it different to how you  imagined it? I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined? And how was the flight. Sorry, am I  speaking too fast for you? Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me?  Do you understand what I'm saying? Good. Or should I speak slower? Do you follow or should I speak  slower? Uh... Are you a giraffe? Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Lounge. Kitchen. Bathroom. Bedroom. The uh... the other bedroom... I'll get an ashtray. You have reached From Russia with  Love. Our office reopens on Monday.  If you are interested in our  services... Thank You. This is John Buckingham from St  Albans. I need to speak to you  urgently. There's a critical problem.  It's... Call me back as soon as  possible. It's critical. I don't know what to say. Your letters  were in English. Good English. You  said you'd studied English. I can't take this. I can't take it. I'm not really a  ring guy. Okay. No big deal. Thank you. Yes  thanks. Thank you. If anyone gets this message please  call as soon as possible. It's an  emergency. Good night. You should go now. We'll talk in the  morning. You have reached From Russia With  Love. If you are interested... Nadia. This isn't going to work. I'm  sorry. It's been a terrible mistake.  You must go. I'm booking a flight for tomorrow.  I'm sorry. Uh. Yeah. Pretty good. Uh. No. When communicating he is good at  selecting the most efficient methods  and displays effective verbal  communication skills... On one occasion John showed first  class communication skills in a  delicate customer situation. Initiative. John is reasonably quick  to volunteer whenever others need  help. Although he is sometimes  reluctant and or unwilling to ask  for it himself... He is adequate at resolving difficult  or emotional customer situations... He usually fulfills commitments made  to customers within expected time  frames. Customer Service. John shows a high  degree of respect for customers... John still has some reluctance to /  or has problems in, carving out new  relationships face to face. Judgment -- John makes able decisions  in most areas of his job. John follows instructions  conscientiously and responds well to  personal directions. John is normally very punctual and  in most situations assumes  responsibility for his own actions  and outcomes. Thank you -- I think that's very  fair. Good. Again. Very good. How does that feel John? It feels good. Weird. It's called Trust and Letting Go. Trust and Letting Go. Are you O.K.? Sorry? Bath day? I don't understand. Today? Syevodnya? Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Yes. Party. Party syevodnya. ...It might just be a twenty-four  hour bug... Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday  to you. Happy Birthday dear Nadia... You must be John. You seem very nice.  Excuse me. How's that? We can't drink our piss  can we? Hang on hang on, sorry, but like,  who are you? You must find some glasses, small,  for the toast, and some plates. What are you doing here? Sorry. You've lost me... I'm asking what you're here for. What? You don't speak Russian? Pratsteetye!  This explains your cold eyes. Yes I know. Yuri. Alexei. Alexei and Yuri. What did he say? He says he feels safe here. She says she wanted to tell you but  her English is shit. And no one speaks  Russian, it's very hard for her. The  light please. I need to know who you are first  please. Oh. We are Russian. Yes. I know. Good. And... And what? You mean from the beginning?  Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in  Russia can I cut a long story short.  Okay. Nadia is my little cousin.  Except she's not. But we say cousin.  This is for you. Hold on. Toast first then we talk seriously,  I can see you are serious about us. Just kidding. So hang on. You're both Nadia's  cousins? Of course not. Alexei, he's is my  problem. Right. We better watch him. He's crazy. Right. I am actor, he is actor, although he  is an actor stroke musician. I just  noodle along, I'm not so good. He  makes me look like a retard -- He  smokes me. I don't mean he smokes  me. I mean he smokes me. Do you say  "smoke" in U.K.? No. Right. So I can say he smokes me.  So. So? So I come to England with other actors  to make shows, I meet this freak  from Novgorod I tell him of you and  Chicken and the birthday here we  are. What was that? I asked her if you were happy to see  us. I find it hard to tell with you. Yes it's okay. Thank you for the  food. She says you are a little shy. I  think I know this. So how long will you be in England? Plans are for the architects,  politicians and so forth. You must have a visa or something... You're asking for my documents? No, no... We are all Europeans here. Europe,  Tony Blair and Maggie Thatcher! So. You have nothing to say to your  Fiancee? Maybe to wife of forty years  it's understandable. Come on. You  speak and I will translate. Hello. She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it  John! Uh. Do you like England? Classic! Thank God. She says 'Yes!' Uh... I can't think of anything. Hang on. She says she has a secret to tell. What? She says she watched you at the  airport. When? "I saw you waiting there, by the  gate." I... "I have these uh..." She explains to  you... "When I was a little girl my  father had these beautiful old  glasses." Like... I don't know the  word. Like for watching uh... for  watching the birds. Binoculars. Binoculars. He had these Binoculars  he has kept from the war. I would run around with them taking  pictures of things I liked with my  mind. If I saw something beautiful I  would take a picture. The day before I left Russia my father  gave me the old binoculars. He said  that when I saw you I was to stand  far away and look at you with these,  and to examine your face closely.  And if you were a bad person I could  run away. She says she took a picture. Nasyekski. What was that? Oh nothing. Tell me. No. It is too judgmental. Tell me what he said. He says why did you send to Russia  for a wife. You are not ashamed of it? It's no  surprise to want to love. No. It's not that. Do you believe in love? I suppose it's... I mean define your  terms. It's very strange. How many people  are truly themselves with their love?  It is the greatest human disaster  and it is never in the newspapers.  There are no Marches Against  Heartache, no Ministries Against  Loneliness, no Concerts Against  Disappointment. We look away. And  still we know in secret that nothing  is more important to us. The one  thing we all share but don't say.  Look John I will show you something. Here look, something beautiful from  Russia. Here is Life, there, take  it. Here is bread. Khylep. This is work.  We all need this, here eat. Good. But we cannot survive with  just work, so here is meat and blood.  Myasa. This is family and country,  flesh, strength, eat. But again this is not life. Here is  joy and pain. Chyesnok. Without these  life has no flavour, is too serious.  Eat. But this vodka. Is love. Only this magic changes you  inside. The moon and the stars and  the sun. This is a love song, a soldier's  song to his beloved -- Alexei, he's  Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan.  He saw terrible things. Quick word John? This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely  car. Doesn't necessarily give the  right impression. Ch... To customers approaching the bank  from the rear Right. You can see why it's sensitive? Uh... Yes. I'll leave it on your desk. John. We can see you hiding. How is bank? Fine. I thought you were leaving  today. To be indoors on such a day. It's  crime. Hey. He's just having fun. He's maybe too  strong you know... What's wrong? Of course. They go. Yes. Yes. I understand. I'm so sorry You can stay tonight. I have brought you trouble. Maybe I  should have come alone. Good night. John. You must call the Police. What are you doing? John, I'm sorry. It's my fault. What's he doing? What the fuck are  you doing? Leave her alone. He says sit down. Or he'll cut her. Sit down please. Tell him to stop and let her go, and  we'll talk. Put the fucking kettle down. John. Put the fucking kettle down. Tell,  Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm  going to make him. He says you scare him so much he  must go to the toilet in his trousers.  John, he is a soldier. A trained  killer. We must do what he says. What? What does he want? What did he say? Tell me! He says you are very sad ridiculous  man. I don't agree of course. And  that you must pay someone to have  sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a  prostitute. I'm sorry. What does he want. The Russian  shithead. What do you want ? He wants money. Tell him to put the kettle down and  I'll give him money. He wants a lot of money. I'll give him money. Tell him to put  the... He wants the money from your bank. I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll  go down there. You don't understand. He wants all  the money that is in your bank. I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh  Jesus. Oh Jesus. He is sure you can do this. Of course  you can not. Oh Jesus. Of course I can't. Just leave her alone. I'm so sorry. Leave her alone. Ah John. This is Robert Moseley,  Head of South East New Business.  Robert, this is John Buckingham. Hello John. Hello. I thought you could give us the tour  this morning. Sort of be our Indian  Guide. Right. Do you play? Yes. I do. I used to be in a band. Keyboards.  Sort of like very loud, uh -- very  loud Marillion. I'll give you a tune later. Take the ball and run with it John. This is uh... This is the uh... Morning John. Give us a tune. I'll give you a tune later. This is where we're doing Trust and  uh... Trust and Letting Go. We're not doing this till the fourth  quarter -- Has it, uh -- any results,  has it been been beneficial? Yes. Yes. We're starting to see results. This  is Karen, who's uh... taking uh...  it. Excuse me. I'll give you a tune later. It's weird isn't it. You first. Fifty thousand. Almost exactly. There's over eighty thousand here. Sweet Jesus... Put it in the cases. Split it up.  And don't forget you owe me �150. What for? You know what for. No I don't. I got you those trousers from Paul  Smith. I've been buying you stuff all week.  I've been buying him stuff all week. Such as? When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe.  Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'.  Who paid? Those aren't presents. That's normal  friendship stuff I paid for those guitar cases. It was alright. Yeah it was okay. Yeah. It was quite good actually.  Some bits I really liked. The sets were good. The sets were excellent. Everything  was big, you know, all the rubbish,  coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins,  so when you were watching it you  felt cat size. It was really clever. So. How many times did you have to  fuck him? How you doing? I'll show you something. It should  make all this easier I think. Not all these bastards were like  you, believe me. You should not too  feel bad. What do you mean? Do you want to stop? We'll stop then. What's this? That's not a burn. On both wrists? Yeah. Thank you. What? A baby? What are we supposed to do  with a baby? You can't smoke in here. YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN HERE! Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy  Assistant of New Business at the  bank would have to listen to the  problems of a great many individuals.  This took a lot of understanding and  sympathy, to try to work out solutions  to their problems. But, you see, I'm  not in that line of work anymore.  Nowadays I'm a bank robber. I think that about covers it. I think  I have grasped the part about you  being dumped though. That's got to  hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart  a bit. I mean strictly in my  observer's capacity it seemed you  two were getting on Pretty Fucking  Famously. Unless. Unless this is part of the  routine. You get tied up, stick  around, distract me, they both bust  in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee. I don't want to know. That's a relief. It's nice to know  I'm a regular guy. I'm going to drink my coffee. Then,  we're going to the police station.  Where there will be lawyers, loss of  job, house, humiliation, gutter press,  and probably prison. Even so I always felt the decision  to burst in and rob it very much  remained with me. Well as it turns out I did. Yes please. Splendid. Thank you. You must think... I'm the biggest  pillock... In the world. In the world. I do. I want to very badly. In every sense. If at all possible. Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to  you, I'd like to give it a bash. What? What? No you're not.. No you're not. How... Nice one. How  dumb do you think I am ? The what, love? Down there on the left. You're pregnant. Can I help you? Sir? Can I help you? No. Get in the car. Have you got your passport? Shut up. Have you got your passport? We've got to get off this motor-way. Give me some money. What? Give me your sunglasses. So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't  his name... Fine. Fine. Absolutely. Must be  disappointing though. Must come as a  hell of a shock. So uh... Oh Jesus. Of course. Of course. Of course he  does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks. It's his baby I take it. Not the kids type then is he? Not  that broody. You must be pretty  miffed. Excuse me? Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon  women I really want to see again  too. Fuck off. Fuck off. You started it. I don't want to talk about it. Shut up. I'm not listening. No. So. What's it like having to fuck  men you hate? Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have  had sex with people you don't like  haven't you? For money. To make money. And. It's wrong. And that would be Morals. That would  be one's own moral sense of decency. So. What then? You just detach sex  from everything.. Listen. I didn't go rooting around  in your private stuff. So what? Do you just switch off in  your head or do you imagine you're  with him, or what? Sometimes which? Some... What does that mean? I don't like sex. I don't think I'll  be having sex ever again. Well, it's just that the thought  trying to charm up an erection in  front of a woman, or alone for that  matter, makes me want to die. I think it's my safest bet, don't  you? What? I got what I paid for. It wasn't what I wanted. You don't understand me. Get out. Get out Get out. Jesus. You weren't even on the plane. You don't have to say anything Please, there's no... Oh. Then okay. So how old were you when you met  him? Yeah. He's a smashing bloke. Thank Christ for that. I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You  have to do all this, and what have  you got to show for it? Nothing. Well what have you got? Do you know if it's a boy or a girl? Have you had any before? Are you scared? What? It's none of your business. She didn't  have small eyes. She's dead. I don't know why I said that. She's  not dead at all. I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry. Laugh it up. You should stop smoking. You're  pregnant. You smoke like a fucking  lab dog. I've got news for you. It's not  working. Nobody's that unhappy. I don't want anyone to die. Except for Small Eyes. I don't know. What's your name? It's alright. No. I think I better just go. Whatever. Yeah. No thanks. Because it was a lie. Oh Jesus. I love you. I don't need to tell you  that. I wouldn't leave my child would I?  You know that. I was confused. That's  all. It wasn't easy for me. You know what  I'm like. I needed to know what I  wanted. Now I know. It's simple. I'm  happy. You still love me? Eh? Of course you  do. Come here. Yuri won't be here  for a while. Come on babe. What the fuck is he doing here? That's that cigarette lighter I gave  you isn't it? What? What are you doing? What. You're what? You're with this  creep now. You have. You've actually fallen for  this prick. Babe it's me. I won't let you get  away. Don't do this. Are you okay? Okay. Goodbye. What will you do now? Okay. Promise? You can probably buy them on the  flight. Goodbye. Whatever. Please. It's not mine either. Yeah, you see when I said I didn't  speak Russian I wasn't actually just  making it up. Why? No. What? No. I know. It's a long way to go for a date. What does it mean? Right. Is the flight full? I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight  is closed. Please check. Is it full? Please  could you check. You have excellent English. Thanks. How do you want to pay? Cash. Excuse me Sir... Okay. Come with us now. He doesn't speak English. He's  epileptic or something. Can he walk? Can you walk? Kam. Kapsi. Schta. Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still  John.
