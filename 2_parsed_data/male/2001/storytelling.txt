Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors. You know any survivors, Dad? We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies. Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked! What? What if he is? Maybe he's gay. Thanks, Scoob. And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined. You know...Stanley... There are some rumors... There's something I need to talk about with you. Hey. Even though it was only his cousins that were killed? But I thought he came over to America before the war. He was in a concentration camp? He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute. Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea? And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future? Nice to have you here. Welcome to the show, Scooby. Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look. I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions? Hey, Scooby! How's it going?Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered. Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you! Your story was terrible! What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK? What do you want? Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind. You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex. You're tired of me. I can tell. So you don't want to hear my new ending? But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context. Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw. Well, I changed the ending a little. I can read it to you. Hey, you want to hear my short story now?Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me. Consuelo, what is rape exactly? Why was he on Death Row? But really, you never know. But still, you can't be sure. Maybe he was and you just didn't know it. Maybe it's for the best�I mean, if he was guilty of doing something wrong�People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so? How did they execute him? Oh. How did it happen? Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus? You have a bay? Who is Jesus? Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you. Speak English. Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter? Consuelo. Are you crying? But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting. But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do? But like, what do you like to do when you're not working? Hmmm. But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything? Must've been hard being poor. Weren't there high schools in El Salvador? When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank. What did you do in high school? But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff? Wow. Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two? Really? How many? Do you have any brothers or sisters? Consuelo? 550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade! I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got? Mom? Twinkeys! I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school? Sure, Dad. Gee, you're home early! Hi, Dad! OK! OK. Stay there. I'll be right back. You're welcome. Dad?�Would you let me try hypnotizing you now? I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better. Maybe he's that one in a million! Dad?�Do you think that Brady will ever get better? Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't. Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!Again!! Again! Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!' 'Fuck me hard!' Say, 'Nigger.' ...gger. Say, Ni... Take off your top. It's over there. No. I'm not 'going out' with Catherine. Maybe. She's OK. You have beautiful skin. That's good. You're not. Uh huh. Well, now you have. What are you doing here? Hello, Vi.Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal? C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking. 'OK.' So you just don't care. Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have? All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere. None at all? How about those 'underground' comics? Any books you like to read for fun?No prob. I'm cool. Oh. Like what? What? Hey. What's up? Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host. Well, I was thinking...I might work for you. Great to be here. Thank you. I'll be your guest! Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here? What's tomorrow? Fine. But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born. We did the same thing last year also. I dunno. My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend. Hey. Can you pass the salad over. Was anyone in my room today? OK. Whaddya wanna talk about? Yeah? Man, it's just, like, conversation. Just the same. The same. Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and... I dunno. Fuck! I dunno. See if I have any connections. Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman. I dunno... OK. I hate reading. No. No, not really. You want some? Yeah. I know. Yeah? You should be. I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV. Is it loaded? Gee, your Dad's smart. How'd you get it? Pretty cool, Stanley. Don't be. Your movie's a hit. Oh. He did? I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct. Thanks man. Can I see what you have so far? Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering�Is the documentary almost finished? 200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird. Prnceton. So like, yeah�I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like �still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews�Y'know, I figure I can always drop out. Whoopee. Doubt it. Is this to like get into Sundance? What for? Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project? You a pervert?No, thanks. I mean... You know...I like you. Scooby? I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why. Scooby, don't! Be careful! No, I don't think so... I know. It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet. Thanks.I don't know. Maybe they'll like it. Well, I need to see this with an audience! Hip alternative types who will understand the process better� OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types. OK, you're right, you're right� You know, we need to screen what we've got�invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types�and see what real people think of this. Nothing, I guess� No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious�But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time? Yes, I know�But still, it should be somewhat entertaining. You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry? Thanks. I'll tell Mike. Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper. Yes, I do. I love them! I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is. So whaddya think? ...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism? But what kind of pull did you have? Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience. 'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope... Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds. You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today. Maybe she has caller ID. Yeah, sure. Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary! Great. How old are they? How many? Huh. Kids? Yeah...So you're um...you're married? Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'? Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies. Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point. Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then... Oh, I don't remember that... N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers? I'm a documentary filmmaker. I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity. Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished. Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing. Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out. Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that. Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on. So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it? Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do... That's what I was gonna ask you. Great! Oh, fine. How are you? Toby Oxman. Hello, is this Pam? Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry... Yeah. He went to Harward. Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college? What is most important to you? Sure�um�yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know. Uh, yeah, we're getting there. But what did you get on your SATs? So where'd you get in? HBO and MTV have also shown some interest. Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel. Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it. Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine. Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact. No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
