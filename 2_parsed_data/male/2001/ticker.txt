Hang on. Aren't you on suspension? Go ahead.No excuses, just do it! When in doubt, pull the yellow wire. I don't know. Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down. Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe. That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait... Stay to your left. Don't touch that. Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel. Okay, let's go in. Good, now the other side. He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote. Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor. Right. Off the scale. You got it. No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound... Should we head for the Interstate? How do you know? Driving in circles, waiting for- What's up? Ex-girlfriend? Congratulations, you just built your first ticker. No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you. Your partner? Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second. You don't have to talk about it. How long were you hooked? I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire. One shuts it down, one turns arms it. I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments. Right. Not bad for Bomb squad, eh? How long are we going to stay? Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ... Bingo! Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ... This is where the van was parked. No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage. Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers. With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver? There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course. Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs. Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers. An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout. So what were they doing here? Then let's go see what they missed. Drive. No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did. Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar? Only once, at Redstone. I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish? Don't push it, slick. Treat. We treat devices. We don't use the b-word. Bad luck. By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch. Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive. This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand? That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner. When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department. Alright, let's check it out. Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do. High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition. Where did you get this? Who the heck're you? Any word? Political. We work fast enough for you? Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area. Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work. It's from an IRA. T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk. Call upstairs, see what you can find out. Easy, guys. Reilly! He's loaded! Alright! Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon. A bowling alley. Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal. I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register. Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something. C4, plastic explosive. Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives. Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. Coming? Bev, you're the greatest... We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town. Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. You got it. "Punks", huh? Oh shit... Whadaya mean? Right. What do you think? Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway? Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight. How're you guys doing? Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ... He is! Oh shit... Shit. We're fucked. Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking? Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you. I don't know... That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on. No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.No thanks, Bev. Damn. How's the print coming? We just got a bomb threat upstairs. Thanks. -Where? Officer Reilly, vice. Where are they? I'm looking for the Bomb Squad. Just do it. Patch me through to the Bomb Squad. Dispatch, this is Reilly. How the hell do you feel yellow? What... ? Which one's which? Yeah, another round thing. Make up your mind, trigger. What's wrong? Something round, two wires ... More metal... sharp edge... Wires... metal, cold... something soft... Keep talking. Nothing. C'mon, talk to me! We can do it! Talk to me. Let's assess. What do we do? Fuck factor? Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off. Me, too. Would you? Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town. Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul. Where you guys at? Be right back. It's working. I terrible with mechanical things. I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since. I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me. Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual. What? Which one's which? So cut both. Why do you do it? You guys seem pretty tight. Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago. What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked. `Til we get a better lead. Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive? Look, it's a longshot... Yep. Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along. Just how easy is it to build a... device? Sounds like terrorist heaven. Cream of the crop, huh? You? You mentioned something called Redstone. I don't know. You tell me? The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside. Oh yeah? Prove it. Hey, look-- Where...? She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before? Anything else I should know? So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"? Mike Reilly. Now wait just a fucking- What? What was-? Why...? We've got one hour. Are you coming or not? What're you talking about? We can start in the area where the robbery occurred. Thanks. What do you mean? Off a girl's wrist. A suspect... You the Bomb Squad? Then why tell me? Thank you. Taylor's dead. Who is he? I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type. You touch me again and-- A ticking bomb... Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton. But sir-- I want to work this. Mike. No thanks, I'm fine. Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead. Insurance? What kind of bomb was it? Look, it's important. It don't work- Don't talk. Yeah, just a nick ... Nah, let's just take a look-see. She wanted to cook me breakfast. She didn't work out, had to cut her loose. What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty. No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked. You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway? You don't fish. So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch. I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail. Look who's talking, old man. Nice to be here. Looks like Pooch's doing okay. Someone who smokes French cigarettes. T.J., what're you doing? You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches? A what? Huh? Captain assigned me to assist you. What? It's about this. Reilly, Vice. I- We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up! Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard. I know. It won't work, he'll know it's a trap... I promised her she'd be safe. My God, you're going to use her, aren't you? I didn't. But I had to try. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Report on the case so far. Sir... Yes, sir. Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them. I'll do it. It's detonation cord, for a bomb. I'll do it. Sir, I-- Captain...Ain't that a shit-- Take your time... one day at a time, kid... Mike... You okay? We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up. What was it this time? I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it. Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery? One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family. How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping. Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful. You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens... Next week we work the park. C'mon, it's a quiet night. Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose. Reilly, what're you doing here? What the hell's going on? We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert. What about the ballistics report? Prints? Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes- Pull back. You're only an observer. Reilly, what the hell are you-? You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon. Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business- It's our only option. Glass, you're to stand by with your team. Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and- She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk? But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it? You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean. What's this? I thought I told you-- I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand? Goddamit, Reilly-- What? Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie- Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
