On the plane. Greetings, Mr. George. I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks. You tell Diego I don't appreciate it. You tell him I want my money by Friday. Can you do that? Oh, I see. George. Well, that explains everything. Open your mouth, George. QUIET! Callate! Where's Diego?Ha ha. That's too much, Georgie. Those days are over. The rate is one-thousand dollars. Inflation, you know? Alright. I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you. I don't think there will be a problem. Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie. Why don't we start small? A toast! To Mister George Jung. Mr. I 95, north and south. My brother-in-law. Happy birthday! Yes. Jack Stevens is already a very busy man. Along with many others. You shouldn't stay away so long. The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire. He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point. Let us walk. From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip. Norman Cay is not a person. He is an island, George. In the Bahamas. From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home. Pleased to meet you finally, George. I am Augusto Oliveras. Dejen la maricada pues! No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie! George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano. Blanca, por favor. Que queres decir. Que es lo que el va hacer? Pues, no va hacer nada. I don't know. Drunk somewhere. Try the bar. And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight. I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you. So beautiful. You look like you're about to burst.Diego needs to see you right away, please. Excuse us, Amorcito. Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone. For you, and you, and you. You. Your responsibility is over. You do not fly. You are not a pilot. You are not a distributor. You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane. That is all. You make a percentage. A generous one. And you're lucky to get that. Why are you speaking? The coca is my responsibility! I demand to know everything. I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know. I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important. Whose cloths? Your clothes? Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the suitcase? Tell me about the suitcases. What is the make and the color? Not so fast. I would like to go over the details.Christ almighty, George. Feed her a cheeseburger or something. What does she weight, eighty pounds? That was out of line. You? I lost sight of everything. Forgot who my friends were. Look, I'm sorry about everything. I feel like an idiot. You were right. I did fuck you. And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too. Happy Birthday, George. Mirtha invited me. It's nothing personal, George. Just business. Nice doing business with you, George. It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this? Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies. I don't think so. And I only deal with you? Goodness. Come on, George, no one is going to pay that. I don't know... You're kidding, right? That's a hundred pounds a week. It's your grass. I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you. Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment. I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops? What can I do for you guys? It's your grass. I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you. Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment. I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops? What can I do for you guys?What's that? George? You better get yourself a good lawyer this time. We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one. No fucking way.George, don't be so emotional. This is business. Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother. No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never. I did not. Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George. George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother? What? Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up. Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos? Everything is not alright. I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face! I'm driving you crazy? No. You're driving me crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream? What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle. I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me. Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough? I love you, my brother, do you know that? I'm married, George. Me. I can't believe it. Can you believe I'm married, George? Then relax. It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government. And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles. No questions. No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino. What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar. Who is going to fuck with us? George, we've got sixty-one million dollars. It's either here or someplace else. We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it. Try the closet. Try the back bedroom. Weight it. If it's sixty pounds, it's three. If it's fifty, it's two-point five. We're half a million off. It's two-point-five, George. I am sure. Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later. Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection? Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America. Life is cheap here, you know? No offense, but you know what I'm saying? George, good to see you, my brother. Touche. Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours. Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine? Bad news, George. I'm in Colombia. George. I need you to go to Miami. This is only part of the business, George. A very small part. Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you. I must go to Colombia. That's my George, always thinking. I know. A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George. What's the matter, George? Please, continue. Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery. Yes. Look around you. The sun. The water. The women. It's better than Danbury, no? Come on. I have some friends I would like you to meet. George, are we gonna do this or not? But you must. It's the only way. You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody. Ho ho ho. Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes. Slow down, George. Slow down. Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up. Congratulations, brother. I've been waiting for you. George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out? Allo? Great. I love the Bahamas. Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel. How many kilos can we fit in these planes? What type of planes do you have? Don't worry. We will talk of everything. We have the time. You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine. Now do you see what I am saying? Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions. And that's wholesale. Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand. No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo. IN Miami, we sell for sixty. George? What do you know about cocaine? You failed because you had the wrong dream. No, my brother. Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why? In my country, I am a magico. A man with a dream. A man on the rise. To take nothing and make it something, okay? I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish. That is why I am in your country. Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream. Do you have a dream, George? You like to make the boundaries disappear. It's not only the money, is it, George? The adventure is part of the victory. It's the thrill, ah? I never believed you were a murderer. I knew. I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It's in your spirit. Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape. Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer. You have your intrigues. I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne. In nine months, I am free. How much time do you have? Never mind. Not for you to worry. Nothing. Just a little project. Ah, yes. The murder. Oh, come on, George. If we are to be friends, we must trust each other. Me, too. Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good. But we are roommates, okay? And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars. For the grand theft auto. Okay? So, now it is your turn. Now you will tell me, okay? You will tell me why you are here? No? Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime? Your offense? Why are you here? If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat! This man is having a heart attack. In how long? A week? Cocaine? How much? He's in tachycardia. George, your heart is racing. Have you been using drugs?Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George. I'm sorry, George. Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher. It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent teacher, George. When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary. We must remember we have wives, friends, familia. Even familia that has not been born. But sometimes, we must forget as well. I am like you. I must teach the lesson. We want to teach the lesson. But we cannot. We must remember that life is the teacher. I see. I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad. You now know who your Brutus is. Please. Sit down. We'll drink some scotch. Diego? George, you look terrible. And Diego? Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are right. But money. Beautiful girls? Family. Power? Yes. Money. Which is what, George? Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George? People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George? I like to come up here. To make the decisions. To be one with nature. As much as I can give you? Ha ha. Very good. I like that. Come, George. Let us drive. We have much to talk about. So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George? I like you, George. You are loyal. That is good. That is rare. Maybe crazy. Yes. I can tell already. You are like me. I look at you and I see myself. It's in the eyes, no, George? But, never mind. I am thinking we can do much together. This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business. To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I don't like problems. Un rata - no good. But he could have run, fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die. The man in the garden. He was full of courage. Good. Very good. Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country. The man who gives us the airplanes. The man from America. The mafia. Chicago. Boom boom. Hollywood. You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George? So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?Yeah. Nice. Who's the cheapskate? Layaway shmayaway. I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for. Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape? That was a beautiful message. ...you sonofabitch. Putting on George's boots. That's where you belong... I'll tell her. Yeah, I know. This is it, isn't it? Money. You and your mother. All the time chasing it. I never understood it. Good. You're not going to trial? She's angry. It's all over the news. I heard. Ermine, your son is here. No, it's good. You have a family. It's good if it makes you happy. It's nice to have nice things. Are you happy, son? You're like your mother. You love money. Don't bullshit me, George. I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time. Let me tell you something, son. You would have been great at anything. I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices. You know, the police are looking for you. Not mad. Tough spot. You loved her, didn't you? You really loved her. ...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft... What are you going to do? Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family. What are you going to do? Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family.Don't be stupid, George. We've got him. We've got him dead to rights. But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more. He's going down, George. It's election year. We're not making any deals. You hear about your old friend, Diego? How are you doing, George?What plane? We going someplace? Where we headed? You have your money. It's all there. What the fuck is going on? Where do you guys want to count? Um-hmm. I don't know. He sent me. I'm George. This is a one time thing, Gusto. One and I'm out. Give me a good price for old time's sake. What do you think? Five-thousand per kilo. No. I have the space. I figured it out. This is what I want to do. No honey, I'm alright. That's impossible. We can't be up and running. Who's distributing? He what? Motherfucker works fast. What? My pleasure, Augusto. Diego has told me much about you. Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off. What? You're not going to wait for me? Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two. Baby, you didn't have to come. Promise me that we'll never be like them. I don't want to wind up like that. Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself. No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest. I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments. Are you sure you're okay? You're pale. Okay, guys, we're gonna leave. Let's get the check. You wanna split? Honey, your nose! We'll take it. Should we buy it? I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell. Yeah. I am. Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right. This is it for me. Nothing like this back home. Are you sure this guy is cool? Yeah. I am. Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right. This is it for me. Nothing like this back home. Are you sure this guy is cool? I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole. Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old. That's some fucking deal. I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here. I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen. Excuse me? Something about vengance being best served cold. No, I cam here out of my own volition. Yes, I am. Mirtha. I see. How much? Excuse me? You're a fucking amateur! It's a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen kilos. What are we doing here, Diego? This guy's a clown. He's talking about clothes. My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter? What? Yeah, sure. What details? I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs. I know. She needs to slow down. She's going to blow an O-ring. For calling you a homo. It's in the past. I'm out of the business now, so forget about it. No hard feelings. We need to move on. And besides, I'm sorry, too. I heard. Yeah. She told me. Yeah. I understand. Just business. Right. Fuck you. Not bad for a weekend's work, huh? Half a million for you. Half a million for me. One-point-three five for the Colombians. Sell it? What did I tell you? Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone? You guys are such babies. You want to go home, go. Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode. Barbara and me. No one else. Goodness is right. If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek. Fifty-fifty. That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend. In your pocket, free and clear. It's already been negotiated. It's done. The money is there waiting. Here's the best part. We can charge five-hundred a pound. Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight. The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week. Two bags per flight. Twenty-five pounds in each bag. What the fuck is that? We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop? No. We want some grass. What the fuck is that? We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop? No. We want some grass. Get me a six pack. Oh hey, one more thing? Fuck you, then. I sign nothing. I want my kid out of protective custody. Now. No fucking around. My wife and my kid on a plane tonight. I sign when they call me safe and sound. You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man. I talked to Foreal, Diego. You went behind my back and you cut me out. You fucked me, Diego. No more brothers, Diego. Derek Foreal. Derek Foreal. Derek fucking Foreal. Alright? The answer to all your dreams. Are you happy now? Derek Foreal. Estoy bien, okay? Everything is alright. There's no problem. Okay? This never happened. No one has to know anything about this. Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is. Do it now. Take it easy! Everything's okay! This is not the time, Diego. Nothing. Todo esta bien. Jesus fucking Christ, Diego. I ain't telling you. It's just business. Now, shut up. You're driving me crazy. What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it? Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate. I love you too, man. You're a lucky man, Diego. And keep only forty-percent? No thanks. Are you comfortable with this? There's no room. Where do I put this!? I don't give a shit. Close enough. Fuck it. I'm not counting it again. I'm calling it three. Three million. I counted it twice. Yeah. You do the talking. Just a friend. Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking. What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail? But to the victor belong the spoils. I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek. Just sell it, Derek. Well, you better get here fast. I'm sitting on... Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money. What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I've got a parole officer waiting for me. And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we? It is bad. It's chump change. We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border. We're getting screwed. What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit. We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic. Okay. Good to see you, Diego. I just got released five minutes ago. I can't go anywhere, Diego. I'm on parole. I can't leave the state. Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you? How are we doing? Yeah, I'm out. Diego? It's George. Diego Delgado, please? We'll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone there. I don't know. A hundred, hundred and fifty. How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami? Four passenger, single engine Cessna. Getting it here is no problem. Trust me. I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we get? Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ. Oh my G-d. That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo. I don't know, Diego. I've got a good thing going already. Everybody smokes pot. It's easy. Cocaine is a rich man's drug. It's too expensive. Because they caught me? Because I got caught. I would if I could get some sleep. Good night. I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed. What's the other one? I've got to get out of here, Diego. Twenty-six months. I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything. What kind of project? What do you got there, Diego? Murder. I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego. Not really, no. I don't want to talk about it. What? Today. I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams. Coke. Mom. Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family. It's a family heirloom. Okay, Mom. It's okay. Where's Dad? Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you? Barbara. Mexico. Surprised to see me? Yeah, layaway. Well, you know. It's um... Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good? I get it. I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay. For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up! You're saying life will take care of Diego? You know why I'm here. You know what I have to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk. I didn't come here to drink scotch. Yeah. Yeah, well... Diego is my brother. Money. Keep them coming. Sure. Yeah, maybe. Freedom. I want money. What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know. It's beautiful. Yes, sir. As much as you can give me. Yes, it is. With all respect, Padrino. Diego is my partner. I do not do business without him. Yes. Un sapo? It would be my pleasure. Actually, it was three. I meant every word of it. I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars." Love, George. That was a good one, Dad. That was really something. Remember that? And that FBI agent, Trout? When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said... Tell Mom, you know... Give it to her, Dad. It'll make her happy. Give this to Mom, will you? No. Yeah. Listen. I'm going to be going away for awhile. Hi. Yeah, Dad. I'm happy right now. Dad. So, business is going good. I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable. With my investments... I know. I'm great at what I do, Dad. I mean, I'm really great. Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me. You mad at me? Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do? Just low. May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face... I'm going to California. No, Dad. I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... I know. There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different. Something free form, you know? Something for me, and college just isn't it. I'm going to California. No, Dad. I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... I know. There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different. Something free form, you know? Something for me, and college just isn't it. No thanks, fellas. You've got the wrong fucking guy. I'm not a rat. What the fuck? Is he going to walk? What about him? What do you guys want? He's getting middled, too. And Derek's our partner. What's good for us is good for him. The set-up is wrong. We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail. We're getting middled. Holy shit, Dulli. What the hell are you doing here? George. It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? Figured what out? George. It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? Figured what out? Mirtha, how are you doing? He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do? Yeah. Is she here? Is she coming? Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. I know. Well, that's all I really wanted to say. So, okay, then. Yeah. Yeah, you will. Of course. Yeah, well. I'm working on that. I've got something going. Yeah, so I've been thinking. I love her, y'know? I kind of want to have her. I've been away for so long. Make up for the missed time, you know? You knew I was seeing Kristina, right? What do you want me to say? I'm in prison. You should know. You put me here. What? Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car. What is your fucking problem? There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya. Not in front of the kid. Please, Mirtha. I'll start working for Augusto. I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something. No, that's alright. Where are you going? Alright. But this is... No. These are her first steps. Watch her. Look, Mirtha. She's walking. Pablo said no. It's all over. And I'm never going back. I have you. We have the baby. And there's nothing else. It's just the family now. Shhh. Sleep now. Shhh, honey, never mind. It's alright. It's over. I quit the business. I'm out. Put that shit away, they're here. Jesus Christ. I like fire. What is your name? I don't know. My name is George. Why are you smiling? Do I know you? Hello. After everything. After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you. I love you. I love you so much. You've got to know that. You've got to know. I fucked up. I didn't mean to... I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. I swear on your life. I swear. On my life. That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date. There's schools in California. You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags. Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like. I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday. Thursday after school. I don't know. Maybe California. I'm thinking about getting out of town this week. You want to come with me? I'll be here. California, huh? What is it? A Disneyland thing? California? You can go anywhere in the world. India. Tibet. Australia. Paris. And you choose California? Yeah, sure, whatever. Let me ask you something. If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go? Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again. Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry. I'm going to make this right. I've got a few things going on... You can call me Dad if you want. Dad. How are you doing? Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you. No, never. Don't even think about that, it's impossible. I love your mother. And you are my heart. Could I live without my heart? Could I? I don't know. Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset. Because she's visiting me. But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow. My daughter. But I have a visitor. Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America... Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table. Yes, I do. I don't give a shit. Split it up. Have a great life. I'm done. I'm out. Starting over. Cheers. You saved my life, Dulli. You'll never fucking know. All you guys. Everyone just got a raise. Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen. Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody. Who's the co-pilot? Actually, I've got some news. That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it. What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns? I don't need a little. I need a lot. All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane. Very nice. I'll take it. Yes, I am. Are we good? Yeah, we're good. We're beautiful. We're perfect. This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit. Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance. That was it.
