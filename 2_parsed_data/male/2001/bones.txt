Well, close the fucking door by all means. But don't expect me to go down there and do it. We can't go back there. Are you crazy? You saw -- Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here. You people really don't like dogs. Yeah? Died there? How? Is it true? Alright. Yes sir. Anything you say. Then what do you care? He yours, sir? Go for it. ...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad. You think that's really him? What the hell you talking about? Maurice, man, shut the fuck up. Just some flies. Nothing. Contact paranoia. Must be buggin' from hanging with you. You didn't hear that? "Take him... " Something. "Bury him" or... Keep smokin', fool. Are you nuts? What's your problem with Crippled Dick? Bones! How baddass is zat? This is the place for us. Patrick, you get platinum props, man. Platinum. So what the hell's the good news? Or just Hell-adjacent... Climb out to where? Fine. But I'm bringing a couple of friends. Well, go find his lazy ass. I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome. Where's the gangsta of love? You sure got a way with women, bro. What happened up there? Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here. Where's the others? No. Well, yeah. Maybe just a little. Shit. Tia ain't a chick. She's family. And don't forget it. Pat's right. It'll be fun. You soundin' like the old man now. You want us to move in here? Damn. That is the ugliest building I have ever seen. Looks like a damn graveyard round here. But that's your old hood, Pops. That's some terrible shit. Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years. I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?Bones. You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him. Soon. Real soon. Big Bad Eddie Mack? Got shit for brains and that's a fack. Hey-heh... Unh-unh, little brother. I got a natural high. A supernatural high. I said, no thanks. I ain't interested. And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here. Those 'fools' are my people. But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag. What else? Money. I do alright. Everybody's happy. What it will be. Hush, baby. Where we'll always be... I want you to do something for me, baby. I've got what I want. Turn around baby, look at me. Look at your man. No. Not...not you. You I forgive. Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe. Second, it's got to have just a little give, here. At the edges. And last, but not very far from least... You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff. Don't you worry about a thing. This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight. Must be my clothes line. No? How bout my phone line? Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag. All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess. That was your mama's bag. I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise. Don't need luck tonight. I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no. Then fuck it!!! Aw that's easy. I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother? No brother. I wouldn'ta. I never done a man - any man. Let alone a brother like that. Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked. Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad? You about to find out. And the hell everybody else, right? I don't understand it. You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas. I always looked after you. You had a piece of everything I had. Time like this, is that what you really want to know? How I got the fuck in here? What it will be. Since we was just grasshoppers... I don't need to hear the deal. I don't need any partners. I don't need new product. And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face. We met. That's your dream, Homes. Not mine. I don't want to leave this street. Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me. Nothing but net? Could be a swish. Or a muthafucking air ball. They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops. Go easy on Jay Bird. I can remember when we was his age...Fuck it. Alright. Where is it? Let me see it. You got the shit? We're here. Where the hell are you?Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there. Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there. Clean your mouth, or I will. Those boys had no business messing down there. Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get. That's what? You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule. I got a Lexus. And nobody gave it to me -- Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia. That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure. You know I can't. What will it take? What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy! Wait, Jimmy. Think about it. You woulda done the same thing if you was me. I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own. How did you get in here? You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world. Sorry, my brother. Everybody just be cool. Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal. Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you? One simple word, three little letters. Yes. That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal. Big houses, legit business... Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this. Not just big. BIG. Like big business big. Big corporation big. Big government big. Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands. Nothing but net. It's all arranged for tonight. Eddie Mack's gonna be there. And Offisa Korruptsky, too. 'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun. Get back on the curb! Now! Help me. I'm so sorry. But please, help me... Please...help me... That's the past. It's dead. You were just a kid. It's...it's a bad neighborhood. As you can see now. I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out. I was trying to protect you. Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself. Bullshit! Bullshit!! You're selling it back! That's an order! No one'll ever come here. Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it. Listen to me, boy. I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in! What are we doing down here? Where are we going? You know I hate surprises. Can't be done. That place already died and gone to hell. No way man... That's it. Get out. Now! Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago. They could never connect it to us. You're right. One of my associates sold the building last month. I didn't sell it. What building? Or you didn't know what to do with it. And you? Still a pig. Just a much fatter one. Keep your hands to yourself, willya? Don't call me that. What the hell do you want?You cut him, or I shoot you. Make your choice. Nice rack. How old is -- You better hope not. Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead. That's a Bozo no-no. Jay-bird. Well, somebody bought it. That's what I heard. Don't shit a shitter. Our building. What did you call it? His 'tomb'? We had an agreement. You were supposed to sit on it. Not sell it -- Maybe so. Maybe so. But that ain't why I came to see you. You sold the building. No reason to get nasty. Yeah, I've stayed in the organization. But then again I never got the percentage you did. I been watching you. You done good. Invested wisely. Respectable businessman now. Just like you always wanted. You certainly traded up. ...the trophy wife. Nice lookin'. Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird. Now you. Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job. Fair enough for the shit. But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition. No time for eightball. I got your tip. Not your style. Is it Eddie? Killing off your customers? Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared. 12-year olds. They scare easy. Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash. Come with me. I know it. The old slaughterhouse. Hey, Sal. That little weasel we popped today? He's got something for us. I knew he would once he thought about it.Go on. It won't kill you. Just try it. Ain't no big thang. It's just a po' man's free base. Here, check it out. Yeah, but I ain't talking horse. I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more. It ain't the money - it's the high. The big fat floating 'what if?' And it's way more profitable. Nobody ever wins. So you never have to pay out. But things change. You gotta think ahead. You got a nice crib here. Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood. What it is? What it is? What it will be, muthafucka. You was just doing your job. I ain't killed nobody. Shall I rack 'em? Play a game, Lupe? No more thoughts from your asses. Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me? How many times I told you, no psycho shit. There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it. That you stole off those white boys was down here last night? Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night! Goddamnit! How many times I told you -- Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise. Then how'd you hear it, fool? You boys been hitting the pipe? Get that car the hell away from here, now! I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool. But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off. You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha? Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills. Damn. It's so...fresh. "This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond. Don't know where the deuce is parked. Boys and girls, Moms and Dads. Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones. Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio. Some flies? I think this qualifies as way more than "some." Ugh. Muchos moscos, man. This is too much. 'S up? Take who where? What you smokin'? The man said just to use my imagination. Let's see...yeah, I get it. Potential. I can see it now. The first major urban theme park. Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials. Totally E-ticket. Look around, this place is a dump! Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump. Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king. We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club. "Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool. I am the future. I am all colors. All races. All creeds. I am the melting pot. I am the tossed salad. I am post racial. Just what army do you think the Colonel was in? Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan. "Special recipe". I'm telling you. There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile. The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken. Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash. Potential toxic dump site. "This is Patrick..." "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt. Even the space cowboy can't... He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..." You haven't? Jimmy Bones? And damp, too. Let's not forget damp. Sqweeep. We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin -- "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..." Gonna be le hot shit. Pardon my Francais. Dance club. The Resurrection Brothers play there. Heard of them? Not really to live, just to play. Need any help with those bags, Ma'am? And some people need their medication tweaked.Is this Hell? Anywhere but here. We can climb out. You ain't going down there. Not alone. I'll go. Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner. Damned if I know. Yeah, we can. Least till after this weekend. He ain't going nowhere. We'll deal with it then. Maurice left. Tia's taking a bath. Yeah, there is a strange vibe here. Spooked? Let's get going. Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here. I believe in you guys. You are the real shit. And you know it. Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too. Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part. We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here -- That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time. Naw. I think it's... I dunno. Something about it just buzzes me. I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back. We gotta jump! Here! Here, find my hand. The stairs are right near here. I saw them. Let's just walk up there. Okay, okay. Listen: Bill! Bill?! My old man calls the shots. He built that gate and these damn walls. Don't worry about it. I'll stay with the boys. It's alright. If you want to go home... I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father? Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here. All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible. Cinn? And you believe her? The dead get out? Lucky thing. Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off? Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S. And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which. What else does she say? Why? Careful. That's bad luck. Anytime. Be seeing you. I manage them. Naw. But they will be. They're the best. no really, let us help. We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors. Daddy? Dad? Dead? I don't think your past is dead. It's alive. And it bites. I saw your face. You knew that place. You knew those people. Bullshit, Dad. Don't front me. For once. Just tell me the truth. I came from there, too. Why? Why did you give a shit about the building? Why did you care that we were there of all places? From what? You could have had it done. You didn't want us there. Did you do it? You'll take care of it? Not this time. No way. I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight. I thought you'd be psyched. Just trying to do what you did. Take nothing and make something out of it. Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued. A little business move I made. On my own. I think you're gonna approve. But maybe we're the ones who should be down there. Doing something. Making it better. Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor. It leaked and stained. Post-toasted's more like it. Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about? Last time I checked, you weren't black. I'm not sure what the hell you are. But I know you aren't a black man. Why not? He eats everything else. I thought you were bringing the Colonel? Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool. But I think we can do better. Why don't y'all check out the rest? I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up. Warm this place up, you'll see. It has serious potential. You gotta use your imagination. I was born near here. My dad's from here. He never mentioned it. Not that I remember. Yeah, you heard of him? Whattaya think? Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor. I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem. I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination. It's not safe down there. The fire started down there. The whole thing could collapse. But the place burned to the ground. Save him? What are you talking about? I was born near here. But after my mother died, my dad moved. I grew up out in Rossmore Park. Shit! Damn dog. We gonna have to do something about you. Evidence of what? We're all tired. Everybody makes mistakes. Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different. Ours! Moe's terms. Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.Fuckin' comedian. See you tomorrow. I'm on my way home. Can you handle it yourself? Shit, that was fast.Take my advice. Get the hell out of there. It's a bad place. Always has been. Hey, kid. How the hell should I know? Yeah. He lived there. And died there, too. Take my advice. And shoot that dog. Or let me. Hell no! Hey, watcha doing with that dog?Wh-wh-whooo? Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street. Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block. Looking to score? Don't worry. It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it. Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone. Go on, I ain't shitting you. I can't carry it in my pocket, man. And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop. You gonna have to pick it up yourself. Let me see it. Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot. Leave your car and walk over here. You got the cash? Back here. At the end of the block. We just thought... But -- We got a gift for you, Eddie. Fresh new BMW.It was just like in my head. No, Eddie. It's just that, I dunno. He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur. All I remember is the voice. It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth. That's all we did, steal their ride. We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
