And Outpost? You're happy there? Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area. If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first. My goodness. Milo? What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset. Have a seat. Milo? Give me two seconds with Lacy here? Go on in, I won't be a moment. ...It's -- Milo, isn't it? Like I said: shot in the dark. Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do. Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant....When did you know? What?! Is it your software? You're interfaced with our dish. What?! Okay. What? Will I get to work for Outpost? You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show. Well I parked illegally. See y'later? 'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck. Can you help me?You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up. Milo. Surprised he's not your guest. Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world. There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished. Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line. Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird. We could move 'em up here. 'Couldn't convince Teddy to come? Milo? I'm Danny.I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control. I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are. You see what's hanging on the wall? Oh, that's right. You're "clueless." You could've handwritten it. "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..." You left my party to send E-mail? 'Sorry about the late notice... Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet. ...Worse? What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right? Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid. 'Have a look? You look a little tired. The answer's not in the box. It's in the band. Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place. 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way. You've been coming in early. I meant did you find other stuff to -- Did you? Had you talked to him much lately? I heard what happened. It scales, don't you think? The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait. Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead? What're you implying. Right... Right. Milo. What's up? You're making me young again. Take a look at this. Slightly different approach. Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they -- How's it going? Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before? It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right? In a tree. That's what I told her. My wife. Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions. 'Think I should buy some originals? Okay. I'm Gary. Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here. But somehow got away. When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 -- You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me? The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges. Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky? I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room. It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up. There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it. Would you like a Coke or something? Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you. Just do it. 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12. Wait... He knows. Let's go. Okay, #2. Just do what I'm asking! Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate. Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me. What'd the girl say? Maybe we should all get on it. This is good. Who did it?I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their -- You don't wanna move, do you? I'm just screwed. You know what I mean. Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me. 'Gonna wait outside. They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs. You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay? ...You wanna work -- here? Your app kind of blew mine out of the water. Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style. He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means? You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years. Not that I don't miss you. I mean, it's your life. I think you should go. In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.We tried! And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood. Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy? That'd change with a criminal indictment. Outpost doesn't own em. That's gotta kill him, right?I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite. Where we going? You calling Phil and Randy? Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do. What would Milo want in here, anyway? Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time. What're we looking for? Every entry was authorized. Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?Right. Wait. A toast. ...wanna savor this. Great. Don't we have any chopsticks? ...What? You look beautiful. Great! No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you. You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I -- I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again. I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life. I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself. It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited -- Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you. Look at this. Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle. To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you... ...Different? If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened. After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary. The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when -- Remember Lyle Barton? It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back. Nothing. So you believe me? I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me. They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five. I can't just walk away! It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening. ...gotta get in there. How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know. I've gotta get in there. You think I don't know that? Go where? You can't get away from people like this. It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top. Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically. Oh Jesus. I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing. I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys. What're you -- what? What! You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting. Isn't that -- extreme? I know, I know. That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire. 'Not saying it makes sense. It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly. He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?" To our new life. ...What's wrong? You know he's never been anybody's counselor before? That took some fun out of -- When's Brian coming for the TV? You saved my life in alot of ways. C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating -- I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide. ...But? If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too. When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway. A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff. Yes sir. 'Just didn't know who else to talk to. I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis. It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they? My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley. I am. I am, sir. Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. Yes sir. I need to talk to you. Mr. Barton, do you remember me? It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something... Right... What's that mean again? You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects. He's working backwards, too. Let's do number five? Is it your dish? Gimme the coordinates? Wanna be a part of history? Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door -- What'd they ever do for you? No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost. Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life. This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner. 'Forgot to introduce you. I have a girlfriend. Sure, I'll see what I can do. You're living here? Who's that? He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything. He's pretty tight with his family. Oh hi. I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software. I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more. Gary, I -- I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties. I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons. That's great! Thanks. Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one. No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse. ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious. His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again. Sure. I'm okay. It's going well! Gary, hi. The wrong place? Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there... It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something. 'Don't know what I'd do without her. Oh. Yeah. Talk about work? Never! Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure. Were the flags for Teddy? Definitely. I'm sure. Nothing! You really wrote this just today? Well -- you sent for me. You did this -- overnight? It's okay. Really. Maybe I'm going too fast. Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden. That's insane. You're ahead of your time. ...Do I? No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself. I do! It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it? Skywire. Low enough to relay internet traffic. You know a lot about art, I guess. Oh. No thanks. Cool! You would? Wow. When would we come? 'Think he hung up. ...Hello? Cool. Got out of my other commitment. We'll come up with the next big thing. Those really weird, short lines. It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up. Just thought his work should go on. I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and -- You do? All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools. Wait a second. He knows I know. He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12. ...He knows. Let's try #2. Bring it to the other location. They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop? Meet me at the other location. At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary. She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't. He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do. We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version. But I've gotta go home for an hour. That's lame, isn't it? Perfect. How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to -- Oh. Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf? They know I broke in. Alice helped me. Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own. Thank God. Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there. I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into -- "A beautiful geek? What're the chances?" I told Teddy about you. 'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are? Why were you snooping in my office? Why were you so careless? I don't know -- Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions. Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast. You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you? It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away. We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet. What? Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN. "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em. It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in! Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for? Yeah, they dig stuff like this. "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001." He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire. Certainly not at my happy home. Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick. Do we post it on the Net? There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question. They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over. No, no. Never. Hmm? They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge." They'd frame him. I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. I know what he did to you. You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much. It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there. You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. I snuck into #21. She saved my life. So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now? Why's that? You're compulsive. Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code? "There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. Is it like that with your counselor? No. Please. Cool! Show me. What've you got there? Did I say something? Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something. Me too! Were you an Army brat or something? ...Were you? I'm getting a teacher's pet rep. You know mine. Lisa. I didn't plan this. What does that mean? What d'you mean? No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful. I don't know. I met this girl. Jesus, Teddy. What?! Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff. Wanted to say goodbye to him... Is that how Larry feels? ...You got my E-mail? Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites. What're they building? I've got a girlfriend, remember? She's a programmer? His Snapples were in alphabetical order. So -- how far are we from the campus?He wasn't acting? Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo. That'll be a test, won't it? Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you? 'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department? Gary? What? Longitude 109 -- Ready for number three? Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes -- Gary, don't worry, we -- Hasn't affected his work, though. There may be a little less trust after your outburst. 'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac. You don't look anything like a three- year-old. Did you download Corey? In San Jose? Speaking of which... There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site. We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.Damn. 'Have to go back over there. Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door. Yeah, yeah. Maybe he'll get back to work. Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem? We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in? Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now. Where is he? You're not listening. That kid's the great white hope. There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual. What is it?You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested. #21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in. Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost. Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. You'll be working with her. Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody. Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big... 'Guess he needs to micro-manage something. So how'd you like the house? Oh we're not going to the campus.Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit! Come with me. I'm calling Gary. They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later. Let's get him in here. Any irregularity in the pattern. Keep looking. Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa. I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it. Let's run a printout on card entries. Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused? Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place. We're too late. Take a look. Who're these guys? I could get it out of him. Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I -- Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one. I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place. A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances? Did you tell Alice? What? Come on. Is it serious? I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet? Milo? They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers. But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week. We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms. Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five! Uh. Not exactly. And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
