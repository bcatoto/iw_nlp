Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body. No, I won't let you do it. Ha! Right bitch! Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?... Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash. Wife?! Ah, they just don't know you the way I do. Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend? Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all. That's it. Me, too. 101? Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy. Hey, Brenda. My favorite memory was when we -- Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you -- Oh... I guess I'll die now. And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.I don't care. You pick. Yeah. Can I borrow five bucks? Hey, wanna' share a soda? That's what your man is supposed to do. Hey, look out, a bee! Let's get a hot dog. You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love... I don't want to be your friend like this anymore. Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level. Look, what I'm trying to say -- Listen to me I -- I know, but I've been thinking -- Cindy, about this whole friendship thing... There's something I really want to share with you. Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die. Cindy, let me... Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend. Better try a little higher. No. Keep rubbing. No. Try a little higher. What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold. Shit! Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked. Huh? Great!!! I was thinking the same thing. Yes... Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking... Yeah, I think I'm bleeding. Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand? Let's get outta here. Where the hell are we? Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart... Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny. Whoa, check this out. She looks like you. Dude, somebody's on the rag. Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part. Sure. We can practice talking. It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh? Then what kinda stuff can we do? Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend. Open chest!!! Sure, that would be cool. Friends. Maybe we can study together or something. So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together. I meant you're into ghosts. So, I see you're really into spooks. Hey, you left your book back there.Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there. Nobody wants to go. Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform. We have to destroy him. Quick, everyone to the lab. What the hell are you doing? I don't need your help. The keys. She took the keys. I can do it myself. Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug. The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere. I think we should consider cutting the experiment short. Professor, we need to talk. What the hell?! I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded. The image there. No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out. Professor, I think you should see this. My God! Is she dead? Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders. Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there. That one. Yes, I thought that it would be best. Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances. Would you please focus? Professor! I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe. In about fifteen minutes. And what happens when all hell breaks loose? How are we going to get them all up there? They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre. That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met. Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this. As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration. I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top. Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for. Here you go, Professor. I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable. They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them. I finished all the interviews. Alright. Come on, you guys. Oh, I couldn't do that. That's right. Just a little Rogaine. And sexy. You do. Well, there's a lot riding on this project. Just a little experiment. Hi. That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate. Yours, or the turkeys? Thanks, handyman. I guess so. Alright, go to the belt store... Okay, give me my belt. A little bit... Give me your belt. Alright... I might need your help. What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine. I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs. It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy. How is she? I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before... Uh... I'm Father McFeely No, I'm fine. My holy water. What she said about your mother? Oh shit, you gonna take that? No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass. Remember, don't ask her too many questions. Then let us prepare. Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there. Did you bring my bag? Soon. First, I must bless this house. Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.Yes!!!! Now you'll be mine, Cindy. Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn. Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress. Made you say it! Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop." Um, I'm not touching anything. Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain. No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff. Thanks. I made them by hand. I'm Hanson the caretaker. Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you. I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two? Who's first? Anyone like a wing? I'm the caretaker, not the handyman. Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something. Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly. This part removes the sense of humor. Shorty, why don't you say grace? Yo son, check this out. Now you're being rude, Shorty. Sit down and join us, Cindy.Father, I think you should rest. No thanks. What? Because she will lie? Yes. Father, are you okay? Would you like to see the girl? Father.He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish. No, he lost the house after the stock market crash. No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth. This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora. Saw who?! Who? I don't like this, this... I take it you're not mad at me. Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you? Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss. Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment. No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together. Theo, did you see the animal? That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here. It's some kind of energy field. We better record this. Alright, Cindy, what's so important? I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story. Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated. Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do. Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves. That's why we came here, remember? What? What is it, Dwight? It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room. Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun. Are you sure it's not the tape? What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What? No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs. Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs? Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years. I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly. After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything. So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up? Even in the bathroom? Are those cameras all throughout the house? Fine. What's all this stuff? Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw. Right. What about condoms? Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone. We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation? I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders. Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House. Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids? What's this? Willing? I like that. And, this one? Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean. Ooh, I like her. Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing. Any of them hot? Are these all the subjects? Let me help you. Let me see the files.Okay. I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back. He's right. I should go first. Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around. Yeah, me too. You sure? So, I guess I can go now. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Shhh... It's okay. Hello Brenda. Yeah, I broke my fall. I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago. What's your location? I repeat, what's your location? This is Ray. What's up? Where are you? Yeah, they're so warm and soft. Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on. It's the sequel. It's okay. You mean to tell me we're dead! You're not wearing a belt. I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt. My help? You never could feel your legs. Second best. Don't worry, I got your back. Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys. Yo' Tommy, what up, man? "Fucked me." "Fucked me." "Fucked me." Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too. What does it say? I woke up naked, too.That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid. Hey, y'all! What's going on? That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine? I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy. Uh, uh. I told you it would taste just like chicken. Hey, I got an idea. Aww, the little bird died. Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later. Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together. Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn! Now you gotta learn the correct slang. Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this. Gear. You know, clothing. Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear. Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college? I don't know, but I sure hope so. I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage... Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God -- Sorry, y'all. My bad. Dog, you look hot. Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson. Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.Would you die already?! Never happened! Okay... maybe that would be best. Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day. That means more screen time for us. Let her go, Cin. So, whatever happened to her? Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me. No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone. Come on. We better get you cleaned up. Are you okay? She's right. We should stick together. What if I wanted to borrow those keys? You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate. Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it? Of course. So sexy. That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart. The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is. Work, work, work. Is that all that you do? What are you working on? Hello Dwight.Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me. I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man. "Ray!" "Ray!" Aww. Cool. Dude. Get out?! What does it say? It says, "Ray." Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
