Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him! I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture. Can I see your back? Your father put cigarettes out on you? Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness? Back in the Czech Republic? Your mother was blind? Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like. I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here. This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me. But it's... I would say...half. Half is fair. Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing. Don't worry about him. Think about yourself. Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia. Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that. ...delusions and paranoia. Oh, sure. I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check. I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him. I'm coming with you. Don't say anything. Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for? I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.Yeah, sure. Beep me when you're ready for the press conference. Oh yeah...? Alright. Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions. Oh. There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial. How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield. Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine. Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?! The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King! Okay. But not water sports. Oh really. That's nice. You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot? Are you out of your fucking mind?? Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?! A shower!? Did you take one, too? What do you mean, 'cleaned up?' I came to see how the investigation was going. I called and you're not here. I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!! I beep you - you don't return my call. Where the hell have you been?! Then why didn't you talk to the reporter? Who did cause and origin? Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that? Did the D.A. videotape her deposition? You do that, wiseguy. Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does. What was that, Korfin? Don't you guys understand? It's all about image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth? A cop? Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you. Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you? Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you. Go on. C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people? I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us. Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours. It was my decision, not his. I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers. Are you hit? The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera. Don't look - put her in the car. Stay this side. C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful. Only one guys checked in? It's okay. Any I.D.? Where is she? A timer. Tomorrow. At lunch. I'm gonna propose. What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk. Who knows? But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later. That's me. Vodka tonic. He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly! Describe him. What are you saying? Did you tell him you did? Do you have any Czech girls working for you? We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel. Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up. Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions. You know, I don't know. I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him. How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer. That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that. You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it. Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional. No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead. Just a shower? Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me. Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs. Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left. You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building? So am I. My point exactly. What would your girlfriend think of that? You wanna talk to her alone? She's fucked. Even if that story is true. Something back home? Is that all there is? What are you hiding? Why are you afraid Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first. Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about? So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back. You thirsty? Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's. Better than one. Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come. I'll let you know what happens. This has nothing to do with your fire. You got any better ideas? Stay here. You're Polish? This isn't homicide school. There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do. Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary? What would you call her? Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile. Pretty. You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal. Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me? Good. Good. Commendable. Nah, why should you? Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit. Watch the news? No, what is it? No, we don't mind. You mind Leon? You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you? If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck. Then do it, asshole. What's your accomplishment. What do you want? Don't be late. See you later. Good luck. Yeah, yeah. Good thing. Yeah. I promise. Tonight. Patronizing you... Nay, I love you. I promise. We'll talk. You'll be great. You'll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me. I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk. No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great. Well, that's great. That's good. Answer it. Answer the phone. Could be Leon's. You're ruthless. You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not. Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was... I'm not. Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out? Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh... I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you! Hey. Alright. Alright? Yeah. Now's not a good time. Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously. He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine. I really can't give out any information right now at this point. I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of. We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know. You know you can't do that. C'mon. There are two bodies found at this point. We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done. Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time. Yeah, yeah. Jesus. Keep them out of my way. I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me. Yeah. And he still went to the party. He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle. Not what. Who. How old are your kids? I'm not moody. Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore. So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go. I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off....so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... I'm abused. Don't you think? Out on my back when I was a small boy. That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me. Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out? Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness... Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me. My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind. Give me another one, please. What else do you need? Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don't try to negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or no. No. No way. What's your cut? How much? What about my movie rights? Book rights? No, he is here. Shit... What about Oleg? I was all of these. You bring the cigarettes? Yes. Yes, come with me! Where are we going? He has the camera! He took the movie! Oh no! No! Shit! Here. I have your money. Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane. Smarter than Americans. You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me. So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now? So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time. Good - be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want to die like hero. I kill someone famous. Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books. So...who's Nicky? No. Are you proposing? Dog food. You stuff sausage in it. I am butcher. Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk about surrendering. If you don't want my film - I'll call another show. And they will show it. We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars. No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you. Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film. If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her. Tell him to put his gun down! The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you. C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls. You can't kill me. You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life. My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend. Give me the address!! Listen to me. I don't want sex. Just give me the address and then you go. I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address? Where is escort service? I ordered a Czech girl. Daphne, you know her? Where's Czech girl? He doesn't speak English. Two weeks. We are both from Prague. Is there a problem? Yes. I have five-hundred dollars. Two weeks holiday. Yes sir. Yes. Both. Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview? Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights? Who is he? Traitor!! You think you are a director? You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit. And I hate you. I fucking hate you. You got that? Yes. But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit. Credit? Your idea? I thought it was my idea. Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director? I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape! Bad last moment - I cut it out. Shut up. Look! The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael. Oleg, don't be paranoid. You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you? I gave you half of what they gave me. Look - here we are! Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera! No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? Oh - I got it. Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice. We come out free, rich and famous! Sit down! What does it look like? It's an address book! Put the camera down, Oleg. And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry. The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it. Don't want to film this? Shut up. Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up! Get in the bathroom! I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl? How you erase this? Speak English! Turn that fucking thing off! Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs. For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so. Unless you refuse, Oleg. Turn that off! Get the bags. We have no money. Come on. Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school! Now speak Czech or English. And don't fool around anymore. You almost got us thrown out! Don't speak Russian! Did you hear what I said? Don't fool around. Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth. You spent all the money while I was in prison? Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!? A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work! As a plumber?! A job? Ha. Ha. Milos. Get my money! You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money? Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding. Surprise! Surprise!Any chance we can do that again? Okay. You ready? Ready? You're worried for my safety. I'm touched. That's unique. So what's unique? My kids? Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9. Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid! How old are you? Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole... It's all true! Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit. Now -- I get it. Am I right, Leon? I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie. Sooner or later that's everybody. Jesus Christ. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? It doesn't work that way. I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me. Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you. Viewer discretion advised! I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy! I can't talk business. Hang up. Have a drink. Get her a whiskey. What are you doing here? If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend! This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him. Paulie, you've got kids, right? In love? With who? Isn't he a little moody? That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage. I'm trying to tell you. Well, he... I know.I'd like to speak for himself, okay? How long are you planning to stay? No, you're travelling together. I want to talk to you together. Hi, how are you? Can I take a look at your documents? Are you related? Please join us. Come on forward. Is he with you? Are you travelling together? Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area! How much money are you carrying with you? What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? Next. Could I see your documents, please? Excuse me? Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies? What are you coming here to do? Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York? Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here? Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?Daphne, I... ...Do you really want me to forget about you? What are you doing? I'll make some for us. Do you have coffee? You better get packed. I'm glad I met you. A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one. If I was your boyfriend, I might be. Is he your boyfriend? I still can't believe Eddie's gone. They're not gonna send you right back. I know. I'm just trying to find out who you are. So you were never a prostitute? What about back home? Did you ever turn tricks before? You considered becoming a prostitute? Yeah. This way. The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires. I can't take you to my place. Divorced. They won't until this is over. If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation. Alright. That's a justifiable homicide. But Chief? Over this?? End my career? Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian. What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot. Chief - mind if I take her? No! Nothing happened. I let her take a shower. Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up. Hey, Chief, what are you doing here? 'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it. Who do you think, Chief?! Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that? But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her. I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent. Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but... I took her there for a shower and that's it. Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her. Hey. I'm a professional. You know what I'm saying here. C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently. I'm serious here. I don't have a girlfriend. Yeah. Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her. Raw deal. Why not? She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her. I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid. Of course. I'm on duty. I'm on my way with Eddie. Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be there already. Two heads. I'll call it... tails. This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over. But what if it does? You might need my help. Mind if I ride along with you? You goin' to the escort service? My folks are. My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle. I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something. I'll come with you. Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally. Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell. Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows? Who says she's a suspect? Hmmmm. The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here. If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report? Did you get a report from the M.E.? I don't even watch TV. Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff. Nah, I musta missed it. It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want. Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor? You know what that is, right? Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin' to do. Let her go! Let her go!! Where's your partner? Get down on your knees. You'll be my first. Tommy, take a walk. Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment? He's yours but I take him in! I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in. He's my collar! No way! He's mine! Evidence. Of a homicide. And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them. So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up? Thanks. Appreciate it. Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this. Now get outta here. You okay? I'll send a cop back for you. Oh yeah? Guess again. Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy? Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!! Yeah? What kind? How did you start the fire this time? What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter. They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment! Get outta here! Not good. Lay down. Stay down, Bobby. Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?! If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway. You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene. How long they been livin' here? Maybe you can be his stand-in. Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him. There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us. She looked scared. Oh shit! Oh no! That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us. He knew all along. The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run. Don't blow your nose! Mouth's clean, too. Could you put out the cigar? Part of the job is picking up scents. Oh yeah, why? You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious? I heard. Who the hell let them up there? GET OUTTA HERE NOW!! GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!! DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!! Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy. Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off. Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?Yeah. Yeah. He finished awhile ago. I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media. Yeah, right. What the hell happened? How was it? It hurts. Aw, Jesus! Aren't you tired? You hear that question, Garcia? -- From Czechoslovakia? And how long have they been livin' in your building? Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'. Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don't know who your girl is. Yeah? What? What?? You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it. But you knew that, right? Clean? Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie. 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now! Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here. I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph? Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time! No. I'm okay. Stay with her. Yeah. Sorry...PD only. Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case. Takin' a bath. What's he looking for? You ready? When? It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid. Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell? Coffee for me, I gotta slow down. Don't give me that fucking shit. You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself. And you, you'll pay for what you did! Yeah? Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love. Well, he killed my partner! We're takin' him. Don't argue! I'll take him. What was that? Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight. That's what it looks like to me. No. Go ahead.Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you. I used an accelerant. Yeah, I'm religious. I'm not an Atheist like you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?We started over, you can too. It's easy to learn. Yes, the money is good. I can get you a job. Look at the way we live. I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?! We spent it! Take your eyes off her, Oleg! Look. It wasn't my fault you two were caught. It's his fault. Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?! I wasn't going to wait!!! Did you hurt her? Emil???!A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights! Hey. C'mon, you can't leave me like this. Some freak'll come by and stab me! Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns. Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money? Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action! No, I don't get that! Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul. I'm serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit. Because I am the director. Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now. Be quiet. Watch. This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' And 'action!' I'm serious. In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me? You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we? Cut! Good idea! This way. Hold it this way. Good. Let me get a shot of it. What is that? Why not? I did. What is it? Oh, shit. I hate looking at that! Does it hurt? Gotta light the scene better. Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN. Whatever we do - we fuck her, right? Whore? I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera! You said speak Czech! I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer. What? Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog. Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision. Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies! I want to document my trip to America. Okay. Okay. Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white. I'm here for movies. A cheap hotel. New York. I speak English. Yes...he's my friend.But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes? And isn't there a movie in the works about you? Permanently disrupted? Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist? You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people? Your doctor?Are you married?
