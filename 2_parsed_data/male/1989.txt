Now. No! I won't have you running around in the middle of the night. You're coming home. Alice! No, I'm not. I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again. Since my little girl became a mom... Alice... Sobering... I'm so sorry, honey... You sure you don't want a ride to work? Where are we going? It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip. No. A deal's a deal. I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...There you go. Love you. You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember... You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream. About him? He'll show up. C'mon, what's really wrong? Okay, babe. What's the matter? They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris. It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon! Sorry, babe. Hi, beautiful.He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people. It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me. He's inside you, where he hides. Mommy...? My friend, with the funny hand. No you're not. You don't even care about being a mom. How come you don't think about me? She doesn't want me around No... Been having bad dreams. I could tell you were sad. I just wanted to see if you were all right. I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed. It's lonely in there, in my room. Hey...wake up.She killed herself. Her soul's gonna be in torment. No shit. Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh? They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business. That's what the newspapers thought. She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought. That's their problem. Then we'll find another way. I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger Whoa, slow down. How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet? What, you named it already? Who's Jacob? Tell me some more about this Krueger guy. Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit. Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her? Then get out! I thought about that. I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else? Yeah. I'm just aces. I've got to write some of this down. Well we gotta do something! Greta, come on. One burger with me? I think I'm starting to wear her down. Have some anyway. Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that. Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should. He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes. That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place. Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom! My undying love. Have some. Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses? He invited me to his house last night. Stick around, please? I'm not finished - I loved Greta. A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it! Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?! Faint. Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help? Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language. Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on. ... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him. I don't think he'd feel it. Maybe we should bail? Getting very weird. This the right place? This should be it... First decent idea you've had. ... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side. Nick, we can't just -- Hey, when in Rome -- I didn't know. You didn't take, did you...? You hear things. I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me. Nick, have I been a good partner? Nick... You up? Where is the subway station, please. Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York. You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla. I call, right? I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days. You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene. They say we got to turn around and come right back. That's what they say. I got a plan. What are you missing? Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia. ... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere. What are you doing? Maybe we should do something? The Wolf? What? I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him. Who do you think the Jap is? What are they doing now? Whoa, I knew you were going to say that. I absolutely anticipated that, Nick. But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him -- ... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's -- Nick, let's go hunting. Bag Cavello. I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater. Why? Back-up. Let go... So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust? Wait up. You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window -- Hey, hey, where you goin'? ... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine. I think you did great. Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs. I think she got to you, pappy. Hey, all right. What does Ichiro mean, anyway? You all right? You okay? You cool, Ich? What'd she say? Pussy, ass, soft personnel.What does Charlie mean? Cool? That I should let you pay for the drinks. Kampai. Joyce can be nice. Squid? How can you be so sure? Think we'll get him, Nick? Louder, pal, louder. Yes... Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla. You know, Nick, we can't lose. Luck. I'm sorry. Thank you. You have one? Someone attacked him. I don't know. I couldn't tell. I followed them. An hour from the train station. I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting. I like him waiting. Kampai. I can't... No. Nick, you can't do this. No... For Sugai. Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you. Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick. No. I won't put myself in danger for you anymore. It's illegal, Nick. It's very small. He'll never speak to a Gaiijin. What...? Why? A resort city, Beppu. Nick! San is an honorable title. Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san. ... A Godfather. His man was killed at the printing plant. Nick -- I'm not drunk... You can trust me. I'll check it out. You can't come in. They don't want -- You were too far behind. Yakuza. Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue -- Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki -- Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous... Nick... Sure. You toler -- yes, tolerate me. There she is! Nick... You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.' Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days. He might not even be in Tokyo. He says they're very nice. He wants to know if you have anymore. We can ask someone I used to work with. A criminal. Someone I pay money to... I stole them. I've continued working on the case! I'll get him for you, Nick. You must leave? I couldn't keep up. My shame is complete. It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we... ... keep something of their's. A tie, a pen. They made you leave your hotel... ... you caused a disturbance. I don't, that's all. I don't deserve Ohashi's respect. It's Ichiro. Ich. Nick! ... We got to keep looking. Track him down! Great balls of fire! No, this is the place for the young Yakuza. "Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire." To the killer. Jerry Lee Lewis. The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's. And call me Ich. Where would you look for the mafia?Then take it from him. Don't be. This is my stop. She's such a long way home for you. I like your friend, Joyce. You're lucky. You are a lucky man. Where you come from a man can stand out. It's expected. Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out. Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules. Looking in. Always afraid. Ugly little lives... Keep the change.Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket... He couldn't find his ass with both hands. It's incredible. Hit him or something. I'd feel better if we had some heat. I hope not. You said that in the last two places. Let's grab some food. I said let's go, Charlie. Let's go. In Rome, I'll bow. Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun. The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad. I was new, didn't know shit. When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor. It's on the top of my personnel file. They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way. I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie. Go to sleep, Charlie. Number five with a bullet. No. What'd you say? Not a prayer. Beats forty hours on a plane. I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas. Saving your life. Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm. Some party. Frank Abolofia. Charlie, don't do anything. Promise me? Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know? Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked. -- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up. -- I should tear your head off. Charlie... It's not regulation. And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat. Get rid of it. What's this? He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City. Casinos. -- Cavello. Ronnie Cavello. Home. Thanks. You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor. And don't call me 'pappy.' Are you expecting anyone? Give me a break, would you? High spirits, desire, commitment. Connie... Short shift? We can't lose. Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you? Call for help. You all right? Why's that? What's that for? Me too. A wife. She left. Now we've got nothing to negotiate with. We need the plate to negotiate with. Joyce? How many men? I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me. You did great, Ichiro. Just one, compadre... Kampai. Start it. Not now, man, okay, not now. Work with me. Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside. It's done. You don't have to come. Let's go. Him first. So I bring some cheese? What's in the box? It's a new deal. ... coming with me tomorrow? Big enough. I'll be a nice Gaiijin. Because he knows how to get to our man. I want to go talk to him. Where does this Sugai live? A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him. Ich, my name is Nick. Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick. I want to yank Kobo. Shut-up. We're through. I mean it. This is the end of the line, Matsumoto. If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend -- Gaiijin. She disappeared... shit! Good. Very good... Smells like Bayonne at low tide. Ichiro -- Four goddamn days. This is going nowhere... If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside. You're doing fine, Ich. Now drop it, okay? Are we getting married? Did I say that? What'd I tell you? No. Don't say anything. Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize! Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night. What's he saying? A snitch? Know her? How'd you get this? I can see that. Yeah... Why weren't you at the platform? What happened? Why the hell not? You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever. Leave the rice cake outside and go home! Give us a break... What's the problem here? That's what you said in the last three piss pots. Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's. Let's book, Charlie. If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night. Where're you going, Ichiro? Where do we start looking for this guy? I'd like that. Might be different in New York. Can't make you change your mind? What if I chant? Why would you care? No one's keeping him here. We're in? Tell them I'm not. Who am I supposed to be? I don't remember you saying no. Not if it works. I'll meet you at the train? What do you chant? Where's the wife? He drinks. You could fake it. It's my last shot. I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night. I need someone to translate for me. Unavailable. I need your help, Joyce. You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying. He's on duty. Sure, but then I just pull out the photos. Maybe I'm a quicker learner. You have a helluva way of answering. You can count on the truth from people who don't like you. I could use some help. Show me around. I'll pay you for your time. Gaiijin? There was a change in plans. Don't give him any more. Sugai won't give it to me, you know that. I'm amused. Time, I've got plenty of. Guess I'm on a roll. Save it, I already took the tour. I'm taking you back. Right. He killed a police officer. I planned on catching him, Captain. He was my partner. Why me? What...? What if I say no? What? Why? Yeah. Not in that company. This by this... I have to get to Sugai. If anything happens to her while I'm here -- For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help. Let me out of here! Hey...! HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR! While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch. What's this? Can we skip the poetry, inspector? Because I want you to tell me. Could you fill me in? Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this. Work with me. I want your best detective. We're police officers. I want a gun. Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents. After a court convicts him. He belongs to me. That wasn't our deal. Good. I don't have to. If I say no? With these? You trust me? Why tell me this? The Feds would be onto you in a month. The families who control the casinos? I want him. I'm impressed. But let's use the short form. I'm looking for --Goodbye, officer. -- Do you know where she is, detective? Do you know how to find her? Even where to start? We will find them. You had my help, detective. Your plane leaves at six. Two officers will escort you. Twenty-four hours, detective. Look. Your visa has expired. Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported. The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here. Why don't you ask your chief detective? Do you know what this is? You're foreigners. It is not allowed. You lost a man we wanted for some time. It was very incompetent on your part, officer.... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds. They'll be all over Abolofia's place. Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time. Your plane's at nine a.m. Be on it. That's orders. Period. How? You don't know the place. You don't know the language. Get on the plane. They're blaming it on you. Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner! It's not your job. They said send a detective if I could spare one. I can always spare you. Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan. It's a nice, safe country. You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight. He's wanted in Japan. They want him first. Then we can have him. Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers. The Japanese embassy is very interested. Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective. One guy do all the damage? The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer. Hotel room and rental car were full of it. Dope? How big a package we talking about?But, Aud... I... I came to find someone... No... no... There is something I must ask the Gods... Not quite... The second note to wake the Gods... Yes -- I believe you do. I... but I... Of course. I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this! That's right! And thanks for the Cloak Invisible! Goodbye, Aud... No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him. I'll bring it back. Where's the Cloak Invisible? Just give me a hand. Halfdan the Black. We mustn't let him land! And the week before that? Five this week; how many the week before? And I thought you said it was something special... "The fifth one this week"! I've never been to bed with anybody! You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you? We never went to bed together. Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well... It was different... HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else? You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else? What... you mean "got into bed with" them? Yes. What? What's the matter? These? What are THESE? They're swords. What are what? How d'you KNOW we're "friends"? WELCOME? WHAT did you say? We blew the Horn Resounding. But... How is it you can see me? You can all see me? But -- LOKI! Where did YOU come from? And will the dead ever return, Freya? I will go and wake them up! Is there nothing men can do? Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue... The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is. It is day, of course, Freya. I see the world. I shouldn't have come. But it IS! Look! Yes... oh, yes... Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big. You don't know Halfdan the Black. He wants to kill US! Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder! He's trying to stop us waking the Gods. They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow! You've got to let me go! Yes? The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf. Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword... No. No, no... It was very... er, nice. No. Really. Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing. Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us. No... no... We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we? I'm sure it's lovely. Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is... Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and -- That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're... Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing. How? No... we don't... I don't know! I just did! Odin! Is THAT Odin? Well... no... I'll ask the Gods to give you life again! Why? I've come to take you back to the land of the living. Tell me your name? Why should you care? You told them I raped you -- why? I didn't mean to! Oh, thanks. Louder. Scream. I just said I didn't feel like raping you. Oh! Stop talking as if we were married! To pay for the next expedition, of course. Oh well -- you've GOT to do them. Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all. About NOT raping you... I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone. I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all? I don't suppose... no... No. It isn't rape then, is it? No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people... Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em. Sh! Shut up. Yes. Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast. It's not magic! It's just a trick! But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn! I know! You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed? What's wrong with making friends? No. How deep IS the ocean? It saved my father! I know. Snorri! Get your oar out! Come on, move it! He was lucky... Sit there. What? "But" what? Find it... AND cross it! I... I... KILLED her... She got me thinking... I met this girl... Where does it all get us, Grandpa? We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet... What's it all about? Faster! Slower! In... Out... Slower! Nobody can row at that speed! Row! Row! Row! Well, you ARE! Look out! You'll see! What "magic"? Look, the sky is blue... ROW! Shut up. You there. You there and you there. What are YOU doing here? But you're the Gods! Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed. Because... you're... you're the Gods.... Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time. You must help us. You'll be sucked down too! No! Let go, Snorri! Oh... I feel a little... oh... To the oars! Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men. Well, come on! Row! That's better. That's true. You'd better sit there. You there, and Ornulf there. Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there... Now stop it! No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods. Right. Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent... Oh... right! Well... CHEERS everybody! What's the matter with them? Oh... er... yes... Nobody gets killed. There is another way. What are you talking about? So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! How about making friends? And you, Keitel Blacksmith. What do you think? What's the matter with Bjorn? Keitel Blacksmith? I have to go... Sven! We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard... Is THIS Hy-Brasil? She MUST have a knife or something... ROW! We haven't got a spare place. Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING? It doesn't matter WHERE you sit! Hey, you two! What's going on? I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try. We'd be the first! What's the matter? Are you afraid to try? What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge? And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?No, don't say anything else! I think we should go... Just say something cheerful. You need to say a bit more than that! Who gets killed?That's my boy! So? What'd you do to her? It's always the women that start the trouble. Who have you been talking to? You talking piffle, son? What? We're missing all the fun...Well, where is he then? Vanish into thin air? How did he do that? Nothing... I just immerse you in water... It can't do you any HARM... What's all the panic about? Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick." You know, my son, our lord said... No, it is NOT. Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian. Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert... I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.Make your mind up. Sorry! Sorry. I want to die... No, I don't! He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway. Oh! Who cares? We're HOME! That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory. That's it! Bastard. Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL. I know. I know. How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick? No, I'm not.Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge! What is it? Well, what else do we do? But... But how could he know... unless... Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place. Wait, Erik! For your own sake... For the others... I... I'm not worth risking your life for. Let me go, Sven. Aaagh! Get away, Snorri. What? It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... I... I... It's not my business any more! Made by YOU, Loki! Like you got rid of Snorri! We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt! No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you! She knows it was our fault! Help! You'll drown us bo... Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot! Relax! YOU do it! How can we stops him now? Well... I... I thought... Together we stand! The Blacksmith's Code says I must... My brother blacksmiths! The bottom falls out of the sword business! They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky... Can't make enough axe-heads! Can't make enough swords! Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says... Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you... It's all right! It isn't happening! But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her... She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day. I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic... Ah! So you admit there IS someone! Well... where is he? Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course! Right! Where is he? Open up! I know you're in there! Open up! I know you're in there! The important thing is not to panic. Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning. Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing. You DO know how to play the horn, don't you? Is there something the matter with it? I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand. Not when we explain about the Great Blessing. Don't talk nonsense. Why? It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well... Careful! They're not supposed to hurt you. I'll tell you what... YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing... Well, how d'you think I feel? They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die! Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it? We're just not a very musical nation... Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM" And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to? REALLY? You're just saying that. But you don't want to hear it. A lot of people like our singing. You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you? What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing? Would you like us to sing to you? Well... isn't it great? Well... for a start... er... there's no killing... The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky. You will wait? Bye... sorry...SHE blew the Horn Resounding. How do we know this is the way? What d'you mean? It was my master Keitel's idea. Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans. By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business... I should have got rid of you long ago! You fool! You've lost your mind. Keep your mouth shut, Keitel! Shut up! Help! Help! I'm drowning! Help! I can't swim! I can't swim! You'll be able to throw it further than I could. Sh! Hurry! Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods? Wasn't it, Keitel? You can't let Erik do THAT. Honour and protect all blacksmiths. That's right. It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths. The Age of Ragnarok ends... But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods.. If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us. Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"... You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it. You could charge him what you like. Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.Look... Erik... Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other. So? Why should WE care? We don't HAVE to help anybody.No! Arrgh! I've got you! Weren't we supposed to? A magic dishcloth. Like fish. First we're flying -- now we're sinking! Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat? Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other. Now you've got all the big ones on one side. You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time. Trust me to get the missionary. It's SO nice to feel wanted. Thank you VERY much indeed. You mean we'd be dead? I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord. Your lord. Same thing, isn't it? There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER. You're wasting your time. You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard. What have you got there? What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith? Oh... Who's that? Well! Come on!I came to find my grandfather. Let me do something for myself for a change! Over the Edge of the World. Hy-Brasil? She hasn't got any. DEATH! I AM one, Dad! I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time. Yes it does! We could be at sea for months. Look, I bagged it last week. I was sitting there. But HOW? Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard. Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik. What are you talking about, Erik? I will join my grandfather there. Hang on... I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too... What are you talking about? Got you! Dad! Easy, Dad! There is nothing we can do... GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad! I'm just building up to it, Dad. Well, of course he is! DEATH TO DRAGONS! KILL! KILL! I must KILL! Kill! We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill! I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES! I must only let the red rage... But it's a responsibility... So did your father... You went berserk... I know, Dad. Tell him I'm coming! You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla! Thorfinn! You can't die! Shut up. Well... I'm game. Neither am I. You liar!What did he say? What "magic" have you brought, Erik? I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight. It's magic. The sun! That's it! SHUT UP! Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif. You may need a real Berserk. He hasn't. Do what? What do we have to do? The Dragon... I hate you! I hate you! And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"... He drove me mad! Helpless... Well, go on! Go berserk! There! THAT'S a true Berserk. Sh! HOLD it! HOLD it in! Stop it! It's no good going berserk against a dragon! Not now, Sven... You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle. But it's a responsibility being a Berserk. So did my father and his father before him. I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald... I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair... It's a tradition.Don't you FEEL it? I know. I know. He wants to KILL us. Halfdan the Black's here! That's terrible! You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends". Let's hack her to pieces. Very deep... usually... Erik! Row! What are you doing? It's Halfdan the Black! What are you talking about? Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night. But... FIND the Rainbow Bridge? Mum! Dad! Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that! And a sort of slightly sick feeling? Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach? He used to puke in his sleep. Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke. I mean many of the greatest sailors were. You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know. Are you all right? No... he's not... not... there... I'm not frightened... of anything... Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla. Me too. Well I'M certainly not, either. He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age! I never do... Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad. No, Mother. Yes, Mum. Yes, Mother.Okay, that's no problem. Didn't I do it? That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett. Hiya, Oscar. What do you say, slugger? Okay, okay. It's not my job, but what the hell. I'll do you a favor. He takes the grocery bags from her. I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a building superintendent.Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other. Think about it. I know. Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son. There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god. I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment. And perhaps a car and free parking. Time is running out, Dana. Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's. Well, mainly Vigo's. But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship. Not in this case, my dear. Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo! I don't believe we have the luxury of choice. No harm will come to the child. You might even say it's a privilege. He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo. And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world. Doesn't that sound nice? Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? Okay, just thought I'd check. Good night, Dana. Sleep well. Don't let the bedbugs bite you. Do you need anything? You want me to come in? Hello, Dana. I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay? Is the baby all right? Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that. Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do. Do I have bad breath or something? We'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I could take you to lunch today? You know, you are really doing very good work here. I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations. You pitiful, miserable creatures! You dare to challenge the power of darkness? Don't you realize what you are dealing with? He's Vigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to him. So you see, everything is in order, is it not? It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things -- The Upper West Side. Then why have you come? Dr. Venkman? Dana is not here. My pleasure. We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman. It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition. It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian. He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century. Pleasure to meet you. I've seen you on television. Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong. I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman? I await the word of Vigo. -- the sorrow -- Yes, the scourge -- Command me, lord.You've got to stop them. Please! They're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them for murder. They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48. Now they want to kill me. You've got to do something! Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt. That's it? That's all you have to say? Get on with it, counselor! Yes. Sustained. Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case? The witness is leading him. Sustained.Oh, yeah, sure -- no. But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum. You're right. We should stay. Should we go? Tonight? Okay. So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right. I can finish this later if you're tired. So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them. Oh, sure, that sounds great. Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home? No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds. Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt. I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out. I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster. Oh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. It was an accident. Ghostbusters. Don't worry. We're not moving. He is. What is it, honey? Did I forget something? Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the -- audience. I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds. Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody. I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me. Thank you. Can I have some of your water? Your honor, may I approach the bench? Do I? Okay, let me rephrase that question. Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children? I let them handle all the little stuff. I just come in on the big ones. Hey! Wait! Okay, I'll meet you there. This is my cousin Sherman. Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters. I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out. I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back. It's just a scared little baby, Sherm. I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she? I got you out of those bad tax shelters. Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you. Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor. Come on, Sherm. You're my cousin. Do this for me. I'm begging you.This is not just some money-making scheme! I didn't just make up the date. I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve. I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.So what are you saying? That the world of the supernatural is your special province? I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman. Why were you digging the hole? And please remember that you're under oath. So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street. Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster. Hi, it's really great to meet you guys. I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that -- Then you should go to the police. I don't believe in any of that stuff. Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year. Forget it, Louis. I could get in a lot of trouble. You were the one who got me in. Like what? I'm a dermatologist. I can't write orders on the psych ward. I can't do it, Louis. It isn't ethical. I could lose my license.I won't. Certainly. No. Not that I can recall. Venkman? I think he was borderline for a while there. Then he crossed the border. Occasionally Oh no. We'll do the happiness index next. I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you. I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field. It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters. I'm not saying you did. In science we always look for the simplest explanation. They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland. It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country. I'm worried. The vibrations could shake her to pieces. We should have padded her feet. It's working. The positive GeV's are climbing. This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop. You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters. Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population. It's a rough translation from the Moldavian. "Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --" You were supposed to help me with this. That's a thousand million electron volts. I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street. I'd like to have a stool specimen I think they're more interested in my epididymis. Hello, Venkman. Don't shoot! You'll hit Ray! Something good -- We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol -- It won't work. There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell. If you two are looking for a fight, you got one. Who wants it first? Come on, Ray. Try me, sucker. Nine feet -- ten -- Six feet -- seven -- eight -- No, not exactly a man of the people. "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy." I'm Egon -- It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source. His nickname is "The Hammer." What's the reading? The New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an experimental subway system. Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870. Why don't we try the Giga-meter? Good idea. This one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground. Three hundred eyewitnesses. Who was that? Late Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or Brunelleschi. And it's all flowing toward the museum. No, the slime is rising. There's definitely something going on in that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red. We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.Sorry! I think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's something brewing under the street. Is this the spot? No problem. Always glad to help -- and hug. Do it! Just do it! Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us -- I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you. But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg. We just have to mobilize it. Butt out, you pencil-necked geek. I've had it with you. That's it. It's on the bottom. This guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy. Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window. I'll be back." And we're the ... Hey, I didn't imagine it. There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there. Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh? This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole. Nothing. Not a trace. You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis. Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come up with anything? What's your story, Pete? My great-grandparents were Swiss. I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived. Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island. Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey. My Fault! I don't think they make Nikes in her size. I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th. I hope we have enough stuff to do the job. Forget it. The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff. It looks like a giant Jello mold. It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually. You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible! Okay, but you're missing all the fun. We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow. We thought you might want to come along. What happened? I'll get one more reading. Nothing. Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub. But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned. I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen. Listen to this: Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things -- We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction. Like a goat on garbage. This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance! Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states. No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state. Oh good, you're here. Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you. If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect. I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon. Careful, Winston. He's a mean one. And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan. I'm Ray -- Okay, let's heat 'em up! Hey, hey, hey, stresshound! Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble. The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting. Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts. It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything was going on it's totally subdued now. Dana! Dana Barrett! Aaah! Nobody! I can't tell you! Who? Just -- someone we know. Oh, just checking something for an old friend. Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something. I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's up? How's it going? Oh, hiya, Pete. Groovy. I've never felt better in my life. She's moving! Don't you see? It's the slime. That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil. Oh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead and try it. Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line. Yeah, I guess so. It was the strangest thing. I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop. This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all. Whew! Sorry, boys. Well don't think! Are you telling me how to drive? No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for a second there. Let's go. What? Yeah. Huh? What? Now if you don't want to be the -- -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear." And he didn't die of old age either. He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered. It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson. Yeah, but what a ride. You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow. Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae. After all we did for this city. Come on, Winston. We can't quit now. The holidays are coming up. It's our best season. Then let's do it. Ready?So what? It's a free country. Thanks, Lib. Same difference. Finally came to your senses, huh? Don't worry. Janine has a very special way with children. Let me jingle you right now. Thank you. If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century. I'm not even good for me. All right, you want to be real? So tell me why did you dump me? Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe? So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions? I have a hamper? Next time ask me first, okay. I have more than two grades of laundry. There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty. Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here? Janine Melnitz, are you kidding? Do I have a vase? I brought some of your clothes. Wear something intriguing. I brought along some interesting possibilities. It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's one of my most valuable employees. Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a babysitter and everything. Trust me, you need it. Are you all squeaky clean now? I'll put him down for you. You are way too short! And your belly-button sticks out! You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother! Or we could do that. For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me. If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night. Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free. In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here. Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things. Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right. They're here now ... Right ... Let me know. We'll take care of that. Ray, Pete. Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid. This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it. I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub. You better stay here. Who could blame him? Were you wearing this nightgown? You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts. But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised. No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in. Are we having a pajama party? I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here. I'll call you. Later, Johnny! I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy. Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room. You know what it needs? A fluffy little white kitten in the corner. As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case. You're really good, you know. So this is what you do, huh? Thanks. I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet. Don't worry about me. I'm like a cat. You are personally responsible. If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing? Okay, let's take a look. Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it? There's our old cash machine. And the dry cleaners we used to go to. And the old video store. We really had some good times, didn't we? I'll supervise. Unusual? I don't know. I haven't had a lot of experience with babies. Oscar! You poor kid! There's no doubt about it. He's got his father's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly. And smelly. You stink! It's just horrible. You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled. What's his name? I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional. Men are very sensitive, you know. We need to feel loved and desired, too. He ditched you. You should've married me, you know. So what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe. I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot. Let's go to work, boys. You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show? No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard. Anyway, we're just about out of time. Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets. Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ... ... Good night. Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn? Valentine's Day. That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine? Oh, you think so? Well, I've got news for you. You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid. Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants. And that's just round one. Now you're talking. Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you? The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too. No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about. We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you. I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just want to say hello to him. Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest. Oh, Johnny. Did you back the wrong horse. Not. Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back. I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory. If she says it looked at her, it looked at her. Hey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking to you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you. This is the one that looked at Dana. You know, I never got to ask you. Where you from, Johnny? We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list. Your name was first. I know. I'll let you get back to it. Nice meeting you. Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you. Too bad for the Moldavians. How are you? What's that you're working on, Johnny? These boys aren't playing around. Maybe they just want to appeal. Who are they? Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist. Well, for your sake, I hope you're right. But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind? This year? That's cutting it a little close, isn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right? So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year. And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe. Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book? Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund. Milt, your new book is called The End of the World. Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease. Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it? No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it. I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway. That's where we come in. Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice. Yes, I did. We were city champs. Ostrov? I've been there. Good party town. From where -- Neptune? Pretty impressive, huh? So far so good. They love you, Lib. Keep it up. Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay? Roach breeding? Sounds better and better. Dana? The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime. Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge. Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead? That's it? "I'll be back?" A hundred and five years? He really hung on, didn't he. You need the exercise. I knew that. Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard. What now, Brainiac? Yeah, you would. Is that for personal or professional reasons? I don't even want to know where that is. How've you been? How's teaching? I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh? Egon! Me? I'm a little of everything. Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around. And that's what made this country great. Oh, right, you told me that. They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall. How about you, Winston? I think she looks pretty good here, don't you? The whole city's together on this one. We took a vote. Everybody's down on you, you know. She's new in town. We're almost there, Lib. Step on it. Are you kidding? We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th. I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth. Trust me, I used to drive a cab. Only one way to find out. Ready, Teddy? Good effort. Now what? Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray? I hate Jello. Yeah, sorry I missed it. I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here. It's really kind of a coat and tie place. I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys. Let me know what you find out. Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations. Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler? You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license. Beautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish up and get out of here. Did you find anything at Dana's? You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you? What kind of tests? 'Mood slime.' We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it. This is what you do with your spare time? And now you're going to eat it? It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it? You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes? Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy? I'm Peter -- Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are. Relax. We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile. I love this. We're onto something really big. I can smell it, Ray. We're going to make some headlines with this one. What's that? Well, Holmes, what do you think? Who, Ray? Who? Who? Who? Oh, Ray -- Who? Great. So what are you guys working on? Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub? So, no goat hooves, huh? Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request. Miss Blue Blood? Her family's been here since the year 12. It's okay. I have my Senior Lifesaving card. If she's naked under that toga. She's French, you know. Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it? And pure -- It better not start yet. I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch. I don't think he's ready for the toaster. So we'll put a warning on the label. I don't care what you say. This could be a major Christmas gift item.So be it. On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me. The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year. Bring me the child that I might live again. I command you. -- the sorrow of Moldavia -- I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia -- On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood. What was will be, what is will be no more. Now is the season of evil. Find me a child that I might live again. I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.There's something very familiar about this painting. Rivers of the stuff! Is the line sinking? I'd put my money on that Vigo character. You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'? Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man? I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty. Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk. What are we doing? Ray, I was ready to kill you. You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out. Nice going, Ray! What were you trying to do -- drown me? Are you all right? No, I just thought -- Are you all right? You coming down with something? You finished here? Now that's one ugly dude. You got a flux and a half. I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there. Does it have any favorites? Yeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise. Give it up, Ray. You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore. In a year these kids won't even remember who we are. That's it, Ray. I've had it. No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds. I'm ready. My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man. And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either. What are you, Dana? How deep does it get? That water's cold and I can't swim. Wonder what? And decent. You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true? Tell him about the toaster. Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.May we go home now, please? Did you say...? Uh, uh... Yes. Yes. My reputation precedes me. Oh, what?... your servant, sir. Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh... Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies? Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour. Oh, Sallah! What a relief! Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly! What about you? Yes. Now we know. Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city. Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map. It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm... Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean. Look, Indy. The Roman numerals! Where? It looks like a converted church. Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him? I'll tell him we'll take two. But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith. The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly. What is it? It's today's mail. And it's been opened. What has the old fool got himself into now? Yes. My treat. Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection. All your life. You've got it! Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way! Haaa! No, Henry. Try not to talk. Look what you did! But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword. Henry, the pen -- Henry! What are you doing here?! Arghhh! Oh! You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend. I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit... Oh, well. That's good. Thank you. Schneider? Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse. Tapestries? Are you expected?Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind. Care to wet your whistle, Marcus? I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal. Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you. We're through! You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right. Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo. The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me. Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history? Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones? We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared. We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail. You could be more right than you know. This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would. This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete. Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy. As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away. Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones. Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact. Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway. Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail! Every man's dream. Including your father's, I believe. Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail. Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to! The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea. My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper. Can you translate the inscription? That was our assessment as well. Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. Have a look over here. This might interest you. My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.Got lost in his own museum, huh? The Name of God... The Word of God... It's war. What? It's a rescue, old boy. Come on. Marcus! After you, Junior. Ready. We named the dog Indiana. What did you find, Junior? Me?... Illumination. Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize. Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!! But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I". Penitent. Penitent... The penitent man. The penitent... "Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass." Junior... You call this archaeology? Now, who are all these people? What do you think you're doing?! Get down! This is intolerable! It's a new experience for me. Those people are trying to kill us! Nice landing. More or less. Son, I'm sorry. They got us. What happens at eleven o'clock? I didn't know you could fly a plane. I don't know. We'll find out. Then what are you complaining about? Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges. "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth." Very well. I'm here now. You left just when you were becoming interesting. Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance. Actually, I was a wonderful father. And do I detect a rebuke? Hmmm... What did we talk about? Ships that pass in the night... Well, I'm as human as the next man. You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience. When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment. Good. What did you get? Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her. That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me? Marcus would agree with me. Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail. I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember. Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm. Three devices of such lethal cunning. Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge. There is more in the Diary than just the map. My Diary's in Berlin. You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin! Stop! Stop! Stop! What about the boat? We're not going on the boat? ...the solution presents itself. This is intolerable! Oh. What? What? What? And the chair. The floor's on fire! See?! I ought to tell you something. Feels like a cigarette lighter. What am I looking for? You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear! So did I. She talks in her sleep. Umh? Don't worry. He won't. Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?? Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? So it wouldn't fall into their hands!! I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers. You did!! You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you? They want my diary. Rats? If only I could have been with you. ...you did it. Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior... And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...? He was actually there? You saw him? I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard? Through the library? Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it. Good point. Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them. Thank God! I'll never forgive myself -- Oh, it breaks the heart. But what are you doing here? It is you Junior! Junior! Then wait -- count to twenty. Out!It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God. I'm going after Dad. Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun. Alexandretta. Now we know. The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon." But where exactly? How's the head? Dad was onto something here! Marcus -- I've seen this window before. That doesn't look much like a library. I don't know. Maybe he'll know us. Ah, Venice... Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now. Do you believe the Grail actually exists? Do you believe, Marcus? It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me? Venice, Italy! Dad? I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head! Your treat. All my life! You know how long I've been looking for that?! Marcus! I did it! How dare he?! Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries? Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries. I'm through! Shooting me won't get you anywhere. As what? A Nazi stooge like you? DONOVAN! You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father? Yes? That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet. I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think. What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing. An old man's dream. The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before. "Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever." Where did this come from? Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think. I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive. Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you. Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here. Elsa! Elsa, don't move! I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up. All I have to do is squeeze. Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think? My father didn't want it incinerated. Where is it? I want it. So it did. This one. I think he's in here. Don't know. Think of something. What do you know about this place? No. You like the way I do things. Knock it off. You're not mad. At least I let you tag along. Uh-huh. This. Mine, too. I said don't go between them! I said go around! Don't wander off. He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them! It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet. It must be one of these... Pretty sure. The Ark of the Covenant. Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades. Except he's lost, and I'm not. Bingo. My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves. Tomorrow I'll steal you another. It would make me very happy. I usually don't either. Fraulein -- will you permit me? Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy! And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you. Yes? Yes, sir! Haaa! Uh-huh. Ready? I like Indiana. Junior?! Dad... What did you find, Dad? I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad. "J". The penitent man is humble... The penitent man is humble before God. The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man... Dad?! Get out of there, Dad! Dad? Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation. Dad, we're well out of range. This could be close. It happens to me all the time. I know, Dad! Thanks. Dad, are we hit?! Dad -- eleven o'clock!! Fly... yes. Land... no. What does that mean? Well... I can't think of anything. Dad, how can you? What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years. When? A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that. We didn't talk. We never talked. Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake. I was the next man. That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather! Relax. I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany. This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom. Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ! What about Marcus? Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den? But what are they? Can't you remember? Booby traps? What final challenge? All right Dad -- tell me. You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map. Brody's this way. What? Come on, Dad. Come on! Dad! I'm out, Dad! Head for the fireplace! Dad! Dad! Dad! All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do. What??? Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here. Try and burn through the ropes. My lucky charm. Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum! Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do! Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better. How did you she was a Nazi? She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi? No! Don't Shoot! I came here to save you. Will you take it easy! Look, can we discuss this later? Well, uh... Yeah? Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad? There were rats, Dad. No, Dad. You did. Forty years. Alexandretta. It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy. Well, what was left of him. Found it. Right. I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs. Dad, they come in through the doors. No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here. Don't worry -- I'm fine. And the head. You hit me, Dad! I came to get you! What do you think? Don't call me that, please. No, Dad. You listen to me -- It's important! Dad! I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean? That was seven hundred years ago. Who are you? Where's my father? Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count? No camels! I don't need camels. I'm going after those horses. Come on -- come on! What happened to Marcus, Sallah? I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father. And why were you trying to kill me? Who are you? All right! Where's my father This is your last chance. Then we'll die. Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me! My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too? Why are you trying to kill us?In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours? The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe. My name is Kazim. If you let me go, I will tell you where he is. No, Doctor Jones. It's yours! My soul is prepared. How's yours? If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die. No. Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me. You're strangely dressed... for a knight. A long time to wait. The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it. I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.The dog!? You are named after the dog... Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Run! Papers, sir. Got it here. There is no museum in Iskenderun. And I am his. Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going? You are on your own? Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy? They have them. In the belly of that steel beast. Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody -- But, Indy -- I'll take the camels. That car belonged to my brother-in- law. Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them. Get that camel out of the way!Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but-- They do it to honor the dead, Ellen. Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it? It's a place where the dead speak, Missy. Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is? Ayuh. Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite. You'll see soon enough, hon. And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed. Who might you be, little Miss? Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to-- No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you. Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah! Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance. No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night. Jud Crandall. I live just across the road. Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better. And because the dead walked. I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on. Ayuh--it's a mess, all right. --but I think the thought has crossed your mind. You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis. Louis-- Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago? Nope. He's your cat now. Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis? Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on. Out of the mouths of babes, Louis. Rachel not feeling well? Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong. A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die. She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie. Why, then, things should be fine. Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis? Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back. Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you... They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground. I guess it wouldn't hurt. Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself. Wouldn't wash? Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis! I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception. No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight. Because it's right. Don't worry about that. Your cairn. Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage. You want to rest a bit before you start? I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right? The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat. This was their burying ground, Louis. This time I mean it. Almost there, Louis. Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God. And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear. There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis. Ayuh. Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp. You'll see before long. Let's go. No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right? Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself. No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure. The place we're going is on the other side of that. We're still not where we're going. What say, Louis? Then come on. Does she love the cat? It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to. No need to apologize. Seems like you told me about a promise you made-- Going to tell Ellie? You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary? Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she? I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered. Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's. Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days? Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy. No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis? Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle. Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there... the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure. Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute! Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile. Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands. You folks ready to go on? That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there. I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes. One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis. Allman Brothers. Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself. Good for you. You need a glass? Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.I swear. I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you. Ellie-- Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz. I'm sure you're not. Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right? Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow? Oh, faith's a little more than just believing. I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that. Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard. I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children-- But don't you dare say that. Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear. What's up, sugar? Huh? Ellie? What's wrong? That's enough, Ellen. I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen. I know. Yes. Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left. Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland? Good God! Where'd you hear that? Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time. Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey... And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot. For a little while. Have you got a death-wish, Ellen? No-I guess not. Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee. Yes. I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud? Because something called a wendigo soured the ground. Shit! Look at this mess! I'm thinking about going to bed. Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just-- No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie. It's Ellie's cat. My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits." This babe has said enough. Well...a touch of the flu... What? A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown. Yes. You and this old Indian rag-man-- Wendigo? Can I have another one? No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it? I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But... What did we do, Jud? But-- Jud, why am I doing all this? Doesn't look like they last long. What are those for? No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin. I guess so...but... Why? For God's sake, why? Whose burying ground? You keep saying that. It's funny, all right. You're telling me. Is there quicksand? Yes. Where are we going, Jud? I'm not climbing that. We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks! What do you mean? Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one? Yes, but-- But-- Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back. Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know? I don't know. Bagged cat. What a mess. Yes. Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty. It's Church. Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus. For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about? My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed. I think it is so, Ellie. I can hardly read these. Not yet...how much further is it? Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies? Sure. What's at the end of it? The one that goes into the woods--sure. Nice. What? What were you listening to? God, that's fine. Not at all. Well, maybe I---- Hey--they actually found the place! Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard. I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong. You don't understand-- Leave me alone! Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in-- I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I-- I'm sure. I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy. You better get going, hon. You're doing fine. Yes, I guess I do. That's forgotten. I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised-- Good d-- Getting there. Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her. Well, honey...you know that... And Church will be fine. I just said-- According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks. Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you? She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid. I think it's rather extraordinary. My God! Did you see his shirt? Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and--- I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow. The movers-- Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed. Jesus, the road! And Buckaroo Banzai. Let her go. It's cool.There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs. Why? I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too. Do you feel there is more progress to be made? Do you want to leave therapy? That you are under no obligation to me? You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time? It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible? Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas. Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy? I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to? What brought this on? Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him? Did you find him attractive? Is he still at your house? The friend of John's that was staying at your house. Did you confront John about the visitor? No, I haven't. Radon leakage? So it was recently that you tried this. I take it you've never masturbated? Did you masturbate? Did you do anything? Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched. Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him? When did you begin having this feeling? This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John? But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework. What upsets you about that? Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things? If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over. Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem. Ann, do you see a pattern here? Do you have any idea what triggered this concern? No, I didn't. Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?I'm okay. It's okay. No. No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works... God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see. And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again. And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way. Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know? Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of. All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear? I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting -- I can't tell you like this. Because. Don't do that. All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember. As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything. I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it. I don't know. Possibly. Yes. Not entirely. I don't know. Possibly. No. Yes. I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else. Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to -- I've told you. I can't. Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now? That's very flattering. I... I can't answer that precisely. I'm not in love with you. I'm not planning on it. You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia. No, you're not. Interesting analogy. And you feel the same way with John? Subtlety? If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited? Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him? How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy? Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me. I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions. Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly. The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering". No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem. Her name was Elizabeth. Yes. That's correct. Can't. If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all. No. No. Yes. I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you. About me? About who? So you do fantasize? You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to. Why? Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about? Do you want me to stop? Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about. At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John? Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband? Did you have sex before you were married? Absolutely not. It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband? Does he go down on you? Yes. Do you talk to him? You are married, correct? Tell me your name. Tell me your name. It won't. Are you ready? I have money. Load a new tape, turn the camera on. That's a good question. I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind. Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here. Do you think that's such a good idea? It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this. But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you. Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall. She said it on her tape. Yes. I know. I know. Maybe you want to go. I'm sorry this came up. No, not to me, for me, for the camera. Mostly. Sometimes they do things. Yes. Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of. Everything about sex. Yes. The... interviews are about sex, Ann. Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me. No. Yes. Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men. Not really. Donna was a girl I knew in Florida. Donna? Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal. It's a personal project I'm working on. Videotapes. Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe. Nothing I can't finish later. Ann. Hello. That's correct. Bit of a dilemma, isn't it? Basically, yes. Well, I wasn't always impotent. Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory. You had sex with you therapist? I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately. Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible... You're in therapy? They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse. Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what? I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen. Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes. Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent. Impotent. Agreed. Do you want me to? Why is that? Do you want them? So what about kids? I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love. It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same. I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with. Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention. Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they? How do you mean? No. Lawyers. Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being. I don't know. Sister older or younger? This food is excellent. I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally. Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike. I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out. Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place. Nine years. Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things. Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned. Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes. Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile. What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know. No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married? Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible. I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger? Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings. Are you uncomfortable with my appearance? Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now. Curious. Yes. Have you ever been on television? Yes. Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here. Oh, no problem. It can wait. False alarm. Graham Dalton. Ann? No. I'm sorry. I can't do it. Cynthia, I don't know. I would. No. Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice. I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer. No. You'll have to get somebody else. I never do more than one. I'm sorry. No. Okay. Hello. Is that what he tells you? Different. Yes. Yes. If you wish. You're not wearing any underwear. Then what happened? What did he say? What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like? Were you disappointed? What did you think? Did it look like you expected? Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort? How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis? Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward? Your first sexual experience. Describe for me your first sexual experience. I am now recording. Tell me your name. Just a moment. Whichever you prefer. No. That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes. Yes. I turn on the camera. You start talking. Absolutely not. They are for my private use only. Yes. That's all. I just want to ask you questions. Nothing. Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences. Talking. Why don't you let me tape you? Not exactly. What do you get? Spooked. Nope. I think the man is a liar. I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me. How did you find me? She didn't give you my address? She didn't tell you why she was upset? And are you here to berate me for making her that way? No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset. I just want to know why you're here. She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here? The extrovert. Do I know you? Who are you? How about for five hundred? Will you lease month-to-month? No. You said three-fifty? It'll just be me. You're hesitating. I think that means you have. Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband? I'm not going to give you my keys. My keys? No. No. No. God, you need help. She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her? John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property. What tapes? Hi, John. Or go someplace in a hurry. I like having the car, the car is important. I wish I didn't have to live someplace. She held up very well. Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon. I'm sorry. Am I prying again? You have family here also? A bonfire, probably. Everybody has a past.God damn you!! You bitch. I knew it. You son of a bitch!! Bastard... Goddam right. Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes? You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't. Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!! Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him. Where did you go when you left here? Why? What? Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened? Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia. Isn't therapy helping at all? Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit. I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so... I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that. Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling." Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition. I'm not either!! I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair. For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one. Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on. There's nothing to know, Ann. No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation. Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody? Something wrong? I ate by myself. Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know. Yes. I just got busy. Tuesday. I had a late lunch. Mmmmm... Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere. Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here? That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade. I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated. Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk. God, you... you're mean. I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him. Graham. Did he put you up to this? Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something... Look, are we going to do it or not? By definition you're lying to Ann, too. It hurts that you would say that to me. What do you mean? You trust him. You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere. It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes? I just... Ann is very... It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about. I wish you hadn't done that. You told Ann about this? Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean... Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something? Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk? What if this tape gets into the wrong hands? Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat. That you... you don't even know the guy. It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it. Do you want me to stop calling? Nothing wrong with trying. She's there? What's she doing there? Cynthia. John. Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling. When? John Millaney. You know what I mean. Oh. Well, when, then? Cynthia. John. In here!! Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour. You're intrigued? Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way. Maybe. No, I mean doing it at my house. Could be risky. Who said I was jealous? I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time. I wish you'd quit that bartending job. Right. I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days. I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting. I've got to get back to the office. Shut up!!! Answer him, goddammit!! Goddamit... Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!! Give me your keys. Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes. I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes. I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes. What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that? So is my wife, asshole!! You know which tapes! Where are they? Where are the tapes, Graham? Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry. Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key. What do you mean? Really. How'd it go? You were prying before? Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out. What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing? Yes? Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck. Jesus, what's takin' this guy? John Millaney. Brian Kirkland, please. All right, jesus. Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client. Yeah.Not for three-fifty. Plus first and last month deposit. Student? Plenty of room for two people.Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me. Mr. Millaney? One moment. May I ask who's calling? IBM.Absolutely not. No more than seven percent. It most certainly is. No it is not, Mr. Dowd. Absolutely. Correct. True.Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live. That-a-boy. Hospital. Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die? And one good guy. He was your snitch. I know about Esparza. From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it? An hour after you picked it up! In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong! Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error? Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it? Or this -- is this a significant difference? You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun? And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun? The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true? Where's the nearest hospital? Let go of my hair. I have to talk to your brother. I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard. I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it... Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper. I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's -- Objection. Your Honor, that's not fair -- ! -- With objection! Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial! Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right? What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- ! Dowd. Eddie Dowd. "We"? Look, I'm a lawyer and -- Do you see a toilet here you think is really me? I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties. Not necessarily... We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!" No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment? Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment. Clyde, you wait here. Glenn, got a minute? No further questions. Ah. How can you remember that? You can't remember that -- ! Oh really? Come now. Did you see the gun? No. No... Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...! Not at all -- Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider? A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes? Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place? How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue? Least we'd already be at the Morgue. Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right! They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu. I've seen this picture before. You phoned up Art Esparza's wife? What's Art Esparza? -- Roger -- ? I've got a meeting in Chinatown. I'm not that desperate. That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work. You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look -- Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent. That's why I hate experts. But what? ...What do you mean? You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex. Nice. -- What? Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you? Eddie Dowd. A fucking wheelchair? George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy. Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool. Next exit. So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...! There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony! They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse. His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird. Saving it for the Sunday Times. "Have to"? No... "Cecil Stipe." Find it. That DD-5. "Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name? A Complaint Follow-Up form. When did you start working for the goddam D.A.? Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker. I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement. Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in. Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit. We're taking the other case. With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog. -- Remember? -- The Nazi he knifed? Chinatown street gang. Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em... Ten years is a long time. Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty. So go take your job on Wall Street. I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map -- I specialize, Roger... Damn right I'm right. ...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...! I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary. We have a full caseload, Rog. And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you. Pardon... Which dialect do you speak? Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both? You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs? Screw you too, Kitty. I don't need sleep! EXACTLY! Nothing has. But that's all changing. You do. Got any booze in the house? I haven't paid you. I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work. The Joe Boys in 1980...! -- Find him? I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works! A fucking wheelchair? Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe... But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses! I lied. I embroidered. I embellished. Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits... Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use. Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty. Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans? Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder. Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others... It hasn't been that long. Murder witness. For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything. By trusting me. Shit, man... Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too? I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs? Quite a bit you didn't tell me. ...I'm dying out there. "No," what? Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot. You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it! No. You tell me, Shu. What went down? -- About what? Afraid of what? But why? But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face? An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face. ...Okay... Exactly what happened then? Want to tell me what went down here? That's right. Mr. Rabin has no right to -- Thank you, Mr. Stipe. Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up? ...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer? You left your telephone number? When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us? Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested? Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination. Oh come on, Cecil. See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers. 'lo, Cecil. No? Then what did he say? I hope so, Mr. Reynard. Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation? I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant? -- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation. And who was Arturo Esparza? The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case. And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard? Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high? Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold? I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least. -- alleged crime -- The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- ! -- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with! Your Honor, that's trial by ambush! To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests? You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches? Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment? Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses? Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean? That's big of you, Bob. But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court. You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu. I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial. That's right. Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems... What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal. Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere? I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard. I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and -- It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment. This and that. Shu Kai Kim. Edward T. Dowd.Shut your sewer mouth! Let's snuff this lowlife! If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now. "Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister -- I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers. -- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other. I noticed. You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.Haven't heard that one before, Ed. But I guess I'll be hearing it again. Can't I take a simple piss without -- What about entrapment? I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants. Neither. -- Me? Neither. ...For ten years, now.-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd? Well then, does the defense have any witnesses? Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning? The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine? Sustained. Complain to the Bar Commission. So noted. I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi. Sustained.Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold... Shu's the only one I know of... Soldado. That's right. ...A soldado, he takes care of it. Cigarettes, candy bars... PCP, crack... A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments... I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment. Yeah, we do some of that. I would tend to plead the Fifth. Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically. A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons. Five years. I would tend to plead the Fifth.No. I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd. You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk. I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact. I don't think I know that name. In those days, they often worked as a team. Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell. Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation. If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation." Yes, Mr. Dowd. -- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor? -- in a context. Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime -- The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here! The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand! We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and -- Objection. Badgering. Calls for speculation. Argumentative. Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification. I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed. No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case. But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant. You're pissing me off again, Ed. We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking? I see: He'd walk out next month. You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away? Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer. Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here? Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings... Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red. Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me. Let's not drag the Constitution into this. My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd. You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout. We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt. So what've you been up to since then? Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name? Don Reynard. You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin? And why was an exception made? Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang? Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania? By "takes care of," you mean "kills". If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution? "Materiel"? What do you mean by that? And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do? "Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth. What is your rank within La Compania? Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade? For control of the prison drug trade? And its purpose? Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"? Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?... An hour. That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town. ...Jesus! "The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .! Christ... Shu is innocent. -- What? I followed her from the courthouse. I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...! Eddie -- it's Art Esparza! Let's get a cab. I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing. But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand... You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend! I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns! -- Eddie... Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it! I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin! Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but... So what're we gonna do? Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex. 1530 Rivington Street. Roger Baron. A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report... Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and... His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin. I feel much better now. -- Yeah? I didn't ask for a closing argument. -- You found his mugshot? Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa. Do you have to do that? What, the lunatic who -- -- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man." Eddie... What's a DD-5? Eddie... I don't know about this... ...Are you sure we want that? -- Easy as that, huh? You really think that's what happened? What other case? I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case. ...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense? At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone. Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman. Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"? Where? Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie. Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little -- -- a speed manufacturer -- -- an angel dust dealer -- It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer -- Right. You're right. Of course. Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area. It's an awesome responsibility. Shouldn't one of us...? -- Every word. I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two. -- Eddie told you? -- Roger -- Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead. Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case? ...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done? I followed you here from court. What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon? I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd. The phone company was broken up. CIA? I think what Eddie wants to say is -- Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond? -- How could I help you? It was self-defense. When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know. It's okay, Eddie. No. I don't know shit, man! Goddammit -- How can I tell you what I don't know! You tell me, man. About Chinatown. What went down. I don't know. The truth, maybe. Maybe... because someone's afraid. I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't. "Painted"? I killed the motherfucker. Racist asshole came at me. Figures. My mother find you?I'd l-like to answer the question. No, s-sir. Y-yes, sir. I always t-tell the truth. That's why I'm here. They g-got the wrong g-guy. I did two tours in 'Nam... Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency. See-cil. And you b-believe that. Telephone. I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and -- No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese. That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy. You're a l-lawyer? I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...You done impressing yourself, ace? Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!! It was alright for a while, you know. But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago. We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests. If you were married you got a state-room. Otherwise it was bunks. There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months. I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers. So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together. Where're you? This ain't no drill, slick. Make me proud. Goddamnit! D'you tell him we need it right now? Nice shot, Lins. Forget it, Sonny. They're gone. Yeah, yeah... yeah. It's turning. How you guys doing? We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security. Now you know exactly as much as I do. So just get your gear off and get up to control. There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes. Thanks. How you feeling, big guy? Okay, Jammer. No problem. You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights. We'll stay in voice contact. Just hold onto the rope. Five more minutes. Okay? I'm taking you back out. Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just breathe easy. Hey, you okay? Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes. Okay so far. Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig. Kirkhill? That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole. Hey, Perry! Hello, Mrs. Brigman. Who then? 'Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel. Hi, lady. Oh God, Lins... I-- It is insane. WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!?? What's the plan? FUCK LOGIC!! Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up-- Don't argue, goddamnit, just-- Alright, put this on. Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time. Look at this... Time I get back you'll be-- I know! I know! But we better come up with something. I don't know how! Okay... okay. We gotta get you out of here. Son of a bitch! Can't get to it. Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools? Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this. Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us. We better get this flooding stopped. Good hundred yards, I'd say. Wonderful. There's some light from somewhere... Try again. It's flooding like a son of the bitch. You totaled it, huh? Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek. Can we negotiate later? There's Big Geek. Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh? Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side. He's jammed the mechanism. Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water. I think it likes you. Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command. He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis. And he's got a nuclear weapon. So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while? Chill out, Lindsey!! Lindsey! Wait a second-- How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'? No. God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around. Look. I'm just trying to hold this situation together. I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria-- Jesus, Lindsey-- If you say so. It could be anything. Hey, Lins... I'm glad your here. The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours. What about O-2? Need some help? What's the scoop, ace? Hippy, just relax. You're making the women nervous. What do you think he saw? His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator. Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me... But you think it's something else. What? One of ours? Fine. Be that way. Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or anything? I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh. What happened? So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW. You still seeing him? Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit. I don't know. Divorce ain't final. Forgot to take it off. Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me. No, I think you were. Come on, admit it. I think you were worried about me. You wanna know what I think? Wow, you're right! Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves. Coulda been a disaster. I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down. Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb. Who else? You never did like being called that, did you? Well, well. Mrs. Brigman. I'm switching off now. Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it. So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me. Your rig? Wasn't up to me. Hi, Lins. I thought you were in Houston. Did you find Wilhite? Coffey, we're a little pressed for time. Let's go, guys. Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around. It won't work. You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here. Look, it's three AM. These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep. You better start cutting them some slack. Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek. All right. Do it! Is that it? Is this right? Meet me in the moonpool. Move fast. Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that? Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it. Why bring it here? Yeah, for now. Our first priority's to get something to breathe. That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus. Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy. What's the matter with you? Just get around so your lights are on the hatch. God, I hate that bitch. Hafta... go on to... the moonpool. Only way. Take the first watch in sonar. Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance. One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay? 'Fish'? He's convulsing! We're here now. Let's get her done. Hey, you guys are milking that job.I can't... make it... podner. Yuh? It's his mixture! Too much oxygen! Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud. It ain't. I'm sorry... That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss. Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke. Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly. Y'all could be more specific. Missed what? You watch yourself. Okay, here we go. Start equalizing, y'all. Howdy, y'all. Hey, Lindsey! I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings. Give me that!! Just checking is out, huh? How come? Are we talkin' little space friend here? Quiet! Quiet! Hippy, you pussy. Those guys ain't so tough. I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.No. Monk, Schoenick... secure the package. We'll go in through that large breach. I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive. I can't afford slack, Brigman. We'll take reading as we go. If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away. Simple. Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission. I believe the stress is affecting you. Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer. You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't. I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras. We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion. 24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile. Radiation is nominal. The warheads must still be intact. Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. We're on a tight timeline. Wilhite, anything? Cab One, radiation readings? Cab One, do you see it yet? Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out. We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman. Lady, we better fish or cut bait.Yeah! I mean, I don't know... it looks right. Got it. Over. Yeah. The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands? It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins. Come on, man. What else could it be? Do we just leave him there? That's Perry. Everything is. No, I mean it. Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly. Something's going on. Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident. Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something. Check. Then I just hang with these guys, right? Yeah, well you never should have married her then. Virgil? SHIT! That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV. Right on! Hot rods of the Gods. Right, Lins? Hey, no really! It could be NTIs. The CIA has known about them for years. They abduct people all the time. There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who-- Turn it up, bozo. What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months? Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender. Uh, oh... 12000 feet. Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this. He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself. That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat! I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there. A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot. Okay, gimme a couple hours on this. Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy. When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit. Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada. Non-Terrestrial Intelligence. NTIs. Yeah, I like that better then UFOs. Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects. We got Russian subs creeping around. Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man. Give our folks medals, know what I mean? 1840... 50... 60... 70... Cab Three, check. Right behind you. Gotcha, Cab Three. Who is that? That You, Lindsey? You boss is having a full-on meltdown. Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside! It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe. Perry, stand by on the ROV. Sorry about this, little buddy. Better you than me, know what I mean? Hey! How deep?Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me. Yeah, okay. Okay. No! I'm okay now. I just don't... I can't go any further in. I... they're all dead, Bud. They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know... Lord Almighty. Where are we? How deep's the drop-off here? What's goin' on, Boss? Bud! Hippy's on the bitch-box. It's a call from topside. That new company man.What's the timer set for? Getting a reading? Stand by on the ROV. Check this out. Deep. It's classified... you know. Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you. Fluid breathing system. We just got them. We use it if we need to go really deep. Through three miles of water? I don't know. He's hallucinating badly. He can still make it. He's losing it. Talk to him. Keep him with us. Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria. 4800 feet. It's official. High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.No way that could just be seawater. She went front-office on you. Tighten that for me, right there. That's it. Okay, good reason. Then what? Doesn't mean you had to marry her. Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension. So there you were-- Right through the brainpan. Deader'n dogshit, boss. Piece of cake, baby. I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.What is that? You drop your dive light? Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer. Do you read, over? This is Deepcore-- You got it?! You got it? I'm alright, I'm dealing. She-hit.Mr. Wayne is out for the day. Yes? Which bathroom is that, sir? I'd say about thirty feet, sir. Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it. Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you. Upstairs. He's quite docile. ... Very good, sir. Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly. He asked me to convey his regrets.... Murderer... What are you talking about? Take me. Let the boy go. I had to save you, Vicki. I -- -- Please trust me. Is this what you wanted? I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me. No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will. Untraceable. It's very elegant. They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source. Photo database. I'll do your photos now. So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most. They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights. Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child. That's why I wear a target on my chest. Better. It's not on the market yet. Quite a while. I took the scenic route. Thank you, Vicki. I'll take you with me. All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours. The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So -- Please. I'll have to ask you for that film. ...Not even a 'thank you'? How much do you weigh? Too many people. Come on! SHIELDS!! He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT! I know. I called them. GET IN THE CAR!!If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have... ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste. How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century? It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good. I know the feeling. It won't last. He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age. Where's the boy? It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control. Thank you, Alfred. I hope you'll excuse me. It was a great pleasure meeting you. And you. Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too. Do you want a drink? Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it? I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large. What is it you want? You're just back from Corto Maltese. I saw your combat photos. Quite a departure for you. I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale. Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it. Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me? Ohhhh... You don't mean that. In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out? All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited. All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened. Hang on. I have to leave a message. Got it! I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum. Finding out where she is. Keep her on the line! The does it. It's going to be this weekend. I feel naked without it. Very thoughtful. Don't touch it. Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save. What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one? Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process. No one would miss me. Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous? Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing. I realize... the way things have gone between us... ... I wish you'd reconsider. I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you. I know it's late. I -- Are you there? ... Looks like a convention. I said I'd call you the minute I got free. And I did -- And here we are. I don't sing very well. Maybe we should just kiss. I'll take you home if you'd like. Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it. I see. If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much. In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror. There's terror everywhere. If you train yourself to look for it. What did you see? Odd desire for anyone. No. Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. Look, I bore myself silly. Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese? Too much work. I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred. Good. With any luck we'll run into each other. I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while? Do you still think the Joker cares about money?? Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration. I suggest a nice big bomb. He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources. We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by -- Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws. All right, Bruce, what do you suggest? We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks! Boss! Jesus! They've -- WHAT?? WHAT? We got 'em!About how pretty you are, pretty boy. Maybe he'd like to know -- Got it all figured, huh? Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins. -- Maybe he don't know what we know. I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you. I'm on top of it. If there's a problem -- Sorry. We had another bat sighting.You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man. You shouldn'ta -- My brother's a priest, man. There was no blood, man. My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you... Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body. That ain't what I heard. That ain't what I heard at all. I heard the bat got him. I dunno, man. After what happened to Johnny Gobs - - Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE. Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal -- It's not the girl, Jack. Sooner or later you would've tried to take me. You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime. Jack? Thank God. I can't believe it's you. I heard you'd been -- Oh, Jack. -- Don't forget your lucky deck. Because I want someone I can trust. Very good idea, Jack. In fact -- -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.What are you talking about? Why, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future. Eckhardt... our problems are your problems. Don't let your job interfere with your business. -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent. I missed you, Lieutenant. HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!! JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK? I've died once already. It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it. Is that what you "heard"? It's me. "Sugar Bumps." I understand. Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in? Okay, a break-in. Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live. You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously. Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all... ... You made me what I am today. Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor! Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot. MOVE! Can't you do something?? They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT! SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE -- SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!! Take 'em! I want his head! That's it. Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends. I've considered that possibility. Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!! Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions! I want ten million and one. Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up. Joker here. Can we talk? Miss Vale, was it something I said? Do you want to sniff my flower? What? I improved her a little... Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask. Strong stomach, huh? I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all. ... Behind the makeup? A visual record, yes. A before-and- after kind of thing. This could make your reputation. Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you? Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe. The small one. You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment. How high up would you say that is? Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right? Because I... ... Because she'd never speak to me again. See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you. Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word. I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki. That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good. "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant. Great. Give me a grant. I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. Alexander Knox. Holy shit. Holy... Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?! HOLY SHIT!! Great. How?? What do you say? Let's head for the lights. Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way. Jesus, Vicki! Where is it?? Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope. CRAZY BAT-STARD! Not what? The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He -- -- I can't believe it. I was right!! Bruce Wayne is out of his mind. Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over. Right. And they know him. And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for -- ... Okay, then, I have a confession to make. I'm the Batman. ... Oh? Why is that, Vicki? Everybody needs a hobby. You explain it, Vicki. He walks out on his own party. Half an hour later, who turns up? Batman. Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. No place to change. Yeah? According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva. Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master. Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to? Yep. He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop? Jim Gordon Nice snap, huh? Pulitzer Prize, 1963. Why? Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious. I do this for a living. There's a phone. You can call him up and cancel. Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through women. Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up and asked you for a date? Shit. HEY, MIRANDA! C'MERE! Now pay close attention to this. Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne. Well, he must like the way he looks. He's got a mirror in every room. What were you thinking? Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. This guy must be the most worthless man in America. I bet they like him for his big charity balls. Likes to kill? KNOX Women find him magnetic. Holy shit... Where does one man get all this junk? Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually know all these people? Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger? Oh, absolutely. Bruce and I are very close. Small so far. I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent. Oh, it's too good. We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers. God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this. Too much glamor, huh. What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo? Apes in Kenya? Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. If I had a good enough hint.Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect. All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in -- I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'Do you want this money or don't you? Now shut up! Shut up -- No wonder you're such a chickenshit. Now shut up. There ain't no bat. God! How old are you? There ain't no bat. No shit. It was all over the pavement. Gimme a break, will you? Shut up. Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right? No big loss. What are you, scared of heights?That's it? And what happens if we say no? I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.Well, I'd better find Patsy. Say hello to Mutt for me. To fucking Mutt. So what the hell's Mutt been up to? Say Steve, where's your manners? Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead. They're townies?! Do they go to Henley Hall? I'm in as long as we're careful. All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught. You know how many demerits we're talking? Sounds boring to me.Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something. You afraid of them? I don't think they're in school. Knox? Well, no shit, Sherlock So don't goddam come! Please. Don't come. What do you mean you don't know? How'd it go? Did you read it to her? What is the point? So you really think she means you're going with her? Well? At Chet Danburry's house. Knox, you gotta calm down. Meeks, you're the brain here. What do the dead poets say about somebody like me? I feel like I've never been alive. For years I've been risking nothing. I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act. Knox wants Chris. Hey, this is great. Women swoon! Come on. It'll help you get Chris. Thigh man? Mr. "K" was a hell raiser. How was dinner? Why doesn't he let you do what you want? Charlie Dalton. Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden? This is it. Yaa, I'm a dead poet! Except sex. Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything? And English, and trig It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks. So much the better. I couldn't stop myself. It's Nuwanda, Cameron. Why? Nobody knows who we are. I thought I'd be spontaneous. I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it? It should, but I found it and now I claim it. carpe cavern, guys. Seize the cave. I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation. In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me. Oh come on, Pitts... I'm sorry. I, we Yes sir. Yeah? Like what? But I thought- You're siding with Mr. Nolan?! What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that? Mr. Keating! I here and now commit myself to daring! "O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken." All right! I'm thinking! "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove." But... I'm not? What? I think you're sweet. And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say? If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing? Miss it? It drives us crazy. That's part of what this club is about. In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off. I told you, that's a secret. It's only me, Mr. Nolan. I swear. I made it up. Yes... sir. No one, sir. It was just me. I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's. Welton Academy, hello? Yes, he is, just a moment. Mr. Nolan, it's for you. Yes sir. We were just talking about that. Doing fine, sir. It's better than doing nothing. Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father. Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it? Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda. I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven. No. Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks? If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up. All your asses are safe. Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what? I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in. They were walking along the fence past the soccer field. Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting. Nothing, unless you object to having girls here. It's Nuwanda. My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it. The sax is more sonorous. All right. I'll second that. I'm in. You're welcome to join us, Todd. I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin. Eight o'clock in my room? Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do. I'm just saying Oh yeah. Sure. Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar That's not my fault. What's his specialty, brown-nosing? Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group. Hey, I heard you went to summer school?You fucked up little prick! What are you doing?! Stop what? It does? What? Chris. We got it. Let's go. It's not all right. Come on, DadAnything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton? So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood? Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand? Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles. You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you. I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson. So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy. A man is not very tired, he is exhausted. Don't use very sad, use morose. Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do. It also won't do in your essays. We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting? Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up. No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received: And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it. It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal. Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd. Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi." Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time. Why does the poet write these lines? Very good, Mr._? Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means? I always thought education was learning to think for yourself. Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point. About the evils of conformity. Courtyard? Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure. I didn't know you taught. Come on boys, don't be shy. Don't stop! Excellent! Have him act. Give it rhythm! A sweaty-toothed madman Now there's the poet speaking! Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see. NOW! Use your imagination! First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish! A madman. Perhaps he was. What kind of madman? Don't think! Answer. Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door. What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it. All right! Very good! There's a barbarian in there after all! LOUDER! Again! Louder! Good god, boy! Yell! A barbaric yawp. Really? You told your father what you told me? You let him see your passion for acting? What did your father say? Did you talk to him? Not if you're going to stay true to yourself. Give your father the benefit of the doubt. Talk to him. Let him see who you are. Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him. You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do. If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want. Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling. You have to let him see who you are- It's your only chance. Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you? A dangerously self- destructive one. You can't live a life for someone else, Neil. You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me? Have you shown him your passion about acting? Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world. Seeing a student like you take root and bloom. It's worth everything. That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me. Did you come here to talk about my teaching? Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching. Okay. All poetry was acceptable. The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead. Nothing wrong with research. Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.Will do. Actually I don't really know Mutt. Actually I don't No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry. I'll tell you later. Yep. The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me. Damn it, it's gonna happen! I feel it. She's going to be mine! Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point. That's not the point at all! So? Yeah. Can you believe it? She was gonna call me! She invited me to a party with her! No, I've been calm all my life! If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me. God, I can't take it anymore! If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself. Needs Chris! Must have Chris! The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive. But why? It will? How do you figure? I don't know. I don't get it. What is the Dead Poets Society? Terrible. Awful! I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life! Yeah! Tell him off! It couldn't get any worse. Knox Overstreet. It's just for a little while. You promised. My Word Dead Poets honor. Chet won't know anything. We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over. I promise. Dead Poets honor. Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out. Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever. Then come with me. Are you going with Chet? Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet. Of course just like that. That's how you always know when it's right. Of course I know you! From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul. But I love you. I didn't mean to make a fool of you. If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble. You can't be in here. Chris! All I'm asking you to do is listen. "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold." I don't care. I love you, Chris. You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these. Chris! carpe breastum. Seize the breast. But, Chris... No. I'll be there. The Danburrys. Friday night. Thank you, Chris. Well, sure! You are? She's glad I called! Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress. Sort of. So, uh, where are you in school? The pleasure is mine. Yes sir. They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind. We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir. I don't know. She won't even see me, Pitts. Damn. Damn! If I could just get Chris to read this poem! You really think I should forget her? I can't just forget her, Pitts. And I certainly can't think about math! It's not too bad. It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?! I'm calling her! But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend. What would the dead poets say about that? She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry. Mr. Mondo Jocko himself. They're friends of my dad. Probably in their nineties or something. All right. Jesus, what are you gonna do? Wait a minute. I don't let my parents walk on me.Garden? Ahh! Eat it, Dalton! All right. I'll try anything once. How about a trig study group? Right after dinner. He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin. Well, welcome to "Hell"ton. "We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read? Oh Captain, My Captain. What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non? Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math? The hoi polloi. Doesn't it mean the herd? Meeks. Carpe Diem... seize the day. Good luck. If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost. That is where they should be. Now put foundations under them. His grades are hurting, Charlie. Any group pictures in the annual? I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it. It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play! Is that clear? Is that clear! Did you really think I wouldn't find out?! "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says. "You must be mistaken," I say. "My son isn't in a play." You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting. Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business. But you deliberately deceived me! Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me! Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately. Good boy. Call us if you need anything. You know what this means to your mother, don't you? When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please. Until then, you will listen to me. I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me? Fellows, would you excuse us a minute? I'm sorry, Neil.This is stupid. Are you kidding? Don't be ridiculous. What good will that do? What are you going to do? - Charlie? What happened? What happened? Were you kicked out? You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie. You don't speak for the club. You what?! How did you do that? Where'd you find them? Nuwanda, what is going on? Charlie... Charlie, That was great! Where did you learn to play like that? To put the rout all that was not life. And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. Pledge Overstreet. I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately." I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!" Who's in? Sure. Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way. All right?! Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson. Hey, he's your roommate. Sure, but Cameron asked me too. Anybody mind including him? Yeah, chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead. Yeah. He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business. But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting. As long as I keep my grades up. Yeah. Isn't there an easier way? Eighteen! That's two years! What about the play? The performance is tomorrow night! I know what he'll say. He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it. He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good." Are you kidding? He'd kill me! Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall. When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison! I mean, I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's. But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want! Why do you do it? I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something? Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they? Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone. Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something. What did the name mean. Did you only read dead poets. I was just looking in an old annual and... Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain. What was the Dead Poets Society? Where are you going? You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may... Are you crazy? What's wrong with that? Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat. What I have to do. Screw the annual. Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here. And you'll be approving loans till you croak. I gotta get to the tryouts. Wish me luck. God, I want to do everything! I'm going to explode. Then you can help him. Nothing. No mention of it. Screw it all. I don't give a damn about any of it. Yes sir. Father, I have the main part. The performance is tomorrow night. Father, please. Nobody- I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and- Father, I-- Father! You know me, always taking on too much. Yes sir. Yes sir. I'm sorry. Father, I wasn't disputing you. But father, it's not fair. But father, I'm assistant editor. The god of the cave. Look at this. Forget it, Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, your grades hurting too? Beyond the stream. I think I know. I say we go tonight. Everybody in? But different. I don't know. Visit from my father. That's it! "Follow my voice. We'll try no manhood here." See you at dinner. Put more into it! Chicken shit. Where were we? Lots of girls. The girl who plays Hermia is incredible. You should come to rehearsals. I know they need people to work the lights and stuff. Yes, and acting! It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives. Follow me then to plainer ground. God, I love this! Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou? I mean, this is one special gift! Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one! Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set. Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one. Maybe they thought... Oh.. This is your desk set. I don't get it. It is? Happy Birthday. You get anything? Todd, what's the matter? Quiet. I have to think. From my father and Nolan. Sssh. That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission. No. Er No. Why not? Don't you think you could be? No, I want you in. But being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in. Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool. None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it? By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon. You coming? Jesus Christ, whose side are you on? I haven't even gotten the part yet. Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while? That's a laugh. If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him. Horseshit. Nothing's impossible. As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it. First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that. Hell no, but that's not the point. The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it! So I'm gonna act! Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it. Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me. They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs. A play, dummy. What I want to do! Right now. What is really inside of me. I've found it. God, you really have a problem, don't you? How can it hurt you to read? I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself? What? Put what? Goddamn it, tell me. But why? Don't you understand what Keating is saying? Don't you want to do something about it? What is it then? Want to come to the study group? Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up. The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean? What? So what do you think of my father? Well, you've won the booby prize. Don't expect to like it here. Oh, so you're that Anderson. Why'd you leave Balincrest? I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled. Stand up. What is this "Dead Potts Society"? I want names. Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone? Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again. Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail. Bend over and grab your shins. Who else was involved in this? what?! Good. We're very excited about him. He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know. Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet? Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton. How's your father? At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself. John, the curriculum here is set. It's proven. It works. If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same? Boys marching. Clapping in unison. What was going on in the courtyard the other day? English. Way before your time. It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you. I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom. I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable. This was my first classroom, John, did you know that? My first desk.But what if they see it, Nuwanda? Damn it, Nuwanda. You idiot. Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?! Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is? Charlie, you had no right to do something like that! Oh God, it's over now! Well, of course not. It's just that... You could have warned us. Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club. Well... All right! What'd she say? Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda? Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda. You have another choice. All the good ones go for jerks, you know that. Forget her. Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve. Too bad. What is it? What is this, a midnight study group? That's miles. Where is this cave he's talking about? Weird.I have something. From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream! Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us. Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough- His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly. Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold. A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain. I... I close my eyes. His image floats beside me. A... A sweaty-toothed madman. A crazy madman. A madman. AHHHHHH! YAWP! Yawp! A yawp? Do you have to quit the play? YEA, ART THOU THERE?! Yea, art thou there? I'll come to the performance. No thanks. This play? I will be with thee straight. Yeah! And just look at this ruler! what? Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother! His birthday's always a big to-do. The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one. Oh. They gave me the exact same thing as last year! It's my birthday. Neil, you're not gonna... From you? Neil, how are you gonna do this? No? What do you mean 'no'? No! I don't know, I'll probably never know. The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine. All right? Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you. When you say things, people pay attention. People follow you. I'm not like that. You want me out... is that what you're saying? What is that supposed to mean? I guess. But if he said no before then... Why don't you ask him first? Maybe he'll say yes. Come on, that's impossible. Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning? Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you? And now he will? So? I know that. What's it got to do with you? A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it? Found what? Keating said everybody took turns reading. I don't want to do it. I don't want to read. Yes. But I... I just don't want to come. Thanks but I'd better do history. Nothing. I'll take him over mine. I don't. My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough. I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up. My brother went here. Todd Anderson.My brother. You got my back. We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there. He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers. Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy? I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint. Ya see what I'm saying? Check this out. Y'know Sal's. I like 'em, but you don't play anything else. Is that the only tape you got? How you be? If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS. What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for? Motherfuck gentrification. Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street? Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block? Who told you to be in my neighborhood? I'll fuck you up quick two times. Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me?" You almost knocked me down. The word is "excuse me." Yo! Jade, I still love you. So, in other words, you are not down. Yeah, I asked him. I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's. He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall. And I--we--want some Black people up. Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian. Have you noticed something about them? Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame? Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa? No, are you? We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame. What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures? Boycott Sal's. Boycott Sal's. Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say. Two dollars! Forget it! Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker. How much? It's so nice to see a family hanging out together. No. I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world. You the man. I'm cool. I'm cool. Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here? How come you ain't got no brothers up? Mookie.I'm gonna leave now. I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases. I own a brownstone on this block. Excuse me. I'm very sorry. Yes?Squash it. I don't know how he does it. No! How long? It's been about a year. Make it plain. As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest. You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?I hope the block is still standing. Where did you sleep? I've done that before. Is it a good morning? I thank you. I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama. Maybe I should be heroic more often. I wasn't trying to be a hero. I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think. If I did, I might not have done it in second thought. Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. I'm not stopping. I'm on my way. I didn't know you had such beautiful hair. One day you'll be nice to me. We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice. At least civil. Besides that. Da Mayor don't bother nobody. Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you. Da Mayor just mind his business. I love everybody. I even love you. Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you? That's it. Doctor, always try to do the right thing. Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'. C'mere, Doctor. Mookie. You got a deal. Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches. Listen to me. How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor? Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store. How much will it cost me? What makes Sammy run? What makes Sammy run? How old are you?Fifty cents. How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying? I said my name is Eddie Lovell. My name is Eddie. Ten. Eddie Lovell.Motherfucker you. How many you say? C Duracell. Twenty "C" Duracells.WAKE UP! Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn. Here ya are. Keep the change. Alright.

This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie? What can you say? No! Too long! Too long. Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out. Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb. A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time. OK, but listen up. I'm gonna break it down. What was you saying? Don't worry about it. But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either. Him no white. Him no white. Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks. ML stands for ML. That's it. Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that. Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms. What? It's a motherfucking shame. Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street. I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place. Can ya dig it? Do I have to spell it out? Sweet Dick Willie. It's a fucking shame. Look at that. I'll be back on my feet. Soon enough. Don't worry about it.We're not hanging out. I'm being escorted back to work. No, you the man. You the man.

It's e-vit-able. I didn't know you could read. Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black. That's what I think. Vito, what do you say? Sounds funny to me. As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers." And not Larry Bird? Who's your favorite movie star? Who's your favorite basketball player? Gotta go. See ya soon. Everybody happy now? Remember what I said. Smack him back. People are free to do what they wanna do. Who don't work? Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.

Pino, I work hard like everybody in here. We're outta here. That's what I think. If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life. Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass. Ya like him, huh? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Be right there, Pop. Listen to what I said. Pop, stop lying. 'Bout time, Pop. Pop, what else can I say? I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here. We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst. I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood. I don't like being around them, they're animals. Then we could try something else. Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood? Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive. Turn it off. Twenty minutes. How come you niggers are so stupid? Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on... See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders. He's making us lose business. C'mere. Don't get too friendly with da Mook.

You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time. Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed. Mookie, I always liked you. Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you. Whatdafuck do you want? Where we goin'? You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said. I didn't say nuthin'. You must have a guilty conscience. What are you guilty of? Yeah, do you know 'em? Here, you gotta delivery.

Mookie, no cursing in the store. Hey! What did I say? Vito! Pino! Let's go. Shaddup! Jade, what can I fix you? You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys. So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority. I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none. This is America. Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all? Well, you don't. I'm your father, you better remember that. I didn't think so. We don't know nuthin' else. Too many pizzerias already there. Since when do you know what's best for us? Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think. You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.

I love both you guys, you know that. You're class. But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls. So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.

If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes. Go down like pudding through a hot pipe. Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we? Five's my guess. Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there. Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning. They gotta go. Uh-oh. That's not good. Let's get him up here. What's wrong with them? What's our friend's problem? Beasley.You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace? Come on, friend. I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee. You'll forget what you're angry about. What do you say we go for a walk, pal. The fire. The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym. Knee. Tore it up against St. Anthony's. Right before the accident. Oh. Two at a time? Oh. What do you do? You the magician?Vacation? Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself. So? Twelve years. What're you saying, Charlie? I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie. You can't just -- What about tomorrow? Now? Why not tomorrow? After the show. What's this? Little slow tonight. You wanted to see me, Charlie? Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there? You believe this? The kid won't come out. I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there? Well, look at this. Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart? Wait. Watch. Here comes Dad. I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together. Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack? In the attic. Behind some of Dad's stuff. Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals. Recognize these two characters? Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack. Twenty years, Ma ... Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack. How's the birthday girl? Tag 'em, Willie. The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday. Thanks. Two nights. When they coming in? What happened to the two Clays, Willie? I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said: Christ, that's right. How could I forget. What a nightmare. Right. It was someone's birthday. Halloran? Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory? Yeah. Larry Shelton. Blackie. Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh? Charlie called. I can keep the beat. Yeah, I know. Me, too. Oh. Fine. It was nothing. Couple sore knuckles. Nothing. Looks like these got a few years on them. Good choice. Hey, what do you know. Looks like we can have that drink after all. What's your pleasure? We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory. No, it's not that. I ... can't drink from the bottle. I ... gag. No. There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ... I set it for Wednesday. The ceremony. They're doing the stone today. It's okay? Wednesday? Oh. Yeah. It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it. Uh, we already boxed some things. I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff. It's in there. If you want to get started. Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink. But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry. I didn't hear you come in. Jack! No, fuck you. And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you. That's right. I wasn't there. I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy. No, let's stay on it. I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig. He left a wife and two sons. He wasn't a hero. He was a fool. Dignity? Who the hell are you to talk about dignity? It wasn't professional, Jack. It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt. I'm sorry. I should've checked it out. I screwed up. But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig. Look. I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday. What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway. Jack, you're on television. What? What? We're on after Meadowlark. What's wrong? A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity. Publicity's publicity. Right? Seventy-one It's a disease, Jack. We're against it. It's not a moral decision. I don't know. I don't know. Some disease. I told you, Jack. It's a telethon. No one gets a cent. No. You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know. Jack? You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie? We're in for three weeks solid, Jack. Just until we find another girl. Be reasonable, Jack. What do you mean? What? That takes care of this week. The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri. Maybe so. You ever go back there? Where it happened. I could've. But he didn't want me to. Yeah, but he told you things. He never told me anything. Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together. It was like you'd passed some test, you know? Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you. I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember? God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he? Not for me. I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? Otherwise, I forget. I just forget. But you. You never forget. Ever. So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday? Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ... Right. It's incredible how you do that. Remember things. February? Right. The Royal. When's the last time we were there? A gift. Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels. We, dear brother, are a fucking smash. Yup. They want us back. Easter. It seems they have this egg hunt every year. Only not for kids. Adults. They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn. Then afterwards, they have a dance. An egg dance. Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open. It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business. No, you're wrong. It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done. Celebrating. Join me? How come I didn't hear anything? He was wearing a suit. What are you talking about? Huh? We were just having a little discussion about morality. Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere. Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you? Funny, huh? Dedications. I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room. The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. Daniels went crazy for the idea. And that's not all. Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability. Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie. Yeah, well, she's our girl now. I think we better keep an eye on her. There's trouble there. Hey, listen to this. Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years. You believe that? Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her. Makes me nervous. You haven't seen Susie, have you? Two hours ago! Half-hour. Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast. You see what's on the buffet? Fine. Yes, really. I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack. If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune. What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano. How dare you say you love me. What's the matter with you? What? Thank you, thank you. You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also. So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop. Say hello. Introduce yourself. Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family. Right, Jack? Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother? What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what? Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack. Nobody. So why should you care? No! I never hear it! Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I won't let it bother me. What's the matter with you? So the piano's a little out of tune. So what? Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid. I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is -- I don't know. I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal. Is it? A big deal? Yeah. You mind? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But if it doesn't work out, let me know. I'm,flexible. I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning. We might as well do the towels the same way. Unless you want the right. I figure that way we won't get confused. I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay? Good idea. To Peggy Lee. Not true. Besides, Jack's the romantic. A few bars! Pearls. White gown. Beautiful. It was April. April seventeenth. That one I remember. Come on, Jack. It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together. It'll be like when we were kids. Relax. Enjoy the view. We do. She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries. Last? First night? When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack? All right, but if you change your mind, let me know. I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway. You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on. Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit. Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move. We could use another appetite. Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay. Yeah, well, what can I say? Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big? So what do you think? You recognized me. Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then. You all right? Yeah ... Well, I gotta go. Something, huh? All those bids. Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.' That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth. All three-day turns. That's what I figure. Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls. And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all. She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond. Jack, for crying out loud. Your bachelorhood's showing. Ah, here we go. See anything? Here, how's this? I just wish she'd get here, that's all. All right, all right. I'm a little tense. You hit me. It's not gonna hurt you. Come on, stand still. Yeah, well, Your's isn't. Let me run a comb though it. Just like the day of the auditions, right? Jesus. How's my hair? I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen. Where the hell is she? Okay? I suppose we can bring it down a little. I didn't get her number. Okay, okay. I'll call the girl. I was just thinking what Ma would think. I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act. I just thought we should talk about it. Between ourselves. All right. What's your name? Jack. I just don't understand. You would think someone ... anyone ... Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible. Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven. Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack. What's that? I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack. I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us. If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad -- If you're unhappy with the arrangement -- We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed? It's just an idea. I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right? I been thinking maybe we should make some changes. I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer. Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk. Yeah, and what put him up there? Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it. No. It wasn't like that. I told you. Something came up. Some political dinner or something. I don't know what you mean. Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains. Look good as new. The trees. The flowers. Nice. Nice, huh? Honey, it's only Uncle Jack. You remember Uncle Jack. Jack. So you'll come out, right? Something came up. Don't worry, Charlie stayed true. Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house. We don't get a gig. It's not family. It's business. Yeah. Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya? It's me. Nothing. Everything's great. Terrific. What do you mean? You'll see. Christ, Jack, it's her birthday. Your older brother. You gotta go. This time you gotta go. We gotta go, Jack. No, I mean it. By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow. It's more than that. Funny. Strike a bell? What about that waitress at the Ambassador? Because I'm your brother. Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours. Seeing anyone in particular? Really. You sleeping? You look awful. You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth. What do you think? What d'ya got? What d'you say, Willie? Tighten her up? What d'ya got?, Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing. She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive. Cindy. It was an accident. They don't. They're always asking about you. You're their uncle. Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend. Say hello to the kids. They've grown. Maybe Thursday. I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis. Fuck him. Great. Terrific. Fuck him. This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack. You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative? Jack... Huh? I mean it, Jack. Behave. Don't make trouble, all right? Of course, back then, things were a little different. I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack? That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack? You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know. How long has it been, Jack? You look like you just crawled out of bed. Christ, will you look at your hair? Jack. Jack. You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack. That's not the point. How we ... ? What, are you kidding me? Great. Terrific. Glad you could make it. Your limo's ready, Ma. A cab? Ma, come on. My car's just a half block down. You wait here. You sure? No, we're not. Jack? I guess you're,right. Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open. The audience was a little off tonight. So what'd you think? You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you. Look, Nick. You want us to pack up, we'll pack up. Doctor's orders. The flu. Yes, it is. Uh... he knows it. It's one of Jack's favorites. Uh-huh. Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us? Right. Well, that's fine -- Blanche. I'm sorry? Uh ... Frank Baker. This is my brother. Catchy. You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond? Terrific. Thirty-eight. Miss -- We ran long. You're an hour and a half late. Impersonally. Don't take it personally. Look, miss. We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home. Punctuality. First rule of show business. You're an hour and a half late. We're finished. This is where the auditions were. Susie. It's one more show. One more time. That's all. What're you talking about? They love it. What? Forget it. How about you? Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend? I guess I ... If I jumped to... I just saw a man walk out of your room! No. You listen. I had my doubts about you from the beginning In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here. So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency. I just saw a man walk out of your room. You want to tell me what the hell's going on? Someone needs to grow up. I won't take it, Jack. Well then ... shall we? Got another song for us? Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack. So. Susie. How 'bout it. Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle. He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother? What do you say we send a bottle over? Hey, will you look at that? No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera. God, we were just kids. That was something, wasn't it? People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night. Chills. Through the whole audience. I could hardly play. Tell her. As Charlie Steinway is my witness. Yeah. Great. It's paradise. That's what it is. Paradise. Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five? And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life. I told you, he's got the gift. Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it. Jack? Go ahead. He's always right. Go ahead. Pick a virgin. First times. Hey, look at this. Virgins. Baker's unabridged. Sorry. It only plays static. You two could play checkers. For the kids. Merry Christmas, you two. Don't forget. We leave the twenty-sixth. Uh, well ... we flipped a coin. Maybe. I'll call him. By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action. Resort, upstate. I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two. Jack, you with us? We do not take tips. I'll apply this to the cost of the dress. We are not a saloon act. We do not take tips from dirty old men. Give me that. Fucking. Did you hear it? Fucking. She says fucking in front of an entire room of people. The switch. Hit the switch. Right. We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors? Okay, remember. Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ... Don't worry. We'll take it out of your share. You can buy new ones tomorrow. They're nines. Right. Uh... good. Big feet. Nine? All right, but make it quick. Shoes! What size do you wear? We're not exactly silly with time, you know. Jack, you find anything? Okay, okay. Here, how about this? My wife wears a seven. You don't look like a seven to me. Just look. What do you wear? A nine? Come on. We don't have much time. Come on. It's orange! That! You can't wear that! Is there a language problem here? Your dress. For tonight. Where is it? Where's your dress? We'll talk about it later. Right now, you gotta get changed. What-? Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back. Good evening, Miss Diamond. You're late. We're a team. We work together. No. We are not supposed to be backing you up. What's the problem? Ready? When we know. Uh ... we'll let you know. That's the premise. Okay. I think that's all we need to know. Uh, well ... They are in tune. But not with each other. Yes, well, they are. That'd be me, sir. Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack. We trust you, Lloyd. You know that. Born and bred. Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe... Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd? Uh ... thanks. Thanks, Lloyd.Just the same. Maybe next time. Oh. No. Strictly dryland. Trunks? I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ... What do you do to him? No bones? How will he eat? Isn't there something you can give him? A pill or something? How many? They're falling out. Teeth. Baker. I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you. Go fuck yourself. Get your hand off me. Accident? What's wrong with the kid? My brother and I. One each. Piano. No. She asked for it. Daughter's. Sweet sixteen. Five years ago. November. Yeah. Yeah? I mean, you can play. You're okay. You know, that night, I ... It just all came up. How're your hands? This'll kill 'em. I'll take the Mallory. Oh, yeah, right. I forgot. Bought it on the way over. Clean as a nun. Go ahead. Sure. Yeah, fine. Right. Is everything done? The arrangements, I mean. Later. What're you doing? Who's weak now, big brother? Fuck you. You weren't there. Stay off it. What's happening to you, Frank? You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it? You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity? What? Basketballs, Frank. You had us playing for basketballs. What-are you? A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank. Who's watching? Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think? Shut up, Frank. We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium! Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? Seventy-one? What's seventy-one? What channels it on? You don't know? What disease? What's it for? Nothing. We get nothing. We're not getting paid then. Twenty-eight years. Better give her pneumonia. Cancel, Frank. What're you doing? I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be? I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance. I can't make the tenth. The tenth's out. You're making things up, Frank. You could've come. It was just a can of beer, Frank. He was just having fun. You always threw up. Yeah. I told you. It's a useless talent. They were simple songs. A useless talent. April. Couple years. The Royal. Expensive hangover. The party's over. What're you doing down here? You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper. Unlike me. He had to come quickly. It was a big leak. We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it. He's with the hotel. I called him. You saw wrong. What're you trying to do? Wake up the whole goddamn hotel? What? What the hell are these? She's a big girl. No. Why? Time flies, huh? They stopped serving two hours ago. How long you been at it? How's it coming? Really. What the hell are you doing? It won't happen again. Scout's honor. I'm sorry, Frank. All that talk about family. I just got emotional. I love you. I just wanted to say it. Right. I love you, Frank. Because I can hear it. Doesn't it matter to you? Christ, can't you hear it? No, that's your problem, Frank. You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old. Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say. Accommodate? I don't think I know what you mean. Why would I mind? So you're gonna leave it on. Every night. For a week. We're gonna be here a week? All night? You leaving that on? Right. Good idea. Okay. No, you take the right. Right. Okay. Have some more wine, Frank. He's drunk. Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars. We were playing the lounge one night and she came in. She was staying at the Grand downtown ... I thought we all had separate rooms. I thought we had separate rooms. Sunday. Day. Wednesday. November. '71. Two years ago. March. Thanks, but I've got plans. Yeah. Very realistic. Just a lucky guess. Hey, Frank. Right. Yeah, fine. You wanna get a drink? Yeah. Something. I'll take my chances. Make it collect. Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee. Oh, brother. How about these? No. She's here. You're a fucking alarm clock. I told you I was gonna hit you. I'll hit you, Frank. I swear. Get out of here! Get out of here. Awe inspiring. She'll get here. It's early. I'll drop the eighths. What's the matter? How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna? Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote. Ma? Ma? Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador? Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget. You're getting cold feet about this. What's there to talk about? She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class. What are you, crazy? Let's get it over with. It was a somewhat extraordinary day. What? It never was. You, Frank. All these years you been telling me we're different. We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us. I'm grateful, Frank. How much? For the singer. Frank. Fuck it. Okay? I'm not unhappy. That's what we agreed. It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say? Sure, why not. Talk. Hey, you weren't there. Right? A gust of wind killed him. That how you see it? What was it like? No? Bullshit. Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off. The hell you don't. Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he? You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank? Terrific. What? Your doorbell doesn't work. Yeah, okay. What're you talking about? So talk to me tomorrow. After the gig. I've had enough family for one month, Frank. Frank? Yeah? What's with Charlie? Her hands. Like that. I made her nervous. So what'd we get her? You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore. Says who? I don't gotta go. No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go. So do I. No thanks. It's only a ring. Not a collar. Uh-uh. How about you? You seeing anyone? I'm not seeing anyone. In particular. Why the interest? Only on odd days. Thanks. Trust me, you're not missing anything. Try the black Knable. Yamaha white. Nice. Bosen black. Flat. You got weird kids, Frank. She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that? It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ... They tried to electrocute me, Frank. Only by relation. Besides, they hate me, too. I hate your kids, Frank. So we on tomorrow night? Fuck him. Fuck him. Count the fucking money, Frank. Count it. Count it. Like an angel. Who's gonna make trouble? Hey, amigo! Lotta water. Twenty-eight years, Frank. No one's gonna be looking at my hair. Come on, we're on. What's wrong with it? Frank. I'm here. I always get here. Don't sweat it. Frank. You want me to show up late a few nights? What's the point? Am I late? How we doing? Thanks. Brought it. Funny job. Job. Gotta go. Baker. He doesn't bite. Come on, Ed. Baker. Jack Baker. Don't worry about it. No. Black. Labrador. The name's Baker -- Yeah. Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now? Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him. No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth. It's been a long time, Ma. I suppose. For a while. She left. Pretty much. He leads, I follow. Frank works hard. No. Downstairs. Thanks. For letting me in last night. I didn't want to wake you. No. Hi. If I see him. I've given it up. Vegetables. What kind? So how's the cat food business? You don't pick your brother. We outgrew each other. Yeah. Got my own sign. There's always another girl. If our feet get hot, you grab the piano. Look, if you want to leave... Coffee? Frank wasn't 'there. Ma didn't want it around. After. I don't know. Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her. He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb. He had a mind that escalated things. By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition. They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven. Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't. Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous. Long story. He called her. My father proposed to my mother in there. History. Soap? Must've been a cheap date. How come you didn't close your eyes? I have to make him some chili. Okay? She's four feet tall. Ed? Friend. Nina? How do you know? Let's make a deal. You shut up. It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you. Look. You don't know good. All right? I'm not upset. Nothing. Nothing. I can keep the beat. Practice. There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few. It's a shitty song. Relax. We'll drop the song. Just dinner and dance, right? Hey, business is business. No thanks. I never touch French cigarettes. Like a baby. You? Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets. In and out. It's okay. Last one. I guess in case one year they're not. Every year. Every year. Forget it. Forget it. You want me to walk you? Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee? Huh? The Stratford. He takes after our mother. His kid's sick. Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through. Fucking. You never sang before? He'll come around. It ain't always a blessing. My brother here? Another five years, huh? Yeah. Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy. Losing his teeth. Sure. Merry Christmas. Yeah? Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it? Okay. How'd yours go? He's just feeling sorry for himself. This is it, pal. Hear me? Two bucks a can. Ever go to church? Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay? Hey, what do you want to do? Grow a beard? Older than me. Ivory. Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him. Oh? How do you know? The recent past. My days are not the old days, genius. In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop. Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him. What happened to the donut king? Sounds big. What's he do? Eddie did. He's losing his teeth. Eddie. I'm not much for sweets. Huh? Oh, no. Fine. You? Good to see you, Ma.All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room. I'll take a look. Save it. What's he look like? All right. Hold on. You want to know if he's okay. Right? You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five. Regular hours are eight to five.Lucky for you. Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack? Yes, sir. That's quite a girl you boys latched onto. She a local? I'll call you. I'll call you. Yes, sir. You're just what we needed on a night like this. Terrific, boys. Really. Terrific.Is that important? Then I'm afraid I don't understand. Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos. We were assured they were in tune. Good morning, gentlemen. I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager. I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.What am I gonna do? Put a record player out there? Bad, Frankie. Bad. You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical. So she's got a few sniffles. Sick? How sick?He's got blood in his eye. Like clockwork. You got a good memory, Jackie. Yeah. The big boys sent it down yesterday. No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps. Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?My pleasure. What's the gig? Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack. Out.And I'll never do it again. Forgive me? All right, all right -- I'm a major ass. Hear what? Right. Right. There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories. Let's drop it, okay? Never mind, you don't want to know about it. Nothing. Well...how do you feel?Don't be ridiculous! Dear Christ... Not another word, do you hear me?? She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault! What's that? What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose?? Christ...where's Rennie?? Where's the radio? She changed her mind. Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five. Rennie's not coming. That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home. Where did you get that alcohol? Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights. I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents. What are you doing in here? All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood? My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts. Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way. A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson. What did you do with Rennie?? Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board. Enough is enough. I doubt very much that one even exists. He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing! She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you. Has he brought it back on course yet? Walking corpses are not real! That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded... It's no coincidence. I demand to know what is going on... I thought I told you to stay away from her. Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen. I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion. She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life. You have no right... Let's go -- we're running two minutes late. Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned. You can and you will! Swim, Rennie! Am I? Let's find out. Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim. He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake. You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how. Perfect for a swim, isn't it? I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life. You can and you will!! Get in the boat, Rennie! This isn't a request. Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about. I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship. I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever? You had me worried to death! Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it. Why are you doing this to yourself? If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of... You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec... The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can. Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN? What is your location?Jason's here in New York. We have to get off this ship!! This is Jason's fault! The fire alarm... She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if... It's...dead. But I thought... Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch? I've got the numbers. Yes... I...I don't know... The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead. You have to call the police... Rennie...what'd they do to you?? But Rennie... We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case. Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly... Rennie...?? I didn't mean for you to go! The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further... I don't know...we've gone off course or something... If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again. But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do. Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you. It's okay...you're going to be okay. I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall. Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway. I got you a present. I heard you weren't coming. Rennie...So what else is new? Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend. No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it. The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.I...I can't... You're telling a lie. He is not. I'll take some lessons this time. I promise. What a beautiful day.Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid. Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent. How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come on . Hey, don't run away now. Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving? It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that. So, are you a cheerleader?Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go? Oh yeah, that's it. Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things? So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like? Oh yeah, that's it. Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap. So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like? Take a break Veronica, sit down.Uh-huh. I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile. Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd. Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock. Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then. I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself. Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but... Oh, I just had the nicest chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots? You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean. You really fucked me up, Veronica. What? Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe? You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge. You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven. You didn't say Simon Says. I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you! If you'll excuse me...... You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting? What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils? Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag. Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious... "You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it! I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back! I could be up for that. I've already started underlining meaningful passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on? Catch a movie? Miniature Golf? Phase my ass! You'll be back ! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back. Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you. Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor. Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi? You kids are making too much damn noise. She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes. I was just making it more special. How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse? Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes. Did to. Did to. You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face. Of course. Remember he's left-handed. Don't move! I'll get him back! Did you miss him completely? This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress. Perrier water! You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up... We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick. Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed. It doesn't work on small animals! They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce. Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word. Incredible similarity. These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm. Do you take German? Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time. Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee. What is this shit? Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, Dad ? Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner. Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now. Mute! "I die knowing no one knew the real me." That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school. This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss. "To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me." Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion. We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing..... I'm just a little freaked, all right? You got what you wanted, you know. What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge." And your worst enemy. Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup. Chick-en. Yeah, great. Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking. Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue. I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself. Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue. Good plan. I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. Just saying it's not hard to end a life. See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby. A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift. Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die. That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you. I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match? Dreadful etiquette. I apologize. Maybe it's time for a vacation. I don't really like your friends either. Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect? My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State." Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company? The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee? I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane. You going to pull a Big Gulp with that? Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach. That's the stupidest question I've ever heard. There are no stupid questions.Shut the fuck up, all right. Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest. Is it sleeping, dude? Cool off, we're seniors. That pudwapper just stepped on my foot. Pretty weird. We on tonight man? Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule? What did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio? Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though. Veronica is into his act. No doubt.Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in! Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and... Punch it in! I think so, man. Goddamn Geek! Let's kick his ass. I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh? Answer him dick! You going to eat this? Let's kick his ass. Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle. And God help whoever it is. Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground. Put your faith in that, pal. They're great with kids. They love 'em. They eat 'em up. I'm kidding. Look at that. You can't buy better protection than that. That there is your Man's Best Friend. Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- nothing . I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're quiet , they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle... ... then look out. You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests. You want consistency? You want dependability? You want safety?What toys do you have? Where are these toys of yours? So where are all your toys? Was that your dad? Whoa, check it out. They're really white. I'm Bernard, by the way. Those are cool Reeboks, Neil. They're real new, aren't they? So, Neil . How's it goin'?So this really does the trick, eh? How are they with kids? Safety? You test each one thoroughly? Oh -- uh -- girlfriend. Well, it's for a woman. I'm looking for some perfume. There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand -- I know . I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now. Right. I should. Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her. Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too. What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words. I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever. Things are beginning to come to a head. I can feel it. And I want everything to be perfect. -- a sense of proportion. That would be stupid. No, no, no, no. I understand that. Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing. I am. I'm really feeling pretty good. I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come. Oh, fine. She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her. I guess so. I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone. I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever. When I was a child... I got used to the closets. The boxes. The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip. I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood. Cardboard. I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard. That smelled like rust and decay. It was safe in the boxes. It was when they took me out -- Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky. Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like. -- institution. Yeah, since I was a kid. I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time. Then I learned a lot more when I was in the -- Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff. I still find it very soothing. Right. Oh, it's nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place. It's great. It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers. There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along. About us. I think we should talk first. It is tomorrow. Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do. I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices. What happened? I was driving by -- I saw all the cars. Are you all right? Because you were pretty? I was alone a lot as a child. No one to compete with. My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things. When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody. You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you. Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world. I don't like having to rely on other people. Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down. It's a living. An occupational hazard, I'm afraid. -- General handyman, yeah. I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house. I do housesitting while the owners are away. In fact, that's why I've been in the area. I've been living very close by. Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning. Isn't that always the way? Just show me the way. Yeah, that was easy. Maybe I could take a look at it now. Sure.A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet. Here's the TV. Let's watch some TV. Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor. Give it here, Bernard. Hey, c'mon. Okay. That's okay, Mom. No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now. Mom, I heard someone downstairs! Mom, there's somebody in the house ! Where'd he go? I don't know how it started! Thanks, Mom. Whew. Thank God. I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone much bigger than me . RUDOLF! Has anyone seen Rudolf? I don't think he came in last night. But there's this psycho . Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with every day . I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school! I could take a cab on the way home. Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning? "We don't want to be late for our first day of school." Shit! It's fun. Let's follow 'em. God, your sister's really hot. I thought I was supposed to stay in my room. No. -- A man. A man started the fire. Can we keep him? And I can't help having a cold. The thermometer's broken. I have a cold. I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right? All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go. Rudolf? C'mere, Rudolf! I didn't. No. What about cable? Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too! Are we gonna buy this house?Put it out, man! Grow up, Dreyer. What for, dickweed? Shut up.Should I come home when I'm finished there? Yeah -- we know him. He's been hanging around the house. This is my house. What? I think it's time I came home now. I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down -- Look, I think we should work things out. And what was that neighbor guy doing here? Who was that? I am so sick to death of hearing your opinion of my state of mind, what you think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. You're the final straw on this back, baby! This is for the best, you know it is. Why do my socks keep disappearing! Someone blew the whistle. Someone hates me. I'm fired . I'm unemployed. Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength? Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off! There might be some extras in the garage. Everything -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only Lowenthal never showed up for our lunch ! It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some -- Do you smell smoke? I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes. When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled. I had cancelled! Then I get back to my office and Aranson is waiting for me and he knows everything . He wasn't there. C'mon. What -- what are you doing? His secretary just confirmed. He wants to see me! The floor has a nice shine to it. Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine. Did the cleaning woman come? I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus. The cab's waiting! Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us. You'll see. Who told you that -- someone on the radio? Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having. This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With nothing . Barbara Zelman ? I don't believe this! Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now. Maybe you don't appreciate that. Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie. I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket. What next?! -- A strange bra under my pillow! Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while. Maybe Rudolf got the same idea. Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time. I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive. He's made some friends, hasn't he? One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it. All new houses have noises. No. No . If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right? Oh -- great. Huh? I know. It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me. -- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is? Some nice neighborhood. He made, you know, a remark. Did you hear what he said? Did you hear that? Damn. Good -- that's what I was trying to project. How were we -- were we cool? It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us. Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer. But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed. It'll be even shorter if I get that new job. Come on. It's a nice pool, isn't it? You want me to bargain at the high end of our range? -- I'll have a stroke. I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks. You wanted furniture too, didn't you? High end? Honey, it's a whole new budget. Stop knowing me so well. What's that? What? We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool. Neil, calm down. Get on the other side of that. No man! Go to your room . Do you see a man? You knew a second ago. Who started it? Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old! Hiya, sport. Where'd you come from, huh? What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog. What does EVERYONE want me to do? You want to move back? Huh? Would you like that? Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?! Y'know what? I'm ready to cancel our trip. I really am. I've had it. What did the thermometer say? If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically. Oh really? You've been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna? Why? I just read your report card. What's the point? Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered. What kind of report card do you call this?! Neil, do you mind? All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake? We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then? Okay! We have TV! We can all get stupid again! Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too? Do you have enough money? Really. Uh huh. I'd like that. Promise? Thank you -- how efficient of you. Even cosier. It's a double. Right over here. And this -- is the master bedroom.Well, you'll just have to make her understand. I can't help you if you don't help yourself. It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any. Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport. Because life isn't about playing it safe. Life is about taking risks. You have to put yourself out there a bit more. Ask her how she feels. It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more. Show your affection. Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself. Who doesn't? A sense of proportion. That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is -- On the contrary -- this is tremendous. I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, declare ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty -- And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way -- The whole disapproval thing. If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you? -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life. As long as you keep remembering why. That's terrific. Don't be afraid to be demonstrative. You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke. And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that? You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone. In other words, you've done your best. I'm saying don't carry the burden of other people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control. Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you hope the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be. Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time. Right. So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people. -- hospital. I'm happy that you're working again. As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you? And what about work? Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now? All right then. That's important, isn't it? -- For you to be in an "up" environment. I'm saying you should literally take that as your base , do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon. And the rent is okay? How's the new place?Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more. That it acquires intelligence from its victims? Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship? Why isn't he out swimming around? But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb? Not exactly a big ocean country. Was there such a thing? They found this? Yeah...right... Why Sixpack? And? The mask is because you think it might be...catching? I'm not a doctor. Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?! Dead? This morning you said he had some skin disorder. What's wrong? What mistakes? Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check. What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious? Be my guest. We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit... Are you planning on working tomorrow? Just get in yours! I got hung up! Try this! That's an order! Go on! No. Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think! Can you fix it? We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and-- That's why there's a dead one on the ship. It ran out of blood. No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that? I thought they were your friends? What has? There's now a problem with the weather for pickup. There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours... What?... ...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to--- I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding... Doc eat already? Stay calm! DeJesus! A readout! All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow-- How do you know it was Williams? Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics. Any other suit problems she should know about? Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system... Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters... I can't see them! Where's Jones? Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct. We're on backup air. What are you doing? Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us. Shit! He sent them all. Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other. I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done. You think I should hang around more with the crew? Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something. Whatever made you want to do a tour down here? No. I'm just being friendly. How's astronaut training? That was a loud one wasn't it? Why can't we pick up his signal? That's great. Now let's move 35 degrees southwest. I need more light on that, Four. There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit... What? Jones...come with me. Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms. No! Shut up, all of you. Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb? All right... What's wrong with it? Something wrong, Cobb? You're only twenty-five tons off quota. Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day. It's just a day off. You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help. He's not at his station. The internal monitors read normal. Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit... Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty? What's your air reading? Charge set? No...she killed herself. I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms. Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one. Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner. How do you feel, DeJesus? Give me a readout, DeJesus. Forty-eight hours! But it's a delay! How long? A day? Two days?! What're you saying? That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow? Do it. I'm not anxious to find out, either. What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy. How's the weather for pickup tomorrow? I know that. Thank you, Martin. Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.Personal effects... You're damn right I do. Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside. I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that. You got money in this tub? Not yet. Hook's on 24... Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups? What about his suit? That's a million five the company's got to replace. They'll make somebody go get it. Who else...Sixpack. If he had his blinkers on-- The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute. I'm telling you, it's the suits!Oh, God, she's out there... It bit me! Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of--- No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand? Excuse me, sir... ...I'd really have to show it to you. Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir... What about our quota? Where's Doc?! Itches like hell. What was it? What happened? Bullshit. You read Russian? What the?... I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here! I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself. What's going on? At least we get time and a half. That's in the contract. He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine precaution ." Pretty good. He sent them out videotaping outcrop. What music? There ain't no music. Shhhh...don't tell no one. Job security. Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here... No way, Mister Beck! No fucking way ! We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift. It's a contract violation! I'm going to kill it! I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out. I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!.. Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it. You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin. You guys are crazy. What the hell you play that stupid game for? This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit. Who cares?Be careful with it. Intelligence may not be the right word... Why stop with just one aspect of marine life? Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?... Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds... It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water. Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... adapted . Danakil man?...one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia. No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus... It could be a million things, something in the air, food.... But he went on that ship and so did Williams... I want to examine the crew. And they didn't believe the symptoms I described... I don't know. I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses... For this...you don't need to be. Here. Put this on. You examine him. He did. Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know. These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes. You mind if I take a look at this? Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning. Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver-- Take it off and let me have a look. Still bothering you? It...almost got you. ...and a Russian grandmother... Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background... Russian. I don't know. I'm guessing. ...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy... but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality... The monster appears to be a genetic aberration... It would explain the suction- like appendages. It's had a meal. I'm going to try to remove it. We've got to get him to the infirmary. We're simply concerned about her...proximity to... The infirmary?... Two hundred meters.Your suit, Becky! Where the hell've you been? Fuck your orders! No! I hit it. But I can't see it! Can you see it?! I am thinking, man! You think I want to die! I am thinking! I-- No way... Jesus Christ... Crunch...Implosion. What dead one on the ship? He did. Were, Doss were . One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big leech, with those teeth!... It's got Hazy! We're getting out of here just in time. Bullshit...I was just talking to him. I saw him move. Uh, oh...I see where this is going... The good doctor hasn't showed yet. He don't need a readout, man, he needs help! Yes sir... Aw, loosen up, Bowman... Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you. The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there. It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him! Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing? I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather. Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them. It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened! And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here. That thing happens to be my friend. You let him get away! It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out. I'm going to get the Doc. Fuck double pay, man! I want out of here! "Routine," my ass! Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day! Yeah? How'd the kid hold up? Oooooh. Damn! Not so loud. Turn down the music. So that's all you do?... Listen to it for Christsake. Whooo! Right on, Cobb! Let's hear it for our shop Steward! Probably the plumbing. You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what? Under there? How'd you do that? 'Fucker could have gotten us all killed. Twelve hours! Burritos...Enchiladas... Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?! No fuckin' lie... Like a leech. Bigger than DeJesus? How? I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door. What are you going to do to him? Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick? Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick. She's downstairs in the infirmary. How far away is she? Answer them and quit kicking me! Jameson? Who are you trying to con...? Tip top, Willie...tip top. How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship. Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't. She's wondering what's happening. We're losing air faster than I thought. The air's stopped. The good doctor signed our death warrant. Oh man, that's just great... Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us? DeJesus...It's got him. I ought to smack your face! Sleeping. No sign of Doc, though. I'll check the control room. You look in the shower room... Sixpack... Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month. "Debbie Does Dallas"... Hell, it's in Russian. I can't read it... Jameson? Who're you trying to con? Let's hope it holds.I realize you must have gone through hell-- Twelve hours, no big deal. We should know something first thing in the morning. Don't worry. It shouldn't be a long delay. Unfortunately. We can't. Beck, trust me. If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours. But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you? Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body. However, the company doesn't want you to do that. Beautiful. Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision... Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself... ...as long as you know it's not in your contract. Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean? Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...Huh? I...uh...uh... Look at my foot, sir! This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk! Shit... Don't worry, darlin, I'm... What's wrong, did you miss me? Bitch! Look what you did! The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge. My pocket. Check my pocket, will ya, honey?Roger. Twenty minutes... I'm going inside. Charge set. Backing off. C'mon Rover let's get out of here.We have records. We have proof. I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse. Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship. Because he's guilty. Don't let your father's business infect your life. Well, take a look around the house. Is everything nice, but not too nice? Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash? Does he give a lot of gifts? Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range? Look, why don't you check it out for yourself? See if your father fits the profile. We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients. We've been investigating him for five years. We believe that when they die, he takes their money.Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise? Hmmm. Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years. The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much? Because her family... And your former wife. Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates... So you refuse to answer my questions? Understanding the following rights...You're sure? Okay, thanks. I'm sorry, but they turned down your card. Thanks, I like yours too. Excellent. Good for her. For going to school? Is it a gift for your wife? Are you getting a set together?I dream about it. I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants. You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something. Lloyd, it's us. I told him to be himself. Meaning? I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd. Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess. He wants to leave things on a good note. Come on, it's graduation. Lloyd, why do you have to be like this? Visit her at the home. Look, why don't you just call Diane again? Lloyd, she's being difficult.You're freaking out here man. Man, you're bringing me down! Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that. Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.PAIN! No my brother, you have to go buy your own. YEAH! Yeah.Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims. I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it. That's right. What family? We never heard from them. I sold her house for them, made them money. This evening is over. Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake. I have people here. Speak with my lawyer. Jesus. What, I live in a palace, right? I have guests here. Yeah, I don't want it. Um, thank you very much. You're very kind. Keep it. Oh yeah, let me give you another card. Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch? I'll take the whole set. Yeah, she won a fellowship. No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter. Hi. Hi. Don't say that, it's not good for you. You're... Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got. That's right, work it out. Why are you being so hateful to me? Is this because of Lloyd? Alright, alright. Go ahead. When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead. I made their lives better. No, you don't know what it is. It's not for me. This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again. Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do. I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths... You think you know what this money is? Honey, about what? Honey, it's not what you think. I swear to god. Honey! Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous. What happened to you? Just finishing up in here. Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best. 'I like him'? Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent... Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care. Give him this pen. Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change. People change. Well listen to me. Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh? What are you going to talk about? What do you have in common? You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags. Do you love him? Diane! Alright, let's stop this right now. Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous. This isn't even smart thinking. Bon voyage. You're going. You're going. Did he ever get rough with you? Sit down. Lloyd? Do you wanna make things easier on me? Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit. You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that. You've always called before, always. Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright. You bet you should have called. You still live at home. Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals. You should be. Morning. Oh yeah. There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream. So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again. Which they did. Let me finish. So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream. I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that. Crash paranoia. Well, let me start it. I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane. Now why can't I tell the story? She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you. When she was eight years old, she... Goodnight. Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it. Wait a minute. How was Lloyd? Morning honey. No, listen to me. You're the best in the country, don't you understand? It's like a pyramid. It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents. And it's you. So tell me something, where's the flaw in that? There is no flaw. We'll worry about that later. Now come on, tell me that you're special. You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss. You stand up straight and admit you're special. You won it. You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won. No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship. I just had a phone call. I love you too honey. I'm sorry. Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss. It's all working out for you honey, don't you see? It's all working out, just like we planned. All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned... No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what? They really applauded you today honey. Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours. Go ahead, open it. Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents. Okay, I promise I will. Just come here a minute, I want to show you something. Ha! Okay. Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful. It's... no, don't worry about it. You're very funny. Go back, that's great! Oh yeah! Ha! Go back! What a great line! Why? It's fine. It's nice. Just her name. She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better. "You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..." I'm incarcerated, Lloyd! I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this. I don't deserve to have you as my go-between. And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you. You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction. Very talented. She's very successful. Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter's a lot different to you. Are you? Are you going to England with her Lloyd? Go ahead, pick it up if you want. No, really. Seriously, Lloyd. Yeah Lloyd. What are your plans for the future? Well, we pay for the [?]. That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars. Thanks Lloyd. Yeah. Honey? Fine Lloyd. Hello Lloyd. Jim Court... no, this is her father. I'll take... Yeah, she is. Good luck. What? Okay, I'll give here the message. Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works. The truck? The guy with the Datsun? Is this the guy with the Mustang? Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment. Jim Court?Dude, I can't do it! Your car? Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes? They're going to be valuable some day. So what's up?I'll be home soon. Hello Constance. It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do? Can't she come back? How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen. I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen. No, no, don't go in there. I'll be in my office. You're tough, J-man. Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really. If it's such a big deal, I'll go. But remember this, it used to be fun. It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you. But I am not T-I-M. Jesus Christ. I get in a good mood. How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood? Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH! How do you know how to draw the red line anyway? Hey, bad throat, huh J-man? It's no problem. I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there. Hey, sis. If she wants me, she can come to me. I am. I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls. Read it. I already did. Alright. So, what's your point? Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different. I admit nothing. See you tomorrow. Hang in there, man. Wait for me for when I get round to the front. Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here. Please? C'mon, just do it. Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her. Look at those eyes. Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her. I'm gonna call her. What's a scam? Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall. We ate together. We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event. The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date? 'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride. I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about. That was a mistake. The rain on my car is a baptism. The new me. Iceman, power Lloyd. My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey. If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise. I'm going to take out Diane Court again. No. You just described every great success story. Alright, it's alright. How's it going? Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything? Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon. So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay. Alright, high level air safety tips. If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right? Okay, good, this is all very noble. One more time would be nice. What? Hurt me again? Not a chance, don't worry about it. You do? What do you want? What do you want? Then don't do it. What is that? What are you doing with your hands? Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila. What, I'm sorry I said that. Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it. You told your dad? Did you tell anybody? She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you. Did you talk to Corey? Is this because of your dad? You shared it with a dick. Yeah you do. I feel like a dick. You must think I'm a dick. Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other? It sounded like you did. 'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me? Okay, what did we just decide? Okay. It's good knowing this. Okay, how much time do you need? I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. You need to study? What's wrong? Say what? What? This is a good level, isn't it? I was just going to tell you that I love you. I said it. How do you know what I'm going to say? I've never sent a letter like that, you know? I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you... Why didn't you tell me? It did? Check your mail tomorrow. I sent you a letter, a letter. I don't know. I'm happy. I don't think I am. I don't think so. No. Are you comfortable? Let's get outta here. You want to? Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson. Now, go into second. Little more gas... Yeah! You can get this whole problem. Now, maybe you downshift to first? Little more gas. Ease it up. Hold on- minor setback. Now you feel confident, right? Yeah, a little bit. Listen, this is important. When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in. Okay, this is important... If you'll just maybe ease it into second. Yeah. Now, when you feel like you're confident,... You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right. Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it. Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around. Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little? Yeah. With potential. Don't worry about it. We're just having coffee. We'll be anti- social. No. It's okay, everybody does that. What did you say? Wait, wait. You told her about me? Okay. I'll see you there. Bye. Okay, bye, I will. Really? Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here, Well, except for one thing. I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat. And they just jammed their mouths, you know? The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me. You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers Me? Sure I do. Won't you see me later? After work? Oh. Mmmm. I think you should wear that. Nice one. Boy, this is a mother dictionary. Yeah. Today is tomorrow. Sixteen weeks is a long time. So am I. I want to see you again. I want to see you as much as I can before you leave. I said it. Job? Being a great date. Basic. Hmmm. What? Twisted? Watch out for that glass. Sure I do. It's just you and your dad, right? That's cool then. They knew of you. Now they know you. Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe" Have a good sleep. I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer. It's the worst job since keymaster. So we can finally talk? No. Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys. No. They're Bavarian Death style pretzels. Yeah Whoa. Goodbye. Eight. Eight O' clock. Alright. This is really great. Alright, we're going out. It's a date. It's a scam. Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock? You will? Excellent, alright, this is great. You will, really? Pardon me? No tips. I won't give you any tips of any kind. Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months, Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party. This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he, What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's? So you're monumentally busy? Are you busy on Saturday? Are you busy on Friday? Busy? Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out. Do you wanna go out? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember? Quick question - do you know who I am? Yeah. Whoah, what a day, huh? Yeah. I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible. Yeah. I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back. No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing! Hello, Diane? Look at those eyes. Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break. Hook up the jab, hook up the jab. He's back. Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'? Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength. Poor little man. Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right? That's gotta be a good thing. It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'. Read that. I know this part, keep reading. I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay? I know. But then I reconsidered. 'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter. I'm good at it. I know I know. Am I going? Am I going to England? I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right? What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy? There's no way. That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir. She wouldn't get out of the car. I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car. But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um... I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something. I'm going to give you another chance. Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening. Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you? Hi, Lloyd. This is my eighth and final call... You mean like career? Uh, I don't know. I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that. So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future. As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell. Your training sticks as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet. I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter. I'm totally and completely serious. Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves. How do you pay for one of those? How ya doing? Is she around? Hello. Heard about that graduation present. Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me. I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back. I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink. Kickboxing. You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future? Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport? I can see by your face, no. My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours. Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir. Pleasure to meet you. Okay. Good afternoon. Goodbye. She's really pretty great, isn't she? Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she? Oh. Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342. Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall. No. No. Uh... okay... um... Hello. May I please speak with Diane please? Diane Court. My car. Stop freaking with her head man. Just stop playing with her mind, you know? She's a human being. She's a person. She's very talented, you know. Joe. Joe. She's written sixty-five songs. They're all about you. They're all about pain. How many people really know what they want though? I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know. But I know that I don't know. My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings. I mean, there's no possible way. What? No way. How ya doin' Miss Evans? How you doin', brother? Alright. Key? I'm Lloyd Dobler. I called her up. Yeah. What? Hey. I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty. Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something. I don't know. I was just going to kind of move around. I was gonna... Oh, I was just going to... You know Diane Court? I got a question. If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere? Yeah, alright. Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep. You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL! I love you too. Alright!You've gotta get her out of your head, man. Hey man, I was in love once. I got hurt really bad. I never wanna go through that again. It's your castle, man. Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first. Diane Court is a showpony. You need a stallion, my friend. Walk with us and you walk tall. Later for you, Luke. We're full on bonded. I love you man. Give me my firebird keys! I love you man We finally graduated, big dude guy!I don't really know where we are. Ooop, excuse me. This is great, this gives me hope. Thanks. Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you? Yeah, hey, oh god. Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you? Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam, huh? Mike Cameron, how you doing? Oh boy.I'll put this past my boss I can put that together. And I want to turn the home over to the state. One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months. I can't give you that. This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years. He's been getting it from every end. I'd love to hear his story.Certainly. Diane, everybody loves that you showed up. I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd. You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up. Why am I yelling? Thanks a lot Lloyd. A very responsible young man you're out with tonight. Wow, man. Well. Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster. It's gotta stay purple. All night. Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?My pain? Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly. Bring me the ship or I will destroy you! He doubts me. You doubt me? Then I shall make use of this starship. This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier? And how did you breach the Barrier? Magnificent. You are the first to find me. It is I. The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle! Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down. Rescued at last. But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position. Following new course. Warp seven. New course? You have no authority. What's going on here? Sulu, what are you doing? And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates. Admit it. We're lost. What's Emergency Landing Plan B? DO it. Go to Red Alert. Raise shields. Position, Bird of Prey?I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces. We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances. You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet. This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences. This is the Starship Enterprise.No, but you can bet they will. Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely. Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk. The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs... The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages. I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III. Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we? Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.Understood. Kirk out. Have the Klingons responded? Oh, please. With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant. On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?" You caught me on my way to the shower. Bob? Can we have it quiet? Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now! Mr. Scott, you're amazing. Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it. Which way to the turbo shaft? If we could send a distress signal... Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way. I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott. Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on. You told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened? Go, Sulu. Transporter room. Status. Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth. Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu. Put it on the screen. Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please? Why didn't you beep my communicator? Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back. Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart Spock? Spock, I thought I was going to die. Spock? What is this? Spock... don't. Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge. To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge. Spock. Fire the rockets! Spock... the booster rockets. It must be all those marsh melons. Hmmm? The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here. New word. "b".. "a"... um... "a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word. You're right. I'm a little out of practice. Uh....that's an "s." That's a little vague, Spock - Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not. But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned. Is what possible? This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he? How do you know? There's got to be a way out of this place. He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's... Why didn't you tell me this before? I gotta sit down. There, you see? See? You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother. You mean he's your brother brother? You made that up! Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't... I ordered you to defend this ship. You stay out of this! Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger. Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass! What you have done is betray every man on this ship. Damnit, Spock. God damnit! Let me do something. An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him. Be one with the horse. Spock. We don't have 1.2 hours. Mr. Sulu. Execute. That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City. Damn. Let's go. Fascinating. Why? What do you mean? Who is it he reminds you of? But he does seem familiar? Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan? What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost. General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd. Not General Korrd. I could use a shower. Goodnight, Spock. Goodnight, Bones. Go to sleep, Spock. Yes, Spock? Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim. Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in? The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in. Doctor, if you please. "Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..." Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?" "Pack Up Your Troubles." That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing? What are you doing? I've always known... I'll die alone. Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me. Oh, God Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one... On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while? MM.? Because it's there. I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain... Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods? Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully... What makes you think I won't turn us around? No special conditions? About the ship... You are mad! Your vision? Wait! You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier. No. I refuse. No... I didn't. Spock... What have you done to my friends? The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew? I'm afraid of nothing. You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier. I'll take you to the bridge. In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually. Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take- James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know. Perhaps I have a way to bring one here. What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship. Join my quest. The power was within you. Let us explore it together. Your pain runs deep. Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.I don't have a clue. But the shuttle- Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked. Closing. Shuttle en route. She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you. Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it. Captain, we can't trust anyone now. Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up. Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push. Aye, Captain How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job... I think you gave me too much time, Captain. Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition. Or yours. He's not? Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise. They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard. Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most. Uhura, I thought you were on leave. "Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we? Borgus Frat.I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother. Not possible. You were never alone. Welcome aboard, Captain. I believe we are witnessing my birth. It's all right, Captain. Proceed. ...mark two. The emergency channel, open. If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate. It would appear we are too heavy. Uh-uh. I believe I have found a faster way. There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room. "c."... "k." A "t." I am here, Captain. Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known. There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist. That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan. Is it possible? He did have pointed ears. The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape. This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof. I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry. Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers. I have a half brother. Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother. I did not. No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek. You ordered me to kill my brother. If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead. If you think it would help. Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me. Captain, what have I done - You must allow us to act. Exactly 15.5 seconds. Yes, Captain. Yes, Captain? At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours. To land any closer would risk detection. Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563. Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear. When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return. He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic. He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors. The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief. There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary. I do not often think of the past. He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth. I cannot be certain. Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have. The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command. Yes. Goodnight, Doctor. Yes, Captain. Life is not a dream. Jim. Captain? I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words. That song did not come up in my research, Captain. Are we leaving, Captain? Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong. I am preparing to toast a marsh melon. I don't understand. Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain. Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock. I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods. I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation. Ah, Captain? And that is? I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken. I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me. Sybok, we must find a way... Sybok. Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God! Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you. I belong here. I cannot go with you. Do you? I hide no pain. No. I will not. Sybok, you must surrender. I am a Starfleet Officer. It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-It runs deep. Share it with me. I couldn't help but notice you pain. The ship.... No, no, it's not possible. Why? Why have you done this to my friend? He has his doubts... It will be your chariot! It could. Yes. With a starship! We sought only your infinite wisdom. It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it. Qual se tu? Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted. What's going on? Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates. Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind? A Federation starship. Spock... What have I done? Because you, too, must know. No conditions. The ship needs its Captain. Am I? We'll see. Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side. But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true? Now learn something about yourself. I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that? I don't control minds. I free them. Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality. What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear. Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out? I trust your message was received? We must change our course at once. What are you doing? No! No reply. Remain on course. But I thought Captain Chekov.. I see. Very clever, Captain. Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say? Who are you? I must have your starship. No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me. This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity... I don't understand.. Reveal yourself to me! I don't understand... Why not? Spock? I know you better than that. Each man's pain is unique. You know I'm right. Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk. Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge? No. You must kill me. Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help. I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big. Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
