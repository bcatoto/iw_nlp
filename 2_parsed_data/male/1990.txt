None of your business. What the hell are you doing? But the boss knows I always been loyal. How come I never hearda you before? That's a lotta crap. What're you talkin' about? You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap. Call the skank now or I start redecorating. What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her. What? Fine. So call her. Get her over here. Man, you got a bad attitude. You're attractive, you're smart. Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do-- I never woulda done it. Probably not, anyway. I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool. Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know? Comin' off hard. Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is. No wire. Guess again. Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras. He wants you to come see him.Where? Can I say something in my defense? Nothing happened between me and Tia. You didn't tell me you lived with her. Could you give us a moment. Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank. You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are. Do you know why I went after Justine? Justine was not an unwilling participant. You're not still pissed? How're ya doin', Max. But I'm afraid of-- No way. Lemme put some clothes on. What? Where're we going? What is it? You're roommates? What are you doing here? I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried. I was crazy about you...am crazy about you. But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away. It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.Theo rode for this place a long time, man. It concerns only Jah. But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High. Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman." Nobody there to sign for it, mon. What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover. Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery. He escaped from custody after 4 days. Hasn't been seen or heard from since. And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot. On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos. I did a search and came up with this. With your help. Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation. But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden. Wasn't s'posed to, but it did. And it's back to the law of the jungle. You got your predators and you got your victims. You are involved. By being alive you're involved. These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder. The oldest is twelve. The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped. Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat. Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead. Deeds, not words. I need your help. It turned up on the black market. One of my sources thought I might be interested. Open it. On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone. Once and for all. It was war, Max, and you won. I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do. So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences. Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out. My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule. Everything happens like it's supposed to. Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord. Somebody's got to. You're a soldier, Max. That's what you were put here for. But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up. She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me. So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow. They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down. She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers. You know who Sonrisa is? The woman you met, Lauren. She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar. The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area. Your help. I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them. Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best. Hardly... A girl. The technical term for you is "chimera"... How much do you know? How well do you remember the lab? The bar code on your neck, Max. I know who you are and I know who you're running from. He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier. L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures. Then the lightbulb went off. C'mon, Max. First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment. The other one like you... Suppose I could help you locate the other ones. Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about. No, I meant this. C'mere, I want to show you something. I haven't been able to get you off my mind. I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention. But I had to see you. Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out-- It's alright, Peter, we're fine. You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here. That would be appropriate, yes. So saw my hands off, I left you a present. You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear. Bent? Me? You're the one who tried to rip off this piece. It was open. I'm not a half bad cook. Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time? Yeah... You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse. Something. People had a choice, even if they took it for granted. And now they don't. Look around at all this... Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life. Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared. They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands. Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them. Fortunately, my needs are met in that department. One of my sources. Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa. Lauren's not my wife. Too early to tell. Now you know who I am, where I live. I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me. Wasn't that hard. The one you're wearing? Can we go somewhere and talk? Logan Cale. We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night. Who is... So, what, you liked it because it was shiny? You have good taste. French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus. We're just a little tense right now... It's okay. You're lucky. I almost pulled the trigger. I was expecting someone else. Thank God. You're a thief? I'll wait. Any idea when she'll be back? I need to talk to her. But she does work here? Know where I can find her? I'm looking for a lady who works here.This. Okay, okay. I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to? No? Yeah. Bruno's girlfriend. This won't hurt. Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D. Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out. Who's Camille? Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk. He's got exposure. He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance. This is what your life's worth, Bruno. I'm outta Portland. Sonrisa didn't want local talent. Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient. It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is. I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down. Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job. Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape. You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it. See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life. You haven't figured this out yet, have you? You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around. You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack. That's not why we're here. Actually, that's not gonna be necessary. I like to keep it professional, that's all. Sooo...whattya think? Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date. Play a little miniature golf or somethin'. Yeah? Yeah, sure, I understand. Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is. Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works. You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in. I'm on a break. Don't look down. Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops. Out there. No time. It's a sweep. C'mon. Police drone. I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here. I'm really glad we're having this conversation. You're right. I was angry at you. But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault. Can you ever forgive me? Why would I be pissed? I got overhead... You're light a deuce. It's a rule. I don't get involved with guns. Later. I ain't mad at you... A grand. Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later. Thought so. Turned out he wanted me for something else though. I didn't. It was a present from a guy. Every week. Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva. And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either. He's a mistake I made about six months before you did. But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke-- Yeah, me too. I made you coffee. That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little. Hang on, Lauren. We're conferencing in Sophy. Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think. If she hears her kid's voice... Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go. We're not going that route. Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with. Look, I'd really like to... Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet. I know. Damn... Are you alright? SHHH! Don't do that! Zack... He made it... He's alive... Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes. But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening. And you still think you can do something to change that. We're quoting Mom again. And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved. Look, thank you for this but-- I don't know what to say. What's this? That's what soldiers do, right? Well, not me personally. You believe that? I'm sorry. I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'? See you're back and still rocking the boat. That's deep. But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta. They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way. They want me...bad. Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever. Best case, I wind up back in that facility. More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean. I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention. Yeah, I catch your hacks. He's Satan's lap dog, or something. That's low, but this effects me how exactly? I already don't like the sound of this. What's in it for you? You said you could help. Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people. Your basic hodge-podge. Yeah...a made-up creature. Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of... I know they made me. Even got the label on my neck to prove it. I remember fine. I just didn't understand what was going on. They never told us anything except what to do. It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out. We got separated right away. I never knew how many made it. Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me? I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job. You did go through my stuff. You lost me. The other ones? Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong? Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand. You need to get out more. You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl. Yes on all counts. We are not fine. Whoa there, Tex! We've been through all this. How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own? Am I s'posed to be grateful? How do I know you didn't? Bent. Completely different situation. I steal things in order to sell them. For money. It's called commerce. But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent. You got a lotta nerve. Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment-- I won't be staying. Is the social studies class over for today? Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about. So what are you gonna do about it? You miss the good ol' days. Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat. Those good ol' days? So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice? What's your shot in all this? Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday. Girlfriend? How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list? So now you tracked me down. What d'ya think? Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention? How'd you find me? Lemme get my coat. Sorry about your window. Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend-- So this guy walks into a bar and says... The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going. No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast. Whoever that is. I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time. Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy. First time I ever heard that. Girl's gotta make a living. And if I ever catch you coming near my man again... Say the words, "I understand." Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand? This is not a place you wanna go. I think you should go now. Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them. Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month. And so should you. Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you. I know all about how you threatened him. That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble. Look, I don't know what you want-- How do I know you're telling the truth? You said you knew where my fiance was the other night. Who are you? What do you want? Who is it? I'm on my way. Just give it to me. I'll remember. Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day. Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight... I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me. You and me both. Bastard... You're crazy. Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations. How's this about me? Here's your money. As long as you're okay. More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that. You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks. What about the other kids? You get anything on them? She was a nurse. She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the... ...the clinic. There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming. Nothing on Hannah? Then what? Thank you. Who's this guy? This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah. Sorry, I was seven at the time. My name's not kid. It's client. As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle. Now, you got something for me or not? Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here. You did. But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario. Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie. They don't have a lot of moving parts. They're prisoners to their genes. And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes. And because he's my friend. Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson. It's a secret. Gotta go. A fog bank. Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world. A long time. If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking. A little what? Yeah. No. Tell me the truth. Am I a female fog bank? That's odd... I just don't go in with any expectations. What guys do. 'Nother order. Straight. At least he didn't swing with your ride. Morning, Sunshine... Okay...idea. Compromise, right? Bruno here comes with me. He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow. What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights. Can you put that in a bag or something? She's gonna want to hear for herself. She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright. I have sincere eyes. I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this. You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country. I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever. Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business. What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list? You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars... Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service. Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds. Not right now. Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues. You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow. Here's the dealio on Eyes Only. He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid. So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go. Don't believe everything you hear on TV. Probably a touch of what's going around. Playing hooky again? It's payday, need me to pick up your check? Shut-up... Say the words, "I understand." You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish. And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up. Understand? None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't. You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are. Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but-- Easy Sketchy. You don't. I'll give it my best shot. And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move? How'd you get her out of town? Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen. --a philandering pig. You set up on Lydia. When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up. I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie. And why should she? What happens if you level with her? Fight fire with fire. Threaten to go to her husband. A toy? And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way? Does this person have a name? Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic-- And you were a sympathetic ear. Really? Here it comes. The part where the guy turns everything around. You left out condescending. Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending. Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses? I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me. You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh. I'd be pissed off too if I was her. What's up? Hey, Sketchy-- Right, the big one-oh. Quitting time. Grab a cold one? Catch you back at the wall. Theo's dead. I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot. Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot. I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job. How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this. The guy is seriously not well. He's sick. I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check. What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field. I was on call.What're you lookin' at me for? I'm not his next of kin. Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around. Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions. Which is none of your business...or mine. So you just decided to return it to the sender. Or, in this case, the sender's wife. None. Max something. I got no clue where she stays. Can't help you. She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me. Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme. You don't want to. Ladies would be elsewhere. Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might. What about this? Fourteen-thirteen Market. Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already. You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job. For a change. And Theo can't pick up his own check because?... More like deployed in bed asleep. I want you on call here. This is a hot run. Beat it. You're late.That was extreme! Did you see that one guy-- Okay, okay, okay-- True, but-- She was the one-- She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic. No, I'm serious. That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes. You rock, Max. You... Rock... Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you? She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh. Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo. I just don't want Natalie to ever find out. She deserves better. But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me. She tells you how I've been-- So you're straight on how this is gonna go down. Look Max, I made a terrible mistake. One I'll never, ever make again. Natalie and I are soulmates. I know that now. She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that. Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again. Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed. Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out. She's as much as said so. But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her. I'm a toy to her. Lydia. She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie. Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us. Exactly. Hear me out. This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married-- I'm the victim here. But there's another side-- Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged. Max-- I know what you're thinking. But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with. As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much. So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially. Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max. We gotta talk. But I'll take a rain check... I gotta meet Natalie for dinner. Later.Tell everybody hey. What if he's on the level? I know what I got, Max. They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets. Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good. Feel like the dog's dinner. You're the best, Maxie.One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma. Got a pencil? Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone? I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive. Your fiance has four previous wives. His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off. Which is what you oughta do. I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can. Hardware's too sophisticated. It's gotta be the government. And why do I think they're looking for you? They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery. But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture. Whoever tossed this place wants you. And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire. I don't know what your story is and I don't want to. I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance. Lemme get the file. Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners. This kind of search...it's heavy spadework. I'm gonna need-- They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about-- Only a last name would be nice. Or the nearest town to this...clinic. A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail... Then what? That's it. That's all I got. Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine. He says he got it from a woman. Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove. He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing. It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped. So we don't get anything on the seller. Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you. I got a hit on the car. An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers. Right here someplace. You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid. You drive away business roarin' in like that. I asked you to keep that thing outside.Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me. Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing. You know it, Lilly. You're a thousand percent right! That's right. Take a little, leave a little. Not skimming a thing, Lilly? On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much? See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly. You want a drink? Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door. You'll never shit right again. What's that, Lilly? And if you do it wrong? Tell me about the oranges, Lilly. You ever hear about the oranges? I'll loan you a raincoat. You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes? It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it. I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this. You expect me to buy this? Motherhood. What the fuck are you doin with a son? Your what? You wanna talk to me straight up? Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off! One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth? You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me? How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that? You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando. Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn. It's his kidneys. Right in front of the room. I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert. Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean. Oh, everything's the same size, same price. Evening. Welcome to Phoenix. Hah. The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different. Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon! It's all hollow. Nothing behind it. Can't move. You ruined me! You destroyed me! Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer. Want a look? Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken. Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already... Mary Beth! This has never been anything but -- Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money. Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely. Mary Beth, what we have here, uh... You brought a case? Good. Here you are! Two rich people! These machines -- They're in here. We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately. Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in. You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means? The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing? Loose talk is the one thing I worry about. And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.Yes, yes, but that's -- His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital. Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside. The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.Take two, three days. Call when you get there. Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo. Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.Well, I'd have to see it, of course. You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in... I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry. I'll get you a check. Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars. Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased? This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry. I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see. You are a valued customer, as you know. Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.This time... My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting. It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money. I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.That's that, then. No question, huh? Not many. Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock. I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here. Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun. One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound... You up to it now? A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me. Do you have any particular reason to say that? I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon. I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even. That's natural. I realize this is a shock. Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here. Roy Dillon?Fair enough. Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was. Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet. Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities... The truth is, Mr. Kaggs -- I guess I'm just not a leader of men. Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry. Perk. Oh, sure. Fine. Well... But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to -- I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody -- Well, uh... No. What? Me? Sounds like a good Idea. Just myself. So I heard. Lead on. That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman. Roy Dillon. Whadaya say? NO! Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing? There's nothing more to talk about. What? Just trying to help, Lilly. That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes... If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it? Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly. Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out. Well, uh... I don't see why not. I don't? That's right. No. For God's sake, Lilly! What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself. Never. Uh-huh. Not very good! Oh? I didn't know anything was. Oh, you'll live, Lilly. Yeah, sure, that sounds nice. I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either. No. I know you do, so that's why -- I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you -- I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now -- Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself. Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you. You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job. Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over. And Myra's stuff? You must have some money. Don't be sorry. You're not taking it. You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though. This way's perfect. That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix? I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it. No. Myra followed you, huh? Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down. Why should they? The cops are satisfied. You're dead, Lilly, it worked. Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it. I just came back from Phoenix. Going somewhere? Well, that's good news. Well... nice to see you again, Lilly. I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh? You ought to put a bandage on that. Expecting visitors? I pay my debts. Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough? We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants. Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend. That's right. Why? I tripped over a chair. You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that! Lucky? You call that lucky? Bluebell came in? Sure. Up to you. Not as tough as you, huh? How come? You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob. I like those. It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself. What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what? I can take care of my own bills, Lilly. What happened to your hand? I guess I owe you my life. Thanks, uh, Lilly. Nice to see you. What am I doing in here? Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years? They knocked out my tooth! They twisted my arm. In your other hand. I am in school. I can't. I just left home. Let me see how you did that one. You taught me a lot. Then I invented. You watch that mouth. What's that? ) What? I'm happy the way I am. No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you. Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever. What I say is, no. We don't do partners. That's what I say. Don't I get any say in this? Maybe I like it where I am. I don't think I need it. The last I looked, we were just talking things over. Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners? And hello to you, too. Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay? Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out. Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard. Running your broker scam, you mean. You must have some very knowledgeable friends. She didn't see you, in other words. ) The track? Did you run into Lilly? You were gone for a while. Oh, come here. You -- I don't know. What? What for? Yeah? Sure. I'm pretty tired myself. Things a man isn't supposed to know. I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through? Sure. I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them. Take a hike, you mean? I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me. That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it? Upstate where? Where? What happened to Cole? Yeah? How? And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run. I thought these people were broke. And when he got serious? Is that right? I've heard the name. Nobody does that single-o. You talk the lingo. What's your pitch? Myra, I'm not following this. I'm a salesman. Working the what? What? Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work. You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more. See you soon. You ain't seen nothin. We'll rent a car. Because it's comfortable. Every day in every way. Oh, don't be stupid. That's just Lilly's way. I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that. Mama! I just do what the doctor says, babe. You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts. Her job. Oh, yeah? Thanks. How long do they say I'm in here? You called the doctor, huh? Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game? What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage? All? It ain't bad. Oh, I am, baby, believe me. Mm? Let's find out. That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all. Taking you for granite? Always, for you, baby. Oh, yeah. That's that. No, its -- Why did she--? Oh, Jesus. Not many laughs in this room, eh? Well, let's get the shock over with. Ate the gun. Oh. What? Yes, I know, I know. Sure. Let's get it over. Not that it matters. This is the morgue? My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day. It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide. Gun? No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out. Well, mostly, I don't believe it. Thank you. Yes? Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush. That's true, Mr. Simms. Well, thank you. And thank them. Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by. Mr. Simms.Happy to see you looking so good. We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves. Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon. Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--Do you want some help? I can call upstairs. Are you all right? Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game. You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing. Yeah, ever since that ... Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him? By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.Don't bother to call again, okay? I'm hanging up. Listen, Jake. I gotta go. Maybe the demons are real. Maybe there's a larger truth. Maybe it's not the army, Jake. They're not interested, Jake. There's nothing to expose. I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen. It's hard to explain. That's right. We did. Hello. What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?Don't go. Wait ... Daddy. Mom, it's ... It's cold. There was a bang. Daddy, what was that noise?I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay? It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand. I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam. I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it. You mind? I'm eating, huh? You need ... a doctor. Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay? Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they? Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university? Ah! I thought you were a mailman. Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here? The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean? I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.What else did he say, Jake? But the paper ... Why do you say that? You think they're connected? Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back. He say what they looked like? How long had that been going on? What do you mean, demons?No! Oh God. No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain. Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family! No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then. Let me out of here! I don't know. I don't know. This isn't happening. I'm alive. Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead. Take me home. Get me out of here. Like Della. Just to see you. That's all. I see. Della? No, thanks. No, don't. But thanks. I'm okay. Hello, Sam. What do you want from me? Stop!!!! Oh God! Just my luck. Oh, terrific. It's short, huh? I could have told you that. Hey, wait! What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ? Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that? What are you talking about? What do you mean? Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know? Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you? What's going on? How can you just turn away? What about the others? Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this. Well, try, huh. What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why? Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about? Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger. He was upset. He thought people were following him. Don't go? I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe. Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours. Now what? Tell your mother. It was the window. Gabe? What are you doing ... ? War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Used you? Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you? A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something. Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you. Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh? I'm too messed up to teach. I am. Doctor. Ph.D. Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man. This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what. I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy. No. Not really ... A couple of weeks, I think. He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said. He told me he was going to Hell. We should get ourselves a lawyer. Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one. Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on. An explosion, just like Paul's. ... I've seen them, too. Not tonight, Louis. No more rest. I'm walking, aren't I? There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis. What? By myself? I've seen it. It's all pain. I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis. Am I dead, Louis? Am I dead? Louis, you're a life saver. I don't know. I've been having them recently. You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that? I had this weird flash just then. God almighty. What did you do to me? I can't relax. What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos. What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in. She hates me, Louis. Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years! I thought you said she didn't say much. She told you that? Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that. She talk about the boys? Sarah. I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say? What did she have to say? Her knee acting up? What can I tell you? How do you know? Hell, you think I am? But I see them. I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. Please help me. I need your insight, your intuition. Yes. I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis. It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to. Christ, I know how it sounds. I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life. Yes. No. I see them. I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean. I need to know about ... demons. I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady. Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft. I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos. Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all. I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch. I haven't seen her in months. It's good to see you. The postal service. I'm a mailman. Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me. That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him. Whataya mean, no record? Jacob Singer. Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me. Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes. New? He's been here for years. I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please. Save me! I'm not dead. I am not dead. She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious. She was good in bed, though. Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice. What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was? This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy. Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed. It's freezing. Goddamn it. I want Louis. No. Don't move me. I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had. They stole it. My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor. TELL ME, DAMN YOU! WHO ARE YOU? Goddamn you! Oh God! This isn't happening. Where have they gone? No! What's going on? Where's my family? Where are they? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys? Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say. Stop it, Jez. Don't do that. Don't be funny. West. I picked up my ticket. I'm leaving in the morning, Jez. Mid-town mostly. Then don't bug me. Shit! Can't I just have a bad day? Goddamn it. Why do you say that? I'm tired. I'm not upset. I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten. Well leave then. Go to Hell. You know goddamn well what I mean. That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana. I don't know you. Why won't you answer me? Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me. With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away. TELL ME, DAMN YOU! WHO ARE YOU? Who are you? What are you doing to me? What's going on? Where have they gone? No! What's going on? Where's my family? Where are they? What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys? I love you when you're angry. No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable. I promise. No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you. It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone. Stick with me, kid. I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie. Me neither. Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez. I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do. I have no idea. I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God. A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him. I'm not here. You haven't seen me. Don't! I can do anything I want. You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news! Stay away from me, Jez. Let go! Jezzie? I don't believe this. What's he talking about? What? What do you mean? Why didn't you call me? He did? When? In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real. You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone. Underneath all the bullshit, just love. I love you, Jez. With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away. You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up. What? Are we in Brooklyn? Am I home? Help me! Help me! Hey, I'm not dressed. Jezzie! My feet are throbbing! Don't gimme that. I can't do it. Look at me. I'm ice cold. You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die. Coming here? What'd the doctor say? What are you talking about? I'm freezing. What the hell are you doin'? How high is that? What does it say? What's it say? A hundred and two? If I could stop it, I'd stop it. Show me Della! Where's Della? Bring her here? Where? Where are we? I wanna leave. Get me out of here. They weren't human! Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me. They're like demons, Jez. What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures? When was the last time I said a word? Why do you bring her up? I'll be glad to avoid the crush. I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me. I'm going home. How's it going? Ready? I just want to look ... Wait. Don't. Gabe. Well, you didn't marry her. She looked good then. What do you mean you can see? What? Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College. Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida. What's in here? I must have been out of my head. And look what I got. Yeah, but for what? You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny? And where do you think Jezebel comes from? They're Biblical. They were prophets. Eli. Why can't you remember their names? Who? Jed? Thanks. What's that? Jezzie, I can't see. I don't know. No. Have you seen my glasses? Don't ask. Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time. Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow. What do you mean? Thanks. Where to? If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was. Where is the lamp? I didn't want to wake you. What the hell did you do, move all the furniture? I don't know what to say. No. I couldn't. I would have stayed there if I could. Mike, it was real. It was glorious. It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there. I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle. What's happening? Help me. I can't move. I think I'm falling asleep. One drop? I don't know. What is it? Never? How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something? You come here often? So why tell me now? If you knew, why didn't you say anything? Who then? But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there? None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive? Like it was yesterday. The Ladder? Yeah, sure. We were losing the war. Shows how much you knew. Long time ago. I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me? No. I'll take the other one. Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably. You got a nice tan, though. How was Palm Springs? Where's Wong? They're awfully heavy. Yeah, you and everyone else. Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet? Excuse me. Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep. Help me! What?! What is wrong with you? You come near me and I'll blow us all up. For what? For seeking the truth? Help me! This is not a dream! This is my life. Last night! They were as real as you are! That's a lie. My family was here. Where's Sarah? Where did she go? She was here ... I'm awake? Where am I? Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue. Call my chiropractor. Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there. You come home with me. I don't know. I don't know. The army? What is it Paul? What's happening to me? Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams. Everywhere, like a plague. I've seen them too ... the demons! Don't do anything. Paul, I know what you're talking about. It's okay, Paul. It's okay. Why not? Who, Paul? What exactly ... ? Who is? You in trouble? What's goin' on Paul? That black car? What's wrong? You can't talk in Brownsville? Why the hell we drivin' here? Nope. It's not worth it. You'll never win. It's almost like a conspiracy, huh? You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed? Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds. Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick. Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor? Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life? Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years? Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned! Speaking. Hello. No. No. It's okay. I'm okay. Blew up? What do you mean it blew up? How did it happen? Jesus, Jesus! ... When? Died? I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?Me, too. Grass never did that to me. Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something? How do you know?Do you want me to get someone? No one knows. They say it blew up. Last month, before Thanksgiving. A car accident. I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died. Can I help you?Jake, you need to rest. What are you talking about? You can barely stand. What are you doing? You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try. Perfect. We got it. Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand. You ever read Meister Eckart? How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart? Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side. Well, I'll see what I can do about it. From a slipped disc? That'd be a first. Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you? I know. Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you. What? I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit. Wiggle your toes. If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong. Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office. You should go back to her. Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake. She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out. She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you. She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months. Ah, good. Now turn to your left. Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out. Who? Turn on your right side. How about the other "right?" I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left. A bit. I saw Sarah the other day. I know you. How come you're so tense today? Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.Save the words ... Just send back my credit card. What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too. This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be. Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me. I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here. Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back. Well that's good to know. Better living through chemistry, that's my motto. And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone. Just relax. Pleasant dreams. It's strong stuff. "Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh? Stick out your tongue. That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax. Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on. I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue. I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it. Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me. Sometimes. When it's convenient. Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help. The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business. I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records. Yeah. But not with the Cong. A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it. A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought. Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember. That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder. Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know. Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder. No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies. Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there? Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse. So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68. Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors. Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind? I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home. They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something. She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us? They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire. I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army. Oh God. I know. I know. God almighty. I thought I was the only one. You've seen them? What do you mean? I don't know what to do. They're waitin' for me, that's why. I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home. Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild. They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind. That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me. Yeah. I don't know. Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em. Let's get a couple drinks, okay? Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us? I'm not sure where I can talk anymore. I just need to talk. You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous. Still married, Jake? You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh? No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it. Count 'em on one hand. I work in a bakery. I need to see you. I need to see you, Jake. Nothin' much. A long time. Paul Gruneger! Jacob Singer?If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form? You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here. I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files. What's your name? Our doctors are seen by appointment only. Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment? Carlson? Is he new here?I don't have to ask if you can feel that. I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little. We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call? Who did? Your back? Did you fall?What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange. That was set. I'm tellin' you. Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that. Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident. I say you should get a shrink. Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you. Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall. Not me, buddy. Dr. Carlson's dead? Shit! It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.Push 'em back. That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. He'll never make it. Total delirium. He's burning up. Dream on! Clear the area. This is an order! We're not going to hurt you. Please come quietly. Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest. Push 'em back. That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. Total delirium. He's burning up.Ah, shit. You got me. I ain't even married. Now put your fucking hands in the air! Lemme ask you a question. Ever fuck a mutant? I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down... Well, there it is; the Last Resort. Sure you wanna go in? Cheap domes. And no air to screen out the rays. Freaks?...'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory. Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not First time on Mars? You're getting off to an early start. So, where to? Oh, the usual. More money, more freedom, more air. Welcome to Mars. Over there man. He ain't got five kids to feed. Hey, I got four kids to feed. I think my grampa might be here. And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air. Whatcha doin' to me, man?! I got six kids to feed! Need a ride?I'd advise you to hurry. Never mind. Wet a towel and wrap it around your head. That'll muffle the signal. Don't bother looking. It's in your skull. They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.There you go, Mr. Brubaker. Suite 610 in the East Wing. I'll go encode your room key. Identification? Hmm. It seems you left something in our safe. Would you like the same suite? Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.You're nothing! You're nobody! You're a stupid dream. Well all dreams come to an end. I didn't want it to end this way. I wanted Hauser back. But nooo. You had to be Quaid. Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up... Impossible. Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet. Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on. My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people. Fire it up, Doc. Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes. And you like Melina, right? Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right. She's gonna be Hauser's babe. Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you. Perfect, my ass! --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you. Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked. The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us. We gave you lots of help. Benny here... He wasn't in on it. You set him off by going to Rekall. That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics. You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato. The fucking mutants could always sniff us out. So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole. Don't be modest. Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing. Well, my boy, you're a hero. Kill him. Don't be an idiot. Perfect!...Get out of Sector G. Now. Don't think. Do it. Stop fighting and get out. Great! Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass. Now let's get down to business. Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head. And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic. Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening. --Do you think you can play along? Who told you to think?! I don't give you enough information to think! You do what you're told!! That's what you do! I know that. Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system. As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want. Anything. If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end. Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person? Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that? I want him back in place with Lori. Lori says he can't remember jack shit! If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth. What the fuck is going on down there?!It's a symbol. Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep. Swallow this. No need to be rude. I'll do it. Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?" What about the girl? Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified. Is that a coincidence? Think about it. Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday. And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent. I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure. I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down. Not exactly. What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes. But you're inventing it yourself as you go along. You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console. At Rekall. I'm quite serious. You're not here, and neither am I. I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now. This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.O.K., everybody pull out! Richter! Call from Cohaagen. Arrest that woman! Where? Not since you lost him. Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.They found us! Everybody out! Shit! Wrong. Kuato's a mutant. So don't get upset when you see him. Yes, you do. That's why we brought you here. -- Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain. And Kuato's gonna dig it out. You tell me. Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless. You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine? On his way. Sit down. If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning. Hey, hey Tony. Give the big guy a break.Unh-uh, pal. You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else. You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble. You blabbed, Quaid! You blabbed about Mars! Come on, let's go have that drink. Let me buy you a drink. Yeah, you did. I told you not to but you did anyway. You went to Rekall, remember? How was your trip to Mars? Hey, Quaid! Don't fuck with your brain, pal. It ain't worth it. A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized. Well don't. "RekallRekallRekall." You thinkin' of goin' there? Oh, Rekall. Rekall?Look at this shit. I've got a lock! There! He's not at ground level. I've got a weak signal over there. That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere. What is it? Level 2. Galleria. I've got Quaid. I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it. I don't blame you man. I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady. Up to the right.Thanks for taking Johnnycab. The fare is eighteen credits, please. Would you please repeat the destination? Welcome to JohnnyCab. Where can I...? The door opened. You got it. I'm sorry. Would you please rephrase the question.Ernie, dump him in a cab. Around the corner. Tiffany, you help him. I'll destroy his file and refund his money. And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid. Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall. Oh shit....Oh shit... Why not? Use your head, you dumb bitch! He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip! What the fuck is going on here?! You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?! I'm with an very important client. What is it? What's he talking about? I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet. Now you tell me. Is that worth three hundred measly credits? Aaah, let me tantalize you. You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission. People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman... You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip. You. You're the same. No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you. Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself. I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip". Whatever you say...Just answer one question. What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken? Smart move. Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options. You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket. Look at the statistics. I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference. Guaranteed, or your money back. As real as any memory in your head. First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights: Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course... Venusville. Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits. That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail. --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant. Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is. To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em. Right. Mars. Now help me out here, Doug. You were interested in a memory of... Good to see ya. Right this way. Doug...Bob McClane.What happened to number five? Take me to the hotel. And you get a kickback. Why not? What happened to them? Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....? Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of. The Last Resort. What to the rebels want? What was that? An accident? You got the job. Where's yours? What's wrong with this one? How'd you find me? Who are you? What do you want? May I use your pen? Thank you. Get it, please. Definitely. Thank you. I am Quaid. Do you expect me to believe you? What are you afraid of? Turn it on. Come on, Cohaagen! You got what you want. Give these people air! The guy's a fucking asshole. Who is it this time--my mother? Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet. Sorry. Too perfect. So why am I still alive? Get your story straight. This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall. --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant. He's lying. Hauser turned against you. Fuck you. Sleazy...and demure. Brunette. Hetero. Not really. I've just always been fascinated by Mars. Eight years. Two-headed monsters? Nice to meet you. What is it? Suppose I do...then what? You open it. That's right. She's real. I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall. Bullshit. It's all coincidence. How much is Cohaagen paying you for this? Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you? Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming! And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me. Amazing. Where are we? Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me. I'm listening. What do you want? Melina! C'mon! You're Kuato, right? I don't know. What, aliens? Yeah. Where's Kuato? We don't have much choice then, do we? Relax, you'll live longer. Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else! Are you crazy?! I don't know anything about Mars. What the fuck did I do wrong?! Tell me! Harry, what the hell is this? No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow. What are you, my father? I did? What trip? Harry! No shit... Why not? I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. They sell fake memories. Hey Harry...Harry! You ever heard of Rekall? Quit while you're ahead. Anywhere! Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!! Drive! DRIVE!! How did I get in this taxi?! Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter. Bullshit. Right. That's why you tried to kill me. I suppose you're not here either. Yeah. Some of it was fun. Clever girl. I didn't know you were so kinky. I'm honored. O.K. then. If I'm not me, then who the hell am I? Bullshit. Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too? And falling in love? You think I'm an idiot? Remember our wedding? The hell you're not. Not talk! I said TALK!! You call this a paranoid delusion?! They did! But I killed them! Forget Rekall, will you! These men were going to kill me... --I got a trip to Mars. Let me finish! I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and... I don't know! It had something to do with Mars. Harry from work...He was the boss. No! Spies or something. And Harry from work...Get down! Some men just tried to kill me! Bye. Lori, don't you understand? I feel I was meant for something more than this. I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody. I'm late. Lori, move. All right, forget about it. Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists. Just think about it. Move to Mars. Let's do it. Lori... You know I do. Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams. But I'm always home by morning. I don't know. Nobody. Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream! Who? Mmmm..... Let me go! They'll be here any minute! They'll kill you all! Go on. Secret agent...How much is that? I'm not interested in that. I give up. No options. All right. What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund? Come on, don't bullshit me. How real does it seem? What's in the two week package? I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars. That a problem? Mars. Nice to meet you. I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream? The whole core of Mars is ice. The reactor melts it and releases oxygen. Cohaagen knows it makes air. But the bastard won't turn it on. It's just up ahead. Aliens built it. The one in the mine! The reactor. Are you all right? Are you still you? He's lying. I don't need Kuato for that. Like what? What can I do? I saw them. Not bad, for a hooker. Just wondering. By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall? Now what? So you dropped by to apologize? I thought you didn't like me. Melina, please...People are trying to kill me. He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good. Melina, Hauser sent me to do something. Inside what? Don't be ridiculous. Why would I lie to you? Forget I said wife. She wasn't really my wife. Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ... I didn't lose it. Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else. Me. Not any more. Hauser left me a note. I don't remember you. I don't remember us. I don't even remember me. I don't remember you. There's something I have to tell you... I guess he didn't. Blondes. I love you. What was I doing on Mars?! Damn! ...Who are you? Wait! I gave you?It's about goddamn time. I say we throw the switch and see what happens. Yes, sir. They've got Quaid! They're protecting him! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. But I thought... He had help. From our side, sir. No, sir. That's now. In an hour, he could have total recall. We can't let him run around. He knows too much. I'm trying to neutralize a traitor. Pull them out. This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down. HER! There! The woman! Quaid! That's Quaid! Watch your mouth, Captain. Any news of Quaid? What the hell is this? Come on! Up! Split up. Find him. I've got him. The guy in the turban. Shit! He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars. Where is he? What was that? I couldn't hear you. Are you saying she liked it? I want that fucker dead. Where?We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars. You asked me to find you if you disappeared. So here I am, good-bye. What? I'm leaving it here. Come get it and keep moving. This is the suitcase you gave me.My cannon. Cannon fuse. How much you think? You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!? What? Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place! We had food, water... Roger that. Yeah, still got one poking around. Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to do? No problem. You stupid punk! You came that close, that close!! Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town. You guys all set? Some kind of mutation...? Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door. "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain." What do you think? Max firepower or...? I think I scared it! Damn! Val, we can't get them. Never figured on having to shoot through dirt! Best goddamn bullet stop there is. Come back. Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace... What the hell's going on in town? Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready... Well, who put you two in charge? She's got my vote. Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right? That's fine. We've got some new things to teach them. In a minute. What's under the ground? We're not getting up on the roof. Earth shelter's the best. Known that since I was a kid. Val? What the hell you doing back already? Just barely, Pham. What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on? Come back. Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency. I'm on forty-nine. What the hell you doing back already? A beauty, isn't it? We bought three of them for the rec room.What do you use it for? What the hell is that, anyway? I don't know... They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds? You can't fight'em that way... That's four. Let us know if it starts moving, Burt. Hang on, Burt. The bastards are up to something. Yeah, like they got a plan... Good. You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail. So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains... Okay, Burt, listen. Forget shooting them. Tell me this: can you get to your truck? One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass. Ready as we'll ever be. Or a big mother slug maybe? Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things. You bet. You gonna be staying up here? Howdy, Rhonda. Where the hell are they? Hope they didn't wise up. So...now what? No. We go straight. He'll never make it! They're gonna get him! Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum... No good. You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail. You know, up the jeep trail. You know, Val went to that college, too. For a whole year. Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million. I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here. We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death. I'd vote for outer space. No way those are local boys. Well, at least the bastard can't climb. Pardon my French. I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in. Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else. Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead? No problem. Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out. Well, we'll ask around. Let you know if we hear of anything. Oh yeah? Think about this: She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man. For my part, I'd be proud to have her. I'd goddamn worship her. She likes both of us. We both helped her out. Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself. She just practically asked you for a date. What the hell is wrong?! You're not civil, you're glum. We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me. Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil. Yeah...but no ties. People ? Hell, National Geographic . Road's in! Light it, man! LIGHT IT!! What the hell are you doing?!! I want to live for the three days. Use the fucking bomb! Or just knock us over. Look, use the bomb! Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope... Well...that's it. We're not getting off this rock... Jesus, Val, it's pretty far. I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there. Don't worry about me, jerkoff. I'm best at driving the Cat. Like hell you are. We got a plan! Doesn't matter. The cat can pull any thing. A car, huh? Like a big armored car? Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer! Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons. No way they could stop it. Wait a minute...the Cat. Could we take the Cat? Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway. Shut it up! Shut the little bastard up! I'm gonna kick his ass! You're right, don't matter where they come from. You go north, I'll go south. Run for it? Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails. You're not even trying to come up with a plan! Don't he have a home to go to? Well, folks, what's the plan? You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here. Son of a god damned bitch! Been waiting there all this time. How the hell's it even know we're still here? Fuck you, too. Pardon my French. Well...haven't seen a sign for hours. Maybe it's long gone. I think we wait right here. Okay, now, how far's your truck? Prairie dog burrow... Yeah. Where's your truck? Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway. Pham Van don't get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks! Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of any thing like this before? This is one big mother! What the hell are they? Shut up! They got wind of something they don't like! Why would they do it? Here's the plan...We don't even stop. Ride like hell. Tonight we keep right on going. We'll walk the horses. Car's gone. We just missed them, that's all. That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark. You want the rifle or the Smith? Relax. A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick. A man who plans ahead. Slick as snot and I'm not lying. It must've grabbed us. That's why the truck stalled-out. Hey, I don't want spend the night out here! You're hung up again. Val! Val! Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now. Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead. Oh, Jesus!! Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way. We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee. You got that right. Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do? Camp out down below and just wait for him to die? Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger... Reckon he hated Perfection more than us? You suppose he wanted to kill himself? You're full of shit. One job I'd never take is working around electricity. Adios, bridge! We did it! We faced temptation and we did not bend! She's got us. Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection. Uh oh, it's Nancy. She wants another load of firewood. In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection. We gotta better ourselves." You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here? You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right now ? Damn it, Val! Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this! Car wash?! That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that. We could. We could. But we'd have to get really serious. It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place. You gotta ask that ? Catch it later, Pham. Gotta get over to Nestor's. I thought you called it your pecker. Look, don't make the mistake I made. Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me? Here with you. Don't matter. They're all the same: dead weight. Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails. Make my skin crawl! ...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter... Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z... Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her. You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her. Nah, it's September. Must be the new one. Nestor's out of town tomorrow. We don't dig today. We don't get paid today. Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead. You never take the long view. Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday. It is Monday, right? Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor. You're gonna get us hung up. Has a lot of rain. Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment. I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and... I was in one. A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree. Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon. Wasn't so damn funny, I can tell you. No...it was eggs. I did eggs. You didn't cook breakfast?You bet. I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her. If that ain't the truth. And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred. Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those. She wants to lay down. I'm a little worried.God, what a stink! Am I sure?! It was right there. There's the cord. It's...gone...! Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time. What? The con...! Oh my God. I'm dead. Let's finish in the morning.I'd do the same. Well, catch you Thursday. We playing cards tonight? Forget it. I got vegetables coming out my ears. Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as seen a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres. Well, I brung her something I know she likes. How's she doing?I've got a plan. You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby. Get us some help. Okay, ten dollars. I didn't do it! What's going on? And I appreciate it. Hey Val, listen. Bearing going out, you think?BACK OFF, BURT...! Right. We're gonna run. Get ready. Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles. Be there in two hours, tops! Damn it! They'll sink this rig just like a boat! Let's go you two. We're headed for the mountains. Listen! Listen! We know what they are! They're big things under the ground! Much bigger than we thought! They're coming after you! They're coming right now! Burt, get out! Get up on your roof or someplace! We found out what's been killing people! They're under the ground! Burt! This is Val! Get out of your basement!! Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof! Then we'll talk, okay?! Burt, can you hear me now? You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely... We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece! You are so full of shit... What? Somebody paying you to do this? Civil? I'm civil. No ties. Sell the movie rights. We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar. Road's in! Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in People magazine... Not yet, not yet... I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!! So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway. It's out last one. We can't kill them all. They're...they're trying to make us move! Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...? Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure. Come on, everybody! We gotta run for those rocks over there! Damn it. What the hell are they doing? They're up to something. Watch your ass, shithead. Only if something happens to me. Get real. I'm faster than you. I'm making the run to the Cat. Well...all right ! We just roll on out of here! Its tires are flat... But...we could pull something! We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it! Jesus. It's slower than hell. We need another plan. How the hell long it take you to change a tire? Chuck him out the door! Like a little hors d'oeuvre. I'm gonna help you. Right. We need to be talking about what we're gonna do. Right. Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options... Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower. First let's see if Stumpy's still out there. Me, too. It's been listening to us. It's got no eyes. It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure... Son of a bitch! Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see? I don't know. If this one's any faster than that other one... God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones. Little sons of bitches. We'll take your word for it. Naw, don't want to winch it. That'd tear it all up. Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps. You got that right! Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them. We just didn't tell you . Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these! We're really in on something here! So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime? Sons of bitches! Oh shit! That is the plan...I mean, goddamn it! What the hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon? Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from? Great. Thank you. The rifle. Screw you. For all you know they could fly . Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners. They better be fast. Fifteen lousy bucks. Yeah! Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...! Fuck you! I am not! Jesus! I don't believe this! Those assholes are supposed to be fixing the goddamn road! Hey! Where are you guys? People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?! Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know? What the hell is going on? I mean WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!! I'll go with that plan. Probably up a pole starving itself to death. Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place. Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst? Come on, sombody must've chased him up there. If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun? He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you. Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground. Jeez, look at that guy. So long, cactus! Damn straight! Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing! That's the plan. Forget it, man. It's not worth it. I'll call that little bluff. How close? What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet. I was up for going to Bixby. I was getting excited. Well, you're the one won't work in the car wash. You're the one's gotta have a plan. Yeah, sure. Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two. So? That car wash pays good, and they're always looking. So what if we just did it...today. Pack up. Drive straight down to Bixby. Get serious. Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them? Right. We plan ahead. That way we don't do anything right now. Earl explained it to me. Well, I'm a victim of circumstance. Tammy Lynn Baxter. Well, sure. Why? What the hell do we know about seismographs? The new one! That's supposed to be a girl! Who the hell's that? That's not what's his name...the grad student? Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today. Do Nestor tomorrow. Do not talk to the driver. Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year. Handymen, Earl. We're handymen. If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him. How many cows does it take to make a stampede? Is it like three or more? Is there a minimum speed? Hell you did. Your turn. Did it yesterday. Franks and beans. Yeah, Heather, we got you. They're tearing down the houses here! We all gotta get outta here together! Now! We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan. Burt! Heather! Yeah, Burt. The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III. Ran into the new college student, Rona. Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham! Twenty. I don't believe this. The phone is out! Pham, your phone is out! You don't get it, Pham. The idea was: we were ripping you off. Could be. LET'S DO IT! Good point. I think the ground's getting closer. I think we do it. We're gonna save our asses here! Yeah, good! Something to keep them busy. We need a decoy. Like what ?! There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains! What?!! Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?! They're working together, too. What's it doing? You paying attention? This oughta hurt like hell. Rhonda's got an idea about that. Yeah. One, two, three... Think it's still following us? You okay? Yeah, vibrations in the ground. Around here? Why would they? Yeah, geography.Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could. I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better. Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening? Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you. Then lemme throw in a couple more things. Y'all take American Express? Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.Someday honey, I will... But I have to be goin' now... Conta i no joras... Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...

Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave. Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?... Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present. You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air. Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant? I don't mean your head head - I'm not gonna piss on your head - your hair an' all... Just piss in the toilet. Y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin' down from Bobby Peru. Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there? Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here? How old are you? Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol. Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em. That's right... Take one of these. She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you? Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby... Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good. This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there. How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?... Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya. Don't think about it too long. You had enough? Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal? Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out. Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor. Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way. Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya? Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested? I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it. Ready for another? Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas. Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now. You an indian? You black? Sorry to hear it. Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today? Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive. Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet? How 'bout a beer? Need a hand? I'm from all over. Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit? That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up... What'd you say? No shit?!?! You know him? The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica. You heard from Reggie? Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me. Told ya I would. You still riled?About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86. Club Zanzibar. Mostly black though in that boogie place. Gas?Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests. How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent. Artie? That you, Artie?That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see. It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did. You hitched yet? Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday. So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya? What'll it be? The regular? Black Label? Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope. Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut? Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting. We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning. No big buildings like in New Orleans. Muchas gracias. He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing. Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45. Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill. Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop. Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.We don't have no paper bags. Yessir. This be it?Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth. Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap. Was in all the papers three years ago. I'm seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed. My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love. She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor. Sailor... Lula loves you.I'm sorry. ...Asshole. Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative. Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that. No sir... Sounds right... I'll check it out. Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it. Set one up. No... She's fine. Back home. Real good, Chet... It's been awhile. Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in. So, it's back to the islands. I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts. Whattaya do there? Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home. Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!! Gotta admit, you guys are - two in four dozen. How's that? Hasta siempre. This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place. Why not? How was the fishin'? I couldn't say, which one? Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'. General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666. In what capacity? Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year. Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business. See ya downstairs. And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight... Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again? All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'. Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde. That bastard Pucinski... Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this? Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help... Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em... Now tell me... Who was that?... Who know's your here? I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it. Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail. What? How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay? Did she tell you where she was callin' from? I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday. I will, Marietta. Goodbye now. Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days. No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em. Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home. Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night... Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side. Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya? Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it. He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm? Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer. I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair. I'm scared, mama. Why we sittin' here, mama? Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man. Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'. My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama? I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like. You ain't actin', mama. What I made you do, mama? How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen. United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase. Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. That is my permiso. But I am also with the government. Oh, many things... Do you know Honduras, Johnny? I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life. The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing. Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland? Hasta siempre. It has its moments of uncertainty. Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened. I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method. Would you like to enjoy a martini with us? The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first? Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA. He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras. In many capacities. Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy. You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation. The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles... The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles. In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said. ...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.What is it? Why should it? What's she doin' here? ...But DAMN man... This better go smooth. Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road... I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby. Forty bucks... Have now. I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby. She really say she was pregnant? When did you talk to Lula? Lula tell you she's pregnant? Whattaya mean family? No... I don't think so, man. What's that? Why not? Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure. They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh? No. No. Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member? New Orleans, huh?... We was just there. Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well. This your car? No, haven't heard of it. That'd be fine, Bobby. Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done. You was in the Marines, huh? Thanks. You say it's straight ahead a mile? What's the name of it? Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here? What happened on the charges? If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business? Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular? But I'm wild at heart. But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance. The Good Witch... I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl. Come here. This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom. Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her? LULA!!!! What makes sense, is all. He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too. It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot. Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good. Lead the way. You must be my son. Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now. Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault. What? Lula, I got to get some sleep. That was in Vietnam. I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I? What could I be up to, Lula? We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso. We're goin' to, Lula, real soon. Uh-huh? Went with Bobby. Oughta make 'em happy. You talk to 'im some?... And Bobby too, I hear... That smell's still fillin' this room good. Few beers is all. Feelin' any better? I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise. Love you, too. It's okay by me, peanut. I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here. Anything I can do for you? I'll come along. Yeah? You sick? Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell? The only one. Okay, honey, I'll see you later. Yeah? Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work. Fan works. Not bad for eleven dollars a day. Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City... Let's get outta here, honey. I'm afraid she is, baby. Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that... Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey. Let's get ahold a' her quick. I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole. One bad car accident... I don't know... Looks like clothes. We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move. Trust me on it. There's worse places, honey. It's a comfortin' idea. They have, sugar. I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama... You upset with me? Lula, you there? Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos. We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar. I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life. I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames. Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos... Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy... Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before... You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you. This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya. What's that, peanut? That'd be good, Lula. Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way. Under a hundred. Told you not to call your mama. Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off. I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back. I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are. More'n likely. What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you? Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'. Yeah. Uh huh. You ready for this? Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door. Just part of life on the road, peanut. You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey? He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him. Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here. Who knows, baby? I'm goin'. Where? You do. Gotta hex from a voodoo? Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all. I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute. I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other. The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost. It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong. No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams. Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits. We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all. I do. I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar. You got me, peanut. Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts... My God, it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it? Huh? What's that, peanut? What lesson do get outta that story, Lula? You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it. We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans. Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said. How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose. Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it. Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em? Got you a pack of Mores again, huh? Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style. Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast. There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'. Come look at this. Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her. We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first. Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat. What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup. Life is a bitch and then you marry one. Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned. You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer. They sure do stink. That don't smell like a More. You got about six more big states to go before we find out. You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County. What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut. Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me... Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.' She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it. I guess. That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg? When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind. Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day. She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma. Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me. Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy. Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do. You up for that? Yeah, maybe... One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon... Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready. There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey. So? What's that? Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice. Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space. Hell, peanut... Actin' funny how? What's that, peanut? What happened to him? You tell the boy who knocked you up? Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out? It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there. At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again. You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far? Yeah? Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat. Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken. Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was. This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys. We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know? That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately? That's good... Now go get yourself a beer. You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one? Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance? You okay, honey? Here she goes again... And you never told nobody about it? 'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you? So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen? Didn't he say somethin'? Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed. I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth. How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak? But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen. You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan. In a fire, as I recall. You're perfect for me, too. Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that. It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time. Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness. I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer... I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'? Stab it and steer. Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom? Peanut... It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California. You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula. So? Whattya mean? No. What?... ...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula? Thanks... Well?... Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard. I didn't see nothin'... Life is unpredictable. You heard right. I think Santos or Marietta Fortune. Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know. Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile. Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here. Shhhhhh... Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now... My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul. I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood. That's just another part of the price to pay. You got nice tits. Put your shoulders back, I said. Put your shoulders back. Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed. I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"... One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble. You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him? You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut. On one condition... Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut? Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage. Through the forehead? You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun. But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope. Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun. Where? Where? In the leg? Shoot him? Like with a gun? Explain it... I told you. Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb? Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt? Simple? Kill him? How? You need to explain it. Just tell me what you want. How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii? Get rid of him? Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad. What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing? Take care of him? What do you want me to do about it? Have it your way... But you want it. Oh yeah - sure... okay. I knew you'd want it again...I said, I ain't got you... No, I ain't got you... But I ain't got you...Thanks for the promotion, man. Could somebody tell me what's going on? Like slo-owly ... Right away! Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter. Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy. Can't we bring up the bass. I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive. You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs. Why didn't you jump on her? What's happening to you? Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other. Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position. What are you looking at... Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.I ain't -- got -- you. I said, I ain't got you... No, I ain't got you... But I ain't got you... Thanks, I needed that. What did these Vancouver factories do? Hold that thought. Are we being shot at? What cheap shit... hey, waiter! But I am... Lots of things. Her favorite yogurt. The ten drummers she would take to a desert island... Have what? I'll buy you a new one. I found her. Thanks for the information. Appreciate it. Question one: Can I have some money? Kidding. Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny? You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who? What? Where? How? Now. They did one of these about my ex- wife. It's called 'The Nutcracker.' 'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money. I need some questions answered. Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case. Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you. Ouch... Of course I want off the case. Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight. The fact I'm alive's a technicality. I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there. Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g... Nuthin'. Ah, the Dorothy Chandler. I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night... Oh... I have some questions. Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty. Let's see, you're her worried sister. Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole. No thanks. I carry my own. Zuzu Petals. You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A. Now that we've broken the ice... Poor taste. I know. Listen, I respect homosexuals. When I was young, my maid was a homosexual. My maid was a homosexual. Some fag. Charged me up the ass. Oh, that! Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy! Roseanne Barr naked! I don't know, I never met your father. Sorry about the glass. And the house. And the breath. Don't say it. Orange juice? No prob... Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure. Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya? I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit. I've heard cars fuck with more harmony. Great pipes. I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member. Later, Don... I'm not cynical. Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now. Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle. So many assholes, so few bullets. Let's get hitched. I guess I, you know, love you. It's a beautiful thing. After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them. Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line. Now's the fun part... Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s. Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money. Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make? What an interface! Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit. Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name! It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know. Su-ure. Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers. Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty. But it's not necessary. People are dead. One was a friend. The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number... Aha, just what I suspected! I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue... Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance! Get that music off! What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority. Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out. Drop us at my place. Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything. Yeah, let's bury her. Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't. I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu. Why people are killing and dying for her. I don't know, what was the case? I like. What did you... Hey, where's your spex? I'm sorry, that dress. What do you say we... I wish I knew. You did good work... A fucking C.D. Wow, this case is closed. So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it? How'd you get this from her? Why did you interrupt? Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me. And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz. You going to be okay? This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs... Sorry, Jazz. After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay? Cool. Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door. Some concert. Could be interesting. Dress nice. Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton. Quiet. Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney... Keep it. It's your paycheck this month. Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again. I love you, too, baby. He wants to meet at six. What time is it now? Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money. Doritos cost money. I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here! Rock stars! I'm going out of my mind. All I get are perks. I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks. I want cash. Moulah. Wampum. Dead Presidents. Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford. Fucking Australians! I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there? I do it for love. Cash or check, Jazz? Don't do this to me. All your friends call you Jazz. Your tip paid off. Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag. Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary. Oh. Three hundred coming right up. You gave it to the girls for one. How much? Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy. So, Zuzu. Are you okay? Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life. I'll mail you a letter, come on! ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney. Are you okay? You wish. Come on, let's get outta here. This is fucking unbelievable. Zuzu, it's a long story, you see... I can't kill this kid's father... Hey. God. You're an asshole. I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job. Shall we? Why have you come to my planet? Pretty smooth, huh? Ye-ah. As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo: 'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.' No, wait... Sorry, it was dark, now come on. I'm afraid so, you want her? Ye-ah. Zuzu, be quiet. Put in Colleen's disc. Number two. Ye-ah. Sure. My axe! Are you okay? Zuzu, wake up... People still watch that? Stop. We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for... Friends? You didn't tell me that. He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life. Here's our stop... Zuzu Petals, you're not bad. In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day. You know him? You know rock-n-roll? Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived. I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do... How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda. What? Jesus, tell me! You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead? Uh... wha? You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em. I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy? Let's get serious... You okay? Give me your gum and grab the wheel. What? A simple 'please' would suffice... Zuzu Petals! Zuzu Petals! Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit? Who killed Johnny Crunch? Why do people want you so goddamn bad? I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested? This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying? He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy. Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk. Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit. It's me. Good news is that yeah, I found him. The bad news is... Well, I got some good news and some bad news. Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads... And hey, I appreciate it... Jesus, how could you be so stupid? Come on, we're going to a hospital. Run to the nearest phone and call the police. Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you? I don't need it that bad. Holy Colonel Mustard. Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money. Did he just say what I think he said? Twelve pack? Hey, you, get off my cloud. I'm talking to my friend. 1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix. Well what is it? I'm not Kreskin. Why am I what? Excuse me? I catch you saying the F-word again. I'll kill you. That's a fucking promise. Now get the fuck out of here. I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... hey ! Get that stick out of your mouth. These things are killers, man. Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that... Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose. Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies. The Village People rotted your brain. Really? That's okay. I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer. Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun. You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks. Really. I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you. Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked... Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days... Why do you hate me? It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop. Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here... You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons... Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir. Let me go out like a man. You gotta be kidding! This is unfuckingbelievable! I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young! Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard! Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect. I felt love. Then Jazz left me... and now I get to die! Okay. 'B-y-e! I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world. Say cheese... You were saying, snapperhead? I'll bet you're not smiling now! I. Am. The. Biggest. Sissy. In. The. Whole. Fucking. World . The case! I'm off it! Fine! I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.' Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more. Julian, you're fired. Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing. Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music. Those ingrates really take a bite. But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but... Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company... And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made... You'd said something about proof... Shit. When I say 'no,' run for the door. Are you okay? What about Don? I just gave up smoking. A last drink? Ah, I didn't say seven P .M., now did I? Okay ! Okay. You got me. Boy, you guys are tough. I have the third disc. Indeed. I. Do. Yes, sir. Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock. So if you'll excuse us... Oh God, please, don't ! Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits. Shit, just start torturing me, man. I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit. And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then? Uh, nice piano. Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh... It's another time, Julian, another place. If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be? Jazz, we're talking here. Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end. Isn't your enjoyment impaired? Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm. I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney. Do you know him? I knew your father. He was quite... Boing. You're one hell of a lip reader. How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick? I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob. I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division. It is to us! It's computerised. Hebedeebuh. Hebedeebuh. Maybe I did die in the explosion. Hey, the poet... I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff. That's funny, you're cute. Only on a first name basis. You're a poet and didn't know it. Zuzu Petals. Sounds like a drug. A lethal one. I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit. They are very hard to walk around in. 'Bye, Johnny... How nice. Friendship's a lot different out here. A wrong number is a relationship. But then this isn't a social call. Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard. I don't believe it. Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.I'm still the king! Accident? Accident! You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry. I cut my fucking ears off so I'd only hear my music. Here, look. What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head? When I was young, I read Billboard and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got. Fuck me... Oh please, Ford, I'll do any -- Ciao. Oh, wait. One sec. Open the window. Kill them. Not quickly. Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.' He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that. And then the mob iced him. It's all more tasteful than it sounds. I'm running a little late. You see, I'm having a party at THE Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit. Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland. It's 7:30. You really should get a watch. It doesn't have to be like this? Don't play games... ugh. Did you say you don't have the third... ugh. I'm not going to torture you , Ford. Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson. Wait, where's the third C.D.? How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here! A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc. Together they make, oh fucking forget it! Golly, I'd probably faint. Shock. Go on, another time, another place. Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain... So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades? I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea. Well, hello, Ford. Terrible thing, but good career move. His record sales have gone way up. I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit. An asshole? A swine? A ballistic turd? Pick one. I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company. You see the music is irrelevant in this industry. I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with. Why thank you. It's a Christmas present. That was my sense of humor, everyone. I wish you would fake a laugh. It's easy with a deaf person. Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection. I'm Julian Grendel. Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best. Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees. I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s. There's four thousand here. Just find her, man. She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week. Do whatever you want with my words. And my money. So... What? It's my daughter, man. I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl. She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros. You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and -- I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective. Fucking amazing, huh? Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit! Still in La-la land. Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks. Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you. You look at this picture and all you see is beauty. I see the beast. It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame. God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody. Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is. Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane. He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it. After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you. 'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A. It's booty time...' Like me. 'Booty Time.' Two words. Disco Express. If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun. What are you running from? Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got? You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women. You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...Hey, they blew me. Three hundred. Thanks. You interested. It's festival seating, so... Got those Vomit invites here...Shut the heck up... Pop. Who's my real father, man? What kind of sentimental bullshit is this? Yeah, go on... So, did you find my dad? Liar! You don't care! About anything. Where's my father? Have you even looked? I tried to help you...! Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that. I kicked their ass! Well, I tried. There were two of them you know... These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits. I think Armani. They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done. I'm sorry... You need it. I've got a clue. Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring. This ain't no social call. One hundred bucks. To find my father. Who cares? I got a case. Ouch. Forget it. I got something serious to dis-cuss. When you going to let me work with you? Why you always fucking with me? Gut feeling. Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn. You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great. He made mirrors. Busting his balls? If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box. Listen to him. "Watch the suit," he says. A little pisser I've known all my life. Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big. Son of a bitch. Get over here. Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin. Paulie. You're all I got. I need help. Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit. I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong. But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me. I was fucking crazy. But I'm okay now. I can be trusted. I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together... It was easy money. I did it in the can. Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie. I've been all fucked up since I got out. I understand. Nods again. Nods. Paulie. Why would I? I swear. Why would I get into that? Me? Why would I get into that shit? Wha? Me? Oh I Him. The guy from near where Christie used to live? What thing? The Brooklyn thing? Tell him. It's okay. Yeah. What about the kids' school? Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay. What happened? You okay? Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it? Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand. I need it. I was depending on that money. You what? You know. The stuff I left. Where's the stuff? So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out. Just get me out. Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out. Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first. I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead. Paul will calm down. You'll see. What did he say, exactly? Hello! Hello! Have a good flight? I had everybody working. Even our old babysitter. Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie. Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning. Get packed. We're getting out of here. Never. Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it. Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody. It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody. Forget Paulie. As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything. We've got to help each other. It'll be okay. Stop! Stop! What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me. Jezuz Christ! What are you talking about? Shit. I'm just having my last few drinks. Son of a bitch. It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do. What's the matter with you? You're crazy. That again. How much? Are you nuts? Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car. Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it. What bag? Get inside! Go inside. I'll be right there. I'm in construction. He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage. I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right? She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes. I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said. Take it easy. We can talk about it. I didn't know, I swear. I thought it was next week. I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check. I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy. Yeah. Yeah. How? He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all. On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck. I can't eat, just get me some coffee. Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye. Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country. Nah. Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction. Come on, don't fuck around, will ya? What'll I tell Fran? Paulie's gonna make him? There are cops all over the place. What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay? I gotta talk to you. Jimmy. What lions? I'm not going near any lions. If Paulie finds out, we got problems. It's been six months. What? Paulie was just talking about him. Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax. Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city. He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal. I mean, he actually enjoyed it. Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies. He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast. What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street. Marty, please. Let me talk to him. He heard. Will you stop. Done. What are you gonna do? Fight with him? He wants his money. I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right. I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building. It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot. My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me. I can't make any more deliveries. What could I do? If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat. I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone. Do you realize what we're involved in here now? What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg. Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean? Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important. Call from an outside phone. I mean it. You know what to do? Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick. You ready? They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it? Tommy, come on. Put the gun away. Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy! Tommy ... Will you get the fuck out of here. Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad. Tommy. Come on. Relax. Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it. Come on, relax. He's drunk. He's been locked up for six years. It's okay. I'll make it up. I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay? Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all. Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody. Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this. There's enough powder around here to put us all away.I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case. He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida. It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh. I think you got a good shot at beating the case. What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit. I better call again. You want the melon? I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls. Watch this. Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her. Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him. So what? Where are they gonna go? Don't worry about it. Oh yeah? Anything you say. Have a drink first. Give'm a drink. We did it. We did it. For Christmas. Your share. It's just a taste. We only have to shove'em over the moat. we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions. Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems. It's still better than letting somebody find him. The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard. Well, we gotta dig him up again. We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate? You got money for your bullshit television, don't you? I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money? Keep 'em coming. Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him. The third store down. I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block. I gotta talk to him as soon as I can. Did he say what they're asking him about? How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade. Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools. We'll pick it up. We'll pack up everything and send it to you.No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one. The oldest one. He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack. She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor. Look at Jeannie's kid.Okay? I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight... Are you okay? What happened? So do I. I hate to do dishes. Stay there.Please? Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do. But, Paulie, please. But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town. I can't go here. I can't go there. But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie. You know me all my life. I've always done the right thing.I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. : You're some fucking jerk. Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything? What happened to you?No more shines, Billy. Don't go busting my balls. Okay? Hey, Billy. Watch the suit. Billy, how are you? No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it. No, no. It's okay. Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend? For Chrissake. Come on. You don't even have to stay. Jeesuz! What's the big deal? You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend. You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful. There's a shovel at my mother's. Keep him here. I'm going for a bag. He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good. I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.Here. Take it. Now I gotta turn my back on you. You treated me like shit. You thought I was some fucking jerk? Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied. You think I didn't know what you were doing? I warned you a million times. Anybody! You understand? And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me. You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand? I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison. I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me. You understand? I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here. Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean. I don't want any more of that Shit. No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on. No. No. The guy from downtown. What did you hear about that thing? What? You want a partner? What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would? Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop. You? You think you're the only one? I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen. You think that matters? You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards. If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime. Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going. You got a point there... Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself. Sounds good. Sure. I'm not much of a critic. Well... ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it. Sure. Thank you. Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and... Anything you can tell me might help. I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon. Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock. There's that spice again. I'm not sure. Maybe nothing. That thing. Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be. How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here. Where the hell is that thing? Just leave it, all right? "There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him." They're hauling Misery into court. "There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him." Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice. Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about. Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye. There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents. He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out. Just from his agent. Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office. Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things. Stop--stop right here. Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy. Work, work, work. Virginia? When was that blizzard? G'bye, Ms. Sindell. You think he might be missing? I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels? Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks. People sure like those Misery books. He's your client, huh? Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer? I'm sure you're right. So do I... No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary? Maybe you can, Libby. Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that. Newspapers? Has she been buying any odd things lately? You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you? Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books? Answer me a couple things? Hey, Pete.You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses. You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne. I'm almost done. Dome Pear-igg-non it is. You don't know? You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things. It will. I'm glad you like it. Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter? Maybe. Three more chapters to go. It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world. I know you do. I love you too, Annie. And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book. Be my guest. Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles... Why, what are you going to do? Kill me? Take your best shot. I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here. Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you? I don't know what you're talking about. No, I haven't. What? It is. Why would I want to leave? I like it here. Why would you lose me? Annie, what is it? I think you're right. To Misery. It's perfect. Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice. Well, it certainly says you. Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair? Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles? Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine. Annie, I think we should have a toast. Oh. You can't get this in a restaurant in New York. I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it? It looks wonderful. And so do you. To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you. Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row? Have to wait. ...have to wait. Yeah, yeah... Well, is it fair? Should I keep going? Nothing. What about a bee...? I said that? The what? I'm telling you, I can't. I can't write this anymore. They always cheated like that in cliff-- --chapter plays. --cliff-hangers-- --not fair? I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here. What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?" Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much. I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie-- --please... I want my pills NOW! You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills. Annie, what's the matter? No, just the paper will be fine. I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written. C'mere, I'll show you. You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo. It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie. Great. I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much. You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation. You just expect me to whip something off, that it? Misery's Return? Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write? Set what up? If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books. Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room. Great. I don't know. You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists. You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split. God knows you're entitled to it. No big deal. This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything. You want me to burn my book? You want me to burn my book? Show me the way? I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise? Perfect. No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all. I DIDN'T... Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive-- Well, I hope you like it. Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly. Yeah, thanks. I'm... I know how that can be. The Sistine Chapel? She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is... I'm getting to believe you. Misery? My pleasure. You'd be amazed at what some people will believe. Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines. I can live with "great." I guess that means it's okay. I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago. My daughter must be going nuts. The phones are working? Then the roads are open... It's fine. Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that. The profanity bothers you? Pretty rough so far. I can take it, go ahead. No, what is it? But what? It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title. I don't have a title yet. I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck. You want to read it? When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing. You're very kind... I didn't know it was going to be a big storm. Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear-- Following me? Will I be able to walk? Shouldn't I be in a hospital? What are they...? --my number one fan. How long...? I am. Well, maybe not completely-- Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks. I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper. Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me. I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book. Great. That'd be a first. Yeah. They're in the semis. Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd... Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? I'm doing this because I have to. Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ... I might just have something that I want on my tombstone. Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever. For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here. Marcia, please. I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business-- When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then. An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.No, the typing kind. Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd. Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy. We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days. If I can. Buster.I do. I take it all very personally. Very nice meeting you, Vivian. I don't think so. You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have. There's no way you could know that. We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract. Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares. We would give you a promissory note... Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock. We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share. I'd like to find out. You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch. I see. Well. Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then. Hope to be? Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? I am. This is Vivian. You two been together long? You and Edward? Thunder's a horse. Come on. Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing. Come on, I'll show you Thunder. I like your hat.Do what you have to do. I don't take it personally. We can reach an understanding on this. But I do know. I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will... Ah, the escargot. You're not getting any navy contracts. Twenty-five percent. Who indeed... What? You what? Not with those smokestacks it's not. What's that long building over there? You're very right. I think the best thing we could all do is go home. This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I? I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you? The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that. How? If you had a... reprieve, what would do? Stop. For just a moment. Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct? You're making the right decision, sir. Expected ... offer. How are you, Mr. Kross. It is not your company. It's a public company. And I am going to acquire it. Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you. What I did with those companies was perfectly legal. No. What I have is a lot of money. Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock. On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours. To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid. But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything. Vivian... Stay with me tonight. Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to. You're packing. It felt good. I got tired of hating my father. It was a business decision. Not all men hit. And no one is going to hit you anymore. It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money. Yes. The man made a business decision. It's not your concern. It's... business, that's all. Vivian, I want you to listen to me. The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated. What do you mean? I've never treated you like a whore. Vivian, life's not a fairy tale. Vivian, I've thought about this a lot. This is the best solution. It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that? I have to go to New York tomorrow. One more night and you're finally rid of me. Yes. I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you. I know. I'm glad. If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you. Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know. That's the fun of it. I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you. But you'll be surprised how much you understand. The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words. What happened to him? Vivian. I'm paying you to be you. Be you. Have you? Ever been in love with anyone? I'm glad you like it. Now be quiet, I've really got to read these. The opera. To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker... You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you? I don't. I'll guard them and you with my life. You won't. Shush. Of course you can. I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however... Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing. I really am sorry. Vivian... I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did. I should have known that it would hurt you. I'll call you a cab. If you want the clothes, pack them up. Fine. I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you. Vivian... Can we talk about this? Can you just try to calm down? What was I supposed to do? I told the truth. Why should the truth upset you? It's not as if you're from a convent. Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened. I don't know what you're talking about. Vivian, what the -- Ready to stomp sod? I'm sure that's true for some of them. Shall we mingle? He's good at what he does. I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard. I think it's exciting. He died a long time ago. Not much to tell. I went to public school. Went to university on scholarship. Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it. My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after. I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him. Easier than learning how to be poor. My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies. But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman. And he took his money with him. No. Dinner can wait. Please. Thank you. I would. Nice. Good. Vivian, you belong wherever you are. I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you. Was someone rude to you? Why not? I still don't understand why you only bought one dress. I have work to do. Television? Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant. It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive. Upset. No. I never get upset about business. And that's the way the game is played. I'm sorry. I thought I told you not to answer the phone. Thank you very much . I think you'll approve. The Rex. This isn't a date. Let's hope so. You'll get some more clothes tomorrow. I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp. Got it? Just one? Christ... I hope it's appropriate. Did you buy some clothes? Never answer the phone. Ever. Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go. I'm not just talking about sex. Done. All right, two thousand. Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500. Of course. How much? I'm in town until Saturday. All right. How much for the week? Don't drown. Where'd you learn to do this? Not... quite. Assets are anything of value a company owns. Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off, I make a profit. Vivian -- By breaking up a company's assets -- I sell them. The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million. I buy companies. No? Why's that? Do you ever... enjoy it? I'd say you give a good dollar value. Mmm, I could tell. I took the couch. I had some work to do. About last night... Occupational hazard? Did you sleep well? No hurry. Would you like some breakfast? Good morning. What do you like? Yes... You really are a very beautiful girl. Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate. Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne. Try a strawberry. It's a very good year. They should be. They're both good at it. I think he wanted you to tip him. Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers. And why do you say that? Uh-huh. Let's talk some more first. Fair enough. Always. Want to know something? I don't quite know. I hadn't planned this. -- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you. Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne. Room service. What do you drink? Exactly. Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're... You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour. My raincoat's in the back. Put it on. Then let's go. It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive. You know how to drive a stick? Get in. This side. Edward. My name is Edward. Fine. Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night? Neither do I. A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff. You're joking. For the whole night? What do you charge for company, Vivian? Ugly habit, biting your nails. Sorry. If I did, I didn't mean to. Very good. You ought to have that printed up on your business card. Must be dangerous. Hooking. So do day jobs. You like being a hooker, Vivian? What's your name? Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it. Ho tel. New York. Very good. You're obviously mechanical. If you can figure it out, be my guest. Not exactly. No. Sit-and-spin. Alright... why not? Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart? That's ridiculous. Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? No, you look like a hooker. Yes. Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly Hills? What's that? Afternoon. Thank you. My what? Of course, yes. If you'll excuse me just a moment -- Yes. And I don't like what we've become. I'll cover any losses you have on this one. Now get out, you asshole! I think I broke my hand. You're fired. Have a good day, gentlemen. I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you? Let him answer. Give me twenty minutes. Why? I'm up. Goodbye, Bill. Bill? Stop panicking. Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down. I'll be in the office tomorrow. Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker. I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard. You're being ridiculous. She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie. Why do you want to know? Vivian's in sales. Yes... The night I left your house, I was lost. I was looking for directions. We just did. Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian. Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money. Do it. I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now. Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise. Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away. No one you know. What time's diner tonight? We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides... You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you? I'm here. I'll bring it back. Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia. I'll see you in the office. By the way, about your car... I'll see him alone. Everyone knows you're my muscle. We'll make it social. Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner. Tonight if you can arrange it. I want to. Love this car! Is it new? No. Really? Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do? No, thank you. I just got off the phone with one. Apologize to Elizabeth for me. Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.Who are you going after next, sir? Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished. You've won. Congratulations, sir. I talked to some developers about the land. The real estate possibilities are endless. Most of the yard we'll just level. I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said -- Storage, I think.You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris. Quiet. Would I get the loans? I... I don't know. There... there wasn't time... I... I would take advantage of it. Yes. Of course, yes. After the expected filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid. Yes. I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer. Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights. I'll get used to it. Mr. Harris. I don't question the legality of what you do. It's your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you. I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks. You've got a lot of nerve. What would it take to buy our stock back? Name your price.Of rent I do not bullshit. Kit give me nothin'. Rent. You're late.I leave extras, miss. I also place las chocolates on the pillow. Housekeeping . I come to turn down the bed. Housekeeping. I come to turn down the bed. 5:00, I turn down the bed.Good afternoon, Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly. The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge. The young lady staying in your room? I have a message for you from your "niece", sir. Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel. Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian. John, call a limousine for our guest, please. Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go. Bill the hotel. See you again sometime soon. You're not accompanying him to New York? Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow. Miss Vivian. I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own. Barnard Thomas here. Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk. There's someone here to see you. Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel. Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead? Miss Vivian -- Then you would use your-- Then you use your soup spoon . They will serve salad. Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners. Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table. All right now, pay attention please. Salad fork. Either you're European or badly brought up. In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen. First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand. You'll like it fine. I think you'll find it normal enough. It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say. What is it, Miss Vivian? That's all right. I'm sure they're quite lovely. I rather hoped you'd be wearing it. Of course. Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again. Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. What's your name? And who is that? You're a guest here?All this because of that whore! Edward, we've been together ten years. You broke my nose. What!? Have you lost your mind? Oh, my god... Edward, no! I don't think there's any sense in -- We'll be there. Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office. I want him to commit his stock to us this morning. He wouldn't say. Edward... I think we got him. His nuts are on the block and we got him . You there? I had to call. I jus got off the phone with James Kross. Get this. He wants to see you. Today. Did I wake you? Promise me you'll read those contracts by then. This is no time to disappear. We're in too far. Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information? So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. It's too convenient. Hear me out. I've known you a long time. I see a difference in you this week. Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross. Sales, really? That's great. What does she sell? Doing what? And you just happened to run into her. Great. What's she do? She work? Come on, you can tell me. I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this. Fill me in on this. How'd you and Vivian meet? Bill Stuckey, Vivian. My wife, Elizabeth. And some of it's mine. Edward, his jugular's exposed. Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds. Now, you're giving him the chance to get away? As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars -- But, Edward... We're letting them slide? Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there. We can bleed'm dry. Goddamit! Where is he getting the money to fight? Eight o'clock. Kross is bringing his son. Very bright kid, watch yourself with him. Who's this girl you're taking? What!? I know a lot of nice girls. Edward, did you hear me? Oh, god, what? You shouldn't go alone. He might claim that you tried to black mail him. Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal. Yes! And you don't even know where you're going! Cynthia's not coming? Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you... At least stay for a drink. This party's for you. What's up, where you going? Don't worry. I'll pay for it. What a you charge? Huh? Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe ? Are you a fifty dollar whore? I bet. A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal. Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did? He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter. For no reason! What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head? Why? What was all that benevolent crap? What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation? I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities. I just might do that. It's okay. Edward told me. Your secret's safe with me. All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard. Having a good time, Vivian?Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime. They're too big. Yes. Oh here we go with that. Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that. Why, you don't want us to bring him over? We got the same thing. I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home. I pay my own way. I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late. I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight. I'll drive her to the hospital. My name is Sam. Samuel. I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name? I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain. You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof. I told her I would if she would give me time. Maybe I can get down there next week. This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street. Why are you always afraid to get somewhere? You always got something to say. You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights. I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there. It was nip and tuck. I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body. It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like. It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters. I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted. You okay? Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right? I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money. Why does he always pick on me? I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way... Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it. Will you still get the money from your father? Why don't you come in for a while? I don't see you crying about my drinking it. What is a sip of coffee going to do? My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did. Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be. I'm busy. Harry is coming to pick me up. I'm going back home with Harry. I need to get my suitcase out of the garage. Doesn't he look a whole of lot better? He will be alright. I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night. Babe Brother. This would be a bad time for me to leave. I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong. I could swear I heard my son call me. Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know. It is just a regular card. What is that? Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die? Did you ever have to use this thing?I'm not here to argue, sir. Well, you just have to move further out. Not anymore, not in the city. You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen. When are you boys going to fix that roof? How come you're not wearing my shoes? Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing? Junior spends time with his child. No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature. What did your wife get her? Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week. Since when? That's a lie. What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one. Now how far would further out be? We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have. I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots. It's only a tale. But these are white people, anybody. The punch... I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line. He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth... What did you put on it? What happened to your hand? Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick? What, are you having another party? How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick. How is the garden doing? It's good to be able to hear that. I will appreciate that. I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up. I'm worn out. Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son. I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it. Son, you make me wish I was dead. No, I'm too hot now. Well, it's up to Suzie. Babe Brother is a poor boy. I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him. You're always taking his side. He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him. I'm not going to let him get away with murder. I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes. Your feet are cold. Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs. I don't know how two brothers can be so different. Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday. My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now? I tell you, I feel like a ghost. Haven't the years been good to Hattie? My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him. You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story. I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior. You and Babe Brother hit it off so well. What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing. It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home. Well, I would appreciate that. I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away. You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong. It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window Man, act like this is your home. Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out. Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news. Why didn't you catch a plane? He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry. This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra? Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up. What would you give to be rich? I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time. You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there. Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over. Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere. Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything? Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor. I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets. I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me. That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out. Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river. It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life. 'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead. You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son. Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways... ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you. It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what? I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning. Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy. Everything these days is made overseas. How often is your wife called to help delivery? Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time. Next time when I feel a little better perhaps. Good morning. I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me. That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome. Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor. I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger? My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground. I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on. Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom. He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age. You invited me. I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is? Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones. As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman. Good afternoon, ladies. I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway. How is he doing? Only if you can spare it. That smells like fresh coffee. You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right. Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time. I hope that it's nothing serious. Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today? How is everybody? What's the problem here? You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything. I'll be right there. All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is. You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark. Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place. No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit? Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary. Well, I don't want to put you out. Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth. Those boys never did have good luck. I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick. Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason. What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush? Wasn't Hocker lynched? Now who are we talking about? Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there. Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't. You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste. Good God Almighty, bless your bones. But the problem grows. How many people do you all feed? Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor. A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days. I already have, my dear. Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say? Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry. "Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly." Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some. That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother. I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers. Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road. Girl, do you still sing and dance? You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human. Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying. Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person. Country people got so many strange ways, Some folks take that natural stuff too far. Did you have your child at home? In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X. You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since. I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago. Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives. Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil. And evil is a thing you work at.What is it, noontime? We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad. You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother. I ought to break your damn neck. That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up. I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house. Why in the hell didn't you help mama? Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him? This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal. You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street. You used that excuse to get out of the army. When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof? All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering. He should be caring. That is not too much to ask. I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me. Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit. I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth. Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock. When did you talk to Harry? We can't really bring another family in here with us.You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin. Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town. Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that. You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree? Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one... There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?I'm sorry he got those birds. Where is Skip? Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter? What are you doing?But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them. I didn't mean for you to pay me for that. Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times. Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry. Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals. That's nice. You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together. Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to. Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls. He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome. Don't shout! Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
