Okay, I'm up. Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work out. I got an appointment with a trainer. I can't cancel now, he'll charge me. Yeah I did. Last week, I told you. I did. And then I wrote it on the calendar like you told me to. I did tell you. Thank you very much. It all worked out! All right? Now, are you sure you understand the terms of the bet? `Cause this is serious. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah, ka-ching. Ka-ching. Ka-ching. Guys, let's start loggin', all right? Charles Manson? Do you have any other thoughts? Good, awesome, let's start this off with a bang. Jamie Lee Curtis. I got an hour and ten minutes in "Trading Places." Uh, both chesticles. Ah, I got something. A three-titted alien from "Total Recall?" Aw, she's not famous. "Damn it, Cohaagen, give the people the air." So if you want that perfect tan like the stars, he's the one to see. We'll be right back on "E! News." Stay with us. Okay, is Jessica Simpson here yet? Is she on her way? She's left her house? No. Cookie, yeah, cookie. Thanks. I'm sorry I'm pissy. Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we wanted to talk to you today because we had a little debate on the conference call with New York about you. We were wondering aloud to one another whether or not you would be good for on-camera. Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here, and everybody's going see you right there. Huh? Oh, congratulations! Hey, maybe you can get your own place now. Yeah! We can watch "Taxicab Confessions." Ladies? What's going on man? How long you gonna make us wait out here, for Christ's sake? Come on! What the fuck! You know what movie I just saw again the other day which is fucking, like, mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it since it came out? "Munich." "Munich!" Dude, "Munich" fuckin' rules. "Munich" is awesome! That movie was Eric Bana kicking fuckin' ass! Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the ones getting killed. "Munich" flips it on its ear. We cappin' motherfuckers. Not only killing, but fuckin', like, takin' names. If any of us get laid tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in "Munich." I agree with that. I agree. You know what is not helping us get laid? Is the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, over here at our table. I like your shoes. How was "Burning Man" this year? Fuck you guys, I'm glad I'm not Jewish. So are we. Fine. Screw it. You weren't "chosen" for a reason. Yeah. Ahh! Ohh!!! Yo, a beer over here, please? You're gonna be embarrassed when you realize I'm Wilmer Valderrama. God. He's literally ignoring this entire half of the bar. Don't even bother. A beer over here, please? He looked at us! Did you see that? And if you can't get service, what am I gonna do, you know? Okay, you want a beer? Just observe. Come on, man! Here you go! For your trouble! Thank you. BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) There you go. Okay, enjoy it. I'm sure. I tried that once before at The Comedy Store and I got punched in the ear. Oh, here, take mine. Please, I very rarely look cool. This is a big moment for me. Just take it. No problem. I'm Ben. Okay, you too. Have a-- Okay, enjoy, be nice to them. I'll see ya later. No, I won't, `cause I'm a pussy. What's up, daddy? That girl. She, she totally gave me an opening, man, and I locked up. I just want to get shit-faced, though, you know? I'll just jerk it later. It's cool. Are you fuckin' crazy, man? She looks...smart. Who's that she's sitting with? It's her sister. Her sister? Yeah. Dude, it's the dream. What are we doin' standing here man? Let's go. Come on, follow me. You stay here. Why? `Cause your face looks like a vagina. Dick! Hey, which one's the sister? Hey, Crockett. You still partyin' with Tubbs these days? Come on, man. I'm getting it from all angles here. I don't like it anymore. I know, I don't either. Was it weird when you changed your name from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam? Yeah, it was really awkward. All right, man. I got to take off. See ya, "Scorsese on coke." What's that? Chewbacca. It's, you know, it's Chewie. Oh, another beard joke. Fuck. Fuckin' hilarious! Hey. Hi, this is my friend, Jason. I just wanted to see how my beers were doin'. Oh, hi, I'm Ben. Yes. How ya doin'? Just trying not to stare. It's a shame. You're beautiful. You think that's gonna stop him from hitting on her? It's not, at all. I love kids. Yeah, absolutely. Cool phone. I had the chicken pox three times. I have no immunity to it. We don't have the heart to tell him it's herpes. It's not herpes if it's everywhere. Bye, lovely. All right, I'm gonna let you two get to know each other. Cheers. To you. Ben and Alison take pictures of each other with their cell Oh, E! Dude, I think he's doing the dice thing too much. That's really all he's got. Alison and Ben take another shot. Alison runs her fingers through I use Jew. You want to get out of here? Yes, uh, uh, uh... Wicked. Okay, I'm really excited to watch that. We should get a cab. This is a big yard! Let's go swimming right now. Let's just do that. I'm doin'-- Whoo! You're prettier than I am. I do. It's in my pants. I have a condom. I'll get it. Man. Come on. (to the condom) Stupid fucker. I almost got it. Just give me a second. Okay. Good thing I'm drunk. This is lasting forever. I just doubled my record time. I'm sorry I'm sweating on you. Fuck off, Martin. I said, fuck off Martin. Oh. Hey. I'm naked. Did we have sex? Nice. What time is it? Why the fuck are we awake? Let's go back to sleep. Really? No work today. Do you want to get breakfast? Good morning Alison. I'm Ben. What's happenin', man? Ben. How's it goin'? Ah, to be young. You stop it. All righty. See ya later. Enjoy the day. Never do what they did. You are? Uh-oh. Someone's getting home- schooled. Whew. I just yacked, something nasty. I feel way better, though. I think that's the secret. You just gotta puke. Did you puke? Awesome. Can I get your number? We had fun, right? We should hook up again. If you want to contact me, I don't have a cell right now because of payment complications, but you can email me at the web page, I check it. It's Ben at flesh of the stars, one word, dot com. So, awesome. Okay, uh, see ya. Bye! That was fuckin' brutal. Yeah, that was brutal. Great. Of course. Okay. No, actually, I didn't read any of the comic books until I got the movie. JAMES FRANCO (cont'd) Are you okay? Like I said I really wasn't into them, but now that I did the research, I think they're pretty amazing. JAMES FRANCO (cont'd) What the fuck? Is that the sound of you puking? We should put this on YouTube. This is hilarious. Look how sweaty you are. You look like Dom DeLuise. You look like Jabba the Hutt dying. I'm just jerking your chain. I'll fix this. No problem. What's up? BRENT (CONT'D) (cont'd) Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Over here. Not on the mixing board, not on the mixing board. Are you okay? Are you sick? What'd you eat? You haven't eaten yet? Here, here. What do you have, like the flu? God, I hope you're not pregnant. (into the phone) B.K. It's Brent Master Five. Alison just puked. Dude, that's what I said. She's probably pregnant, right? (into the phone) How does she look right now? She looks like she just realized that she's pregnant. I love weed. I could smoke weed every second of every day. (through the mask) Jay, I am your stoner. Hey, Benjamin? Yeah. "Flesh of the Stars" just got an e- mail. Really? Would you like me to read it to you? Yeah, sure. "Ben, what is your number? I need to speak to you right away. Alison Scott" Shit! Someone wants seconds, mama! "Looking forward to speaking with you." Yeah. Do one of those smiley faces at the end. Fuckin' A. Those are sexy. Sent. Uh-oh! Somebody wants another piece! Shhh.... Booty, booty, booty call. (into the phone) Hello? (into the phone) Oh, yeah, Alison. What's up? She like-a the way your dick tastes. (into the phone) I've been meaning to call you so we could hook up again. You know what I'm sayin'? (into the phone) Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good. What do you say Geisha House, Hollywood, nine o'clock? (into the phone) Six o'clock. Beat the rush. Yeah, leave more time for afterwards. Dessert. Sweet. (into the phone) I'll see you there. Take care. Peace. I'm gonna get laid mother fuckers! Nice place, huh? Sorry it took so long to get a table. I didn't realize you needed a reservation. So you haven't seen him, though? So you don't know if you're pregnant. You're not a hundred percent sure. I bet you're not pregnant. I'm supposed to go? I'm Ben Stone. Nice office. And you're next. I'm just kidding. DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd) There's the cervix. And the uterus. See that? That dark sac there, that's the amniotic sac. And right there, in the middle is the embryo. Do you see that flicker? You know what that is? That's the heartbeat. Yeah, it looks like you are pregnant. About eight or nine weeks, I'd say. Congratulations. Oh, God. It's okay. I can't fuckin' believe you didn't wear a bag! Who does that?! Why did we go to Costco and buy a year's supply of condoms if you weren't gonna use `em, man? I can't believe you did this. You fucked everything up. Look, the real point is not to get yourself in this position. That's what you have to realize. You gotta know all the tricks. Like, for example, if a woman's on top, she can't get pregnant. It's just gravity. Everyone knows that. What goes up must come down. I think it's awesome that you're gonna have a kid, man. Think of it like this. It's just an excuse to play with all your old toys again. You know what I think you should do? Take care of it. Tell me you don't want him to get an "A word." Yes, I do, and I won't say it for little Baby Ears over there, but it rhymes with shmish-mortion." I'm just saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears -- you should get a "shmish-morshmion" are the "shmish-morshmion" clinic. Ben, you cannot let these monsters have any part of your child's life. All right? I'm gonna be there to rear your child. You hear that, Ben? Don't let him near the kid. He wants to rear your child! Aw, Ben. Ben, come on, man. I'm just kidding you. Oh, great. Now he's upset. I won't let him do it. I'm gonna be a grandfather. You happy about that? Absolutely. Delighted. This is a disaster. No, this is not a disaster. It is, you know? An earthquake is a disaster. Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad she doesn't even know who the fuck I am, that's a disaster. This is a good thing. This is a blessing. I had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it. Wait. Are you living your vision right now? I am kinda living my vision, yeah. Well, that is sad, I'm telling you. Life doesn't care about your vision. Okay? Okay. Stuff happens. You just got to deal with it. Roll with it. That's the beauty of it all. I just don't get how I tell the kid not to do drugs when I do drugs. I'll feel like a hypocrite. Well you remember what I told you? When you were a teenager? What did you say? I said, "No pill, no powders." That's right, that's right. Right. If it grows in the ground, it's probably okay. I guess it worked. You told me not to smoke pot all those years. And then I found out you were smoking pot that whole time. Not the whole time. Just in the evenings and all day every weekend. Not that much. Honestly, though, when you look at me, do you not think at all, like, you know, if he just never existed, I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble? You know? Absolutely not. I love you totally and completely. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm the best thing that ever happened to you? Yeah. Now I just feel bad for you. Hello? Hey Alison, how's it goin'? Good. That's good. That's what I was hoping you'd do. So, awesome. I know we didn't plan this and neither of us really thought it was gonna happen but life is like that, you know? You can't plan for it and even if we did, life doesn't care about your plans, necessarily, and you just kinda have to go with the flow and I just know my job is to just support you in whatever it is you wanna do. I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm gonna do. I'm on board. Yaaay. No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if you could help me by telling me, like one thing that I am supposed to do, then that would be good, `cause I literally have no idea whatsoever. Do you want to, like, get together and talk about it or something like that? Like a date? I mean... You look beautiful. No problem. Come on in. Everyone, this is Alison. Ally. Hey. Jason. I'm sure you remember. You look beautiful. Your body's responding really well to the pregnancy. It's amazing how fast the milk arrives. How's your sis? Oh, good. Tell her "What's up" for me. All right, I'm gonna go make a protein shake. And this, uh, beautiful young man is Jonah. Hey. Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there. I'm gonna grab my shirt. Just take a seat if you want. Just another day at the office. Do you have any acting experience? How's it goin'? You wanna toke? Man, my balls are shaved. My pubes are trimmed. I'm ready to fuckin' rock this shit. What the fuck, man?! If I go in there and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my mind! Last time I went to the bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed animal! You're embarrassing me in company! You embarrass yourself! Oh, great. I hope you have a great evening! All right. Let's go. See you guys later. Yeah. At least! God, honestly, I just got used to the notion that someone would even have sex with me. I didn't think this would happen. Get ready. This will be coming out of you in seven months. This is exactly what our baby will look like. It is. It's not bad. (in a French accent) Hello, Mommy. Our baby's gonna be French Canadian. I like that. Exactly, I'm not good with accents. Baby books. "What to Expect When You're Expecting." Well, you can't eat sushi. You can't smoke. You can't smoke marijuana. You can't smoke crack. And you can't jump on trampolines. This is basically a giant list of things you can't do. I'm gonna be sitting there on the trampoline smoking crack. And you're not gonna have anything to do. You're gonna be bored. But I can't wait to read these, honestly. I put these in front of my toilet, though, they'll be read by tomorrow morning. Do you want me to get you that? No problem. These are heavy. So what do you think? Should we have sex tonight? Well, now. That's pretty crazy how your sister's pregnant. I think they'll be fine. They'll work it...Look at us. It happened to us. Well...fuck! At least we don't have to use a condom, you know? BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) But we can. I brought some just in case. I don't have V.D. or anything. I mean, I don't, I thought-- It's just I thought we could get a little...fun out of your situation, you know? I know that. I'm sorry. I like you a lot. That's all this is. Sweet. Yeah. For the baby, right? B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told my roommates that I thought I was gonna get a B.J., so... I can do that. I'm really nervous. Yeah. I think I am. I wouldn't do that. Just so you know, I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay? I couldn't take it. I can't raise this baby alone. I'm Ben Stone. That's nice. But a boyfriend. Because he likes breakfast so much. You guys wanna hear something neat? We're gonna have a baby together. Yeah, a baby. You don't have to be. I feed your bear the grass? Know what your bear would also like to do with some grass? Smoke it. Fetch. All right, bring it back. Go get it! Fetch! All right! Bring it back. I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you! Whoa! They seem to love bubbles. They go ape-shit over bubbles. They're really going ape-shit. That's an incredible thing about a child. What's so great about bubbles? They float. You can pop them. I mean, I get it. I get it. I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles. That's sad. It's totally sad. Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything. Am I going to be okay, man? Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not okay. You're asking the wrong guy. Just don't ask me to lend you any money, you know? Can I just have some? No. I have fifteen years of tennis lessons. I thought you went to Santa Monica City College. I went where I went, Jason. I'm not asking you to work twelve hours a day. I mean, you guys watch movies without nudity in them. I'll tell you what, man. We could probably get it online in three months. Thank you. Yes! Three months. Come on, Jason! Fuck off! Yeah, well, you still have a little dick, Cartman. I'm breathing like James Gandolfini over here. (to nearby athlete) Slow down, man. You're making me look like a jackass. How long you kids been married? We're not. You're single? She's not single. She's just not married. Are you two together? Are you sure you don't want to come paint-balling? Have fun, guys. Seriously, watch the eyes. All right. See ya, Ally. Peace. Bye. I don't want to go. I swear to God. I want to see "Breathless" at the LACMA. Hold on, pause it, pause it, pause it. Those are good ones! We're like thirty- five seconds in. Nice. Credit bush. You never get opening-credit bush. You got me. You got me. Really? Oh, my God. Are you serious right now? I am very relieved. I can't imagine meeting and more of you people. Ooh. Do they know? The belly. You're pregnant aren't you? I mean, you've put on like eight pounds, nine. It's all in your uterus. It's okay. We can hide this. We'll dress you in black and we'll emphasize your boobs. Your boobs are going to be big. And then they're going to be like scary big. But then they'll go down. And then they'll stay down. I won't. Just tell them. They'll be cool. Everybody loves somebody pregnant. Looks like your computer has chicken pox. We'll skip their houses when we're trick or treating. What do you want me to do? Form a posse? Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my lynching rope. I don't take it lightly. I'm not going to go over to any of these people's houses and say, "Hey, you mind? Can you baby sit?" You're so concerned with stuff, like don't get them vaccinated, don't let them eat fish. There's mercury in the water. Jesus, how much "Dateline NBC" can you watch? What am I doing? I literally am at a point where I don't know what I can say. Yeah. Pretty much. Don't do this in front of Ben. Sorry, Ben. It's okay. I didn't think she did, anyway. I can't go. This band is doing a showcase out in the Valley. I got to go. I got to go. Hey. Think we'll ever be as happy as Baby Bjorn couple is? Yeah. You look happy. You keep saying that. I know. Nice. Holy shit, it's fourteen hundred bucks. There's one of these in an alley behind my house. We could just grab that. Just rub Purell all over it. (whispering to Alison) Shh. Yes. We'll take it obviously. I mean don't insult the woman. She wants to get us a gift. Want to buy me some new clothes? What else can I squeeze out of you? You know they say don't drink and drive? Right. Don't drink and bone! Yeah, she was acting weird and I really think it's just because I haven't made an honest woman out of her. She's carrying my bastard child. No one wants that. That's what I did. I married Debbie when she got pregnant. You think she's, like, hiding me? Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that? Probably. I'd hide you. How much do wedding rings cost? It really depends, you know? I think you're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring. That'll be easy. I don't make any money. Really? I thought there was a lot of money in porn. God, it's not porn? All we do is we show you what nude scenes are in what movies. Like Mister Skin? Who's Mister Skin? Dude, Mister Skin. We've wasted fourteen months of our lives. This is exactly the same as our site. How the fuck did this happen? Mister Skin! That's even a better name than ours! Well, fuck me in the beard. Dude, they got the top ten group shower scenes! Why didn't you think of that, Jay! Don't put this on me! God damn it! Well shit. I saw it online at one point, but I guess I didn't connect the dots. What are we gonna do now? All we need to do is think of a new, better idea that no one else has thought of already. "Spiderman Three" starts in eight minutes. Shit. Don't worry. We'll figure it out. You know what? Just because this site exists doesn't mean ours won't work. Good things come in pairs. For sure. "Volcano," "Dante's Peak." "Deep Impact," "Armageddon." "Wyatt Earp," "Tombstone." Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. Exactly. We can work together. This helps us, if anything. We're golden. Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being exactly and it's not how I wanted it. That is why I'm presenting you with this empty box. It's a promise, Alison. A promise that one day I will fill this with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I can't afford it yet. I've picked it out, though. It's at De Beers and it's really nice. So, basically, I'm asking you, will you marry me? Because I'm in love with you. Really? That's so nice to hear. That's the first time a girl's ever said that to me. There's a thing? Look, I thought you felt weird that we're having a baby and we're not engaged. I'm going to get off my knee. It hurts. That makes sense. No. I just wanted to do right by you. If you don't want to, that's totally cool. I know. Thanks. You mentioned that. It's nice. You're not going to tell them? I like it. It's a good plan until her water breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes. (impersonating Robert De (impersonating Robert De (impersonating Robert De (back as Pete) Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window. No, I love what I'm doing. But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year. You can do it. Do you want to go to India? I get what he means. Honestly, when I found out about... ...I had this flash of me in a white Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada. The chopper's taping it, and I bust through the border and I'm free! I kept thinking that. It was a flash! Don't look at me. We can talk about our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, "Alison, I got the car here. What do you want to do?" No part of you would think, "Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?" You never got that flash? "Where we're going, we don't need roads." You wouldn't do that? Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He invented the DeLorean time machine. Everyone has a time machine image. Who needs a time machine? This is my time machine! I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun it to 88. You are a funny motherfucker, man. How can you fight with him? I just want to kiss his face. He's cute. I like the way you move. This is fun! We should do this more. This is the most fun I've had in a really long time. I can't. I can't. I'll poke the baby if I go deeper. Please don't yell at me. I'm sorry, can we change positions? I'm going to crush the baby. No, it's not. It has no shell. I weigh over 200 pounds. I can't do it. Can you just get on top? All I can see if our baby, poked in the face by my penis. You look beautiful. Your chin looks so skinny. Do you want to do it doggie style? I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's doggie style. It's just the style. I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't have to go outside or anything. Here we go. Is it good? Should I go slower? Just tell me when you're close. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, fuck! The baby. It kicked my hand. No, no, no, no, no. Not like this. No, this was a warning kick. This was a bad kick. Look. My dick must be like an inch away from its face and it's coming, just coming in at its face. What if it kicked because it didn't like it? I can't do that to our baby. That's the first thing it's going to see. It's having the baby between us, it just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It just freaks me out a bit. It's a little weird. You've totally lost it? Okay. Shit. Fuck me. Oh my God! It's the Russians. Jodi! I'll protect you! Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no! That was horrible! That was so horrible. You're fine, man. When will it be light out? Take it easy. When will it be light out? Did anybody turn off the gas? I didn't do it. Oh, motherfucker. Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's a pretty incredible person. Nice to meet you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool, Martin. That's, that wasn't... Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes? Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on. Look, I forgot you were sleeping over. I'm sorry okay? You want me to stop smoking pot because there's an earthquake once every ten years? That makes no sense, Alison. You're being irrational. Just relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the cops. California. Hey! You know it's times like this I'm glad I don't own nice things. It's a big mess, but there's only like fifty bucks worth of shit here. That's kind of the good thing. You know, my dad told me, "Don't move to Northridge." But you figure, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know? It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place doesn't get condemned. That would suck. Hello? You! Really? Oh, man. I don't want to do that. He's not cheating on her. I just know. I'm one hundred percent sure he's not cheating. No. It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat. Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome? I'm just saying the music industry is different now. Steely Dan would never even have a chance. Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan gargles my balls. They're incredible. They really aren't good, man. Old Steely Dan. If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP. I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there. That's true. And I don't want you to worry. I'm just going to jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band. You guys are crazy. He's acting totally normal and hilarious. She doesn't have a gun, does she? Oh, great. Looks like no one's home. I just feel bad for Pete. I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this. (through a fake cough) Pete! I coughed. What do you want from me? Thank you. I told you. Can we get out of here, please? I didn't hear anything. Carlos Delgado. Oh shit! Hideki Matsui. Sorry, Charlie. Debbie. It's our fantasy baseball draft. It's, it's our draft...for fantasy baseball. I told you all about this. Got Matsui. Aw, shit. I went to the movies. By myself. "Spiderman Three." Because I needed to get away, you know? With work and you and the kids, sometimes I just need some time to myself. It's not that big of a deal. Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three" next week. Well... What? I don't even know what to say. Uh, what do you want me to do? I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest. I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit. Come on. Oh, shit, she's coming back. How come we go to the gynecologist so often? I bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three-hundred- thousand-dollar machine he has. That's a little strong, I would say. It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny. Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation. I have. You've sacrificed your vagina? Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery. You're right. Fine! Oh! You know what? Why don't you not threaten me?! I'm not going to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere! No! No! No. No. Can you let me back in the car, please? Have you calmed down? Did you take a breath? I have no clue where we are! Fine. Go. Great. Why don't you take off your earrings, too? They weigh about eighty pounds. They're made out of moon rocks aren't they? I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here. Sorry if I'm trying to lighten the mood a little. I didn't read the baby books! What's gonna happen? How did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?! That's right, the ancient Egyptians fucking engraved "What to Expect When You're Expecting" on the pyramid walls! I forgot about that! Who gives a flying fuck about the baby books?! Did you just say my lack of commitment? Because that's what it sounded like. It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you like an asshole! And you said no to me! You know what? I know this isn't you talking, it's your hormones, but I would just like to say, "Fuck you, hormones! You are a crazy bitch, hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!" Fuck them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit! I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for once. I totally know what you're talking about, man. If I wrote out the list of shit Alison doesn't let me do it would be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't have samurai swords in your room. Don't have illegal grow operations in the house. I could go on all fucking day. Have I told her to stop doing anything ever? No. Marriage is like that show "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it's not funny. All the problems are the same, but it's... Instead of all the funny, pithy dialogue, everybody's just really pissed off and tense. Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version of "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It lasts forever. Let's get out of here, man. Honestly, let's just go. Let's go to Vegas. Let's do it. Yeah. Why not? Since when do we lock this fucking thing? Come on! Yo. We can't go, dude. Sorry. Holy crap! What happened? We got pink eye. What? You giving each other butterfly kisses or something? Very funny. That's not how you get pink eye. You get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities. Hey, Ben. Yo. How's it going? I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere. You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow? Totally. That's awesome. Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed. Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did someone take a dump right in your eye? No. No pink eye for me. I'm just really...high. Well stay back, guys. I got to get my suit. Are you Debbie's husband? Yeah. This is fun! This is great. We're going to have the best time ever. We make a good team, man. Yep. It's like I can't come here with Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's like she wants to hold me in, and she was telling Alison she could train you. She thinks she could train me? Yeah, like you're running the Triple Crown. She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking face off. That's right. In front of a crowd, baby. This is better. Besides I don't know if I have enough of these babies to go around. Oh, my God. Are these mushrooms? I got them from a roadie for the Black Crowes. I'm eating them. Oh, no, save it! I got tickets to Cirque du Soleil. You do?! No you don't. I swear to God, man. Holy shit! I see the beam of light. There it is, baby. Woo-hoo. You're so money that you don't even know how much money you have. I love Vegas, man. This is the greatest place on earth. It's really amazing here. Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome. Now that's how you get pink eye. (to the Two Pretty Girls) Hey, what's up, baby girl? What's up? End of the line, please. Yeah. Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll let some people in when it clears out a little. You'll get right in if you go back to the end of the line. Hey, look, I don't make the rules. No. Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get out. Take care of yourself. It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you step to the back, please? Yeah, but maybe you should listen to your friend. All right, you want to come in, you're going to have to go to the end of the line and wait like everybody else. Come here, come on. I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I fucking hate this job. I don't want to be the one to pass judgement and decide who gets in. This shit makes me sick to my stomach. I get the runs from the stress. It's not because you're not hot. I would love to tap that ass. I would tear that ass up. I can't let you in because you're old as fuck...for this club, not, you know, for the earth. You old. She pregnant. Can't have a bunch of old, pregnant bitches running around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed to let in five percent black people. He said that. Five percent. That mean if there's twenty-five people here, I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people. So I got to hope there's a black midget in the crowd. Why y'all want to be in here anyway? Y'all need to be at a yoga class or something. What the fuck is she doing at the club? That's not even good parenting right there. Your old ass should know better than that. Have the mushrooms kicked in yet? This was a great idea, man. This is the best idea I've ever had in my life. What are they going to do? What in the world are they doing? If I shaved my stomach and my chest, I would look exactly like that. Those guys are at work right now. (imitating one of the No! Don't applaud! He'll fall! I'm freaking out right now, man! The mushrooms are turning on me! Papa. I am not your papa. I can't deal with this shit, man! Let's move, gang! Come on, come on, come on! Jessica, can you get these plates and put them on the table, please?! This isn't funny. That guy has twelve kids. It's not funny. This is sick. This is a sick movie. That's a lot of responsibility to be joking about. That's not funny. I got to turn this off. It's freaking me out. There are five different types of chairs in this hotel room. Holy fuck. What are they all doing in here? These are five different types of chair. Get them out of here, man. This is too many chairs for one room. There's a guy that works for this hotel. His whole job is to find chairs. Look at this one. Look at it. It's gold and red and it's kind of shiny. Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is beautiful, and it feels amazing. The tall one's gawking at me and the short one's being very droll. I don't like them. Oh, wow! It's weird that chairs even exist when you're not sitting on them. I'm up high! I'm really high up. I should've read the baby books. Why didn't you read the baby books? Because then it's real, you know? Dude, it's real whether or not you read those books. That baby's coming. Oh, man! Think they'll take us back? Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you? All the time, man. Like every day. I wonder how you like me. How can Debbie like me? She likes me. I mean, she loves me. The biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around. She loves me so much that she wants me around all the time. That's our biggest problem. And I can't even accept that? Uh, like that upsets me?! What? She's the one. She loves me. You can't believe...that people love you? I love you, man! Debbie loves you! I don't think I can accept her love. There's something wrong with me. You can't accept love? I don't know what it is. Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy thing in the world? You can't accept it? I have to go to this other chair. Oh, this is a better energy. You can't accept pure love? You can't accept Debbie? She's chosen to give you her life. She's picked you as her life partner! But you play fantasy baseball because you can't accept her love? Ugh. I could accept it, man. And Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and she's funny and she smells good and she's nice and her hair always looks different. She's too good for you, man. Tastes like a rainbow. You're disgusting. You're an urchin. And she busts your balls because you're a little bitch! You're a filthy bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie wants to give her life to you and Alison doesn't want to do that with me. And it makes me sad all day. I want to go home. (with fist in mouth) I want to go home, too. Oh, hey, what up dog? Around. You know, just kind of doing my thing. I don't know. Are they mad? What have they been saying? They said that? That sucks. Penis. It means penis. Babe, we're running low on plates. Hey Ben! What's up, man? What's happening, man? Hey, Debbie. Good. How are you? I just got yellow cupcakes. I can run out. I'll get some more. I don't mind. You sure? Well, that was fast, you pussy. You're the one that got dressed up like a cholo on Easter to come to this party. How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace? You look like Babe Ruth's gay brother, Gabe Ruth. Well played, sir. That was good. You going to talk to Alison? Yeah, I was about to. Right on. It's a doll. Thanks, Ben. We can get back on track and everything's going to be great. But Debbie's happy. I didn't do shrooms in Vegas. I'm not that guy anymore. If you give me a shot to just show you that I'm con-- Oh, shit. It's okay. What happened? Thanks for warning me, man. I just walking into a fucking buzz saw! She rejected me! Because you, for some insane reason, told Debbie that I did mushrooms with you in Vegas! She gets mad because I smoke pot! Now I'm upping it to fucking psychedelics! Thanks! Really? I thought that she'd take you back. You know why she just rejected me? Because you're such a shitty husband, she thinks I'm going to turn into a shitty husband! "Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you." When is that baby popping out? Really? Are you dilated yet? Wow! You're about to drop any second. I love your broach here. No, you don't look like a...fat cow at all. You look great. So, I have to get going in. They're calling me. Well, I just need to run in. Congratulations. I'm not being an asshole. Wow. You managed to turn Steve Carell into an asshole. No easy feat. You screwed me, Dad, okay? You said everything was going to be fine and nothing is fine. Nothing is fine. Because you were the only one giving me advice! And it was, it was terrible advice! I don't know how to take responsibility for myself, okay? I didn't read the baby books! I should smoke less pot. I don't know what to do! I'm an idiot! What, tell me what to do! Just tell me what to do. Stone, you settling in okay? Best job I ever had. Like to hear it. Alison, thank you for coming in. I don't want to shock you, but know what's under that jacket. You're pregnant, have been for a while. From my count, you're right around eight months. And I don't know why you felt you couldn't tell us. It's unfortunate that you didn't tell us because you would've found out that we thought it's great. You know, it's a rare thing that you live to see the day your wildest dreams come true. I mean what is there left to want? I get to go to Legoland. Say it! I shouldn't have given them all that meth then. Or Saturday. You never know. We might see it all in one day. Hello? Hey, what's up daddy? What are you doing? Just smoking a joint, drinking some beers, you know. Rocking. I think we're about to go to a new club. You coming? No. I'm going to pack it in soon. What's he doing? He says he's going to call it a night. Dude, it's like eight-fifteen, man. I know. I'm just tired. Is he depressed? You depressed? No, I feel great. I like it. He says no. Ask him if he's going to kill himself. You going to kill yourself? No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you. Tell him not to jerk off with a noose around his neck. It's dangerous. You shouldn't jerk off with a noose around your neck because it's dangerous. Okay, very good. Oh, and tell him if he has to, tell him he needs a teammate or a spotter there. Right. And if you do, um, you should have a teammate or a spotter there. Great. He says your mom's already there. That's cool, man. Hello? Oh, don't run out of gas! Don't run out of gas! Come on! Hello? Please be in here. Hello? Hello! Hello? Alison. Hello? Alison. What is this, like a water birth? What are we doing? Should we go? Okay. Okay. Let's relax. Do you want to talk about things? I feel really bad about a lot of the shit I did. I can't believe I said some of that. That's all I think about in my head. But maybe we could bring the baby into a reconciled place so, we can talk-- Okay. So, what should I do? Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr. Howard. It's an emergency. He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco? Do you know when he gets back? Do you have his cell number, by any chance? Hey! Good news. I got his number right here. I'm going to call him right now. I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I shouldn't have told you you were a fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said that. I feel terrible about it. It's okay. I didn't I'm going to call him right now. You're doing so great. (into the phone) Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling. Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's going into labor and you are not fucking here. Now, where are you? You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco, you motherfucking piece of shit! And you know I'm going to have to do now? I'm going to have to kill you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac! You are fucking Biggie, you piece of shit! I hope you fucking die or drop the fucking chair and kill that fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes. Peace, fucker! Hey. I didn't talk to him directly, I left him a very nice message, though. What I'm about to tell you isn't that bad. You should know that going in. We can get through this and it's just a little hiccup, but everything will be fine. Do you trust me when I say everything will be fine? You're welcome. It's okay. I stole this from Martin's grandma. Thanks. We're close. Home stretch. (to Female Nurse) Hello. This is Alison Scott. Dr. Kuni said he would let you know we were coming? Yeah? All right. Hi. You're our nurse? That's why I'm holding the clipboard. So, uh, what else is up with you guys? I'm just joking. Let's have a baby! So, I'm sorry it took me so long to find that vein. That little guy really didn't want me to find him. Yeah. That's how we can tell how the little guy or gal is doing. We really, really appreciate you coming, man. He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco. He didn't tell us though. Yeah. Four centimeters. Dilated. I want to get the fuck out of here. What? I just want to get the fuck out of here. Just relax, man, just relax. I don't fucking like hospitals. Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think you need to relax and embrace the beauty of another life joining our gang. We're having a baby. We are having a baby. I'm not having shit besides a fucking panic attack. There's probably a fucking room back there full of dead bodies! You guys want to be here when one rolls out and just fucking coughs malaria into our face? Jesus. Fucking shit. Is that good? I could do this all day. What the hell was that? What's that, what's happening? Decels. It's going to be okay. (to Dr. Kuni) Is it going to be fine? You're going to feel a little bit of a push. What are you doing? What? No. Would you please just listen to her? Whoa, whoa, whoa, what? No. What we want is to take a second to talk about our options, okay? That's all we want. Can we talk outside in the hall for a second? Look, she's just having a hard time because her and her doctor had a very specific birth plan. And they wanted it to be a very special experience. Look, man, will you help us out? I have no idea what I'm doing. You can be as big a dick to me as you want. Just be nice to her, man. That's all I ask. Just please be nice to her. I think so. Thank you, man. I know, I know. Look, I talked to him. I think he'll be more cool now. You really don't need to be. And you know, I knew you'd give me another shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know? No, no. Me neither. All right, Martin, who am I? Stephen Hawking. Oh, fuck. Stay down! Jonah, you shithead! All right, how do you want this? You want this over the shoulder? I can do whatever you want. I can get in there. Kind of Spike Lee angles. Can I talk to you in the hall for a second? I'd like to be in there with Alison...without you. Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room. If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies. Okay? So don't even try to come into that room. That's my room now. That little area with the Pepsi machine...that's your area. My room. Your area. Stay in your area. Stay out of my room. Back the fuck off. What are you doing here? I wish I'd gotten that on tape. Give it to her. Give her the epidural, okay? Give it to her now. We have time. Just do it, please! Maybe we can take it down just a little. I think you're going to scare the other pregnant women. Jesus. Oh. This is messed up. Something's wrong in there. No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to me like she's crowning. Is that right, Deb? No, I disagree with you. That sounds terrible. I'm going to go sneak a peek, see if there's anything I can do. Oh, God. You don't want to see it. You don't It's beautiful. You don't want to, though. You okay in here? Jesus! Yeah, okay. You all right, buddy? One sec. What did it look like? I shouldn't have gone in there. Don't go in there. Promise me you don't go in there. Me go in there? That's the last fucking place I want to go. Like I'm going to go in there. Try getting a boner now. What's up Deb? You did it. You did it. Oh, my God, you did it. I love you so much, too. Oh, my God. You got out. You made it out. Welcome. You ever get so bored you just stare at your balls? I bet you do, late John Lennon. Here we go again. I think it's Matisyahu. Awesome. You want out of the bet? I want out of the bet. You know what you have to say. Just say it, man. I think now is the time. "Jason, you're the master." You heard it, right? Yeah. All right. You're out of the bet. You're done. Your face smells like an old man's balls. Thank you. I love you, Debbie. Okay. Gentlemen, it's a girl! Ohhhhhhh! Yeah! We got a daughter! Mazel Tov! Congratulations, Daddy! We got a beautiful little girl! Let's meet her! She's awesome. A beautiful little girl! Let's meet her. Aw. (to the baby) And then your mommy said, "Just do it, already," which was very confusing to Daddy. So I listened to the most literal translation of that and I just did it, already. What would you do? Don't tell Mommy, but it was the smartest thing I ever did, listening to her, because now you're here. Isn't that nice? I think it is. It definitely is. That's why I got one in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The only thing is we have to decide if we're going to be Crips or Bloods before we get there. I look good in blue. The fighting continues. We could just throw off everyone and become Latin Kings. We both look good in gold. No, these guys can honk all they want. I ain't going faster than twelve. It might take us around three hours to get home, though.
