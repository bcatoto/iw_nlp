Yeah. Transmission's shot. Shit... Rae... Rae don't do this now... Rae! Look it. I got somethin' for us.  This is gonna help, okay. This watch here is gonna beep at  midnight. Every night. That's when  it comes up on you the hardest, right? And wherever I'm at, my watch'll  beep, too. We'll be thinkin' bout  each other at the same time. Wherever  we are. I gotta believe we can do this or I  ain't gonna make it, Rae. I love you. I never laid a hand on her in anger.  Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'.  But this business got me wonderin'  what a good shake and slap would do  for her. I didn't start this, R.L. Your mother's funeral. I's a  pallbearer, remember? If you come to talk about that  muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and  leave you sittin' pretty in that new  suit he bought'cha. Say what you gotta say, but I ain't  gonna hear you speak his name to me.  Not never. You hear? Carryin' on behind my back. Make me  out to look like a fool to all our  people. Tell me, what's friendly  about that? And you gonna live it with him? Rose. Folks get sick. But you do  what you can to get on the mend. Our  marriage... it just got sick. That's  all. I keep the heat on. Kept us warm for twelve years. Better'n me? Rose... please... If we get with a counselor. At the  church, maybe they's... God forgive you, for how you done  me... My Daddy told me that a younger woman  would bleed me dry. And that's what  you did. Ya bled me. Would'a chopped my arm off if you  asked. And this how you do me! You better pray, gal. You better  pray... It's already noon, Rae. You think  that skirt should still be on? You won't at the square this mornin'. Get me ten bags of mulch. Yes'sir. Keep the change on that. Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus. You wanna tip me, best do it in butter  beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a  yours, none of that store-bought  junk. That's what she said. Alright, Lincoln. You come on by,  I'll load you up. He black alright, he just ain't blue. Folks can dance when they want. Didn't  buy that mirror ball for nothin'. They got blue snakes up north? Wanna get on somebody 'bout live  music, get on ol' Laz, there.

Rose said... it didn't go too well  this afternoon. See, that's not how  we wanted this to go down. I told  her, I said, Rose, we ain't leavin'  till we make peace with Laz. And  that's God's truth. I laid it down. You laid it down. I did. Funny. Layin' it down... for my wife. We're not gonna get through this  clean. But it don't need to get dirty.  All this... it just come together  unexpected. You think I want to hurt  you? I... I'd take a bullet for you,  Laz. You wanna give that a try? Bo. You still got that .22 behind  the tap? My little brother say he'd  take a bullet for me. You come here to ease your heart.  Well, I ain't gonna give it to you.  You took her into your bed, now you  gotta lie in it. I'll always love you, Laz. Till the  end of my... LAZ! Cain slew Able. Slew him out of envy.  And God put his mark on Cain for his  sin. You want that mark, Deke? Give  you that peace you come here for?  I'll give it to you, just say that  shit again. Say you love me.

You know I need your love just like  the angels need heaven above. Well I sure did shot my baby, but I  did it because she did me wrong.  Well I sure did shot my baby, but I  did it because she did me wrong.  You know the judge called it murder  now the penitentiary is my home. I loved that woman, she said she  didn't love no one but me.  I loved that woman, she said she  didn't love no one but me. Yeah but I caught my baby cheating. Now my home ain't where it used to  be.

Listen... Listen... LISTEN NOW, GAL! I ain't gonna hurt ya, hear? Gotta  get you well. Now, look me... HEY!  Look me in the eye. Open your eyes. Go'on, now. You need  to see, ain't no harm here. Ain't no  harm. My name is Lazarus Woods. And I ain't  gonna let you die. I know, child, I know. Gotta break  that fever now. Don't mean to hurt'chu. But I ain't  lettin' you die. Put fear of the Devil in me, gal.  Got me spooked like I's a kid, I  tell you. But the good Lord, He showed me what  to do. He come knockin' like my man  R.L. say... listen here... This here Matthew. He talkin' on how  Jesus was healin' the sick. And a  man come up to the disciples and he  say... Have mercy on my son, for he is a  lunatic, and sore vexed... He got the devil in his mind and  sores on his skin. And he brought the boy to the  disciples, but they could NOT cure  him. Then Jesus answered and said, O  faithless and perverse generation...  how long shall I suffer you? Bring  the boy hither to me. And Jesus  rebuked the devil. You hear that? Then the disciples say... Why could  not we cast the devil out? And Jesus  said unto them... Listen now... This what he sayin' to  us. He say... If ye have faith... if ye have faith  as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall  say unto a mountain, remove hence...  and it... shall... move. And  nothin'... nothin' shall be impossible  to you. You hear that? You just need a bit  of faith. You just gotta believe you  gonna get well, like I do. That's better. You coolin' down.  Okay. You rest. Okay. You rest. Gal? Gal? GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE? You travelin' right now, gal. You  asleep and you don't even know it. Now... come on inside with me. Come on, gal... Goin' over that hill. Goin' over  that hill. Well, I ain't gonna stop  until I reach my God's top. I'm goin'  over the hill. Well I went to the  valley, I didn't go to stay. Soul  got happy, I stayed all day. I'm  goin' over that hill. What'chu sayin'? Uh-huh. Naw! Nuh-uh. How a girl get like that? What'chu gonna do? Huh? Nothin'. YOU Tell me who's that writin'? John the  Revelator. Wrote the book of the  seven seals. Hey. Take it easy now. Don't rush it. You been in and out goin' on two...  maybe two days. After your fever broke, you'd wake  up in spells... long enough to get  that medicine in ya. Found you on the side of the road.  Someone took to beatin' on you pretty  bad. You know who done that to you? Well I don't... Don't need none. Think it'd be best if you stayed put  while we talk. Best try gettin' ya wits about you  'fore you try to... Let me say somethin' first... Way I see it, it's gonna take a while  for you to get right. I ain't laid a hand on ya but to  ease yo fever... Remember like I  say, I found you in the road... Now, no harm's come to you... and I  aim to keep it that way. Ain't  gonna... gonna run a train over ya...  or however you call it... see... you  was runnin' wild on me... these fever  dreams you was havin'... these fits.  I'd be chasin' you all night. Gal, you ain't right yet. How you let men treat ya like they  do? These men you up under. How you let  them do ya like that? You know what I'm talkin' about. All that mess with ya teachers and...  boys in the backs of trucks. I've saved ya life, gal. I can do  and say whatever the fuck I want. I give ya enough chain so's you can  get about the house. Get you to the  kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll  reach. We got everything we need. Plenty of  food. Ya medicine still got a few  good swallows in it... God saw to it to put you in my path.  And I aim to cure ya of your  wickedness. No ma'am. In my house, you watch that lip... You sick. You got a sickness... we  broke that fever... we gonna break  that hold the devil got on ya. Ain't gonna be moved. GAL! I ain't gonna be moved on this! You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't  gonna bend my will. Right or wrong, you gonna mind me. Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to  the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE Now you get up! And you get in my  house! Whose doin' is that? Say we talk. Just take a seat on the  sofa. I'll get us somethin' cool to  drink. You may not remember. But you spent  a whole half day in my tub, tryin'  to cool down. Melted four ice trays. Wicked little bitch... gonna cut  me... Think I'm gonna let you do me like  that... Okay, now... I ain't gonna hit'cha. Just lost my cool there. Now take that look out'cha eye. No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness. I said... STOP! You hungry? I put some back ache into growin'  them greens. You should slow down  and see how they taste. Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need  to get your legs strong. My Daddy was one of the first mens  to organize soil conservation in  these parts. That's a group of  farmers, you know, each season they'd  rotate the crop. Know why it's best  to rotate em like that? Cuz once in a while soil need a  change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate  in the fertilizer. So next crop what  ya do is plant ya some soy beans.  That give off a lot of nitrate. Change  keeps it all growin' and growin'  strong. Sting a bit? Means ya healin'. So all this farmin' make me think on  Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of  the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on  the wayside, some fell in thorns...  you know the story? The seed that land on good soil is  for them who hear the word of God...  and understand the word of God. Not  enough for you to hear what I'm  sayin', you gotta understand. Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit...  this just a story... Look it. I've seen it in nature,  I've seen it in men. Ya got to change  up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't  gettin' in. Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no  cause to be up under these fools,  ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like  you somebody's dog. No woman... who  joins in union with Almighty God...  or man... in the sanctity of  marriage... should degrade herself...  and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL! My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE?  I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit.  Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket  jukes all ya life... a nigga learn  how to sin, let me tell you! GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! Didn't mean to go off on a tear like  I did. I just got to thinkin' about  things... There goes our fortune. We been doin'  good for ourselves since you been  away. Y'all know when Ella Mae's open up? You needin' to buy some pantyhose? Just some dresses. I'm needin' some women's clothes. A  few dresses. Maybe some shoes. But  they gotta be nice. They gotta be  proper. Clothes a woman would want,  where she could feel and look like a  woman without... you know, lookin'  like a tramp or a hussy or somethin'. That young lady's size, right'cher. Mind I ask, what's all this business  here? For your hands? I'll take a jar of that, too. Lookin' for Miss Angela. I brung you a little basket of  goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes,  some okra, butter beans. Just wanted to say how much I  appreciate you helping me the other  day. My niece, she's cured up, and I  got you to thank. Look here. I got somethin' special  for you. This here is a whipped... body cream.  And it's got a smell to it. Tell me  what you think. They call this Ginger Souffle. Best  if it... if it go on your skin just  after you been in a hot tub... or  shower. Well. Hope you enjoy it. You gonna be on the square later on? Got all my honey-do's done with. I'm  headin' home. Stay cool. It's a hot one. Yes'sir, Rev'rend. Mister Lazarus? Mister Laz... I come for the butter  beans. Ain't seen you on the square. Mister  Laz, can you hear me? Mister Lazarus? Mister Laz, I'm comin' inside... SHIT BOY! WHAT THE HELL YOU...! CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE... Lincoln, come on back. He's fine. Just had a bad fall. R.L., you gonna have to get on. I  can't have nobody round my place. This ain't got nothin' to do with  that woman. Just don't want nobody  around me now. You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin'  this time. You ain't gonna talk me outta shit  no more. I got my mind made up and I  ain't gonna be moved on this. Got no place for preachin' here. Not  now. So you do as I say... I told you to TURN BACK! Man like you ought not take the Lord's  name like you just done. I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I  found her beat. Left for dead. So I  brung her home. I haven't laid a hand. On my life,  R.L., my wick is dry on this. Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out  here, alone, with a beaten, half  naked, white woman loves to fuck. I  been toe to toe with the law in this  town for no more than being black  and nearby. Why don't you go'on and ask her. She  need to talk wit somebody with sense.  Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on  this gal all her days. And this is  how I'm handling it. Go in and talk to her. Please. Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I  expect you to come. You treat folks special when they  company. It's just supper, R.L.,  shit. Watch y'self in there. That girl'll  jump on ya junk like a grasshopper. Did I hurt'chu? What happened in there... that won't  your fault. Ain't a young man alive  could keep they britches on with  that girl being in heat like she is. Why she got a chain on her? That's between her and me. It's  private. And I don't want you goin'  off and tellin' ya daddy. Please don't tell my daddy. My mouth is shut, boy. And that's  how we gonna keep it. Don't go  braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me? So... That your first time? Yes'sir. You struck some gold, didn't ya? Shit. My first time was with my second  cousin behind my uncle's barn. She  weighed two tons, if a pound. Could'a  done a lot better for myself. You  sho'nuf did. This is Ronnie again. Don't know if  you been gettin' my messages but...  I'm down at the bus station and... I just need you come get me. You get  this message, I'm on the interstate  headin' downtown toward the square. Rae. I really need you to... come  find me. Please. We gonna eat with her? She still gonna have that chain on? I ain't no virgin no more? Now that's sharp. That is sharp.  Chain give you any trouble? Good. Now I got the steaks on,  potatoes at a boil, and biscuits  ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and  Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the  corn. What do you know how to make? Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk  all my life. And let me tell you... If all you got is filth comin' out'cha  mouth... people just gonna tune ya  out. Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya.  I just know you got more in you than  junk. Now, you sayin' you don't know how  to cook anything at all? You know how to boil water? Well, get to it. Amen. Y'all let me know if these steaks  are too dry. I skipped lunch. Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to  eat. Ask the chef. Yeah. Sure. Hey, Herman. They buy you that big chicken dinner? They got little names for everything  in the corps when they trying to get  rid of ya. Don't know what it's like  in the guard. There's what you call  a bad conduct discharge, a BCD... we  all called it the big chicken dinner.  It ain't the brig but it'll fuck ya  for life if you wantin' to work for  the government. That's not what this is about. They got another little name called  ad-sep. That sound about right? Ad-sep. Administrative separation. Blowin' boys in the head, for one. Whoa, son! I ain't sayin' shit about  you. I'm just talkin'. Well, you don't know what you're  talking about so why don't you shut  the fuck up? To get back ya had to've gone  somewhere. They been keepin' a folder on me cuz  of my stomach. Like how it was just  before we'd play ball back in school.  Thought it was just some tic I got,  or ulcers like my daddy had. I can't... shoot. Target practice  I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers  each time but... But when there's really loud noises  around me... somethin' happens. I  get shaky and... I lose my breath.  They called it anxiety. Severe  anxiety. It can be fixed and all...  just not in time for.... It's a long process but... they sent  me home. I can't get Rae on the phone. She's  not at home... none of her friends  seen her anywhere. I don't know. She's gettin' crazy,  like she gets. Begged me not to go.  Got real down. I just think somethin's  happened. Like she run off with  someone. You'd tell me if you knew  somethin', right? Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate  when I seen your truck outside. Rae? This don't feel right. Kitchen looks  just like I left it. I know, cuz I  cleaned it. I just been so mixed up lately, Gill.  And, you know, with her history, I  can see how she could get scared... ...and run. Her momma works down at the grocery,  down on the square. Maybe she seen  her. That's not right, really, cuz I... Now wait... I know about how she was like. But  we was different. I's the only person  she talked to about it. How she's  abused. Terrible things, Gill, just  terrible... It's not her fault, Gill. She's had  to take care of me all this time,  cuz I'd just start throwin' up...  choking. Just losin' my grip. And  she listened. She listened to me. And... I got better. I don't get  nervous like I used to. And since we  been together... she been faithful  to me. Put all that junk behind her... Make yourself at home. You done it  already. I'm dealin' with what God put before  me. Not like that. She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to  each other. I'm through with them both. You drink whiskey? You take it straight? To my baby brother. Gonna be a daddy. Want another? To freedom. No joke. Not my place to change your mind, or  anybody else's. People gonna do how  they please. You only get one life...  should be lived the way you wanna  live it. If you want... I can take you back  to town now. Anything. Ain't played 'fore nobody in years. Funny how a sound just speak to ya  heart. Wanted me some kids. A whole mess of  'em. But Rose, my wife... chil'ren  was for another time. They's this one spring... I saw a  change in her. Her breasts start  swellin' up. Come a few mornings I  hear her heavin' in the bathroom. I  seen it with women before. I knew. Come a day, Rose say she had to go  visit her folks in Jackson. Didn't  want me to come... so I stayed put. When she come back... They talk about a woman havin' that  glow. Couldn't see it no more. She...  took it away. Cut it out. One night... While she sleepin'.  Held a pillow in my hands. I could  see myself killin' her. What evil in  my heart make me wanna kill her, I  don't know? It's that voice in me.  Each time I think it's gone, he come  howlin' back. Devil or no, I don't  know. But I am a haunted man. Calls me when I'm ailing. When I  can't find my home, lost in the pines.  I calls it the Black Snake Moan. Mm-mm... Got no momma now.Mm-mm...  Got no momma now.It's over late last  night, don't need no momma now. Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin' in my  room.Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin'  in my room.Some pretty momma better  come and get this black snake soon. Black snake is evil, black snake is  all I see.Black snake is evil, black  snake is all I see.Woke up this  mornin', black snake moved in on me. My life is gone. Only life I was  livin'. And I lost it. I had love in my heart. And I gave  it to one woman. And she gone now. Where am I gonna put all this love? Wait... I gotta stop... Rae stop... Dammit, Rae... GET OFF! This ain't the way for me. I'm sorry. Tell me what to do. You just havin' a fit. You ain't  goin' nowhere. No one's gonna hurt you no more. We'll just stay here. Wait till it  passes. Right here.

I'm not usually  so... afraid. I don't know what's... wrong... Yeah, I do. Looks like you know a song. How you feelin' today? I know that. Go'on and sing it, I'll play. Stop that foolishness. Just do as I  say and close your eyes. Close your eyes. And think about...  well, for a song like this, I'd say  you think about what you love. Get a good picture in your mind. Think on that. And sing wit me. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. Good. I know another. It go like  this. Last night dear, as I lay sleeping.  I dreamed I held you in my arms.  When I awoke dear, I was mistaken.  So I hung my head and I cried. Close your eyes Rae... sing it. Ain't been a week and you already  some nigger's whore? Gill told me.  Told me how you and he... you and  everybody... Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as  a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?

You so green you couldn't stomp  a baby duck. You testing me? Huh? You testin' me,  old man? Test. Shit. What kind'a test you  thinkin'? You mean like, if you a  man or not? If you a killer? Only  one way to prove that. You just look  me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze  that trigger back. Ain't that easy, is it? I been in  some scraps, son, I know. First  there's that loud crack. Always louder  than you think. Like it just come-up- a-cloud and clapped a mess thunder  right in ya hand. BAM! White light. Smell of smoke. Taste  of my blood and brains in your mouth,  stingin' ya eyes. GODDAMMIT, RAE! BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT SHUT UP! SHUT UP! Put all your love and dreams into  one woman... she turn around and  give it all to another man. That's a  good reason to paint the wall with  me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz  there won't be no more question in  her mind. She with a real man now. A  real KILLER! Don't... don't say that to me... Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience  to suffer you children and this monkey  junk. I'm too old to play house... ...and cowboys. So let's have it.  End me or get out of my face! Go'on. Do it. I can't stop... I can't stop... being  scared. What am I gonna do... Thought you knew me better, gal. I need you at my house... right now. I hate this town. You can't round  the corner without bumping into  someone who's got your number. We did a lot of dreamin', me and  Rae. Makin' plans to get out. I'd do  my tour and... we'd move outta here.  Go to Chattanooga. And I'd work for  my uncle. But... when Rae gets like she does.  And she does the things that she  always done. Makes me feel like she  loves this place more'n me. All my life people called me shit  like, sissy and... nervous and... I  got few things in my life that make  me feel like... like... Like a man. Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel  like a man with her. I wanna feel  like the only man with her. Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that  nosey gal up at the counter give me  your home address. Hope you don't  mind me comin' over. I need ya help again. Can I come in? I lied to you. It was wrong. But at  the time... I didn't know what to  do. Imagine you got an earful from  folks about that gal I's carryin'... Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean  to say... I got feelings for you. And I didn't  want you to think... I didn't... I don't want you to go away. There's  better ways to say what I'm trying  to say, but... they it is. Don't go  away. I do. God's truth. I do. That'll do. Don't see generosity much these days.  Everything always got a catch. Guess  I'm tryin' to say... thank you. Just wanted to see. Yeah, I know. Yes, ma'am. You Ronnie? Yeah. I'm Lincoln. Guess I'm gonna be your  best man. Okay. You havin' trouble with that tie?  Cuz I'm pretty good at it. Gotta do it like this or I get all  turned around. Now that's sharp. That's real sharp.  Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't  she? You like it? Well, this one's yours now. You ready  to take care of it? Now... let's stop that. You and me... we can handle this.  You hear me, gal? We gonna be just  fine. Now live ya life. Pull your  shit together and live your life. Maybe I won't. I do. You got her now? I gotta pull over.
