Yessir, just walked in the door. Sheriff he had some sort of a thing on him like one of them oxygen tanks for emphysema or somethin'. And a hose from it run down his sleeve... ...Well you got me, sir. You can see it when you get in... ...Yessir I got it covered. What's this about? Step out of the car please, sir. Huh? What is... I need you to step out of the car, sir. Am I... Would you hold still please, sir. Hold still. Shit. Agua. ...Agua. Por Dios. Ain't got no water. Agua. I told you I ain't got no agua. You speak English? ...Where's the last guy? Ultimo hombre. Last man standing, must've been one. Where'd he go? ...Agua. I reckon I'd go out the way I came in... La puerta... Hay lobos... Ain't no lobos. If you stopped... to watch your backtrack... you're gonna shoot my dumb ass. ...But. If you stopped... you stopped in shade. It's full a money. At the gettin' place. No. I found it. What? Quit hollerin'. You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean. You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you. Just keep it up. That'll work. All right. Yeah. Goin' out. Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back. I'm fixin' to do somethin' dumbern hell but I'm goin' anyways. ...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her. Well then I'll tell her myself. Hello?... Goddamnit. How much? This. And the gas. What way would that be? What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo? Didn't mean nothin'. I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things. I don't know. Will there? With what? Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything? You already asked me that. See about closing. What time do you close? Now is not a time. What time do you close. You don't know what you're talking about, do you? I said you don't know what you're talking about. ...What time do you go to bed. You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed. I could come back then. You said that. You live in that house behind the store? You've lived here all your life? You married into it. You married into it. I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is. ...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss? The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss. Call it. Yes. Just call it. You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right. Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin? Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it. Everything. You stand to win everything. Call it. Well done. ...Don't put it in your pocket. Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter. Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is. Odessa. Not we, you. Stay with your mother. Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars? Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home. C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again. Things happened. I can't take 'em back. Mind ridin' bitch? This his truck? Mm-hm. Screwgie. ...Who slashed his tires? Wudden us. That's a dead dog. Thank you. ...Where's the transponder? In the truck. I'll get it. These are some ripe petunias. Hold this please. ...You getting anything on this? Not a bleep. All right... Yessir. We should a brought wieners. It could be. The old boy shot by the highway? That's very linear Sheriff. Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway. You sure? Truck's just yonder. Somebodies pried the inspection plate off the door. Llewelyn Moss? You figure him for a dope runner? Hell's bells, they even shot the dog. ...Well this is just a deal gone wrong. What calibers you got there, Sheriff? Mm. ...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em? These boys appear to be managerial. ...I think we're lookin' at more'n one fracas. ...Wild West over there... ...Execution here. These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money. But you don't believe it. It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff? I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss. Yes I did. Where does he work? Where does he work? Where does he work? I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon. Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days. Yes I do. Well I got a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing. Uh-huh. You should be used to that. Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired. Yes ma'am? I shall return. Sheriff's Department! We goin' in? What about yours? Sheriff's Department! ...Nobody here. No sir. ...I believe they've done lit a shuck. That from the lock? So when was he here? Sheriff? Whoa! Sheriff! ...Sheriff, we just missed him! We gotta circulate this! On the radio! Sheriff, that's aggravating. You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him? Take me to a motel. You got one in mind? Just someplace cheap. The what? I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed. Is Llewelyn there? You expect him? Hep you? I need the Larry Mahan's in black, size 11. Okay. You sell socks? Just white. White is all I wear. You got a bathroom? Ain't got Larries in black but I got 'em in osta-rich. Break in easy. Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms. What room? Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here. ...Keep going. ...Keep going. Don't stop. I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy. It's all right. Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it. I want you to take me to another motel. Let's just call it square. You're already in a jackpot. I'm trying to get you out of it. Now take me to a motel. He labs from Austin on the man by the highway. Wasn't no bullet. Yessir. Wasn't none. No sir. Yes sir. Sir, I don't want to picture that. The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em? No sir. Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over. Uh-huh. Double ought. They'll give you a wallop. You have camping supplies? Tent poles. Uh-huh. You already have the tent? Somethin' like that. Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles. Never mind. I want a tent. What kind of tent? The kind with the most poles. Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could. Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store? Could I get another room. No, I want to keep my room, and get another one. Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms? What about one forty-two. No, one forty-two. No me mate. How'd you find it? No me mate. Shouldn't be doin' that. Even a young man like you. Doin' what. The old man gazes at the road. Hitchhikin'. Dangerous. You know Anton Chigurh by sight, is that correct? Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em. When did you last see him. November the 28th, last year. You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit? No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th. We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product. Yessir. I understand that. This account will only give up twelve hundred dollars in any twenty-four hour period. That's up from a thousand. Yessir. If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it. Okay. How well do you know Chigurh. Well enough. That's not an answer. What do you want to know? I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he? Compared to what? The bubonic plague? He's bad enough that you called me. He's a psychopathic killer but so what? There's plenty of them around. He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert. Okay. We can stop that. You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells? In all honesty I can't say that charm has had a whole lot to do with it. ...I'm wondering... Yes? Can I get my parking ticket validated? ...An attempt at humor, I suppose. I'm sorry. Goodbye, Mr. Wells. One room, one night. That's twenty-six dollars. You on all night? Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning. For you. I ain't asking you to do anything illegal. I'm waitin' to hear your description of that. There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight. There just ain't no way. I'm not going to hurt you. I need you to -- I'll give you five hundred bucks for your shirt and your coat. Let's see the money. ...Were you in a car accident? Yeah. Okay, lemme have the money. It's right here. Give me the coat. Lemme hold the money. Gimme the clothes. ...And let me have your beer. ...How much? Brian. Give him the beer. Doctor. ...Medico. Por favor. Sheriff I found out everything there was to find. Those vehicles are titled and registered to deceased people. ...The owner of that Blazer died twenty years ago. Did you want me to see what I could find out about the Mexican ones? Sheriff. Oh. One of the tiedowns worked lose. I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff. Didn't have no van with four-wheel drive. ...You going to write me up for improperly secured load? I'm guessin'... this is not the future you pictured for yourself when you first clapped eyes on that money. ...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you. I know, I've seen him. Sort of. You've seen him. And you're not dead. ...But that won't last. What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass? I don't think that's how I would describe him. How would you describe him? I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor. His name is Chigurh. Sugar? Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you? I know how he found me. It's called a transponder. I know what it is. He won't find me again. Not that way. Not any way. Took me about three hours. I been immobile. No. You don't understand. ...What do you do? I'm retired. What did you do? I'm a welder. Acetylene? Mig? Tig? Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it. Cast iron? Yes. I don't mean braze. I didn't say braze. Pot metal? What did I say? Were you in Nam? Yeah. I was in Nam. So was I. So what does that make me? Your buddy? Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you. Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in. How do you know he's not on his way to Odessa? Why would he go to Odessa? To kill your wife. Maybe he should be worried. About me. He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles. ...You didn't take the product, did you? What product. The heroin. You don't have it. No I don't have it. No. You don't. ...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells. Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money. If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh? No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me. He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that. Hello Carson. Let's go to your room. We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home. Why would I let you do that? I know where the money is. If you knew, you would have it with you. I need dark. To get it. I know where it is. I know something better. What's that. I know where it's going to be. And where is that. It will be brought to me and placed at my feet. You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here. I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it. You go to hell. Let me ask you something. If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule? Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are? You mean the nature of this conversation? I mean the nature of you. ...You can have the money. Anton. ...Hello? Yes? Is Carson Wells there. Not in the sense that you mean. ...You need to come see me. Who is this. You know who it is. ...You need to talk to me. I don't need to talk to you. I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going? Why would I care where you're going. Do you know where I'm going? ...I know where you are. Yeah? Where am I? You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going? Yeah. I know where you're going. All right. You know she won't be there. It doesn't make any difference where she is. So what're you goin' up there for. You know how this is going to turn out, don't you? No. Do you? Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't. Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all. Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans. Yessir. Yessir. It was punched out. You gonna drive out there? How's that, Sheriff? Yessir. No sir. I'm a veteran. Nam? Yes sir. Two tours. What outfit. Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight. Wilson! Yessir. Get someone to help this man. He needs to get into town. How those Larries holdin' up? Good. I need everything else. Okay. You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on? No sir, it's unusual. She don't want to talk to you. Yes she does. Put her on. Do you know what time it is? I don't care what time it is. Don't you hang up this phone. I told her what was going to happen, didn't I. Chapter and verse. I said: This is what will come to pass. And now it has come to pass -- Hey. You know what's goin' on? Who are you? Yes. He gave Acosta's people a receiver. That's foolish. You pick the one right tool. ...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window. That depends. Do you see me? Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. No ma'am. Do you need help with the bags, madam? Which bus are you taking? You go to El Paso? I know it. Where are you staying? Carla Jean, how are you. What's the problem there, neighbor. Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time. You from around here? Alpine. Born 'n bred. Here ya go. What airport would you use. Huh? Airport or airstrip? Airport. Well -- where ya goin'? I don't know. Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well... ...There's airstrips. ...The airport is El Paso. You want some place specific you might could be better off just drivin' to Dallas. Not have to connect. ...You gonna clamp them, buddy? Can you get those chicken crates out of the bed. What're you talkin' about? Hey yourself. That's me. Waitin' for my wife. Half. Lookin' for what's comin'. Then you'll like me. Ma'am I know what beer leads to. I thought maybe she was with your boy there. Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well... ...County'll bury her. Here Lies Female, Unknown. Her Number Was Up. ...Buy you a cup of coffee before you drive home? Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash. It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs. It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to? If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you. It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing. Try "old" on for size. None of that explains your man though. He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom. Well what would you call him. He's real all right. All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything. That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel. Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it? ...Good trip Ed Tom. I'm sorry we couldn't help your boy. No. No. I wouldn't worry about it. No. But I gave my word. To your husband. Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself. I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen. Yes. Things fall into place. Mister there's a bone stickin' out of your arm. I'm all right. Let me just sit here a minute. There's an ambulance comin. Man over yonder went to call. All right. Are you all right? You got a bone stickin' out of your arm. What will you take for that shirt? What shirt? Any damn shirt. I need something to wrap around my head and I need a sling for this arm. Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt. Look at that fuckin' bone. Tie this for me. ...Just tie it. Hell mister, I don't mind helpin' somebody out. That's a lot of money. Take it. Take it and you didn't see me. I was already gone. Yessir. Part of that's mine. You still got your damn shirt. That ain't what it was for. Maybe, but I'm still out a shirt.
