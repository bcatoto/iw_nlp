Nope. Never. No, no, on the football field. They called me... ...The Smallville Flash. Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school? Brad. Aha! What'd I tell ya! Not enough vodka in it. S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing? Tuesday. Mr. Roebush? What are you talkin' about? What? Yeah? What do you want? The kid needs a man to show him -- For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent. A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport. All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here. Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row. Hiya, sweet thing. Little guy's getting' hassled, huh? Kent, you still here? Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could. "See" I mean, Hahaha! Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours. Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance. But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --The kid will do fine on his own. Give it your best shot, Ricky! I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids. Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way. Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad. I seem to be. Brad Wilson. But if you wouldn't mind settling for me -- No, well in this case I think I can speak for him. I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know. Superman will be there on Wednesday. Gee, I always loved porch swings. Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day. Uh-huh. Can I help? Call me. Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but -- Old ties are hard to cut. You know, I was just thinking, Lana -- -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis -- Me neither... Well, this pate is rather...unusual. No, thanks. I meant all the choices here. All this -- -- cole slaw, guacamole -- This is some picnic! There's a lot of choices here. Me?? Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream. Gee, I haven't done this in years. But all he had was chocolate milk. Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself. You thought that? Oh...I came close once. Who? But Lana, you could -- I didn't -- Too much mayonnaise? It sure is. The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and -- Sure, Lana, I'd love to. You're welcome...?? You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman -- ...uh, chairperson... You always did. Can I give you a hand with that? Lana Lang. How great to see you. I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run. Uh...excuse me, folks... Oh. You're going away. Let me do it for you, Mr. White. Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think? Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but --- Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem. Sure. We get together sometimes. What! Well... Not quite like this. Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary. You're the best, Lois. So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements? Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate -- Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ? What are you doing? At one o'clock in the morning? What's that? Mmmmm . . . It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible. Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are? Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . . The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint-- -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast! A television set? Not counting this week. You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . . Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks. Dishwasher? Any luck? What kind? Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman? Name?The boss wants to see you. Gus? Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise? Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'? How many sugars? They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where. No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could. They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got. Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent. There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number. That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65. First paycheck?Man, you don't never pass out, do ya? Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail! Brad? Brad is not a good name for a cocktail. Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name? What? What did you tell me? There's no vodka in it. Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong? TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!! Roebush! That's the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before... Omigod!! What's tomorrow? Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss. First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh? Buddy, are we in trouble. What about this week's check? Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum! I know, I'm the fault. Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet. Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs. They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it! Thirty-five. Nope, but -- Kitchen. . . Technician Yeah. Gus Gorman. Say who? Say what? Yeah. A raise . . Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here. One. And a half. So where is all them half-centses? Who gets it, the company? What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions? I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool. First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80! Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax! Sonofagun! Look at this here! Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got -- Hey, what y'all doin' up there?! You want to mess with Superman? Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot. You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet. Yeah, sure. Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train... Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do? I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out! Stone mutha. I told you it wasn't no jive. Yeah? How's it look? Anything. Everything. I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer. Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it. A computer. Fair's fair. Don't be getting' racist with me, man. Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody. 'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans. Now...when do I get a taste? The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set. Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'! Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes. Then how's all the people gonna get their oil? They ain't got captains? Huh? He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of... Greed! Let me tell you something--- That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me. I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig. Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin' It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby. well. I know some stuff too, y'all. Uh...what channel were you watching? Turn on the T.V. Hey, boss. Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where." He says I'm a genius, your don -- Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba! See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into. First question got to be "Where." Yeah, yeah, I can do it. How do you do that? That what they call you? Me? How? But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing? Wipe 'em out? Columbia. Which country? Decaffeinated too? Man, what is this? Black or regular? I'm tryin' to. 'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses? Or socks. Yeah? What do you do with 'em? Uh... Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but... Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and... I was afraid you'd say that. Hey, is there a bus station around here? Whatcha wanna stop here for? Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand. We back in Metropolis? We gonna crash? Watch out for them air pockets! I ain't about to argue with you. What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies? Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on. I know, by computers. And do what? What she call you? Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'. Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story. Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay? Wow, what a beautiful sunrise! The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is -- But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right? I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school. It was hot! Why do I have to do this? A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures. The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker! What about me? I didn't have my camera with me. That's his sister. Vera Webster. Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.Kent! -- but you deserve the vacation, Lois. I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this. Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK Personally, I think it could be a terrific story! Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here. You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film. What about you? All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it. A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera -- You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!! Who's the other woman? Who is she? Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean? Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s. Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion. The picture looks blurry. Where's the handle? Why do I have to do this? Couldn't we just get a computer to do this? How'm I supposed to turn this thing? Okay? Goodbye. 53. Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---Hi. Mister Kent. Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman! Could you get me Superman's autograph? Mr. Kent, could I ask you something? Do you really know Superman? Mr. Kent! Superman was here! Mom and I do this all the time.Join the party, genius! Come on up! Can't wait, pal, can't wait. Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent. Can you do that? But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it. Exactly. Stoned mother. Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it. It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it. Tell me more... What will it get me? What will it do? You designed it? We've already got some. For what? A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans. Blueprints. What do you want? Is this whitemail? Is this blackmail? I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail? I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon! Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal? And then shut down the pipe lines. You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps. And do nothing. Just sit there. Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney. Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it. KRYPTONITE! Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed. God, that's what I keep you for. Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space. What are you talking about, fella? I did. isn't it neat-o? Just the man I wanted to see! What? When? Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you? So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal. Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells... Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons. Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan? A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail." And you are going to do it for me. Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean. Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. Columbia. But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me. You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you? Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon! Plants. Plants always make an office cozier. I don't think you understand. Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee! Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow? Yes! That never occurred to me. Her ya go, buddy, single-malt. Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect. I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers... Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice. Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from." You want to be rich, right? You've been a naughty boy haven't you? C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty. Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question... Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree? Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician? My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow. Missing???? It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said. He's coming! He's going to hurt me! He's the only one who can operate this -- Wait for Gus to get here, sis. That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All... And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business... Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all. Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving... So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage. We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite-- The planet Superman came from. Krypton. I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet. Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him. Nuts... Nice try, Butch, but it wouldn't be effective against Superman. You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to! He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it. I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea! We already have a super-tanker. TOMORROW THE OIL! You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!! Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small... Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist. Computers talk to other computers, right? Storms! Floods! But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more. Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands. Get a hold of yourself, Vera. Nobody else ever will.He's bound to slip up sooner or later. Hello. I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it. In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up." Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work! Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm. 85,000 dollars.Suit yourself, Gus. Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation? Thanks. Let's go Just a second. No...I just have a little stop to make. I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing. No, we're just going down. That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore. Hey, you're perfectly safe. How you doing down there? The bridge...? I'd better get going! It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic: Hey, Don't I always get there in time? Come on, relax. There's no rush. You just did, with that great dinner. You know, I really wasn't expecting all this. I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry. See you around, pal. We've already met. Anytime. I'd wash that out with some iodine... Okay, Mercurochrome. That wasn't me. That guy's gone. And you're next Webster. I don't know you, lady. No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you? Okay, what is it? You want a ride? Tell me. I'm in no rush. So what do you have in mind? Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
