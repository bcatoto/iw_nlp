Don't feel bad. It hasn't adjusted. No, I'm fine, thanks. I'm only walking him. You caught him. You have to be exhausted. We're ready for you.And Philip will be there to film it. Now that's the end of it! He's going with you, Doctor. Absolutely. Good idea. It would make a marvelous attraction; the only Great White in captivity. Go on, Doctor. What's your plan, Brody? What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon. I know, but you're just going to have to find another way. So you better start. Can't help you, Mike. Don't have the manpower. Have you checked the bars? The guy's irresponsible; he's done this before.Yeah. Down there. Coming with us? Overman's buying. You buying?Me? I don't know. Twenty, thirty. I love them, think they're the greatest. Never know down there. Helps to have a friend, sometimes. Well, don't worry about your fiancee. We'll watch over her. Aren't you suiting up, mate?It's disappeared. That? What?It's easy. Put a net on the derrick. Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up. And a missing man. We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon. I'll need more men to look. I don't understand. Overman's too good a diver to disappear. How many sharks have you killed? She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you. No. I'm fine. Only to myself. I want that shark, Kathryn. It's a construction job. I'm the only one that can do it. I am. You're not. Me. That's right. ... Okay. Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right. Come on! It's all controlled from the Control Room. You wanted to know about a cave? What did you just say before? About water flowing through them? I don't understand. Thirty feet??? What do you mean, we don't? What's the big deal? A shark got Overman, and we got the shark. So? Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will -- I can't! My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it. I can't stand it! I can't take water, Kathryn. I have to get out of here. Hydrophobia... Well, that's why you got it. So tell Calvin. ... He ought to put him in here. I don't want to see them, Kathryn. I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade. No, I'm not going through there. ... Mean through the tubes? Sure. Let's go. Okay. What's up? You don't. Me, too. How's your patient? Sean, that's right... You want me to stay? We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water. After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away. Just the two of us. No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me. I can use a shot of what he's got. You amaze me. I'm more scared than you. Change your mind? Why? 'Cause they're hungrier? Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime? Kathryn... Should protect you a little, from the compression. If that thing gets ahold of you. Bracelets. Here. Oh, yeah. Really nice. Who's your designer? Sassoon Shark? Kathryn, you're crazy. Really crazy. A suicidal maniac. After what happened to us? You're going down there again? It's never over... Here comes another six years of bad dreams. God, they're horrible. I hate them. Did you see its eyes? How black they are? The look in them? It's all right, baby. We're safe... I think so. I'm not sure... Are you? You would, wouldn't you? I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care. No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming! You'd think you're gonna leave me? I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber. What mind? If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this. And leave me down here??? Where are you going? Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle. Swim where? Out there? Oh, no, forget it, not me! You go, I'm staying. You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean? ... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here? What's wrong? Let's not talk about that now, okay? Oh, yeah. Very. I know, I built it. I've just never seen it this way. Let's head to the gate and work our way back. ... Friggin' fish. Baby goddamn scared me to death! Damn it! Yes. No. That's cute, Kathryn. Real cute. What do I do now? I don't have a choice. Where's the rubber band? They're coming with us? Not enough loving. Sure. Want to try that new Italian place? Okay, forget him now. I'm going to pick up Sean. Take a ride? It's his work. Yeah, you really don't like him. And what else is bothering you? How come? You called, Doctor? Honey, I gotta go. Don't let him get you. Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around. Yeah. Damn it. I can't understand! I gotta go, hon. Pre-opening jitters. Look, Kathryn. They're jealous. Hope I make it through both. What is it, 97 days? Want another one? Better than catching Sean's herpes. How you doing, Kelly? Sean. Sean, where are you? Thanks. Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while? Show him around for me? He's missing. Sure. He's big, Hutton. You never saw anything so big. Watch yourself. I'm sure you won't. But you're going to have to wait till we come up. Then you can film all you want. No way. After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it? Five hundred yards. It's large enough... That's impossible. If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh? Tell me that. It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool. I'll remember that, my Lordship. Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it? How come you're so brave with all this stuff? Oh... Polar bears in Georgia??? What the hell's there? So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia? Yeah? Well, in that case, have a drink. Buzz off. Hey, I don't want to hear. Yeah, poor bastard. Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it? Why don't you throw in another shark? You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen. Make sure you put this back. Yeah, well I didn't! Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane? Hey. All right, hit those lights too. Let us know as soon as you have anything. Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it. That's impossible. What kind of trouble? Yeah, right. That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara -- Sure. She still talking to you? It's all up to Kathryn. Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her. Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas. In one of those chapels. He can meet us there. This company's expanding. They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California. I think I'm gonna be going to Waco. It's not that easy. Worked construction every summer to get through school. Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this. Finish school first, Sean. Then make up your mind. If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time. Okay, you two, have a good life without me. I gotta go. You know Overman? Come on, let's go. Just find your own. Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea. Gee, it's good to see you! He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean? We were lucky to grow up the way we did. That's Dad... Big bust! He confiscate their water pistols? How is he? Still fighting crime? He needs a haircut. Hey, I'm proud of you, kid. How'd you do in school? In a restaurant. You sit there and they swim around you. Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something. Look great, don't I? Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!We see him, Mike. Between the stadium and the ski show island. Right, Mike. I know. But we show it's not closing. It's not closing, Mike.Shit. You see the three-quarter socket? Sure am. It's Miller time!A piece of pie on Sunday. He. She. Let's blow the bitch up! We can assume he's back in the water intake passage. He's big as a bloody bus! I've heard of a White that big, in Australia... Is there such a place? A cave or something with such a flow? Well, Doctor. You've got your shark. Believe me, I am. Hello. I think his nap's over. And here I thought I was charming you. The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey. He knows I have it, so he watches out. Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos... That's because I am the shark. Philip. That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else. Some miss all their shots. You were quite daring in capturing him. Very skillful indeed. And I like you. I like it when they wake up. Not at all. Could be a new dance... Walking the Shark. Just watch it when he does. Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog. How's sleeping beauty? Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise! I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves! Don't be so concerned about them. Worry about yourself. Afraid I can't do that. Why? Let's hope he knows that. Lunch for Whitey. Something to munch on in case things get dicey. Shark bait. Draws them over for closeups. So do I, love. Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America" Well, then I'm going to film it. A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack. You know how many are born? Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers! Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known. It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes. Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard. You can get killed! That's preposterous! That's a load of codswopple. A Great White doesn't fear man. It doesn't fear beast. It's an orgy of food and blood. Unhappy combination. Most likely one's inside the other. Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it. Maybe you'll get it one of these years. Pack up, boys. Flipper's a flop. Well, I have to get this into the networks. If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all. No, no. That won't do. I thought they were clever. Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here? Okay now. Have Flipper flip or something. Yes, aren't we all. Fine. Have them do some. I just did. Can you make them do tricks? On the telly. We're to film him for the evening news. Always do. I'll stay out of your way. I won't interfere. I'll go with you. You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm. You have a man near it? How far away is filter number four? Filter system number four. Is it large enough? Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate. Reach for the limit I always say. Tradition. Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries. Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard. What I was born to do. The world's southern most reaches. South Georgia, Antarctica. Polar bears. No, South Georgia. Thanks. Bullshot. I will, old boy, tomorrow. Our work is done here. Just came to say goodbye, and good luck. That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely. Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw. I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year. A Great White chopped him in half with one bite. Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back. Watch it, Brody. You're ruining the shot. Precisely. Aww, can't I keep it? Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy. I say, love, is Flipper ready to go? Calvin said it was all right. Bring the crane over. Come down. Easy down. Absolutely. The audience will stain their drawers. I did. She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that. Give me a 400-foot magazine; we may be down there for a while. We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.Take it up! Take it up. Let's go, let's go! No... It can't be. Now what's this do? Can hardly wait to do it again. I'm not acting! I don't want to go in it, okay? No, think of something else. Not for me. I don't go in the water, remember? No, Kelly, I don't want to... The one that goes underwater? I don't know, what else is there? No. Of course not. Don't listen to him. He's - he's... ... my brother. Why you sonuvabitch... As always. You were great out there! This is where to be. High and dry. Well, I needed a cold shower. Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't. I can't even drink it. That's too bad. I don't like water. I don't like being around in. I never go in it. Are you really? Depends on big brother. I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great. I don't know, it depends. ... Massachussettans aren't. Massachussettans aren't. Yeah, from Boston. Puppy love. This time it's real! We can have a double wedding. No, really. I've never met anyone like her before. This is it. We're in love. Yeah, he'll really go for that. Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding. Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity? You and Kathryn gonna stay here? Mike, this is fantastic. I mean, you're responsible for building all this. What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together. Boat building. Don't hurry back. Something wrong? I want to see Kathryn. Who's grown up? Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins. Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring. Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games. Yeah, right. Took it this morning. So was Dad. Great. I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes. ... I'll go to McDonalds. Sharks??? Got a job for me? Damn! You sonuvabitch! Look at you!Back, Kelly. Lean back! Don't you dare. Now what? Balance, Kelly. Bal-lance! I am serious. Remember, skiers stay up longer. I thought I was your boyfriend. What're you doing later? The space shuttle has landed!
