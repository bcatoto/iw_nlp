Aha. James giving some woman the old heave-ho. Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions. I can't talk about it. She's fine. Well, actually we've broken up. It's all over. I'm not sure I can face it. Not too bad, thanks. How have you been?Congratulations. Who with? Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary? Who was the old one anyway? Attributed? I see. Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.It's everything we wanted. A very good read. A terrific piece of work. So, here's to you and Suez. James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are. Congratulations, and I really mean it. You know the lingo. Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership. Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages. Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why. Your readership will be first and second year American collage students... And you'll join me in a sambucca? Are you going to have coffee? Good. Yes...You're not a socialist then? And some of that. Sorry. I'll have some of that. Would you like a dessert...I'm having one. I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team. What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees... I know, I know! Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War. James Penfield. He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'. One of the best chapters in the book.What went wrong? Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation? Yes. Well, we were just... I will, thanks. Thank you. Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance. Yes. Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends. You're kind to be so encouraging. So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty. Thanks. History books are first onto the bonfires. To Ann. Please do. I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was. It's fine, thank you. Yes. Well, I am a great admirer of your work. I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school. I'm a journalist, not a historian. There are questions of method, and approach. I wondered-- What a shame. He was delightful. It's kind of you to see me. I'll suggest it. Remember though, we're news, not features. It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police. Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks. Terrific. Very good. But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent. Penfield. James Penfield. Thank you. Exactly that. No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened? How's Mary? Keep me company. Working hard on that book I was telling you about. Coming to the meeting? Charles! I didn't know you were back. Have a good holiday? And to history. Thank you. Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down. I think that's wrong. A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back. And the Americans were good allies. Simple as that. Freshman and sophomores... Thank you. Yes, please. I'd want to set out events as they happened. The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal. It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do. Then there's the essential-- No. I'd want to-- ...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez... ...break away completely from-- No thanks. I'd like to break away-- Hello. We don't seem to get much time to talk. Shall we have a drink or something? Why not. That'll be fun What did he want? Might? Might? Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow? He's all right, the professor. I haven't seen much of you. I haven't really thought about it. No. We talked about history, and Siberian Geese. I think she liked me. I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend. In radio we're different. You don't trust me. Too late. Just my luck. Me too. Why not stay? Again? Very thoughtful. Who? Both dead. How nice. Oh yes? No, there's a fourth. Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way. Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting. You're at the centre of the world. As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it. And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting. Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off. Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office. There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism. You're a processor of semi-official news. Some people leave at this stage. Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure. You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length. Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do. Professionalism. Too bad. What did your father do? You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian. Really? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good. Oh, but he was terrific. I couldn't bear for it to end. I thought it was tremendous. What did you think of that Wadja film? Can I give you a lift? Thank you. We met last week, at the Wajda film. You won't remember. We didn't actually speak. That's her. You're a piece of shit My God. You even cooked up that Norfolk trip. Fuck off. Are you up to something? Yes, finally. I'm not sure. I'll ring you. Perhaps I will, then. Will it be fun? Sorry. Got held up. What are you doing here? Hold those rights. The torture of small children-- What have you been up to? We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake. You've really got it all worked out, haven't you? Ha ha... You're so gross. Mmm... Let me see. Oh yes. Jeremy, just let me see what you've got. Let me see. It's shit. Come on. Hand over. The Argies. To the Fleet. Bastard. C'mon. I don't want any Jones about this. Blas� and epicene. Nonsense. Not yet you know any of these people? To the airlift. Not here. What about the Cromwells? All right. Suez. 1956. Not at all. History. Oh, I see. Okay, I will. Thanks. I'm waiting for your mother. Hello. Next time tell her I've gone away. I'm not here. Terrific. Not bad. Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster. Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging. What is it? I'll ring you in the next couple of days. I've got to be going. I've got a meeting tonight. No, thanks Dad. Yes, you said. That's good. I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad. It was just impossible to get away. So how is she? Dad. Now listen... She said that? U-huh. I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch. Yes. No.A glamorous young lady way above his station... It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news. He needs a poet's advice. Of course. Committed to memory. Forever. It's terribly good. I've known Susan for more than fifteen years. James, we're old allies. It might have worked. Really. I would have been delighted for you if it had. But she wasn't interested. Not my fault. And you were obviously getting nowhere with her. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that. Susan and I are very old friends, James. Big mistake, I think. You might have learned a lot. Six onion bajees! Great girl. Did you shake the mother off? Still in love? I'm off. Let's meet. You promised to tell me about Norfolk. Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton. Perhaps you should come too. Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained. Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in. One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police. The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man? On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights-- Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle. Purdy's come up with a real dog. Worker's rights in Argentina. So I've been running round getting people to do things. But no one's keen. Workers rights. When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights? I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--" Far too long. That's enough of that. No need to thank me, if you don't want to. Just pay for these drinks. According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often. You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend. She's very nice, apparently. Lives in Norfolk. And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there. It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal... She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot. Ah, ah. There's more. The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter. Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez. It was 1966, the tenth anniversary. ...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington. Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you. You're so hard. All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up. I expressed an interest... Get way. You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying-- You approve! Uh-huh. Tell me what you think of this first. Now, top secret file. And the Argies. To the Fleet. Name so Susie Barrington. Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist... No jokes. James is in love. We were just chortling over that. Blas� and epicene. It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today. One or two. A grey lot. Some social democrats. Some diligent anti-communists. A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA. Any sign of the goddess Barrington? To the airlift. Then one of them was sick all over your new dress. It's because he desires you. The women get all the breaks at these conferences. Promise. We'll see what we can do. You'd look naked without one. Voila! They won't let you in without one. Darling Susan. You look like an angel. But where's your hat? We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you. In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift. And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here? Darling Susan.No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea. Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years. And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London. I'm not telling you how to run your affairs. I'm just saying ... I don't mind. I'm giving you permission. You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife. Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive. In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs. A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was. Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare. What would you call it? I'll tell you another thing. We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that. Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects. We've got the lot. Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films. That food you're eating. Well, it's worth seeing. I just might give you a ring when we get back to London. There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave? Have you ever watched a commercial being made?The bed's all made up if you want to stay. Or a beer. I've got some in. Now, are you going to have some more tea? And Joe Ramage - do you remember him? He comes and helps out in the shop. Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy. The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work. Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her. Tell her you made it. She'll like that. Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like. She keeps asking when you're coming... Come into the kitchen. I'm just making your mother's tea. Hello, Jimmy.I'm terribly sorry. He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back. It's that lady from Norfolk again. Fifteen news items. I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk. They're all old pros. Take a look at these.They don't count. It goes from Henry VIII. Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II. Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens? What period? Have you come to talk about me? She's not my mother, anyway. My mother's in Italy. Why not sit down and wait? She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. . Hello. No. Ah, Susy, it... 'Night. Don't close the door. Don't turn out the hall light.
