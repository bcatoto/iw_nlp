Yes. In the Arctic ice. Lyssa ... Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress. Take the western passage. You have the power. Will it . Will your power outward. You must move away from the Center. I love you, Lyssa, I love you ... I will find you. I will be with you. Where is the Fortress? Lyssa ... Lyssa. Where are they keeping you? Have they harmed you? Lyssa ... Lyssa ... I can't wait either. I lied. Thank you, but I can wait. Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush. Never mind my ears! Go away! We're not married yet . What ? If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it. Well, you're beautiful. That's worse. Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin. Oh. That. I know what you mean. I had nightmares all week. I don't have to go through with it either. I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa. I won't leave you here. They have Lyssa! It was a platonic kiss, Father. I forbid you! No! You cannot know that! You're coming with us. What use is my sword? I can't reach her! She can see the Beast! She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it! Where the spiral begins. Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them. The Beast will kill her. Let us wish him peace. You will tell me her name and we will go together. I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man! Traitor! She'll marry you in hell! Then we must reach her before she feels that pain. Never. Can she be forced? Lyssa? Why ? Yes. No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress. But you suspect. Why ? The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here? I cannot reach her. I will find her! She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her. She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is. Darkness. Tunnels and corridors. Wait. I can't reach her. They know when they're going to die? Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons. Nor will I, till my bride is beside me. Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us. Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us. The Fortress moves? She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible? Lyssa ... Lyssa ... There is nothing. You won't have to. You have rope? But there is another entrance to this place. Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands? In the old books. It's called a glaive. I have no extraordinary powers. We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me. The new Queen lives. The White Castle has fallen. Each to his fate. It is today? Saddles. You have done it? What will happen? Slayers! How did you know? I cannot. I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her. I cannot betray my bride. I cannot take comfort when she has none. I ache with it. Yes. Yes. Yes. I don't think that. I know the cruelty of such a fate. You and I will guard the fire. Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying. I have need of friends. I was hoping I might be your friend. He saved our lives. What business? Perhaps he expected to eat it. A forest near the Valley of Needles. I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep. There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for. Make for the wall. I'll catch up. I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord. Subject to the King, no doubt. At the gallop! We could reach it on fire-mares. Go. I command you. The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it. Go, join them. Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things. Hand over your dinner. These we'll pay for. We must try to get horses. I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you. Forgive me. It's childish to cry. No. I'm not hungry. Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain. I'm all right. That I promise you. To the place where Death lives. So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons. You will follow me. I know you. Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for. Fame is what you leave to your sons. Fame. I don't think you'll grow careless.Each to his fate. Yes. It is today. I road them often in my youth. They can be saddled. Do not let the waters touch you. We must enter the swamp. I found the body of the Seer in the stream. And mine goes with you. I cannot go with you, my friend. A small house. No. We'll meet you at the inn. The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it. I am Quell. Me. May I eat with you tonight? Would you settle for a boar?What else is left for a man without friends. Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you. What ? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues. No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men. My friend . Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ... Once is enough, thank you. Staying alive. I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction. For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now. Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect? It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death. Where is this place? Help! Help! I'm drowning! My heart stays here. Quell? And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination. A venison pie as big as a house. Can't I come, too? Where are you going? I'm glad. I'm very glad. What is that awful looking place? Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life. I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera. You! A boar ? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar. Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals. No, no. I'm with you, boy. Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so ugly . And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh? Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ... What? Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air? Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything. What? Now you poke me in the nose as well? First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend. A foolish wish. And you, Quell? One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred? If I could wish ... ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ... ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house. Smart lad. Bring me my spices! I am Ergo the Magnificent ... ... short in stature ... ... tall in power ... ... narrow of purpose ... ... wide of vision. You do? What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy. Sugarballs? Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops? No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little. Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin. Let me climb to the top and sing to it. Look at its beauty. Look at its grace. Hush! The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent. Oh, my poor stew! I am being exploited! Where are you going? Food for crows. And do you think I live on air? What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves! I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers. Put me down, you lout! Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs! They'll trample him to death! Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ... ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it. And who is he that they should join him ? He was aiming a huge spear right at me! One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me. Me ? Travel with you ? I am Ergo the Magnificent ... ... short in stature ... ... tall in power ... ... narrow of purpose ... ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye! My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!Modred! Impossible! Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back. I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in. You were lucky. I lost thirty there. You were attacked in the forest?They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle. Can you see? I will seek the Fortress for you. Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then. With an old voice? Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing. Perhaps. If the pay is good. A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories. Naturally. You're resourceful, my lad. I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves. We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise. Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men. Yes, my lord. Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I? What kind of friend do you think I am? They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain. A flicker of talent. Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination. Yes. It will double our range. I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap. You've eaten nothing. Well, I'm not impressed. Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves. Not sleepy, either? They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them. When did you last sleep, boy? I compel no man to follow me on this journey. It should be an interesting journey, then. And where do you lead, boy? And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you. They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes. Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all. Hah! You don't know me, boy. How did you know I had sons? Fame? Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun. Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us? Look at its insides. I can't hold the weight of both of you! Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence. Passable, pimple, very passable. Oh, my poor stomach. I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you. Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison. We have plenty of hares. Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food. You had better manners as a pig. But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy. That is true. Kegan! Look. I'll stay behind and keep them busy. It's a hundred leagues from here. Each to his fate, lad. Fewer will survive them. Her name is Death. She has the power to kill. That creature helps no one. And none who go there return. The Widow of the Web? The leader of the Dark Ones? No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us. We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake. There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here. We'll find her. Knowledge I wouldn't want.You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command! You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa. You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one. You will go alone. You can't reach her! Through the door. Quickly! Of course it was. You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three. A fine match. A girl of some spirit, your daughter. That I am, my lady. I knew. It is important to assure the succession. Modred has treated with the Dark Ones. We will hold. Their power is not unlimited. The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers. It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered. Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen. He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner. We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win. How many did you lose? Yes. We lost five.He will not come. You will be my queen. Then he will die! These walls do not lie! He will betray you. Then look! You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.I can. Because I choose it. It is my fate to die in the Fortress. You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now. Cut. Cut ! Use your sword. I chose the wrong passage. The spiral begins in the west. She must make a glaive. Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her. They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ... He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful. You must never know her name. If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance. From here, I must go alone. He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious. He thinks you betray him with Lyssa. Colwyn! The waters deceive you! Yes. You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting. No. She must agree of her own free will. Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen. He has come for Lyssa. There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time. You will know, in good time. I'm not sure. No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks. She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast. The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all. Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below. What do you see? Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death. You choose these? You have not slept in two days. No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us. Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice. It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs. You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer? Reach out farther. Call to her. I am too old to climb down a rope. But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down. There is no other way. With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here. Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these? This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours. I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come. Turold's son was to marry her. Does the Queen live? No. He will master the leader. He is the King. He didn't join them. They joined him. If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death. The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill. The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us. The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power. Yes. It is the Western Ocean. It is the time. You know the voice. The new King. We seek the Fortress of Krull. Go now. Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends. It is too late. He has drunk. Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much. It is not necessary. They will not follow. We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn. Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me. Few have survived it. She had another name once. Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name. She has the power of vision. Yes. I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help. Yes. Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved. Many have perished in that maze. We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision. No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen. You will come with me. I cannot stop the sand. Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here. A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you. Could I lie to you and still see your beauty? There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa. The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here? Knowledge. Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see. You see? It is no trickery. Where is he? My son. You said nothing. You told me nothing. We had no children. No, she was not as beautiful. Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed. The most beautiful woman in the world. It is fifty years since I spoke it to you. Ynyr!
