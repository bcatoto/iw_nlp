Nice night for a walk. Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing clean, right? Nothing clean.  Right. This guy's a couple bricks short. Your clothes.  Give them to me. Now. Fuck you, asshole. Say, buddy...did you see a real bright light? Hold it, right there! What day is it?  The date... Thursday...uh...May twelfth. What year? Sarah? Come to the office, please. You're late. Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress? The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips. Mmm.  Same schedule's okay. Can you handle it? Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out. ...the Remington 1100 Autoloader... Anything else? A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range... Just what you see, pal. The Uzi 9 millimeter. You know your weapons, buddy. Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be? All. Maybe I'll close early. Cash or charge? Sorry, I can't sell the ammo with the guns.  You'll have to---Hey! You can't to that... Wrong. Hey, man... Honey, can I get that coffee now? I ordered Barbecue Beef. Does mine come with fires? He's got the Barbecue Beef, I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe. Miss, we're ready to order. Sarah Connor? What is it, Mom? Gimme a falafel with yogurt dressing and, uh, Baco-bits. Gimme a falafel with, uh, yogurt and Baco-bits. What's it to ya? That's none of your business. Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing? Hi. I've seen you around. You're cute.  Cute I remember. Yeah, right.  I'm Marco. Hello, sweetheart.  Had a rough day? Heeey!  It's my favorite Sarah.  Hi, babe. 'Bye beautiful.  You too, Ginger. Bunky? Hey, mister...? Come on.  Just come on. First I'm going to rip the buttons off your blouse, one by one...then run my tongue along your neck, down to your bare, gleaming breasts... ...and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles, further and further down... then I'll pull off your panties with my teeth... Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit. Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought you were...Can I talk to Ginger? First I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse... Hi, Sarah...Stan Morsky. Uh, something's come up and it looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.  I'm really sorry.  Call you in a day or so. Sorry.  'Bye. ...Lieutenant, are you aware that these two killings occurred in the same order as their listings in the phone book? Hi there. Ha ha ha, fooled you. You're talking to a machine, but don't by shy, it's okay.  Machines need love too, so talk to it and Ginger, that's me, or Sarah will get back to you.  Wait for the beep. ...police had no further comment on the apparent similarity between the shooting death of an Encino woman earlier today... ...and this almost identical killing two hours ago of a Venice resident with virtually the same name.  Sarah Ann Connor, a 24 year old legal secretary, was pronounced dead at the scene in her beachfront apartment... Hey, can we change this and catch the ball scores. Sure. ...no other connections between the two victims has been estab- lished. On a lighter note, these was cause for celebration at the L.A. Zoo today, as... You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department Emergency Number. All lines are busy.  If you need a police car sent out to you, please stay on the line... ...two eleven in progress at Seven-Eleven market, Third and Tamarac.  One suspect believed to be armed... Whoah! Hi there. Ha ha ha, fooled you.  You're talking to a machine... ...but don't be shy, it's okay. Machines need love too... ...so talk to it and Ginger, that's me, or Sarah will get back to you. Wait for the beep. ...I don't know, it looks like it might spread to this furniture warehouse across the alley, the paint on the wall's starting to blister up... Better get another truck round to this side. No. But you will.  It's very important that you live. Not a man.  A Terminator. Cyber Dynamics Model 101. ...Suspect vehicle sighted on Motor at Pico, southbound. Units Two-Zero-Six and Five- Seven, attempt intercept. Unit One-Four-Three, come in. This is One-Four-Three.  West- bound on Olympic, approaching Overland. Air-unit Two.  We're on him. Westbound Santa Monica at 405. Not a robot.  Cyborg. Cybernetic Organism. Just a second.  Keep your head down. Lost him. Good cover. Alright.  Listen. The Terminator's an infil- tration unit.  Part man, part machine.  Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, mircoprocessor-controlled, fully  armored. Very tough... But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs. Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him. No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years. One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff. Right. Cyborgs don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't...do that...again. Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead. Maybe.  With these weapons... I don't know. Suspect vehicle located at parking lot, Cedar and Glen- haven... There's so much... There was a war.  A few years from now.  Nuclear war.  The whole thing.  All this-- --everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it. It was the machines. Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination. Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's. Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal. Burned in by laser scan. Some of us were kept alive... to work.  Loading bodies.  The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out forever... ...but there was one man...who taught us to fight.  To storm the wire of the camps.  To smash those metal mother- fuckers into junk.  He turned it around...he brought us back from the brink. His name is Connor.  John Connor... your son, Sarah.  Your unborn son. ...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it. Then how are you supposed to get back? Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me. ...It's just him and me. Why didn't you bring any weapons?  Something more advanced.  Don't you have ray guns? Show me a piece of future technology. You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go. Why? I didn't build the fucking thing. Okay.  Okay.  But this... cyborg...if it's metal... Surrounded by living tissue. Of course. This is great stuff.  I could make a career out of this guy. You see how clever this part is...how it doesn't require a shred of proof.  Most paranoid delusions are intricate...but this is brilliant. Why were the other two women killed? Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic. You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me? I'm afraid that's not up to me. Then why am I talking to you? Get out. I can help you... Who is in authority here? You still don't get it. He'll find her.  That's what he does.  All he does... You can't stop him. He'll wade through you... ...reach down her throat, and pull her fucking heart out... Sorry. In technical terminology, he's a loon. I'm a friend of Sarah Connor. I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please? You can't see here.  She's making a statement. Where is she? Look.  It's gonna be a while. You wanna wait.  There's a bench. I'll come back. Sarah? You cold? Come here. Kyle. White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe. I caught one, back there. It's not bad. It's okay.  Forget it. See.  Missed everything. Passed through the meat. What? About my height.  He has your-- ...damn...he has your eyes. You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John. John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war... I volunteered. It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war. I'm sure. Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight. You'll learn. John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all. Good field-dressing. Sleep.  It'll be light soon. About what? Alright. You stay down by day, but at night you can move around. The H-K's use infra-red so you still have to watch out. But they're not too bright. John taught us ways to dust them them.  That's when the infiltra- tors started to appear.  The Terminators were the newest, the worst... Terminator! We used them to spot Terminators. ...and when it breaks right off the point they get some pretty rad tubes up there. Not awesome, but I mean, worth the drive, if you're hardcore like me. Rad tubes? You from back East of something? Whoah.  I hear that. Listen, I had a rough night.  I gotta stop and bag some Z's. You can still ride if you wanna hang out for a couple hours. Bag some Z's? Yours is over there. Aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this? What's that? Why? What about it? Molecular-memory. That's the way it was told to me. Tactically dangerous.  We lay low. That's not my mission. Let's go.  Time to move out. Sarah! I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this... It's...like some dream. This...this... ...and you...all so...beauti- ful.  It hurts, Sarah.  More than death. Don't you understand...it's all gone! Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there of what? Fuck you, asshole. Is this enough? Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this. I love you too, sweetheart. Hello. Tell me your address there. Plastique. Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid. Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently. That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses. Hot dogs? My whole life has been combat. Not possible. We'll head out at 0200. That gives you four hours to sleep if you want.  I'll finish. Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed... If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one. No.  I'm not. Good fighters. Someone? No. Never. Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it. It's better that way. John Connor gave me a picture of you once.  I never knew why.  It was very old. Torn. Faded.  You were young, like you are now.  You weren't smiling...just a little sad... I always wondered what you were thinking at that second. I memorized every line, every curve... Sarah, I came across time for you.  I love you. I always have. I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said... Ticklish? What are you doing? I don't think I like this. Listen to the dogs. Light it now. Don't try to move, buddy. Switch places with me. Cover...our footsteps... Leave me here. Run! Look, I told you not to touch anything until we're done.  You got that? Sure thing, officer. What is it? Microcomputer chassis.  But I've never seen stuff like this anywhere. Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe? Keep it out of sight and get it down to R and D Monday, first thing. Good idea.
