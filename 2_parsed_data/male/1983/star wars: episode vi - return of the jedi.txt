The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader! Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor. Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again! Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared. You cannot escape your destiny. I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. Yoda will always be with you.Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. I told you to remain on the command ship. It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.Who are you? Where am I? I can't see. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Hey! Yeah, sure. Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. I thought she was with you. Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here. I don't know. Fly casual. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? You got her warmed? Luke. Why don't you leave that crate and come with us? Oh... great! You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? How are we doing? Fine. Together again, huh? Luke! All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way. You love him, don't you? I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew. Here's the terminal. Charges! Come on, come on! Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. I'm sorry. Ahhh... What's going on? It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. It'll work. It'll work. Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand! Leia! You, too. Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. Well, look at you, a general, huh? Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando. It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. I'm trying! Lando, grab it! Lando! Let's see. Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. Come on! Come on! What did he say? Proper?! Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? What are you telling them? All right, hang on. On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? Good, I hate long waits.We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it! We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. All right. Stand by. Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Good luck. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! No, wait! I thought you were blind! Lower it! Han! Chewie? All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Here goes nothing. Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down. All wings report in.But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her. Leia! Leia's my sister. But I have no sister. Yoda spoke of another. I can't kill my own father. But I had to help my friends. I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. I can't do it, Ben. There's still good in him. You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. Han, don't. It'll be all right. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. We got separated. Quietly, there might be more of them out there. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. Vader's on that ship. All set. Yeah, she's comin' up. Hi, Han... Chewie. I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. The same as always. Wouldn't miss it. Are you all right? Han! Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. No, you don't. You've always been strong. Then you know why I have to face him. Yes. It's you Leia. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. He's my father. Vader is here...now, on this moon. I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Tell me. What do you remember? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? I see them. Wait, Leia! Never-r-r! I will not fight you. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. I will not fight you, father. Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. Come with me. I know, father. Well, I'm sorry. Unfortunate that I know the truth? Yes. Yoda, I must know. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. Master Yoda, you can't die.Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Oh, Artoo, hurry! We're coming! I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god. Here we go again. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge. Your Royal Highness. Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Disintegrated? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Oh. Well, yes. I am See-Threepio, human-cy...His lightsaber. They are clear, my Master. I have felt him, my Master. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, my Master. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? What is thy bidding, my Master? As you wish. Yes, my Master. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... You cannot hide forever, Luke. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. There is no conflict. Obi-Wan has taught you well. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. If that is your destiny. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. So, you have accepted the truth. The Emperor has been expecting you.Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. There it is! Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. I'm going in. Good shot, Red Two. Red Leader standing by.Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Told you, did he? Your father he is. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
