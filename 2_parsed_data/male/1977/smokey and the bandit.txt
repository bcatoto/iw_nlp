Your what? Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios. Yeah, well I kinda figured that. Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man? What do you think? You paying for the gas? How much style? Last year, this was a new rig. You know how rumors start. I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat. You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy. America's bored. Now, what do you want? If...? Yeah, it's the highlight of my day. See ya, Kate. You gotta admire the man's determination. Absolutely. That man is your father?!? What can I say? Hey... Well, at least it hasn't been boring. Maybe six months with good behavior. One to five. Weight Station. Sleep for a week. Wanna join me? The minute you see him, you'll know. It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail. Bandit II? Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'. And? I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta. Kate... You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi. I'm proud of you. I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points. I know. Bandit two, bring yourself on in. An unmarked police car. I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it. I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target. I forgot your question? -- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know? No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon. Let's hit it. Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset. Mississippi's the other way! Where did you learn how to drive like this? You could've asked. Yeah. By stealing my car? You know this guy, don't you? What the hell are you doing?!? See ya, Kate. Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound. Hey... The bus'll pick you up over there. Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket? Christ, what channel are we on?... Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting. Well? Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of. A Texas Bear in Arkansas. Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is. That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas? You know, you're not a bad passenger. Shoot. Anything? I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew. I give up. Would I lie to you? Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement. Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle. They're both a challenge. Driving? Having fun. Whaddya want to know? My sign? Okay. A what? Hey, you could get killed crossing the street. It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers. For a new Kenworth. That's a truck. I never looked at it that way. You ask a lot of questions. Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours. I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours. Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole. Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer. All sound reasons for matrimony. I owe you a big one, Hot Pants. But you'll do it? I'm begging. What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg? Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me? Because I need your help, sweet thing. And I need it bad. Another time. That's me. Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting. Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments... But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists. Yeah, but... How's the clock, Bandit II. What's that, pardner? You're coming up to the scale house. Bandit II? You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear. We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act. -- How we doing? God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'. You okay? We'll be waiting. Over. You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp. -- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line. We're outta motion lotion. Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop. Nope. Just keep those wheels churning. Never mind. It's nothing. We're gone. Just don't worry about it. How we doin' timewise? Then don't. I ran into complications. Son-of-a-gun. Me too. -- Gimme a twenty, pardner. As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool. Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss. I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants. What's your twenty? On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay? Yeah, guy? I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto. What does the old Timex say? If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl. Not for long, you ain't. What's your twenty? On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time? Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second. You can't swear on these. This is Bandit I, come back. Clear and rolling. I hate to say I told you so. We still on schedule? Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle. Let's get the hell outta here. They're jammed! Can a pig whistle? Redneck heaven. Let's keep it that way. Shit! No one's here. Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll. Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you. Because they said it couldn't be done. Yeah? I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over. Two is one. Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass. Twenty-one is nineteen. Six. Got it. Go. Running blocker. Also boring. We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time. How long's this gonna take? And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth. See. Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we? Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset. Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth? No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map. Is that any way to talk to your ole partner? Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way. How'd you know? Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks. Cledus. What else? Can you give me cover, Mister B? Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy? What's up, Dixie Chicken? Pick it up, Breaker. Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil. What's your twenty and what's your handle? Go head on, breaker. Go breaker. About one to five years worth. Seventy-two five. Why do you want this barley pop so bad? Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom? Excuse me. See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.Get your hands off my daughter! You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck. You. Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory. Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through. When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right? Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far. Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way. Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup. Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice. I'm cucumber cool. I'm here. I'm all ears. Let's boogie. Talk to me. It's gonna be close. Real close. Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down. Right, Fred? Just fine. What's the weather like? Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop. It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break. I'm all ears, good buddy. I'll believe it when I see it. I'll keep streaking. Pick me up. Now what? Anything else you don't want me to know? Bandit? Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull. -- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but... I hate to say it... I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop. I'm at marker eight-five. If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye. What they all want -- to handcuff a hero. 'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi. Do I have a choice? My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers. Hear that? Where's his chow? Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. Bandit? She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm. I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts. What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man? I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey. Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule. This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you? What's going on, Bandit? Come on. Bandit I, do you copy? Save it. We got a long haul. Forty-two minutes ahead. Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages? Hit the brakes! You know how to drive one of these things? Liquid gold. That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule. He's history. Loud and clear. Why are we doing this? Bandit? You're wall to wall and tree top tall. If I say go to two, it's really one. If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen. Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six. All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey. What are you doin' now? But I still don't think... If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law. I don't know, man. Ask him? Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught. No. You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it. Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem. Waynette! Or in the slammer. That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per. Forget it. Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord. Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope? No. Oh, yeah. Good for him. Uh-uh. What Cobra? Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff. You're soundin' real bodacious. Back. Yes, ma'am. That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch. I'll keep my eyeballs peeled. Shut up, Fred. Where the hell are you? Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.Have any trouble getting here? He's thirsty. Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou. I think you're just yellow. It ain't ever been done before, hot shit. Congratulations. You just became a legend maker. Five thou. Yes, sir. Oh. But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it? Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves? I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop. Is that Bandit in the lead?You sure do. I'll do it. I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts. Yes. I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you? Why should I?You got my barley pop? Four hundred cases worth. Well? I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style. But it wasn't a Kenworth. Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig. I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia. What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road. You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge. I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks. What's he get if he wins here? Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit? That crazy sumbitch made it. Chickenshit money. Now, you just find him, son. That's the point, Dickey. Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends. Then it must be a helluva idea. If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it. Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits. You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber? Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken. Breaker. Breaker. My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all. My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail. I would say your future's looking dim, boss. Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you. Breaker. Breaker.-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit? -- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel. -- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo. -- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report? -- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money. -- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on. -- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth. -- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
