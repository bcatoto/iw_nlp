They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it. My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over. We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well? Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes. Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we? Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et -- ...It was Malcolm's favorite. Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment? Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened. We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.He has already agreed to come. We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one. An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you. Sir William. We come to seek a meeting. It is suicide. We cannot defeat this -- We must sue for peace. Invade?! That's impossible, it -- But... what will you do? You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king. He won't come. That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace. Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters! It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear. May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin? No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must. A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council. Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here. Young Robert, we are honored --You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this. But if we have not caught Wallace -- The Scots will fight for us? The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself! Wallace has sacked York! I have ordered conscriptions... Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word. I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more. Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead. You fancy him. Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed. Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation. The little cow is insane -- Wallace's followers. You mock us with a smile? You may. Now, my flower, do you understand? Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME! All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it! Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?! So I did! And what was so important about it? What is it?!Keep these. We're going too. Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it? That's just a dream, William! I don't want to be a martyr. You know it's a trap. Your rest is making me exhausted. Rest, William. We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya. Aye. The Bruce is not coming, William. Fourteen? -- I'll wait... back there. I should'a remembered the eggs. You'll move I could crush you like a roach. That depends on the man. Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones. Test of manhood. We'll get those English pigs tomorrow. Wanna stay with me tonight? With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm! Armed? How many? We don't split up! A common thief. Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds. Dig 'em up! What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away. Someone dead from this household?All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make. We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve. So more men were slaughtered uselessly! I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.His legend grows! It will be worse than before! He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower? What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve. Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France. So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand. Impossible. How dare you bring a panicky lie. While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?! What news of the north? Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms! Let her speak. My greatness is better demonstrated with this. This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool. The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery. You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he? Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced. My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe. If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him. I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?! Where is my son?Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe. Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?! It matters not, he is thy king! Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?Longshanks promised! He will. I know he will. The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace. If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king? He was a modest man. Does anyone know his politics? He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland. My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes. In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break. He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight. He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won. I must... consult with my father. I am trying. I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles. No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead. Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way! We must run in different directions! A patriot! Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity. In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God. Yes, Father!... The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question. All right, Father, I'll ask him! If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen? Come, it'll help you sleep. Fine speech. Now what do we do? I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger! Who would do such a thing? What's the crazy man saying, Lord? We can't stop!I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland. So let the council swear publicly. You've all sworn to Longshanks. With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen! Peace?! A thousand. You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face. I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground. No. One of us is enough. My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it. We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom! Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too. Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way. I rest. Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves. Stephen ready? Mornay has come. So will the Bruce. We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long. Hamish, I... thank... I do not confess. -- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject! Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king -- Treason. Against whom? I need you so much! I love you! I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you. I'm dreaming. It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me. Every man dies. Not every man really lives. If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already. Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves? M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger. I cannot love you for the sake of revenge. You have... you have a husband. Why did you? A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it. She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant. SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS! A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas. York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls. I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are. It's battle I want, not talk. Wife of Edward, the king's son? And I will consult with mine. Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it. War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you. Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I. We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why. And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less? Aye. But it won't let me dream. Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field. No English lord would trust an Irishman! Exactly. The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them. They've tricked us.What are they doing? It was in Latin, sir. I don't want to leave. Good to see you again. I will not. Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw? I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can. The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here. You win. Aye, we'll get 'em. I wanna have supper waitin'. It's up to us, Hamish! They're English soldiers, ain't they? Three, maybe more! They're coming! Then when? Tonight then. I've missed you. I will be with you, like this. Forever. I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one. But I won't give you up to any nobleman. I'm not just saying it! I want... to marry you! No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you. Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure. I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy. Thank you for accepting. Your father doesn't like me, does he?You're right. We'll get it later. And that's for the airport. Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president? Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down? You get life for kidnapping. Trade for what? No. What's this? And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then? What about him? After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other. Farrah. Come here. Come here, Farrah... That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy. Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done. Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding. I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa. His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie... You see the paper? I mean I don't care. I guess still in the locker. He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it. They all sound big at the talking stage. Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo. Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard. You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some. About sixty. I think I pulled my quadriceps. Not too bad. I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace. Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off. I have to ask you for that key. You spotted them, huh? So you didn't have the key with you.You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him. Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something. Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons. Calm down, Bear... The money. Fuck. I gotta think... Plan B. Here ya go, honey... You get the money? Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight. I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere. Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline? I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day. He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat. Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew. Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings? Who? Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room. Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him. I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot. You guess? You mean you don't know? So where's the money? Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big. And I mean high up in it. That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer. Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies. You see that? The way the man just went right over? Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him. You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar. He's around someplace. Maybe your nephew panicked, took off. Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal. I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it. Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way. Sure. Family. I know how that goes. Your who? Man, I can't wait for you to be dead. Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado. You broke in my house and I have a witness to it. She's great. Gimme the money. In the can. That the money? I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel. You know Laurel Canyon? Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping. That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies. She can't talk right now. Three. In just a second. Two... How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One... Tell you what... The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo. I need the money. I really think I can be of service on this one. That's all. There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done. Who? Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script? With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is? What about her? I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle. So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole. So whatta you think of the script? I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan? I wonder, would that work? You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep. No shit, come on. How you gonna do that? Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy. You must bring something heavy to the deal. Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace. I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has. You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him. You can talk to me. What's this movie you're doing first? That's the magic number. It's not the kind of thing you do. It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about. Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up. He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer. So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him? We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer. How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double. All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up. Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest. Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that. Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it. Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy. You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this? You positive about that? Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy". What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now. You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account. Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one. What I been wondering is where's he been.You say look at you? What? Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money? Or else what? So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here? Never heard of him. Who? Okay. So who are you? Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real. What three hundred grand? Depends. Who's this? Who is this? Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -� I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -� forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right? You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go. Why haven't you left? Yeah? Which terminal? 'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me. Don't insult me. Get up and turn around. I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me. You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that. Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city. I don't like waiting. He owes me money. Ray Barboni. From Miami.You're kidding me, right? I reserved a Cadillac. What is this? No shit? What're some of 'em? So... how many movies you been in? How 'bout when you went down the stairs? What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay? Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car. You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead. What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back? What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in? You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that? I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right? Bear, you're not really gonna �- It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne. What? First you and me gotta get a couple things straight. Where's Karen? Gimme an hour. I'll find it. Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it. Karen? You okay? I don't believe this. What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo? I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is. Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you? What money? Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know. That's all there is to it, huh? You know how to write one of these? She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good. Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores. She's... young. Get something going there. There's Ilona. Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy". Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy. Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers". I put a gun right here... ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that. Yeah, we're getting Martin. That's right, me. It's what he said, I'm his associate. I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit. That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you. That's what I thought. So let me put it this way... But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him? Harry, let me answer that. Whatever you want, Ray. I like it here. Sovereign. I checked the bag at the airport, when I came. Why would I do that? So what brings you to L.A., Bones? How'd you get in here? That's what I'd do. Make sure I got the right guy next time. Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it. It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something? I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here. Not yet. I just started. I'm a producer. I'm in the movie business. That's right. Movie producer? Yeah, why not. What've you got? Leo spanked a waitress? Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key. Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money... Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died. Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble. Forget about Leo's money, Harry. I found him. Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting. Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up. Is he giving you a check or cash? Here's your keys, Harry. Hey, Harry. That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink. You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears. Never say anything unless you have to. I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut. You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.' That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am. No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down. Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action... What's he doing? Following a guy? Let's see how we get along. Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do. But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it. I'm not gonna pop her, Harry. So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie. He drown? So what's the problem? She looks familiar. No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney. Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone". Who's the star? "Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title? What's it called? For a movie? You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with? You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not? Harry, look at me. I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean. Once. Maybe a few times I have. Not really. They always paid. What I did till recently. After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next. I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen. I'm not the guy, Harry. You mean, Leo? Part of it, yeah. The shylock's the good guy. I said I had an idea, that's all. I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens. Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list... That's right. As a matter of fact... Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money. You just did. Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing? You make movies, huh? Come on, Harry -� Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position. I want you to. You're not looking at me, Harry. They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore... A marker's like a check, Harry. Harry, lemme give you some advice. We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is. You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino? I want you to keep looking right here, okay? You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to. We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer. Where you been, Harry? Twenty seven hundred. Ask your man here. 'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.' Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway. It was in the Herald. Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month. Yeah, he told me. He died. Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya. That's not bad. I think you got it down. Compass. Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans. Buddy? At that point, basically, that has to be it. It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation. Good-looking, too. Like Karen. Yeah, but you haven't found him yet. The guy took off for Las Vegas. I believe it. That's not bad. Now you're squinting like you need glasses. What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed? No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it. Martin, look at me. Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure. Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami. One we're producing. I'm thinking of a movie. So you want to know. So you don't know what I'm thinking. You mean like we don't give a shit. We talk different? Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act. You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone. I'll find you, Leo... At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving. Sit down, Leo. You can keep what you won today. That's yours. I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass. Here's another tip... Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here. From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty? You've been losing. You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want. You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank? I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are. I know who he works for. Where's your phone. Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me? You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine. Couldn't find my toothbrush. I'll be right back. I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared? You bet. Karen! What the fuck are you doing?! You okay? I'll go. I'll go. I don't know. It's not Dave. It's a movie. You sure? Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies. Why not? What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway? What happened? I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -� You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor? Oh. You thought I was faking? Yeah. There's a girl in it now. That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right. Although I've added to it. How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life. Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty. I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together. How'd you meet Martin anyway? Depends, who pays? The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back. Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot. This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset... Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time. I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny. Why does anyone want to be in movies? That why you came over here, to ask me that? Sounds fair. There a part in it for you? Not yet. I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name. What do you think? I got you a copy of the script. You been here the whole time? Yeah. Right. Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican? Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner. Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you. Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped. That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie? You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read. How come you stopped making movies with Harry? "Cotton". Man, can you scream. For any movie. Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -� which by the way was a better book than a movie -� did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look. Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top. Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real. Rough day on the set? No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here. I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night. Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'? A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years. A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad. That's right. Three percent. Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay. No, it was open. It wasn't locked. The door from the patio, in back. I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer. I'm thinking about producing. I'm going into the movie business. Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now. How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him? You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing. You said don't say nothing and I didn't. Don't say a fuckin' word. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep? Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that. That's what the guy said. Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films. What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it. They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?Get him out've here. That's the idea. I'll think about it. Something shouldn't be there. By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used? Your wife a Lakers fan? You have a card in here? You're an investor, is that it? What're you doing in Los Angeles? You live in Miami?Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer. Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway. Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now. Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.That's great, Harry. So what's the -- Hm? Yeah? What three words, Harry? What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick. Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.I went to UC San Diego. We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money. I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars. Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think? Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here? A zillion, huh? That's a lot. Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker? You gave him the money? He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money. He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand? Yayo. Where is he? Where is my nephew?C-18. I don't know. The airport. Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred? Leo, I don't know. You're gonna just give me five hundred grand? You serious? Chili Palmer showed you my script? Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it? I'm working on a few things. Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people �- It's a different kind of deal. I can't do it. That's correct. Look at me. Look at me, Ray. Ray. Look at me. Or else use your fucking imagination. Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else. Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm. Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player. I work for Harry Zimm, alright? Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real. Hello? You there? The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession. Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you? Are you the guy they called Ray Bones? Ray Barboni? Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie. Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names... Who? You have it? So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him. A meeting with who? You and Karen? Really. I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies. Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport. Get the fuck outta my chair. Yeah, Chili. Hi. You're fifty feet in the air! How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there? His shrink's trainer. I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing. I had to tell 'em something. What? You're kidding, right? They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are. Read it. It's a grabber. What do you get out of this? You don't even know these guys. Just a thought. That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -� Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script. Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along. The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back. Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it. She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades. "Ride the Clouds". Good picture. One of his best parts. Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir. Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it. It's not bad when you know what it's about. "Mr. Lovejoy". A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy". Because I need half a million to buy a script. Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs. These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -� this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer �- Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it? Really? You ever been arrested? Ever shot anybody. What does that mean? You pack a gun? I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying. Is that right, that's what you do for a living? So you don't work for the casino? But you work for the casino? You wouldn't be talking to me if you were. Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner? The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast. That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy. That's it? That's your movie? So he comes to L.A... Keep going. Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone. It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken. I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops. You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her. Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores. I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen. Fuckin' basketball game. You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken? Why do I have to keep looking at you? I know what a marker is. Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information? Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this? That's what I'm doing. I'm looking at you. Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack? Have we met? I don't recall. Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do. What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them. So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.' 'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.' You heard me, Pick 'n' Save. Pick 'n' Save. She's scared! Fear is an emotion! Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking. All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene. Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now... She's gonna talk to Martin? Yeah, but whose point of view? How honorable of you. Yeah, what'd he have to say? So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy? I mean morally. Murray was my friend. I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris. Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was. Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there. What do you want, Doris? Come on in. Hello, Doris. Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick. 'We?' He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want. Oh, yeah, sure. No problem. You go on off to bed. Yeah, that's what we need. More agents. That's where you got the idea? He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far. Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks. I'm going. Anyone skim the pool? It needs it. You don't? What happened to Muff? Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on. I don't hear anything. What's wrong? Shylock? What money? Mob guy? Which two?But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be. You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it? It's all mine. How? By taking my money? It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake? How'd you know I was here? Who told you that? I'm up twelve grand today. They report it to the IRS. I didn't know where else to keep it. Where would you?Mr. Barboni is a good customer. Works for Jimmy Capp. We call you a taxi. Maybe you don't see my sign? It's not one of these?Whatta you think, Chill? Wow. Mind if I take it for a spin? What's that? Very nice... Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting. You're not going to tell me the rest? Okay. I'm listening. So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look? The wife sues the airline. This is a gutsy babe. How do I know that? I turn it on when I confront the guy. That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing. How about this? Wait. How about this? Like this? I'm looking at you. Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do? What happened? The pressure got to you? With what? Wiseguy money? One of mine? If you'd like to tell me, yeah. No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious. Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads. It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views. A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech. Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play. Yeah. That was a good party. The three hundred large. What other money is there? I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock. I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they? Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love. I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with. Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too. I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey �- This your ride, Chili? Yeah, Karen knows him. I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to. Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away? I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories. Of us. Karen. Wow. Look at you...Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it. You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh... Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'. Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect. Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife. What Get Away jet? Personally? How'd you know he died, he tell you? You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over. You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie. By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco. Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately. I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man? Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time. Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me. Get in line, bro. The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner. What, like that's supposed to mean something to me? Who the fuck are you?Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit. How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies. What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star? Whatta you doing out there? He already knew it. All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't. No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead. I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time. I told you not to -� In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down. No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe. Hey, Chili. Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that. Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat. You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat? What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job. Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.Mommy!!! Promise? I can't. The voice man is coming to get me. Mommy, I'm scared. Come on, Mom. We're gonna miss all the fun stuff! Mom, I want to go to the fair ... No, Mom -- keep it on! He says things. Bad things. But I've seen him! The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here. The voice man! He's here!Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming? So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me. Your name also happens to be Rosemary. Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming? So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me. Your name also happens to be Rosemary.It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers! No, please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby. It's ... Michael ... ... Michael Myers! No -- please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.Debra, you're fuckin' insane. What in God's name are you talking about, woman? When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows? What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without -- What is it this time? See what I'm talkin' about? Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same. No goddamn respect. Shitheads ... Defacing my property. I showed them ...Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family. And he won't stop until you are all destroyed. I only thank God that I found you before he did. Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible. Found this morning. In a field outside Haddonfield. Stabbed. This house is sacred to him. It's the source of his memories -- his rage. Mrs. Strode, I beg you. Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter. He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room. His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began. I've come to help your family. I've been knocking. The door was open. Is everything all right in here? Leave the boy. Take me. No!!! You've created a monster. Samhain. Jamie's baby ... Why did you take Jamie? It was you. This is madness, Wynn. Where's the child? What's wrong? What's happened to Jamie? Good. I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house. Any word on the location of the Strodes? An old friend. I'm here now, Jamie. You're going to live. You have to. It's a sign. He's come home. Or what's left of him. That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive. I feel him. I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him. Sitting behind these very same walls. Staring. Growing stronger. As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again. Not alone. I need your help to stop him. It was Jamie Lloyd. She came back, as I knew she would one day. And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well. It was her voice. On the radio. It was Jamie. Calling for me. Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind. You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me. But surely Rogers isn't -- I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud. That's the whole idea of living in the country. I thrive on the seclusion. Run, Tommy!!! Run!!! Only me -- -- and Dr. Wynn. No one. Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life. She is the last of his blood line. If she dies -- What do you know about Michael? Yes ... Tommy. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, but do I know you -- Yes?Answer what? Then they can watch. Guess so ... But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes -- Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister? Relax. Everything's cool. Didn't I tell you Harry would be here? Happy fuckin' Halloween. Whatever happened to women in back? Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.It's not working! Wait a minute ... Kara, no! He's gone. Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and -- To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him. 'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.' Black magic ... 'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.' It was there when I found him this morning. It looks like some kind of letter or number or -- Not just Kyle. All of you. His entire family. Here. Look at this. Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next. God, what's wrong with him? Him. I didn't -- He got in a fight and I -- She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from -- No!!! No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?! Who else knew I had the baby?! No, Dr. Loomis. She's not the last night. I know he's alive. People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead. But I know. I've always known. Please -- just tell me the truth. Has Michael Myers come home? I'm Tommy. Tommy Doyle. Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night -- Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here. You heard her, didn't you? It was Jamie.Stay away, Sam. Amazing, isn't it? I even taught him to drive. And I'm its deliverer. Its calling card, if you will. I follow it. Protect it. Act as its guardian. In a sense, Sam, so do you. There you go trying to make sense again. It's a curse. Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween. She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins. Michael's mother had it, too. So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night. Michael has served his purpose. And soon we will have a new progeny. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Your madness is another man's greatness. This is the way things have always been. You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see. But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways. You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work. Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself. And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell. Come now, Sam. This is a gathering of old friends. I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth. After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were. This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice. Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me. Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you. I'll meet you over there. No one's home. Checked it out myself. There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school. There you are. Who was that boy? Sam, don't -- let them take care of her. What is that? Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way. I want the entire staff on alert. We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours. If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back. After six years? Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the -- You don't know that for sure. It could have been anyone. A practical joke. Kids. But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules. Just think it over. You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left. I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country. Old colleagues. This is your change to finally make a difference. We need you, Dr. Loomis. Retiring. As always, your keen powers of perception astound me. And you're right. I've come to celebrate. After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff. Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said: 'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink. Christ, what a night! Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!Now you gotta be careful. You're clean. Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Were they wearing condoms? With how many people? Have you ever had anal intercourse? How many times have you gone unprotected? Yes. Altogether. How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? How old you?Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'. That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural. Nah. Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles. Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude. Yo, you got any weed around here? Yeah probably. About ten. Fifteen is good. How much you gonna take? Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties. Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big. Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs. So really, it's good luck. I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did. I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off. So. You never know when you can end up like that. So. What are you talking about? Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs. He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage. Why I give pennies? Why I do what? You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted? Bet. How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law. She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them. I know what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's only 13. Darcy? Oh. You like her? Who? Man, this guy is really good. I hate this game. Yeah me too nigga. Yep. That girl you boned last year. Remember? Can you do it man? No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"! And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl. And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right? Well, those guys share everything, right? Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know. Activate in the form of, a glass of water. You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything. Unzip my pack, yo. Three pennies and a ball of lint. Yeah, I feel dehydrated. They're gonna tell their grand kids. That Telly. He sure was good in the sack! Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first. It's no big deal, right? It is right. Why? Did she suck your dick? Telly. Den less go Joe. He lives on 76th? You think? You think he's got any herb? What for? That guys a dick. Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec. Get another forty. Smoke a blunt. Shit. Did you tell her that you loved her? She's probably smash you in the fucking face. You mean like fucking two virgins at once. What do you mean? To what? Virgins? Yeah. Yeah. Right. How? What? Let me smell it again. Oh man, that's the best. Oh man, it smells like butterscotch. How did she smell? Did her puss stink? Yeah. How long did you fuck her? Oh shit. How long did it take? She can fuck? Well, how was it? I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up! You fucked it? Shit. Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe. What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches. Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here? I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice. No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care. Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka. I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken. Na. Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight. Yeah. Maybe Nasa. I don't know. Right here. Nothen' B. I'm gonna fuck you up bitch. Sup. Sup. Sup then? Sup? Nuffin' G. Just forget it. Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.Here. Swallow. Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it. This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster. Bang up stuff. I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex. Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle. Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?Yeah. Do it again. Yeah me too. Man we fucked him up. Yo, we might have killed him. You think? You sure? Yo, you think we killed that guy? I had a female vagina last night. I'm goin'. You on the list? You goin'? Where you goin' tonight? Where you at? Casper! Was up kid?Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves. Come on bitch. Throw your fists up. What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down? What? Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?Whah you say? Dissdee? I no understand you. Maybe crazy. Whah is dissdee? Whah?Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'? I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now. I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit. Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid. Yeah? What?! Holy shit. That's all true? Oh god. That's horrible. No. Yeah? I hate 'em. Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade. How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too. Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me? Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this? Hello. That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes. Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub. I don't know, eight or nine. You want a wip-it? What are you guys doing? Hello? Hello?Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK? I can't man. What man? What is it?Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell. Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier. Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy. I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes. Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth. Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her. Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl. Am I getting warm? Are you in trouble with the law? Did you and your boyfriend just break up? No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right? Miss, would I be prying? Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does. A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul. Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all... You're OK? Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe. Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.Hold up man. Why not? You stink. You are? Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park. You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight? Fifteen for me. I don't know. How much do you want? Shut the fuck up. Yeah. Good luck? Shut up. Right. So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks. Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by. That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do. Yeah. Why you give money. That. I don't understand why you do that. I guess so. I gotta stop off home too. I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me. I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her. At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin. I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection. And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on. I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt. She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her. It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember? Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent. Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now. Darcy. Benny's little sister. I wanna fuck Darcy. He looks like my uncle. No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends. I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know. But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic. Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to? Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire. Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring. Right. Right. Yeah. The cartoon? You down with the boost? You got any money? You thirsty? Yep. Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it. I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost. I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy. A little bit. But I didn't really want her to. Yeah. 78th. Probably. I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out. I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer. You wanna go to Paul's house? Are you hungry? What do you want? Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys. I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect. That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen. I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit. Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies. I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit. And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl. And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby. And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup. And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little. Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right. I can tell that she had just entered puberty. You know what else? You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom. Hell's yeah. She was so clean. But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good. Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time. Did what take? Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow. Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck. Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon. What do you think? Was up bitch? Of course I do. I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle. Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me. I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about. I just know. I know you'll love it. I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it. Trust me. Don't be nervous. No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all. I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head. I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed. Do you like kissing me? Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring. Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise. Come on. You can rave on another night. Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out. You should come back with me to Steven's house. Yeah. I can understand that. She won't? Why not? Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you? Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up. I was lookin' for you all day today. Yeah. Yeah. After I saw you last week. You know I've been thinking about you lately. Is it cold? Yeah. Come on. Come on. Come swimmin' with us. Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us! Hey. What are you doin' right now? Of course I do. You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise. What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change. I want to make you happy. That's all. I don't know. I just think that you would love it. Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it. You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff. Because your a virgin? Why? What do I want to do? You know what I want to do? I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg? Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg. Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it? Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg? I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office. No. I was just kidding. Yep. So that's why Casper is how he is. You've heard the stories right? It's not his fault. He had a hard life. He still does. You think so? All right. Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks. Not too late. Not too late. I'm gonna go out for a little while. Mom. But then I won't need your money. Hi mom. Yep. Where does everyone sleep? So, how many people live here now? Nah. Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to. Paul it's Telly. Open up. It's me. Telly. OK. Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid. Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please. Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.I'm sorry. The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should... Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection. Have you ever had anal intercourse? Were you protected? How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? How old are you?Water. Water? No. No. No. ...Noooo. What do you think I should get? No alcohol? What are my choices? Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem. You know I love you... yeah? I wanted to see you... Yes... I guess I knew that. Will you lighten up, please? Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel. I didn't know I'd ever need it again. OK. I like it here with you. Fifth and Mayflower. You know it? Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle. Yeah... I'd like that. You be careful to. I'm going to miss you. Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you. No... we already talked about that. Thank you, Sera. Please! Can we just ignore it? Can we just forget it? I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean. OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink. Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast. That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good? I warned you... ...but I'm sorry. We? That's impressive. How did you do that? Oh, and what did you do? Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank. What do you mean? I like women who wear mismatched earrings. When? Giving you money makes me want to come. I'm going to fill it right now. I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day. Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck. ...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand. No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul. Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money. Because... it's better for me that way. OK? I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right? Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK? Sorry. Of course. Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight? Right... OK... Hi! You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand? Sera... what you don't understand is... Don't be silly? You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time. Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me. Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk? Sera you are crazy. Me neither. Sera... What do you mean? I don't know. I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip. How long have I been here? Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack. I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better. Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something? That's astonishing. Sera, look... What are you thinking? Are you angry with me? Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to. Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either. Is that really what you want to ask me? Do they have drinks? I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is. Don't know. My watch went the way of the car. Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful. Yes. Take your time. I'm fine. This is the home of an angel. You do? Yes. I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you. ...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner. I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend... Don't run away. I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in. If I was I'm sorry. Yeah. And your meter just ran out. I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day. I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow. Yes, that's right. No, I came here to drink... myself... you know... I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want. Maybe another drink first. More tequila? Of course. Want a drink? I'm having one. Of course. Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them. You what? Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately. We can go to one if you'd prefer. Sarah -- with an H? Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want... That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars. That's funny. I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me? Are you working? Hello! I don't know. I'll find out though. The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new one. How'd this happen? What did they look like? Hey, Brad... how's it going?How much, do you think? I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up. Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears? Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.Sera... please go. Go, Sera. Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow. Have you told anyone that I'm here? Yes? What? What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard? A full night on the street and this is all? Where have you been? All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it! It is, after all, Sera, my money. With an old friend. I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets... and how you repay me. You have been lonely? I will keep you safe. We are both older. You have been lonely? I want this, Sera. I need this!I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it. If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people. My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit. I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy. It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered. Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet. And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you? You have had to rule with an iron hand. You have turned friends into enemies. And even at that, the result has only been partly effective. You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials. But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance. You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies. My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live. Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live. He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to. It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance. General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them. I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration. What do you think Napoleon will do? Proceed. I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again. Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter. Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this. Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground. Ah, yes -- proceed. I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point. Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length. Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring. Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army. For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct. Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about. Please go on. You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police. Proceed. General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like. I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established. Very well, General, what is it you wish to say? I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals. Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are. Fascinating! Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master? Whatever suggested the idea to you? I think it's absolutely charming. And, what a delightful idea!Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now. You realize what is at stake? I must be honest with you. I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses. In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command. Would you be prepared to handle this for me? These are odds of 8 to 1. Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men? Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons. There are none here. The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers. About 5,000 troops. I don't even know whether a defense is possible. To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea. We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense. I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties. Thank you for coming. Would you care for a drink? Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in. Please sit down. Please... Yes, Captain? Have you anything you wish to say? Yes -- who spoke up?I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph. I don't know, sire. I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont. I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day. Each marshal has been keeping his own position. I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau. But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked. The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men. Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris. The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet. Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements. Unhappily, it is true, sire. Paris is evacuated, sire. The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. The National Guard is on duty at the gates. It is on this road, sire, following me. They are at the gates of Paris, sire.No, sire... I was asleep. Yes, sire? Bertrand, sire. I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken. That is incredible. I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician. It is a terrible shock.Thank you, sir. I will do that. Thank you, sir. No, sir, none at all. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I am. Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.Just a minute, General. Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da. They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions. I thought not. I noticed you by yourself, all night. You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you? That's a nice city. This is your first time here, isn't it? I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there? Have you been back recently? Bastia -- and you? I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced. I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena. Yes, sir. I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican? Yes, sir?When you eat him, may I have some? Why are you carrying the dog? Hello there, Picart.From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city. The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city. We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago. They said they were acting under orders of the secret police. Our troops have no part in this. It has been started by the Russians! It is the work of incendiaries. At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire. The first reports came in at about ten. Four o'clock. May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors. Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries. No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again. Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again. For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes. The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise. I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is. Indeed you have, Ambassador. Have you sent for a doctor? Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have. No, sir. He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you. I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory. This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons. I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory. I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession. Yes, sir. Are you acquainted with her? Good morning, sir. Are you General Bonaparte?No -- not as a rule. Thank you, Napoleon. Thank you. I'm afraid I am, just a bit. But he asked me to say... on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his... admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven... and that his army... I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle. I very much doubt that he will. Yes -- an excellent idea. You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it. I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.I am at your disposal, Your Majesty. If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat. But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe. If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia. I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter. In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris. But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck. If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow. When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty. When Berlin fell, another treaty. That has always been the rules of the game. But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming? He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness. Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads. Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness. Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me. This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I. Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you? I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose? The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring! I don't think he can afford to. Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it. You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that. Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note? The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time. I have heard that story but I do not believe it. But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation. The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death. I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle. If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion. Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it. I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.Will you use the troops? She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway. When is she supposed to return? Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder. Are you sure that you are not still in love with her? But you can do the same thing in six months. The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life. You must not act impetuously. You can't be serious. It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce. You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters. Yes, of course, I would. You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this. No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage. In the evenings, he always ate at another table. They hardly ever spoke to each other. No... nothing at all. No... To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife. You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.I believe so. I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris. I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself. Yes, of course. What do you want? I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months. Yes. Yes. I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon. It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's. I know. God help me -- yes. My God, what do you think? About Hippolyte Charles. I couldn't face telling you. Yes, I wrote it. I wrote it. You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles? I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you. I swear I didn't want to hurt you. There are some things... better left unsaid. Let's just say, he looks after your interests. That's all I can say. Nothing. That's all I can say. Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests. I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph. Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend? He's downstairs -- somewhere. I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you. I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you. I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon. There's probably some explanation. I believe you sent for me. No, one cannot simply ignore it.If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction? May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me. Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur? Good day, monsieur. Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?What do you mean? Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present. Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack. Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said. "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest." And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment. You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back. When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down. I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one. I'm glad you like it. Ah -- you approve? And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander. Our lives, the revolution, my career? I'm not insulted. Fair enough. Are you proposing to transfer command to me? The numbers are not particularly relevant. You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant. Properly arranged, yes. You could have them here by daybreak. Where are they? Any cannon? Cavalry? What forces do you have at your disposal? Are you serious? What do you have in mind? Things are quite serious, I should say. No, thank you. I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel. May I come to the map? Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras. I did, sir. What cowardice! What treason! Joseph has ruined everything. How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard. And where is Joseph? Who sent my wife and son out of Paris? But who made this treaty? A treaty? Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this? Who made it? Who has been giving orders? But where are my wife and son? What's become of them? Where is Marmont? Where is Mortier? Paris has surrendered?! I don't believe it. And who is defending Paris? And where is the army? Well, Belliard, what's this? What are you doing here? Where is the enemy? I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms. She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her? I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine. Who is there? I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I? She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings? Ah, my poor Josephine. She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world. She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead. She should have had Larrey or Corvisart. They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me? Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper? How incredible! But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her? Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life. Let me see it. Come in. Come back in an hour. Oh, shit, that's not right. Read it back. You may go, Captain Charles. You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte. Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed. Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip? Was the trip normal in every respect? Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach? Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp. I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot. I see... Ah-hh, no. Yes, as a matter of fact, it is. No, they're living in Nice now. I haven't been there for three years. Ajaccio. Oh -- where do you come from? Yes, I am. A glass of champagne, please. My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed. But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people. Impossible, I don't believe it. I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting. How did it spread so quickly? Why didn't you wake me then? When did it start? My God, what a fire! My God...! What time is it? You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected. How do you expect me to find yours? Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend. Does your mother know you have come? And he sent you to me? A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for. That is correct. I have met her. What is your business with me? I am, Citizen. Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais? Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais. Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare. You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear. You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom. Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear? I'll have the fire built up. Would you like some brandy? My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable. I see. Oh...? Will Alexander be joining us soon? Shall we move closer to the fire? I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month. Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last. Oh, yes... of course. That's a very nice name. Where are you from? Only Lisette? What's your name? Oh, I'm sorry about that. Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money. Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street. No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin. No, I'm only here on leave. My regiment is at Valence. Oh, I see... That must be a great burden. Then what brings you out on such a night? You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this. Yes, it is. It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter. Good evening, Mademoiselle. Only as a last resort. What are the Councils doing now? My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife. I have no idea. Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is. But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked. Well, you shall see. Are you trying to insult me? My mind is made up. She will not set foot in my house again. I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her. It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us. The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already. I know of no better time. The important thing is to find the right lawyer. One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts. And you, Junot? You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you? Not even the slightest hint of something? Junot? Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph? I would like both of you to read this. Please read it aloud. Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success. I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to. It's me. Not be safe? What on earth are you talking about? Yes. Goodbye. Yes!! I will be there in five minutes. Go back to your guests. Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous! If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once. How should I know. Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress. Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working. Go away -- I'm busy. Yes -- what is it? All right -- I promise. Promises mean nothing. I don't understand you. I will never forgive you. I cannot promise you that. Not in the least. After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy. Yes. They were the easiest. I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting. One had better legs. Yes. No. Of course. No. Do you expect me to believe that? And now? Were you in love with him? No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers. Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be. I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais. I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon. You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais. Do you have some sherry, perhaps? Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience. Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door. Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house. And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern? Can you give me a drink, please? How did you know it was Captain Charles? You mean you heard them making love? You could hear them? Yes? How do you know? How do you know? Do you know what you're saying? What was there to tell? You couldn't face telling me what? You wrote it. What? Yes. Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now. Do you understand?! What the hell is the matter with you? You mean about my wife?! You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?! Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself. Now, just a minute. You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation. That's all you can say? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Why not? Certainly. All right, thank you. Please ask him to come here. I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier? Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier. Why did you give it to him? Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles? I asked for it yesterday. Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife. God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph? Yes, yes, please sit down. I will be with you in a moment. I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it. Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello. Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time? Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything. I will teach you everything that you must know. Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left? Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her. And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know. I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest. I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside. You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise. Of course, my dear. Yes, I do -- very much. And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits? Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn. Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband. Good evening, ladies. You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you. He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do. That is a matter of opinion. Alexander and I are friends. We have reached an understanding. What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force. My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France. It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties. The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield. We have a treaty with Austria. I very seriously doubt it. I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy. With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse. More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia. That is correct. Yes, he has. I did not ask her to go to war against me. Does she deserve anything better? Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot. Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech. Now, I order you to come down from the cart. No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you. Now, will you please come down at once. You will be taken back to Chalon for trial. You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac. I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men. I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot. Do you know him, monsieur? Send him in. Come in. Let me have it. Come in. Send him in. Come in. Show him in. Is he alone? What did you say his name was? A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us. Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us. I know Alexander. His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland. If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day. Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs. The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much. From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be. Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky. It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together. Life is a burden for me. Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me. It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight. My mother has always loved me. She would do anything for me.On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded. Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time. The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him. With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer. Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon. The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms. On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France. He would later say: "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up." Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy. Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him. He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline. His moods at this time were complex and varied. Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769. He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion. In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir. A message from Citizen Fouche. Major Lavallette to see you, General. Yes, sir. Eugene de Beauharnais.If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur. Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia. No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way. My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to. I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments. He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity. You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear. And where do you place Alexander? What I am talking about is moderation. Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses. England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria. A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard. Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator? Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade. Has Alexander agreed to this? Those are extremely harsh terms. Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.I've been a bad boy. Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand. That's my girl. Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog. What happened here? Who, him? Just visiting. During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy. It's an important speech.Oh, yeah? The grave. Somebody close? Somebody close? Aw, too bad. Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What? 'S okay. What do you think? Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego. It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops. Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money. Where'd you come from? Business or pleasure? You just come in on Amtrack? Amtrack? Where to, sir?Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem... What? I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave. Huh? Sorry. San Diego. Business. Uh, yes.. What? The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is? Same to you. No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn? Can we go now? Believe me, I don't blame you. This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello. For what? This? I've never even fired one. It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them. There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech. I knew you wouldn't believe me. And your husband works for somebody else. I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband. No. I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun. It was because I had this...in my pocket That's right. Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant. I have a problem. If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already. I appreciate that. Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you. She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph. I... Its'...ah...about my daughter.... I need your help. What? Walk out there and twist her arm off? What are you going to do about it, shoot me? I talk to her or you can forget about it. I want'to talk to her. Let me talk to her again. One thirty. California Ballroom. No, please... How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone? How am I supposed to get away? Even if you don't, Her Security men will. I kill her - and you kill me. I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work. I killed you. You killed him. How should I...? He's dead? What...? What would you do in my place? Then I have time for a drink. It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it. The gun... Where did you get these? Who are you? This says "invitation only". At one thirty my little girl is dead. I will do no such thing. You're out of your mind. Yes, I'm listening. Yes, yes, I understand. You wouldn't... Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends. Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl! I'd like to know what... Yes. Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near... What? We have to hurry. Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him? I think you better put that away. Okay... But... Are you sure? The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter. You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me. No! You can't! They're in on it. Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me. You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me. My wife always said I had a problem trusting people. No, that's,..that's fine No. Kisses to you. All right. Kisses to you. Will you promise me that? He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you. No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right? Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do. I know you do, honey. Yes, sweetie, it's me. Over and out. Yes. Yes, I can hear you. Lynn! Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right? Let' s do it. Ready? How did you see us kiss? So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that? You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that? Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that? We made it. I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me? Thanks for the shine. This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying. I don't know. What am I supposed to say to her? What!? Yeah. Thank you. Hi. Keep the change. What are you going to do? I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that. So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.... It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter. That's just what I thought I was supposed to do. It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl. No way, there's nothing you can do to help me. The Governor. If I could just talk to her... One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it. Kill the Governor. There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her. My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them. That's right. What? I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect... Please... Please. Something is going to happen... Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about. You remember me? Can I get out to Flower Street from here? Keep it. Keep it. Is within himself. I said I have to do something. I have to do something. I'm just an accountant.Thanks for the tip. What are you going to do!? What are you going to do now? Well? It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment. You're going to go see her. You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing. Irene is going to help. Meet Irene. Don't think I won't. Yeah, now listen. I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you. Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time? Yeah, all right, listen... Then why'd you drag me into it? Oh, Jesus ... Who? I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation? What are you supposed to do? In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom. Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off. This gorilla's watching you, is that right? Cover your mouth. Mister, what are you dragging me into? Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change? You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty? What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair. Oh, man... I remember. The big tipper. Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there. It's a twenty. You got anything smaller? I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail. What's that? You have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps. Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants? They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right? What do you do, if I may be so bold? Gimme a dollar. Oh, we'll have to do better than that. I think this is worth a dollar. I don't think so. You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild? It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now. Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs. You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned. Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.You know what I'm gonna do. Don't you threaten me. Forget about it. No. ...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together. That's right. That gives you... Again. Come back. That's not my problem, Mr. Watson Keep your voice down. Do you now, Mr. Watson? You fucked up. That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved. Tell me why he's dead. That's right. He's dead. Tell me why. Tell me why I miss him. Me? You get another chance in ten minutes. You... What about the gun? Are you 'fucking with me!? I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving. This'11 get you in anywhere. Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor. Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you. Unless you do what you're told. Go do it! Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it! Yes, you will, Mr. Watson. What's your point? She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here. This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson? Good. Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt. Daddy? Don't worry. She's good with kids. Come with us, sir. You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson? Could I see some identification, sir? You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control. Shut up. Help me get her off the rug. It's under control. Yeah. Just put her on. Put her on. Come Back. Do it! That's enough. You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead. Do it. You're wasting time. God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her. And what happens if I don't call you? You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all. Foreigners! Fuck! Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.- Right there. I'm looking for them. Keep your eyes peeled. Nah. Hates his wife.Could I see it? Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it? I see. Where is this gun? What?It's time. It's time now. Get moving. Where is he? Did you lose him? Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!? It better be. It doesn't look like it. You got this under control?That's Helms. He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player. He's nervous, sir. He's heard you're looking for a new director. Frankly, sir, it stinks. I have no access. I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff. Then his office will be fine. He told me to take you to his conference room. Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ... Mr. President, I don't know what to say. As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified. He should be here any minute.I understand that, sir. I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this. Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me. You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature? No, we have nothing to hide. I agree it's ridiculous but -- Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore. There's a cancer on the presidency. And it's growing. With every day that ... I'm still not confident we can ride through this. Some people are going to have to go to jail. Hunt's not the only problem. Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments. Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses. Uh huh ... Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ... Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here. Hunt has nothing to lose now. Pardon all of them. Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned. Executive clemency ... He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water. And he means it. Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge. Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand. Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify. But they're solid. The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect. He turns out to be ex-CIA. Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you. To protect his people. How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States? Is it? The President would like to know if that was the last payment. I was sorry to hear about your wife.Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day. The whole suit of armor'd fall off. Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans. Yeah? I figured that out. You think this is just about politics? Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob. Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list. You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson. He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman. Why me? Who's gonna tell Mitchell? Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking. He's the one ... Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote. Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue. Maybe she'll stay this time. Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up. Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee. It'll never wash. Pardoning them means we're guilty. The people, the press will go nuts. What about England? He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick. I would personally enjoy doing that, sir. Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times. Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable." Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ... The country's loving it. He's begging for a meeting, chief. He wants to go overseas for awhile. He's in the dumps, sir. Agnew. Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America. Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ... I thought the gloves were off. Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support. Is the war worth it? Is it worth a one-term presidency? Because I think right now that's what we're looking at. I don't know if I'd go that far, sir. No, sir. Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay? In ... hundreds? Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills? Pay him? I told him to get out of the country. It's crazy to start ... He wants money. In hiding. He sent Liddy to talk to me. Is it legal? I mean has anyone ever done it before? Well, he's photogenic. Let's try dog bones? He left his White House phone number in his hotel room. Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll. McCord? ... Mitchell? Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window. Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one. It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for. They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.Sir? I know it well, sir. ... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times. Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means. They're going to want to know what was on that gap ... Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap -- Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again. We can't survive this, sir. They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt. How do you see this? Lincoln used it. If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years. It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it. Sir, the deadline is today. Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun." June twenty-third, '72, sir. The part that's underlined. Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI. I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President. He's completely lost touch with reality. Richardson won't do that. He'll resign. But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him. Who? About a dozen. Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir. Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena? This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next. That's what they're doing. I don't have a pistol. You're all set, sir. Just push this button. Good night, Mr. President. No, sir, you did not. You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people. No one I know feels ... close to you. May I say something, Mr. President? At least Mitchell stood up to it. Mr. Hoover was a realist. Sorry ... It's marked. Also there's June twenty third. And this year -- March twenty first. Those are the ones ...So you tell Mitchell ... Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up. I was wrong. I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him. But we never opened our mouths, John. We failed him. They went after Castro. In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy. I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out. It's got him shitting peach pits. I think he means the Kennedy assassination. It's a code or something. The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else. How so? 'Cause he hates you. It's worse when you get it from someone you trust. You do it. Yeah, I knew it. I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ... It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind? And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ... It was her wrist. And it was through a plate-glass door. Sir ... six bodies. More light, chief? Helms wants Iran or there might be problems. All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah. Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available. He'll give us the documents. But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran. Then he'll go without a whimper. ... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story? ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate. When I met with him, he said ... We could leverage Helms. We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing. It's out of control ... You might burden just me with this in the future. You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker! He's going to think twice before he leaks again. ... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ... Why would they?! Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway? Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things. They come to Jew York City and they buy up things. One of the things they buy is the New York Times. And you know what? Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American. Because they're not Americans. We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top. You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration. So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ... Congratulations, boss. A great victory! The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all. Sir? I believe you're right, boss. Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport. The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ... The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left. And his staff. Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great. Sir? What? We really must go, Mr. President. Mr. President! Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit. That's top priority. Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids. There's more of 'em with you than against you. Not like these mudmutts. Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them. Run 'em over. ... and we've got the economic guys at five. The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget. Sir? ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget? ... never complain, never explain, John ... Sir? Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good. We have to get out in front of this thing. The PR is going to murder us. If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out? You never told him? Alright. But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2? So? You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead. If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall? Jesus! Before?! Eisenhower approved that? I don't understand. Track 2's Chile? What? That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters. Cue the crowd. Go to the woman's group. Get the bald guy, he's great ... Dick, you don't have to make a statement. Herb covered it for you. Meanwhile, what happens to the country? He's treading water. Don't mention Khrushchev. He wouldn't do the makeup. Said it was for queers. Yes, sir. I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing? What do I tell Ziegler to tell them? I'll talk to Helms. Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight. Sir? How is this national security? The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice. He'll need a pretext. He'll never figure one out for himself. Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it? The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up. How does that threaten us? All right. That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman. He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us? You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you. But ... Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys? Or maybe Chotiner? We'll work on it. I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it. How about a COMINT classification? We put it on the Huston plan. Even the designation is classified. But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate. We're clean. It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security." But what are we paying him for? What do you mean, sir? Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks? We were working on China. It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke. They went in to get his psychiatric records. Yes, you approved it, sir. Definitely. Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature. He works for Colson. He used him on the Pentagon Papers. We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant. After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe. Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico. The FBI's onto it. We could have a problem with that. Well, you know, sir, he's a nut. He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper. You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen? He wanted to buy a damned fire truck! Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation. We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ... It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money. It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC. Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it? I want to go home, Dick. Time to go home. Mom expects great things from you ... Go to law school. Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ... Hey ... you'll be able to do it now. I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her. Anything but a talk with her. I said I didn't need a free ride. I need a suit. What do you think? He said in life there's no free ride.Black Irishman. Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture. You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats? "The Second Coming"? Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality. Do you appreciate flowers? So President Kennedy thought. By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize? This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President. Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement. Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese? ... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy. It is not my practice to spy on the president. Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own. My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know. I don't think we can treat this as a formality. Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba. But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing. We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos. Mr. Castro. It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue. And of course I accept. I'm flattered. And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time. And me? ... Current levels may not be sufficient. Not if I give you all the cards ... President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces. You could do the same ... Diem? Trujillo? Lumumba? Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick. You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President. Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President? I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ... Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ... I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ... I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President. You did. And so shall I. Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman? I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote. Would you walk with me down to the paddock? I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth. Kennedy -- never. He'll fry in hell for what he did to me. But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him. Not Joaquin, you idiot. Nixon. Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power. I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde. He's lying, Clyde. Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still. And take your hand off your hip. It won't. As long as I'm here. No one. Your property. It would prove your case. Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls? For history. His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records. I always get my man. He's obsessed with his own image. He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much. As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press. Well, you have CIA people all over the place. Helms has seen to that. Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker. That was a mistake. The White House was full of Kennedy people then. It still is. Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office. Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war. Where are they now? Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war. President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing. How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace! Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up." The Communists have never been closer. Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president. Let the Communists know you're onto them. You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours. I know ... You'll win the nomination. I know you've been very careful not to. That's why I'm concerned. Yes. Your old friend from Cuba. I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment. Johnny Roselli is on his way back here. How about you? Are you going to win? Actually, I've just had a bit of luck. Thank you for coming, Dick. Turn this crap off, Clyde. It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin. It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that. My father sold it before they found oil on it.John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon. That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness. And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard. I'm one of his people. The Cubans are his people. And we're going to jail for him. That's not the question, John. The question is: Why is he paying? In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money. If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall. I'll bet he would. Yes ... I got the money. I won't tell him if you won't. Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do. A guy named Gordon Liddy. Thinks he's Martin Borman. You wanna meet him? We're gonna be plumbers, Frank. We're gonna plug a leak. The White House. Injections. Even this noble sport's been fixed. Seen the guys? Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States. Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies? Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed. Mein Kampf? Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow. It keeps me calm. I don't like going back into the same building four times.Well, goddamn. Are you threatening me, Dick? ... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are. I mean I got federal price controls on my oil. The ragheads are beating the shit out of me. And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear. Desi's got a point. What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?! And whose fault is that? If we'd won in Vietnam ... It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists. "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing. Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President." So, what's this about, Dick? That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow. Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of. Dick, these boys want you to run. They're serious. They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column. That would've done it in '60. Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians. And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam. These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ... He's all business, ain't he, Trini? Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal. We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ... Her name's Sandy ... I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party. We'll see about that. Party ain't started yet, Dick. Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.Not at all. This is not going to leak, is it? Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees? You have many friends ... and admirers ... If they harass you, I, too, will resign. And I will tell the world why. They will understand, sir. To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions. History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries. Oh God, I'm going to throw up. Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved? Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far. I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ... I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic. But it must be done; your government is paralyzed. You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros. We have to entertain the possibility ... Mr. President, this cannot be breathed! Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret. Exactly, yes, Mr. President. That is my contention. Exactly, sir. That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits. What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment. They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon. Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion." They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ... But they all got it back again, didn't they? We should have lunch sometime. Finally someone who's noticed! I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon. You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill. There's no other choice. Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ... He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children. He sees a shrink in L.A. He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead. He must be stopped at all costs. He was, he was. We taught a class together at Harvard. But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ... I beg your pardon -- Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation. We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve. And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy. Secret, Mr. Chairman? But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman. You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.I don't know. He made me see the stars ... Yes. He was a politician. That was Mr. Kennedy. Yes, Mr. President. Of course. I was asleep, Mr. President. What can I get you?How a fat man gets so many girls. Fung pi! I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing. I want to know your secret. What a waste of time. My writings mean absolutely nothing. The real war is in us. History is a symptom of our disease. You're too modest, Nixon. You're as evil as I am. We're both from poor families. But others pay to feed the hunger in us. In my case, millions of reactionaries. In your case, millions of Vietnamese. You know, I voted for you in your last election. That has the added virtue of being true. Don't ever trust them. They never tell the truth or honor their commitments. Vietnamese are like Russians. Both are dogs. Looks can be deceiving ...How about Kissinger along with him? What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile? You gonna send Kissinger down there? So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon? You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?Get off that. That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids. That was a long time ago. You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you. It wasn't your fault. The soldiers were just kids, too. They panicked. You all right? This isn't '48, Dick. They'll never buy it. One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum." And it's playing like gangbusters. Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph. Four. Two boys. Two girls. And eight wounded. You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes. Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy. That'll be the day. The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder. Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain. What the hell -- I love her. And she's great in bed. It's a thing she does. She talks at night. Sorry, Dick. She's a little tipsy. Hiss was protecting his wife. I've always believed that. And Dick beat the shit out of them. The lie? It was illegal, what he did. We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory. Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this? Raising a dirty mouth! You don't need to check the tape. I know what I said. Never. I never said that about Jews! You're lawyers. How can you let this shit go by! Look! This? Nixon can't say this. Then tell Richardson to fire him. They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia. The President can bomb anybody he wants. Yeah? Well, I own the fucking casino. Well, he certainly isn't acting like it. We'll see about that ... How's the job coming, Bob? No. His office. I want a very private conversation. I don't want to be bugged. So ... let's go ... Where the hell is he? Good. You know how I feel about loyalty. I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail. That I promise you. The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John. I have complete confidence in you. John, you don't want to start down that road. I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night." This is beyond you or even me. It's the country, John. It's the presidency. Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John. We have nothing to hide. But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth. That is the incredible thing! He's right. Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John. A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate. What do we have to hide? I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit. Goldwater put it right. He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here. If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course. That's the tragedy of all this. Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility. Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads. The average people don't think it's much of a crisis. For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here. Isn't it ridiculous? You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest. But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John. It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ... We could get a million dollars. We could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten. We could get that. How much do you need? Mitchell? Mitchell's ... family. I like that. That's a solution. What? Pay him. Pay him what he wants. Son of a bitch. Then what about this Washington Post crap? Woodwind and Fernstein? So, what about those Watergate clowns, John? This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences! There were no weapons. Right? No injuries. There was no success! It's just ridiculous. "Ex-CIA"? There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment. Is he one of these guys with a beef against us? We are covering up! For some petty, stupid shit. There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ... No, you're not! You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment. I don't give a shit. They can't force the President's people to testify. I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies. And what am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center? Lyndon bugged! So did Kennedy! FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me? What about Lyndon? He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down. Did anyone talk to him? Forget it. Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ... My point exactly! Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything. Do you see me screwing everything that moves? For Christ's sake! I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do! I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China! So why are these cocksuckers turning on me? Because they don't like the way I look. Where I went to school. I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit! You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president. No, no. He's our only "star" right now. He'd go crying straight to the press. He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch! Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones. I want to know everyone he talks to. No, you didn't, Bob. The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists. Well, no place where they speak English. That way he can always say he was misquoted. Yeah, good old Spiro. Well, better him than me. What the hell is he but an insurance policy? The soldiers were provoked. The students started it, for Christ's sake! -- as long as he's got secret files on everybody. I don't want 'em used against us. What about the CIA? Helms's done nothing for us. I want to see him. We can't touch Hoover -- No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials. I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance. Why not? Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over. These aren't fraternity pranks, John. It's anarchy. A revolution! We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them. This is not a joke, John! It's more than that. It could be more than that. I want Hunt paid. What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman? Screwing with the CIA? I don't care how much he wants -- pay him. Pay him. And? Where's Hunt now? Sure. Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48. I like it. I like the idea. Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?! Two years, he still doesn't come! We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around. Hunt? Howard Hunt? Who? Not another goddamn Cuban? I don't have time for all this shit! Just handle it, Bob! Keep it out of the White House. What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP." This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up. No! Magruder! That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point. Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention. If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary! Was he smoking pot? Jesus! Through a window? Jesus! Did Mitchell know? That smell. I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter. I am that blood, General. I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed. It came over from Vietnam, you know. ... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al. I got soft. You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ... It's gone. No one will ever find out what's on it. I don't know anything about that. That's right ... There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain. That was civil war. The army? And if I stay? Can we get around this, Al? It's totally out of context. I was protecting the national security. I never intended -- So? "Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry. The Pacific Theatre. Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks. I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first. And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ... ... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ... The hell he will! Fire him, too. If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch! And ... Cox! Fire him. A dozen? I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys. I'll take my chances with the Senate. For what?! Who the fuck does Cox think he is? I never made a dime from public office! I'm honest. My dad died broke. You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ... Let 'em try! I appointed three of those bastards! I'm not giving 'em my tapes! It's the President's personal property! I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers! These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves. Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill. Small event but dramatic. People took notice. Exactly! We've got to take the war to them. Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts. More assassinations, more killings. Right, Al? 'Night, Al. You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room. Damn right. And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it? They wanna believe in the President. There's no secrets here, Al. Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al. People've forgotten. I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence! The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards. They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon. ... They've always hated Nixon. I trusted Mitchell. It was that damn big mouth wife of his. ... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened. He would've protected the President. ... go on. This is June twentieth? ... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right. I love America. God bless America and God bless each and every one of you. No ... For God's sake, when does this end?! Townsend gave us 300 grand. Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ... I promised Iran to Townsend. What about the documents he promised? How? It's Helms -- it's got to be. He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain. ... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them. All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ... You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why. They're playing with power. They're forgetting the national interest. In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits. They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ... Right. They don't trust! They don't trust America! My God, my God! He talked to the New York Times? This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ... The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ... ... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ... You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia. It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt. Let him finish, Bob. Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ... You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry. It's killing us with the rednecks. Wait till the Mai-tais wear off. ... "The Beast." A nineteen-year-old kid. She understands the nature of "the Beast." She called it a wild animal. She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand. The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ... She got it, Bob. A nineteen-year-old college kid ... Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ... Don't forget to be on God's side. It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I. We actually agree on a lot of things ... But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela. When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back. They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob. Boy, Pat was brave! It's the parents' fault really. There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob. They've had it too soft. Too many cars, too many color TVs ... Get that little fucker! Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless. No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious. Why're we stopping? I tell you, the soldiers were provoked. Now stop this pussyfooting around. Dead kids! How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this? I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to. These kids are being manipulated by the Communists. Like Chambers and Hiss. Money. Follow the money. They had us bugged. Christ, he had everybody bugged. Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me. That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass. I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier. ... he'd just found out about Track 2. Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going. It was like ... it had a life of its own. Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists. It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore. Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in. He reamed my ass ... Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms! You don't fuck with Dick Helms! Period. And not just Hunt. Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans. All of them in the Watergate. They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba. Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President. That's what worries the shit out of me. I don't know how much Hunt knows. Or the Cubans. He didn't veto it. I ran the White House side. The mob contact was Johnny Roselli. One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt. The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election. Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2. In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion. Track 2 ... it was our idea. We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro. So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead? The Mafia, the money people. So we put together Track 2 ... Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster. He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba. He wasn't protecting me. He was putting me on notice. I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war. But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor! No! Where are they? The bastard! If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won. He made me look soft. ... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America. We would lose all our friends in Latin America. I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ... ... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral. The odds are 5 to 3 against us ... No, no, not tonight. Don't let her in here. I have too much to do. This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob. We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes. The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own. Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world. Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary. I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing. Because the President says it is. My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls. It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security. Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart. Just have Helms call him. Helms can scare anybody. Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him. Just do what I say, Bob. Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it. Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it. Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again. Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period! We've got to turn off the FBI. You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President. Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA. He'll know what I'm talking about. Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ... Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist. Or maybe I approved it after the fact? Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes. No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old. And for God's sake, keep Colson out. It's time to baptize our young counsel. That means Dean can never talk about it. Attorney-client privilege. Get to it. And Dean -- you stay close on this. "National security priority restricted and controlled secret." "National Priority." "Security" is not strong enough. Silence! Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus. Well, why not? Fucking hell. I did? I had nothing to do with that. Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing? On the list of horribles, I know what he is. And I know what he tracks back to. You say he was involved in the Plumbers? Howard Hunt is working for the White House? No shit! This is goddamn Disneyland! Since when? What's Liddy got? That fruitcake! What about him? Contributions! It was a legal contribution. Who the hell authorized this? Colson? Their fourth! But O'Brien doesn't even use that office. The Democrats've moved to Miami. There's nothing there! They did what?! I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place? No. No. They make me sick. They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young. But let me tell you, there are worse things than death. There is such a thing as evil. I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency. But I would never, never consider ... His death was awful, an awful thing for this country. Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms? Cuba would be a small price to pay. But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century. CIA policy? The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms. Except what I dictate to you ... I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago. Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ... Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job. Are you tapping Kissinger? Well, we'll lodge a formal protest. Yes. What? Yes. And you will give General Cushman full access. Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good. Of course you'll continue as DCI. You're doing a magnificent job. The President would support a reasonable request for an increase. I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia. That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding. I'm not Jack Kennedy. Your agency is secure. I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others. All of them ... Yes ... Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers. Things I signed as Vice President. I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else. Screw congressional oversight. I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know. Pay close attention to this. Then find something. And I want these leaks stopped. Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them. You're correct. I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not. The FBI is worthless in this area. I want your full concentration on this matter ... Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for? My friends call me "Mister President." This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar? Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself." All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me. Yeah, you do. I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes? Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office. He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar? Kissinger? Who do you think is behind it? We took his system out. We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar. They're stealing papers right out of his office. The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond. There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar. They've been at it now for a year. Young kids just like Tricia. I don't know. Do you think they have a point, Edgar? Maybe this whole damned system of government is ... The old queen did it on purpose. Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ... Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home. It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star. They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House. I never met the man. Roselli? Johnny Roselli? Can't we just talk here? I've got the police chiefs in San Diego. You should ask Bobby. Oh, my goodness ... Winning? My father built the house where I was born with his own hands. Oh, it wasn't a big house ... It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you. My father sold it before they found oil on it. Presidents don't threaten. They don't have to. Good day, gentlemen. Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ... The American people put me where I am. What do you mean, Jack? It's nobody's fault, Jack. It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead. Things change. Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46. Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war. We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks. Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold .. It's me or Wallace, Jack. Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern. I need your support. Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world. Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson. Gentlemen, I tried. I told Kennedy to go into Cuba. He heard me and he made his decision. I appreciate your sentiments. I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about. Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ... Agreed. By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ... She's quite pretty. Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now. Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane. We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ... Thanks, Jack. You sure throw a helluva party. Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God. ... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you. Yes. My mother used to pray ... a lot. It's been a long time since I really prayed. Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little. Do you ever pray? You know ... believe in a Supreme Being? Don't be stupid. The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways. You're the only friend I've got, Henry. That depends who writes the history books. I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want. But they won't get it. Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry. When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react? Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks? ... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook. I have never made a dime from public service ... Yeah ... Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in. The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard. It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's. That doesn't matter now, Henry. The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry. Idiotic? Yes, I suppose it was. All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing. You knew about that, Henry, didn't you? Housecleaning? It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ... Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry. Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks. That's right! And if necessary, I'll drop the big one. This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know. And if it leaks out of here tonight ... This will get me a second term. Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history. I, Nixon, was born to do this. That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers! That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen. No one understands! -- even my own men. What do you think the Communists respond to? Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying? Hell no! I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years. They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry? I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry. What do you think? Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli. They all went through the pain of losing power. ... as the old alliances crumble. We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment. You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public! And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him! Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way. Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss! ... and what do we get for it? Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me? Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia. No, Henry. I don't. It's your people who are leaking to the Times. Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard? He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover? Fuck it! He doesn't like me, John! It's your fault, Henry. Here, Tim ... Tim. I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem. They started the war; it makes them look bad. How did he do that? All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much? Why? Did you cry when he died? You don't think he was a hero? We let you down, didn't we. Your people. Do you miss Cuba, Manolo? Just ... uh ... you know. Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war. I was the lesser of two evils. Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here. I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman. Kissinger's misunderstood. He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ... We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list. Free, if you're the president. I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker. Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife. I'm out of politics. Sure, I'd like to offer condolences. It broke my heart when Harold died. They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks. They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes. I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality. My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John. Tuberculosis got him. How do you know that, John? Did we try? Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em? What's Hoover found, for God's sake? Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts. Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon. Jesus Christ! How many? Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her. Uh, wait ... Let's get out of here; it's too painful. I hate it. We went bowling last weekend. Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit. You're the one who should be in politics, John. You're tougher than I am. You never crack. Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger. Rocky's full of shit! No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife. He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans. Talks all day, too! How the hell can you put up with her, John? You mean smashed! She called up at midnight last week. Talking a bunch of crap. Pat can't stand her. When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you! But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers. The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers. The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar. Then people bought it that he was a spy. It's the lie that gets you. You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me. They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League. He was their kind. I was dirt to them. Nothing. You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal. A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired. Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II. If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot." I really think that's what has to be done. I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ... ... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John. The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers? ... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again! Can you back me up on this? Can I count on your support? I wanna fight just as dirty as he does. Edgar, wonderful to see you. Clyde ... hi. ... but it was all we had. You all know me. I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ... But change always comes slowly. I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years. I want an all-volunteer army. But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ... That man up there lived in similar times. He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray. You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true. My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves. My grandmother was an abolitionist. It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery. They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers. But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ... Right, right. I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier. Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy. The Orangemen! Now there's a football program. Jim Brown. And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ... Where you from? Hi, I'm Dick Nixon. She must be very attractive. Would she like an autograph? She might remember me ... Where's Trini? Uh, is your mother ... still alive? Oh yeah, he's good. Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ... What kind of, uh ... music do you like? ... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like? I mean, what kind of clothes do you like? Do you like blue ... red? That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ... Hello ... Maybe I am. No, no. I'm not powerless. Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it. Maybe not control it totally. But ... tame it enough to make it do some good. There's a lot more at stake here than what you want. Or even what I want ... I know. I know. I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II. Yes, I understand that. ... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"! And this?! Good Lord, have you lost your mind? Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"! Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you. But a man doesn't cry. I don't cry. You don't cry ... You fight! There's more ... there's more than just me. You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left. You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al. Do you think those POWs in there did? Fire him. Of them. Proud? So I'm supposed to be ... What's in there? What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart. If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get. But I will never resign this office. Where the fuck am I? Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison. Gandhi, Lenin ... They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me. Then it's a question of mathematics. How many votes do we have in the Senate? You know, Fred, they sell tickets. Who the fuck are they? Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license? Good. Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft. The hell with 'em. Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway. We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything! I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset. That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing. I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing. And we got the "big mo"! We're back! No ... it's just going to start now ... If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep. They were for me. They're mine. You're drunk! Don't be ridiculous! You can't expect me to explain that to you. Thank you. Brezhnev's coming in three days. I don't want to deal with them. And him. And you. Hiding what? And what am I doing? What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat? No. Tomorrow. Yes. Not for the Pentagon it isn't. I'm kissing Mao's ass. And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one. How am I going to break this to Bob Hope? Is that adjusted for inflation? Think of the life Mao's led. In '52 I called him a monster. Now he could be our most important ally. Only Nixon could've done that. No, I don't. I'm not Jack ... You've been drinking. What the hell are you saying? Jesus, you sound like them now! ... I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country. These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots! They don't have the long-term vision anymore. They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down. Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through. Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy. Yes! This is about me. Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon! They want to destroy Nixon! And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out. Do you want that? Do you want to see that, Buddy? It's not pretty. Yes! I'm not scared, Buddy. You don't understand. They're playing for keeps, Buddy. The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down. I do. I do. In my own way. I don't need that, Buddy. I'm not Jack Kennedy. Yeah, sure, a long time ago. Because ... I have to relax. Are you okay? Hi, Buddy. What are you doing in here? I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?" And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy! Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV? Anything. You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy. Yes ... you know it! Yes ... I will. Yeah! This. Above all. It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always. I need you out there. It won't be like last time. The war's crippled the Democrats. I can win ... We deserve it. Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last. Nobody knows better than you. Frank Nixon's boy. They love you, Buddy. They need you, too. Buddy? ... We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ... No. It's his way. He hates me. Him and Teddy. They always hated me. De Gaulle's gonna be there. And Macmillan. And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there. He doesn't want me at the funeral. I'll never run again. I promise. Yeah ... I'm out. I'll do it. No more. If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce? Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit? This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it? They want to drive us apart. To beat us. We can't let them do it. We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together. Everything's political, for Christ's sake! I'm political. And you're political, too! It would ruin us, Buddy, our family. My God -- divorce? What about the girls? What are you saying? What are you talking about? I'll concede in the morning. Amen to that. Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech? Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear. They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse! I sure am. The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy. And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why. Thank you, Fidel Castro. You know how much money he had in the bank when he died? Nothing. He was so damned honest ... But I miss him. I miss him a hell of a lot. Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy? Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight. He was a failure, too. What do you mean? We worked for it. We earned it. It's ours. It's not fair, Buddy. I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing. I hate it. It's hard to lose ... We lost ... No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons. We have similar views on the balance of power ... Some say you are, Rocky. Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book. "Six Crises." You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce. Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ... "Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy. What? Write. You know, a book. I'm calling it "Six Crises." It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write. But being out of the game gives me time to write. Lost. Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it. I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court. Hi, Happy. Well, you're obviously making him happy. Well enough. You're looking "happy," Nelson.What about happiness, Mother? Did he have to die for me to get it?! I can't ... Is it my turn? Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ... Please! I'll never let you down again, Mother. Never. I promise. No, no! Please, don't. Don't tell him. I'll never do it again. I promise. I promise ... Please, mama ... Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry. I don't ... have them. Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke. Yes, Mother ... Why me? You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold? Harold ... can I get you anything? What ... ? Oh, no, Harold. He doesn't respond well to humor. Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ... What'd you say? What'd he say?Well, that's wonderful. So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it. Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard. On my staff, foreign policy whiz ... The Republican Party was never home to extremists. You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he? Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party? Whatcha mean by that? Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ... The "crises"? Hiya, fellow ... What were they? To what? Someday, Dick. Won or lost? Repartee, Dick -- very good. Hey, I feel ten years younger! It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life? Oh, Happy! Dick Nixon ... You remember him. Howya doin'! New York treating you okay? I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us. It's a civil war between the Vietnamese. What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in. Ernie Davis. Syracuse. You're shittin' me.So, does Tricky Dick know about this? Where'd you find him? Who we working for? You're fucking me. Why, you got a customer? They're around. How the fuck did you know?Ummm... ... little Bobby. It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want? Edgar, think twice. He works in the kitchen. What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack? ... Use his women. ... Somebody should shoot the little bastard. Mr. Nixon. But it was all we had. ... give me a break, Mary.Or we could write "expletive deleted." Well, we could delete it. No, sir ... Yes, yes. Sir? Compassionate. Grateful. POWs. And their families. That's right. Sir? Bernstein. No, they want you, Mr. President. I really think it would be a good move. Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute. But what am I telling the press about Kent State? What? Win Vietnam, sir? We got the press this time!For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!! Well... is it loaded? Lemme see that rifle son... What are you doing with the gun? Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him. You know it brother. That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands. What it be is, You aren't coming with us. Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us. Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT? Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful." What's up? Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...Just hold on a god damn minute. I... What the fuck? Like? No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't... Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in... I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost. We all lost. Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find. Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it. I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone. Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!! Shut up. Just shut the fuck up. Judge, calm down. Judge, hold on, is your phone safe? Inspector Brimmer Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary." Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand? I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!! Get out of the fucking car. Get out of the car. Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit... Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us. Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol? I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today. So... we understand each other Judge? Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown. You're Judge right? We need to talk.Damn straight. Ain't gonna happen, stay cool. Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is. You know that's bullshit. God damn... Kid never had a chance... Look this is bull... No Fuck you!!! I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole. Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle. Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street. N... N...... Not... Oh. I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know? C'mon we'll walk and talk... Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been? You joining? My Brother.. My brother. You got it. Berkeley? Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful. Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag. ...Glad you came man. No man. PE -- "political education." Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out. Party needs the bread. Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!! Inside ain't in the system. It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up. C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere. Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white. Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility. But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.Did you shoot the officers in question? Huh, well then... did someone else start shooting? From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting? And did you witness the shoot-out?Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me. No sir he didn't. Yes sir, I did. Yes sir I was.Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred. Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards. Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from? Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything. Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons. We are going to shoot you!!! I tell you "officer", it wasn't... No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms. What are doing with yours?. I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law. Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it... You got to sit on Eldridge... You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby? I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay. What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to... This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras. Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby? Damn straight... Let's go check out these Paper Panthers. Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves. We'll be our own stoplight. ...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is? Because Denzil had his hands up!! Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too? Hold up a second... We got a decision to make. ...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that? All right then Eldridge, set it up. Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time. Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together. You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before. Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired... So talk... Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to... No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this. Brother we got momentum! You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother. Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you. Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy? This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer. Yeah... Bobby you gotta... We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns. Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts. And they want us to help with security. The white power structure wants us to act like savages. But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs. Power to the people baby... No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name. Or three you face annihilation. Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm. We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded. No thank you sister. Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you? That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got? Me too. That's why I fight so hard. If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers... Like the manual says, "Information is... Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters. You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker. And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this? You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing. What's the pig's name? Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything. You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust... I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it? See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then believe me those claws are fierce. I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game? You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous. What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day... Right on Brother Judge... Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important. Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war? You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for. Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass. Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us? Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift. You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you? Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you. Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book. We appreciate your help with this. So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower. You were. infantry right?Who? I mean besides the FBI? Who's they? Brimmer you're fucked up... What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest? Hey... what the hell you doing? Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!! Yeah, it's me. I can't... they don't operate that way... What are you crazy? What's with you? Yeah... whatever you say. Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous. I got you. Yeah. I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you. Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs? Naw... I gotta... Cy... I ain't even sure. No, Panther Headquarters. Least that way we could hang out more like we used to. Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift? Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking. PE? What? You guys doing gym class? Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times. Hey, this what they got you doing now? Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system. I don't know. Look around man. Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared. I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me. Another little donation from the police. Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass? Man, this shit's pretty thick. Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this? Yeah. Brimmer. Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired. Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me? Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about? What, I don't know how you mean? I don't know about that. They were empty... Whatever you need, I'll be there. Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know? Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second. I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... I'm down. No man. Gonna walk. Yeah... let me think about it. I don't know. So what's the deal? Yeah. We'll all get out of here together. Motherfuckers... You alright? No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse... The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them. You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that. Fuck is up?! S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station. Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead. Nothing. If you got something to say, say it. Huh? Busted firing pin. You want only the legal stuff right? Maybe... I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here. Just a kid. And who is we? Yeah, I do. I saw... but... You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero. God damn it's him. I gotta go. Motherfuck... well then I got something to do. Rose? Why didn't you tell me? Where is he?. What? Not at all. I'll catch you later. I don't know. But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid. Rose, what the hell you doing here? My Mom's at that. All of the above, man... And then some. I don't know. I really don't. Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else... Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something. Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright. Yeah. Yeah... cop hit me... It's okay Mom. I'm allright.Sit down, This concerns you too. I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty. Brimmer! Could you come in here please? Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement. They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously... Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists? I don't think that will be any problem... Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution. Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it. As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam. By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction. These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau. Are you finished? Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made... They couldn't have thought this up for themselves. That would be an excellent start. Tell him to keep a low profile. Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left. Can you make a deal with them? I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense? It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course. You mean... Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base... Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left... We're working on that... ...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...Wait a second there brother... A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded. I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared. Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it. Men? Well we can spare six for security...Motherfucker... you stay away... Man, fuck you!!! Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing. Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us. Alma I told you to... And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there? What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this? Oh shit Alma... you're... They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings. Uhh... I with it sister but... Alma!? I uhh I don't think... Yeah man, but where's Judge? Alone... Huey man I got to talk with you... Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally. C'mon let's... Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to? We're like policing the police. We need money first... Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers. That's right brother... listen and learn. Later for that. I'm done either way... Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy. Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk. Shut the fuck up!! Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you? Bullshit... What are you saying? Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? Sorry man... You got something on your mind... "brother." What's up with you? Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll... What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is? He had a feeling you'd be coming by. Just the legit shit. Fuck maybe... be there. You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say... What you see is what you got. That's' Bobby Seale. Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too. Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up. Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers... Well, act like it. Come on. But nothing... you do live here don't you?I already got a real one. Come on, it won't be too bad. It's not personal. Come on, let's go, I got to get back. Bullshit politics. Yeah, that's right.No problem. Yeah, right. Hey, fuck you, man. What's all this squid shit?Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public? What? Right Here? Talk to me about costs, here. Sounds good. What kind of things exactly? Clips. Just what I've read. That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire. And now it's gone black market. So, uh, do I get the deck from you? No. That's right. I understand. No, I'm not.Just not the eyes. Okay cash! Logical. Here's everything I have on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex? It's always politics. Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right? But I could pay you more not to. See what I mean? I could write you a check right now-- I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what? A star is born. Some tips. Don't dart your eyes around. Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself. OK? You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event. But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn. And don't act natural. Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on. Got it? Easy, Eduardo, easy. Preserve a sense of humor at all times. Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder. See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire. You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean? Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test. Okay, let's get you wired up. I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors. The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there. Yeah... he figured out what to do all right. No. Mace is in this. How did it happen? What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire? Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape. Tell me. I have a gun. It's under my bed. Don't know. But this guy's real damaged goods. Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too. Now no more games, Faith. Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now. Don't even think about it. Iris is dead. She was murdered. Can't do it. Max Pelcher? You're kidding? It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him. Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing. You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it. And you will. Come on, Faith! He's just toying with you. And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers. What? He gonna record you on his label? Why don't you just split? You don't love him, anybody can see that. And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys. It's Tran, isn't it? This guy is poison, Faith. Listen to me. He's got you walled in on all sides. And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you. I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on? Tonight. Yeah, OK, whatever you say. Just answer one question. Is anything wrong? Iris said you might be in trouble. I'm already hurting. Hi, baby. I've missed you. Faith, call me, okay? I just got to talk to you for one second. Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break. Forget it's there. I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes. Watch and see. You nervous? Forget it. The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me-- Step into my office. Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste. I got a deck with me. I can get you what you want. You just have to talk to me. I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls. I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious. You say it, you even think it, you can have it. You want a girl, you want two girls? I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy? You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up? It's all doable. Exactly anything. Whatever you want. Whoever you want to be. Fabri, get us another round, would you. That's right. Clips. Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here. This isn't like TV only better. This is life. It's a piece of somebody's life. Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex. You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it. I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software. A virgin brain! Well we're going to start you off right. So what do you know about this? Save us some time... You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right? How did you hook up with Faith? Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts. So there never was a death squad. You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump. And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend. I won't say anything. Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too? Wait a minute. Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I? So... I killed Tran. Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me. Jesus! What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran? Where's Faith? No. I suppose not. I didn't know you were colorblind, Max. 2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her. This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right? What do you mean? Okay... what about Strickland? Thanks, buddy. See... things weren't bad enough. They weren't fucking bad enough! Jesus. What stuff? Whattya mean? No. But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs. They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain. He's been cooked-off You may be a little overdressed for this party. Yo, Tick! It's Lenny. Open up! He's in this somehow... I don't know how. Just stay close to Faith. Looks like she was holding out. Faith OK? W'sup, Max? Why me? He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging. And he records it all. But this is a bad one. So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her. The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him. I've seen a lot, Max. He records himself raping and killing her-- He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does her... Not now... I don't want to think about it-- Yeah. No, not really. Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her. You should feel like shit. Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy. Shutup a second! Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket. Hey, Iris, you okay? Thanks, Max. I'm touched by your concern. Naw. She won't call me. You were lucky, Max. It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle. This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe. Thanks, Max. Least you can do. Okay. It was funny. But it cost me money. She never gave me a tape. What clip? What was it? Wait, wait... wait a minute. Iris was here?! Who was just here? What? Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer. What else you got? I said that? Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer. Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens. I'm snorin'. Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me. So lay it off to somebody else. I don't deal black-jack clips! It's policy. I got ethics here. Tick. Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that. I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit. And my customers want uncut. Yeah, but how'd it get to you? How'd you get the tape? Why didn't the cops put it in evidence? Well you could've at least warned me. You know I hate the zap... when they die. It just brings down your whole day. Jeez, Tick. It's alright. He means it. Charm. That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it? Faith, can I talk to you a second? Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning. Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out. You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls. Your sex life? I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there. Sure. Whatever. See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir. One of life's small pleasures. Strickland. See you downtown. Yeah. We did. Naw. They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours. Then we'll be right where we are now. No. Trust me. Take it to him. Exactly. That's why it's a make- able deal. I still got one ace to play. Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants... Alright. We're going up. You see Tran? Got your ticket? Mace... you're a girl. But she was different. There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice. It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice. I helped her. And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her. See? It's not about what's in her head. It's what's in mine. I can't let go of the promise. It's... like... it's all I have left. I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity. I was lost, Mace. In outer darkness. Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank. Another lost soul. And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it? It didn't stop you from loving them. Right? Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them... Whatya mean? We're going! Tran's gonna do her right there unless-- Okay, we gotta get over there. Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something-- Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch. Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland. The sanctimonious prick who busted me out. His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it. I know this guy. If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him. Yeah, right, blow it open. He's totally cut off from the outer world. To break the trail. If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too. Our killer is running as scared as we are. Which makes him really dangerous. Judging by how scared I am. I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her. It was a tough call. There's a plus side? So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me. Happy new year, Lenny. Maybe. But tonight is probably not the best night. Come on, we're rollin'. I've got a good idea, yeah. We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance. Yeah I know. So what do we do? Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see? Mace. I know what you think about the wire. But I'm asking you to do this. It's that important. I can't tell you. You've got to see. It's the walk. Something. Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address. We gotta keep moving. Those two guys were cops. Yeah, me neither. It was one of my favorites. Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday. I'm going to really miss it. Are you out of your fucking mind?! The gas tank's going to go any second! Goddamnit!! 911 is busy! Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof? Shit! It's in my case. Okay? I'm going to open my case... She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car... Easy, there, Mom. Easy. This is audio only. John Coltrane. "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful. No shit. You got someplace in mind? Mace, the guy had a knife. To my throat. In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?! This tie doesn't go with blue! Anywhere. We'll talk about it in the car. Jesus, Mace! S'okay. I know you still love me. How's Zander? The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck? And what about the guy that was following me? Because it had to look random. Not connected to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me? If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko. She said "If they get me". They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason. No it doesn't. See, it's all about what they see walking in. A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong. Random kill. The kind you never solve. She came to me for help. I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night. Yeah. I'm ghosting pretty bad. I need to see more... get more detail. Something. I feel his presence, so strong... It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear. He knows what he's doing. He's worn before... a lot. Never really thought about it. Is this great fabric or what? Uh unh. No way! They'd crucify me. Jesus, Mace. Back off. I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never. Everybody knows that. Wants to share. Snuff clip. It was Iris. She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her. Black. Jack. Go to the Sunset Sheraton. RIGHT NOW! Just go! GO! No idea. It is my sword and my shield, Macey. I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain. You'll see. She's my destiny. She still loves me. Rams... that's football, right? Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse? Begging? Groveling? Any pathetic behavior at all? Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her. Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way. You still like me, don't you? We're still buddies? I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really. Macey... I've never seen you like this. So am I. Just trying to get by. I thought we were friends. Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here. D'you mind? That would be no. I need my case. It's still in the back. In LA? Are you crazy? Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani. You angry? Let's talk in the car. Coming with you. Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation. We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests. I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind. What's his name? Yeah, but that was for love. Define illegal. Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are. But now the risks are outa line. The streets are a war zone. And sex can kill you. So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks. Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar. Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife. And maybe he really does catch something-- Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service. I save lives. No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it. Mace! You're a life-saver. Mace, you're my friend. I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight. Just a couple of hours. It'll be fun-- Come on, Mace. This is gonna be a big night. Can't you feel it? The energy in the air? There's money to be made, dreams to sell. Thanks for giving me a ride. I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side-- They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it? I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately. Have you noticed?And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--' I said, 'Yeah. I'd even do it for free.' You were supposed to go downstairs, baby. Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together. You know it's true. Hey, he was going to kill you. And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass. I'm not. Just a little poach job. Believe it. Now bring me the trodes, baby. Come on, quick. This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby. Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran? You pinhead. This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right? But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says... Yeah. Pretty zany, huh? All this shit caused by a random traffic stop. Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that. Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos. You gotta take what you can, while you can. Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second. Naawww. You got froggy on me a couple times. No plan is perfect, Lenny. Hey, cheer up. World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway. Only he doesn't know about me and Faith. So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall. And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times. I know. So, I'm working for this puke, right? And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control. Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody. It's too perfect. You bet. Did you like it? That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy. That's pretty much the way it happened. You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die. Shit being number one. You just did. I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran. I'll have that. Glock 22. Nice. Only way I could stand your ties. I intend to. Come on! If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all. Whattya say? Just get your butt down here. If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room. It's 2203. You writin'? Give him the tape. See? It's fucking brilliant! The tape for Faith. I know he'll go for it. I can set it up. He's got her up in the room, under guard. And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'. So buddy... I say we work a trade. No. Bad idea. Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history. They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada. Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright. Smoke. Rumors. I've heard stuff about a death squad. A group a guys loyal to the hardline school. Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control. All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff. Is he dead? Sounds like Tick's already celebrating. I'm on her, amigo. No worries. Gotta jam. Yup. Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night. Another slick Lenny move. Yeah. She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie. Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name. Paid cash. Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed. That's right. He wants to share. Needs an audience. This is one sick puppy. Top ten. So've I. Too much. But at the same time he's sending the signal to her-- And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it again. And again. Come on, Lenny. You used to be good at this stuff. Play it down. What's the perp doing? Let's work it. You alright? Y'okay? I'm on her. I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both good. Right? I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it's just a job. I feel like shit about it. I'm telling ya, it's over. We used it all up-- An ex-cop that doesn't carry. It's embarrassing. I oughta not be seen with you. Hey, Mace. What's goin' on? See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense. I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly. Broken hearts are for assholes. Just as well, Lenny. You gotta get past it. I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre. Yup. So darn lucky. I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of. Good thing I wasn't any luckier. Bobby! Another shooter right here! That's not sayin' much. D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp? Bobbyyyy! Tequila por favor! Double shots. Make it Tres Generaciones, huh. Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad. Hey, nice tie. Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks. And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal. You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring! Let me buy you a drink. You see the look on that preppy puke's face? Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders. You really want that on your head? Fine. Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains? The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground. And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves. It'll be all- out war and you know it. There's more to this whole thing than you think. Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks. Problem is, Lenny knows everybody. He's skull-fucking you, bud. Trying to get a reaction. Maybe pushing you to do something. Sssssh! Not in front of Lenny. You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him. Yup. He was Jeriko's manager. Bummer, Tran! Lost your golden goose. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. Sucks. Hey, Bobby, turn that up.Your existence. I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much? Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter? Commissioner Strickland. Nero.I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it. Said I wouldn't want to see it. She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin' Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip. Iris, man. Pay attention. Well, it's cutting awful close to me. I mean she was just here. Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there? Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma This is not good. I don't like this at all... Well... the guy's fucked up. Whoa. That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck. Ha! That's for fucking sure. Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life. Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.' Now that is cold, Lenny. I always bring you choice. Give me six at least. This's a good clip, here. Gets you pumpin'. Come on, Lenny. I got expenses. I got to get this rig fixed. Look at it... Yeah, when did that start? Come on, man! It's what people want to see, and you know it. Fuck that! The last part's the best. You dry-dive six stories and blammo! Jack right into the Big Black. I got ways, Lenny, I got ways. Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics. My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue. So whaddya think? This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand. Right? With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig. Sorry. Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.Take her up to the suite. Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year. Maybe later. The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head. I'd love to. But he keeps showing up. And you keep talking to him. I can't have that-- Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in. It was touching the way you stood by me in there. "Stand by your man". I was moved. You were very good. I don't think he even understands that you did it for him. You're going down. A tragic story, no doubt. How'd you get up here? Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale. He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him. Don't talk to anybody. You understand? Not with everything that's going on right now. Lenny the loser. Panhandler of stolen dreams. Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car. I do mean it. And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again. You understand? Uh huh. Look, Nero. I'll make you an offer. Take her. Right now. If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go. I'll let her choose. Faith always knows what she wants. Hands off. See? About what? I always do. Show a little respect, Nero. The man was an important artist. I already got everything I need from you. You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny? For old time's sake? Make a couple bucks for the holidays?Aw, Mom! Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good. Right. That explains it. Where were you Mom? Did you meet a guy?Game over, bitch! I'll tell you this. After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive. But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one. You don't know a fucking thing about me. You don't have the slightest fucking clue. You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars. Oh, yeah. What? Shit. That sure is a lot of money. Five million dollars? If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it. I ain't scared of you. What does that fucking mean? How'd you know? Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know? No, no. Wait. You don't want me to jump. You're going to jump. I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over! What are you doing? What? What's okay? Bullshit. So what happens now? Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows. What kind of marks have they got here? Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician. I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get. Robert Bain, driving me! Jesus fucking Christ! Yeah, that's it. And he's like a fucking genius. They said he shaded you over and over. And in the end, he aced you again. Shaded and faded. They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit. I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right? Oh! I got a question. Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me. I sound like some fucking fanboy. I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you. Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov -- You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low? I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing? Sounds like chickenshit -- Hey. What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant? I mean you had me, a free shot. That's what I would have done. Two years. Two long fucking years. Bain. Michael Bain. Holy shit! Robert Rath wants to know my name. Boy, that's fucking genius. You're a fucking genius. Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that! No fucking way. You can't -- What are you doing? Just do your job. Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal. That was Peterson back there. That goes to the expressway for the airport. What are you doing? Probably. Yeah. No shit. Why? What happened? Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat. What is this? No. No I'm not. Uh, Fontella's What? Yeah. Yeah, I'm a waiter. Right. Is there a problem? How in the fuck do you know that? I don't give a fuck what you are. I asked you -- What? No. No. No. I don't believe it. I'm on the scent.I'm sorry, sir. A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso. Yes. This is the Hotel Paraiso. Yes, sir. Sure.Look at that. I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind? I used to think about it. I had Margaret. She wanted kids. I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe. I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part. 'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work. You understand? You mean quit? Anything. When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying. It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay. I feel good. Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying? What do other guys do? Can I ask you something? I'm thinking about Moonpies. Ain't that funny? I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one. I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not. I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me. That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that? That's exactly what I told myself. 'Taken.' That's nice. When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them. I have been thinking about this for a long while. I knew this day was coming. I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked. What do you call it anyway? Shit... oh well. One hundred thousand? That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot? Oh yeah? I guess we still need to see that price tag. Like art, right? You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle. I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering. You're pretty famous aren't you? I think I've heard of you. I don't know. Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?' I don't know. Maybe I didn't trust her. Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that. 'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.' I never would though. Not really. Hey, do you mind if I talk a little? I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess. How much farther?Of course, senor. Excellent, senor. If you could follow me? This will take some time. How would you like the funds? You wish to close this account today?Bain! Now I'll tell you something. It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you. Why don't you tell me. You would be. What I just said, no assassin would say. What I've said, only a mark would say. You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right? Did you see how I did that? Magic wasn't it? That's right. All right, Bain. Pay attention, because this is where everything changes. Yeah you are and you hate it. You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't. That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me. Listen to me, Bain. Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information. It bothered you, but you didn't care. How do I know this? Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now. It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say. I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know. I know you're going to jump. There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive. But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good. Okay. We go around once. After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland. Tachlinkov. We both know what you were doing. It's just a shoot-out then. Sixty- forty, at best. Not my odds. How long have you been freelance? What's your name? We both know it's not Nicholai. Okay, don't. Sit back. Put your seatbelt on. The hell I can't. It's my cab. I don't like you. So, get the hell out! Get out. You think I'm running you up? Get out. What? You think I'm running you up? You're right. Talking too much again. What? I'd love to sit in that jury. Send that S.O.B. right to the chair. But they caught the guy. I heard it all. Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco. Shooting anybody. Drugs, probably. Yeah, it's terrible. I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook. He probably had it coming, but all the other people. Real sad. Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio. Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma. I know just what you mean. I'm pretty beat myself. Not too good at small talk, eh? Where you from? So you're from around here? What restaurant? Where? No. No problem. The airport, right? Take us there. No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city. Near the Plaza del Sol. No, no. I said the Hotel Paraiso. Good afternoon. We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca. Hi. Up ahead my boss is in that black limo. We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them? A player? You think this is a fucking joke? Is this how it went, Nick? I give a fuck? I'm done! I quit! Do you fucking hear me! I'm fucking gone! I bet you fucking know! Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts -- He's coming, Electra! Get out now! Yes. Last night -- Electra -- I'm taking off my mike. Wait until he is on the stairs. I waited another four minutes. Four minutes. Martin. I'm not normal. Why? When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me. Honestly? No. I'm not sure that I care anymore. After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated. No. I tried to stop it. I couldn't. She was taken. Someone like me, like you. A pro. Yes. It can be. I didn't want to complicate the situation. Both. Why? I don't know. Yes. Yes. I'm sure you will. Because, I'll take it. That's a ridiculous move. What are you doing? Did he explain how this happened? Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you. And you were drilling these holes...? Why? It's always been that way. The world has always functioned on two levels. No. Thank you. Why in the hell would you take that chance? Jesus, if someone had -- What? How do you know they're not? I didn't notice them. They're worth less points. Why did you trade a bishop for a knight? Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids. No. Yes. Here I am again. No. I went back to the hotel. And waited. Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business. He said I couldn't win. That no one wins at this game. What did he say? He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business. To disappear to some empty Greek island. I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank. He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me. Yes. It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear. Things happened beyond my control. I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense. I don't know. It just happened. I was here ten years ago, I'm here now. That's it. Yes. Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting -- I was. I told you, he will. What? I've been thinking about it for a long time. Five million apiece. You get on your plane, I get on mine. I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed. You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car. If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me. That's right. He can't. The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines. He won't be able to. He'll have to go inside. He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there. If the bank closes, he won't know for sure. He'll come. I'm sure. And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun. The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed. 5:45. 5:50. He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank. It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself. He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe. Then, we wait. You'll be here. A restaurant. A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside. No. It would be amateur. A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming. Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front. He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd. He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank. This is the bank. This is the hotel. In the morning I will enter the bank. It's too late now. Okay? We'll have to deal with these. I paid a lot for these. Transmits and receives. You should. It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it. Thank you. Taiwan. How was the beach? You should knock. He won't be looking for you. Just be careful. Buy a book. Keep your sunglasses on. Okay. Breakfast. I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping. Yes. Here? You can have the bed. The chair is fine for me. I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been. No. No. Yes. Work. The things I need to get done. It helps me to focus. It centers me, helps me think. No. I wasn't expecting this. I need to think. That's where he'll be. I don't know. Nothing. Thinking. Mexico. Good. Do you have a passport? I don't. It. Tell it. For all I know it could be a machine. Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless... This is fiction! Don't you see that? This is another reality. And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them! They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks! Do you understand what I am saying? No one is innocent -- including you! Did it ever bother James Bond? They become complicated... messy. No. Just the first one. It was... mechanical. Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline. Why? My first take? The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money. Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets. Yes. It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared. The same reason everyone does. You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you. Because you are a women. Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women. Women? No... not really. They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive. The training, the weapons, the travel -- Of course. I was going to be James Bond. No, they didn't. No. I graduated from George Washington University. Then I entered the Agency training program. I was just different. Some people said that. I never thought so. Languages. I was already fluent in nine languages. They recruited me when I was in high school. More or less. The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency. Yes. As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top. That's all there is. Until then, there is nothing. You are nothing. Because that's how it works. That's what it's about. He was the best. He was on top. I killed him. He was... taken. We played with a code using The New York Times obituaries. Over three years we played twelve matches. I never won. He was Russian. Nicholai Tachlinkov. A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him. When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game. It's not the same, is it? Because I'm done. No. What do you want to know? As in daughter of Agamemnon? Just Electra? Rath. Robert Rath. He will know everything about you. Everything. I know, because I've done it. Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him. Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment. He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets. He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books. If you keep a diary, he is reading it. He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke. In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled. If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them. No. It's the truth. I know what you are. Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world. You don't have a social security number. You don't pay taxes. You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years. A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy. You think you can do it again. But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing. No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you. Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you. If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you. This is something that is never going to end. You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding. And that's going to take money, a lot of money. If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead. It's simple. You need me. I need you. And we will both need money. Right. We don't have a choice. Yes. The nature of the business. You remove your competition. Yes. Because he is trying to retire me. He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him. No. They hired Bain. The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one. Another contractor. If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me. Until a minute ago. 'Them'? Yellow Pages. V for veterinarian. There aren't that many. You're the computer hacker, you tell me. No, stay in the car. I want you to understand something. If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead. Turn off the engine. Now you understand why I'm here. I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more. The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars. Twenty large? That's all? I'm part of the game, just like you. Yeah. I work for the government. Took a guess. Lucky for you, I guessed right. Nikita? She helped me find you. Get on the expressway. One hour per man. He has to clean up. How many bodies were there? Thank you. Yes. Do you believe that? Can you tell me about it? Do you ever think about starting over? Do you think about their wives or their families? But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them? Do you ever regret things you've done? Honesty. I called because I just want... I need to talk. You're very good at this aren't you? Why are you working today? Would you like a drink? I prefer it like this. Yes. Please come in. No. Yeah. Yeah. Why didn't you fade? Can I ask you a question? Some. Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not. Go ahead. And an R.C. What are you thinking about? Right. Don't know. That's how it works. Everyone who plays the game knows the rules. Taken. Average. A dime. It's a common question. I hope not. It's possible. Why not? Sure. Just a little ways. Up to those trees. Thank you. I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate. Can you hold everything for me until he arrives? I have all day. American currency. That's correct.All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested. What now sir? Enigma. Mystery. Of course. 13 is M....MRE. Recognition, of course. But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean? Master, Bruce? No demons, son. Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them. What? Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man. What? Perhaps the fall... Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed. Old habits die hard. Are you alright? How are you feeling, young man? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady? Dr. Meridian... Why, indeed? Which `they' might that be, sir? I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time. _No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_! Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car. Actually, he took the car. I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling. Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick. No. You said I. I killed them. What did you say? Ninety-three, including the sauna. I don't know, sir. Your dear parents. Suddenly gone. So much loss... Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears. Apology hastily retracted. If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize-- Scholarly research? I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile. A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time. Hardly a worry, sir. ...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment? It's a wonder you sleep at all. The dreams again, sir? Just checking, young sir. Master Wayne's dead wives. May I help you, Master Grayson? Al? Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.Help Chase. I'll be back. I haven't had much luck with women... You are direct, aren't you? I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic. We all wear masks. Try a fireman. Less to take off. It's the car, right? Chicks love the car. Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor? What's wrong? Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian. Why's that? ...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work. And you are? Exactly! I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I? Wait. I have a riddle for you. Death. Death. Without taste, sound and all around us. Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap. No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.Tonight's a good night. Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase. Are all the Batsuits destroyed? Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma. And another name for Mystery? How about, MR. E. Letters in the alphabet. Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card. What do maniacs always want? All the answers are numbers. ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman. I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me. Oh my God, Alfred. ...A bat. ...Afraid. There's one other thing. I feel.. I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne. But all this. It's like the life of a stranger. As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news. Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that. How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...? She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her. Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family... Why do I keep doing this? Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs. Maybe they're right. Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred. The _Rolls_? He boosted the Jag? Is that all? He ran away? Is he all right? Don't be ridiculous. He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents. It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them. Take any three you like. After you get settled we can... Gee, I'm not sure. Alfred? How many rooms? Total? I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me. In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong. They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear. ...The night Batman was born. What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember. Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me? I wonder if she'd go out with me. She has an excellent mind. It'll never work. How's the sonar coming, Alfred? Then you'd have nothing to complain about. I think they're getting worse. Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization. Banzai. Slanta. Nostrovia. What? Oh, it's very impressive. What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party- We'll talk some other - Call my secretary, she'll set something up. Factory looks great, folks. Keep up the good work. Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind? I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed. Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are? Mr...? Chase. There's something I need to tell you-- I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years. ...Not the bat? The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight. Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater... It was my fault. I killed them. I don't-. My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling... I don't want to remember! There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I... And the beast slouches towards Bethelem. Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman. Can I? So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman? Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me. Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain. I'm not- What? I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home. Why do I feel like the other man, here? They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather.... A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them.... The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles? Who's your decorator? U-Haul? I said I'm sure he did. He sure did. Fast work. You just moved here. But... Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along? Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep. Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis. That kid is amazing. What? This isn't normal? I'm sorry. Who are you? And into a black dress. But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes. Look, I'd love to keep chatting- No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch. Oops. Times up. To kill me. It's a stretch but I'll manage. Not much. So, this Riddler, he's dangerous? So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right? Wacko? That a technical term? Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes. Still play with dolls, Doctor? On occasion. Usually at night. Just ones this beautiful. Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion. Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us. Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me. All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse. And when you finally get Two-Face? Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know. We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school. How about Richard Grayson, college student? What the hell did you think you were doing? You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice. I want better for you. What I do isn't about revenge. Absolutely not. Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse. Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now. Excuse me.Four seconds from... Up here, Al. How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there? Big house. How many rooms? How ya doin', Al? Bruce, you can't. But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us. You can't-. I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own. ...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him! You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name? Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault. Back off, man. Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back. I need to be part of this. Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me. I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him. I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya. Okay. I'm outta here.I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle? Rinka. La'chiem. No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms. Skol. Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together. The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way... And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are... So glad you could come. No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you! Wait. You can't go. Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves! What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol. And some people have been trying to keep us apart. Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone. Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip. Bruce Wayne. In the flesh. Can't tell if you don't say please. Yesssssss. I know! How could I forget? Who is it? Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be. What do you think of my new invention? I don't think so. Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons. Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject. Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours. New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah. Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt. Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet. A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either. I'll show you it works. Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred? ...The Box can change their lives. Our stock coupons will spike. Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king. Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the... Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?Wait! You said you'd let me go! Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face. Please. I swear I won't say noth- I got family. ...Please. ...You gonna kill me?Oh please. You're blind as a bat. For _me_? Really? Tell me. Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now. Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks? You sunk my battleship. A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add. A-14. Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will! Go ahead. You can say it. Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours. Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you. About what? Not until you do that thing I like. On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie... Woah. Harsh toke. Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive. Here. Get a good seat. Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman? So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment. Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus? Yet so bright and chipper and conservative! It's so you. And yet so _you_! Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely. You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...Never heard of a double-cross? Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul? That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better? The coin _wants_ to decide. ...or death. What say we flip for it? Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject. _We_ sure are. A hit. B-12. Miss. We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad. You're a genius. Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy. Everything. Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right. Don't bogart that 'trode. Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again. Where are you sending Batboy this time? No. Wait... Holy shit. Let's see if you bleed green. A man with a death wish. Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list. How'd you find us?Well, I didn't know they was a secret club. Well, nobody put a gun to his head. I'll get right on it. Heat is heat. They got heat in Michigan.Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her. Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge. It clearly states in the will -- Apparently just before her death. Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.I said NO! Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that. Why are there two deeds here? Doesn't matter. Move on. We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian. Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom. Oh Jesus. SO! It's not that long. We were here two Christmases ago. Then we should have had lunch at the bank. I nearly died when we split the bill. What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you. Carolyn! Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?" Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean. Nobody did. Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage. I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here. Not yet. You want to go? I bet mom could've helped her. He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff. I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road? Bar across the street. Then why do you? I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis. Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife. He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us. No. We're going to lock this up and -- This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was. That's it! Grateful!? I can't believe she's making jokes. How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope? Well, what am I supposed to think? Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --! This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it. You think she had sex with him? Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...? DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die? What? Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him. What's he saying now? Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away! What?! Yeah. Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray. What problem? I thought everything WAS arranged. He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve? Lawyer here? Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office? Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer. Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice. Okay. Betty. Okay. Nah. Who the hell is Lucy Delaney? WHAT! I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh? Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated. When did she decide this? Cremated?!What about your husband? What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon? Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much. Franny? Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make? I'm going to miss you. Frannie. Again? Maybe you should see a doctor. Now?! It's after eleven. Where you going? What time is it? 'Bout 4:30. Sure. Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing? You feeling better Franny?I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind. I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now. But now that you have it - TO HELL WITH YOU! Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!? Yeah. It could get better. What about us? What about me? The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you. Then he can move! People move! For who? If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize. BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU! I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU! I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong. I told you! I won't apologize for who I am. STOP IT! What do you want me to say? Stop it! How do you know what I experience? What are you doing? I was honest with you. I told you who I was. Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband. Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is - I... What do you want? What? Yes, thanks. Am I too heavy for you? I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden. Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out. Uh-huh. And? You're somewhere else, where? Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. I can't do this, honey. I had a temper. Trouble. Why? No, I don't mind. Because I already tried once. No. I couldn't. He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments. Near the church. I sat outside and had coffee. Nobody's asking you to. Why? It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God. You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas... Have you ever been to that station? How about Bari? How about Italy? What? No. You want to eat something? Are you comfortable? Do you... want to move to the bedroom? Would you like a beer for your bath? How about if I set the table? Can I help? Couple. Want to help? Oh, how is he? Yeah? I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage. Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... The cashier at the general store was very dangerous. I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that. Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea. It's Robert. Okay. See you later. I'll pick you up. Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested... I would love to come for dinner. I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot. Am I interrupting anything? Francesca? No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask. I already apologized. I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions. My mistake. I apologize. Do you want to leave your husband? I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie. That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper. No. But I love them just the same. I told you, I love other people. Not everybody's supposed to have a family. No. I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind. No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly. I'm a loner, I'm not a monk. Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want. I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break. Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much. We're not doing anything wrong, do you. Francesca? Are you all right? Francesca? You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes? I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is... ... so much beauty. This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that? You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out. You want to go back in? You get used to it. No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away. Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root. They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband. This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull. I'm sorry. That was... You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you? Do you miss it? Why did you stop? And did you? Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on. Did you love teaching? No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal. I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions. I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually. Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures. We got engaged. It's still a very sensitive memory for me. She starts sniffing me. Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know. That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks. You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me. Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt. I better go. You sure you're all right? It's been a pleasure. Sincerely. Is the dizziness gone? Feeling better? And clean. Clean? What's he like? Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change. I doubt that. Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure. Must be nice having kids. No, your kids. Oh. How old? As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family? A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet. I thought it was funny. Sure you want to keep those in the house? Mind if I smoke? Sure. Francesca. Robert. Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson. Want another cigarette? I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute... Here it is. Are you by nature a sadistic person? WHAT! Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I? Oh! You caught me. Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one? This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work. Yeah. So, how long you've been living here? Yeah. Excuse me a sec. Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country. Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there. Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy? You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so. How long you been married? After the divorce. Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married. That must be it. It's a great smell. I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it? There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean? Pretty country. If I'm not taking you away from anything. Oh, terrific. Which way? That's it. Yeah.Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky... It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers... ...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino. It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done. Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing. Look at yours. Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers. They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here. So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it. I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History. ...he did what he was told. You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?! Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much. Give me that much at least! I was in the building! Was I at that dinner? Was I at that dinner? Was I at that dinner? Was I at that dinner? Just tell me - He's lying. Liar. I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?! You were never my guest?! Good to see ya. William would you... Hello, Senator. I can't do that. All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should... get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad? Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help? I mean, the heat he brought down is murder! We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that? Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake? First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year. It's a pity in this... I'm serious. No interference. It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way. But what happens when they do find out? But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... He even played golf with the President. A powerful man. As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy. Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing. Hey! Stop - Okay, Randy. Thank you. Congratulations. Oh, good. Fine, fine. How's your family? Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes. ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I - ...been right, but who knows? The worst was Blue. ...stupid things. I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp. Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport. Right back. Right away. 702 472 1862. You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone. I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me. ...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately. Lester... ...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone. Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam... Hello. M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein? You fuckin' piece of shit. You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here. She's my wife. Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me. He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks. But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond. Well... Yeah, sure I do. Why? So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box? No one else, including myself? Ohhh... You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave? When did this happen, honey? I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll - What happened? What happened? Who did this to you? Wh-wh - Amy! Amy, open the door! Hello? Hello! Ginger. Oh. Have a good day at school. Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch. I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch. I'll be right there. She's there with you? She's there with you? ...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is. Well... How'd you know I was here? No, I'm not okay. Nick? Yeah, uh, who's this? Hello. She's driving me fuckin' crazy. I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know... She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy. Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy. And what'd she want? Yeah. I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you. Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you? You're gonna bury us both. What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here! You never - ? ...you? Do you remember what I told you? No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told... Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you. Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right. I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on. What are you - I - Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass. I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody... I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem. I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick. What people? Why? What - what, Caesar's? Yeah. And at the... ...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf. The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care. Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses. Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody. I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it. This guy is gonna run to the FBI. Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy. That's right, yeah. Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that. Okay? ...don't do it to me... Please... I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you. Listen, I would - All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation? Now, what does she have to do with all this? My wife? Yeah. All right. All right. Yes, you lost your control. You lost your control. What happened to me? What happened to you? Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad. Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. That's all taken out of context. Okay. ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it. I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about... I'll be honest with you. I don't wanna come along with you. No, I don't wanna come - Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place. It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand? I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head? What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI. Hey. ...very difficult to get in. It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation. It's... Hello. - no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy. Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them. It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. In so many words, yes. Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is. Nope, there's no way. Yeah, I believe it. You got banned. Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it. I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you. Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you. I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book. You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already. Between... You're still eight pounds over. What's the reason for this? Okay. If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again. So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out. Then he called me a faggot. ...and he tells me to go fuck myself. He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely... No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya. Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place. I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. And I didn't want any of those agents near my place. It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy. ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas. When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message. And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known. Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle. Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit. Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. No, of course not. After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it. Honey, come here. Ginger. Somethin', huh? Hey. I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him. But nobody had to take care of Nicky. While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead. Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. Eight. How did Nicky collect? Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us. I'll take Columbia for twenty. Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it. Where the hell did you learn how to deal? You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me. But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved. ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. No problem. Sorry. Okay, thanks. Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted. I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that. I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him. Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest. I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here. No, that's quite all right. Yeah, I heard a lot about you. How do you do? Seven o'clock. I'll come by. Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right? Well, that's why they paid so well. Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam - Next morning bright and early, I get the call. ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car. This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine. I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas. Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it. And they were usually right. They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened. Half - I'm comin' down. Half of everything is mine. Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff. She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind. Do you unders- You've got to stop her. Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her! Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill? No. Just stop everything. That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris. ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer. She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter. Listen... 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough. I... Why is she eight pounds over? Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'. Okay. Right away. Okay? Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away. Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on. No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten. I'll be right down. Oh, no. What is it? L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life'] I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy. Call security. Why not make them happy? Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants. I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week. I wouldn't give the bum a mop job. We can't get rid of him? For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit... I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work. They had all the pieces they needed. After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway. If she calms down... If she calms down, I will let her in the house. Should I let her in like - ? I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff. I'm afraid to let her in the house. Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you - I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm - I'm not - You'll wake the whole neighborhood! You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that. Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna - Just wait there for me! She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's. You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker. Now you need approval from him to go home? Get the fu- You threatening me? I'll fuckin' kill you in this place! Get up and go home right now. Get up! Get going! Get up! Get - get up! Get - Get up! Get up! And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me? Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house... You want your jewelry? You understand? What? Let you go? You fuckin' whore! You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you. Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch. Let me tell you something. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. Listen, you fuckin' cunt. I should have - I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again, I'll f-, I'll f- ...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind? I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door? Are... I mean, it could get us both killed. What if he won't stop? ...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done. I know you were with somebody. Who was it? I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be. I just hope it's not them. Who were you with? Mm. You know why I want to do it. Just do it. Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line. What did Jennifer have? What'd you have? And where'd you go? So, who'd you go to lunch with? I put her to bed. You threw it away? Hi. You didn't answer your beeper. Get out of here! You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here. You're not takin' Amy. You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here. Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there! Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh? Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch. Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want. You're lower than a dog! I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place! I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch! No kidding. NO KIDDING! Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here! I want you out of here! I want you out of here! Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here. You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now. I'm just tryin' to figure it out. Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what? Around ten thousand? At the most, which is impossible for him. But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand? Yeah. First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days? I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much. The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know. But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. Mm-hm. Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch. Twenty-five thousand for clothes. With the money. So, what'd ya do with it? All right... Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five. That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't. ...the rest of the two million is still there? And... ...twenty-five thousand? It's under... How serious? ...under? What's it... What about the money? Uh, where's the box? Uh, I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know. What do you mean? ...please. That's all I'm askin' you. ...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away... Listen... Hello. Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want? Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes. I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be? Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me. Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I - ...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes. ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on... You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in... How could you say that? You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. You can do it. You can do it. Yes, I - yes, I do. Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones. If not for me, at least for Amy. It's okay. Look... ...you gotta get a hold of yourself. Listen. Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know? I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think - What? What?! Yeah, how do I know? What? Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em? Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too? Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.' You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him? He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.' He didn't say that to you, did he? Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for. You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you? What are you talkin' a- ? Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it? That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that? Huh? Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat? Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for. Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean... Why do you need that much? Twenty-five thousand? For yourself? Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there. What do you need? Okay, want to go with Mommy? ...they didn't know what really moved her. But as much as they loved her... She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her. So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money. Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks. All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Now look, pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important. The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank. You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises? It's nice isn't it? It's chinchilla. Want to go? Let's go back in. You sure? Right? You're with me now. It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right? Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. Why're you crying? You all right? Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you. Want to take a chance? You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine. No, I - I... mean... that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway? It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect... I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. I - I - I... Yeah, I know all that. I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much. And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore. I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family. We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around? Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up. The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be. And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep. ...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything. But mostly... ...pit bosses, floor managers. She took care of the dealers... That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash. Any change? She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money. See you, Ginger. Ginger's mission in life was money. ...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me - We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me. Bullshit! Bullshit! - you could put 'em on your expense account? Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so - What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for? Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a That's amazing. Eight children! How many kids do you have? Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out! Get out! Go on. Let's go. I'll regret it even more if I keep you on. I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin' I'm firin' you, you - Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here. You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win? The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions. It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you! Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win? Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels. Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won! You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on? Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me? Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are? Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this. Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand? The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front. These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off. What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden. What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there. Mr Rothstein. Green? Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing. I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go? That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches. I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance. ...worst possible time for me. All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want? Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand. So, you're a righty? Can you do it with your left hand? Can't do it with both hands? I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands? We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over. I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost. Is this yours? Your pen? Excuse me. Get out of here. You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw? We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it? And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?Thanks, Nick. I didn't give 'em the m- Yeah. A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money. That's what I did. ...I got muscled on the street. When I left here with the money...Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures. [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey. You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission. A record of the arrests...No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't. Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife. That's right. Now this is just a signature card.You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me. Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes? You gotta go back out there. What expenses? You gotta go back there and talk to that guy. Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?Ace, listen to me. No, Ace. What can I do? I-I'm sorry, Sam. Yeah, refill'd be great. Sam? You can't talk to me like... What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me? Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss. Well, I've been busy. Hi. Good. Yes. You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss. Yeah, that works out.Speeding? Hold on a second. Wait, hold on a second. All right, take care. Yeah. Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again. No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this? No, you're not calm. Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here. Watch it, partner, watch it! Excuse me. Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' - I can't. Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca- Go get a bag, man. Jeff, would you go in with her? That's not a problem, that's not a p- Please. I understand. Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise. Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh! Hey. She's on the account. There's nothing we can do. Okay. Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house. All right. Okay, okay. Hey! ...fuckin' jerk-off. You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you... Pitch-black?! It -There's nothing we can do. She had the key. Come on. I'm sorry. If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair. Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things? That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway. Hey! Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry. It looked like a fuckin' gun! What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.You've gotta be kidding me! Leave me alone! You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with? You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?! Fuck you! Fuck you! Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you! Nicky, I'm sorry. I did - I didn't - Nicky, I did -It's instinctive, you know. You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does. Now go out there and show your dad what you can do. Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game. Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.Great! Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you. Yeah. Fuck him. Fuckers! Is that the last one?Carmine's gone. He's gone? We're waiting on Carmine. Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? Carmine left? Oh. Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?We can't help him if - Stay out of the way! Calm down! Calm down!We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a - We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting - We're - we're placing you under arrest for -There was nothing to it. It was my pleasure. No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children. ...Well, I've got a large family.Seven o'clock? Okay. You come by the house? You see? Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week? Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan? Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it? Okay. Frankie, you're a good boy. You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand? I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me. I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky. Are you sure? Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem. I want you to tell me the truth, mind you. It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth. Frankie, I want to ask you something. You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better. And I mean... that's no good. It's in all the papers. Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it. Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that? E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!'] ...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand? Fine, fine. Hey, Frankie. And how are things going down there? Uh-huh. Good. Fine. Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you'] Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains. Okay? Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him. T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] Ace. That's enough now! Ma che cazzo! You got a round figure on it?I'm a little in shock, quite frankly... Why are you doing this to me? I can't believe you're doing this. What are you talking about? What? This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town. There's gotta be a way to work him back in. But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner. Thank you.Come on! Yes. Yes. Get lost, Ginger! Get lost! That bag's full of fuckin' chips you Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me. What money? I've seen you stealing from me. What's the matter? Ginger, honey. I'm sorry. Thank you. Very nice.Yes, don't worry. They checked in alone. ...they're in Penthouse K. Listen...He's not here? Carmine left? Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine. Oh.Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off? Yeah, that's my pen. Why? What?You got it. Schmuck. All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick? I'll call you right back. Mm-hm. 1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b- So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes? Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay? Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't... She's not here, Sam. Hello. Hey, little Dale Evans. Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck? Okay. Yeah, yeah. I know that. Yeah. Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing. Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay? No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face. You know where she gets this from! Shut your mouth! We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay? Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right? Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about. Huh? Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl- No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy - You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive. She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here. 'Go! Go! Go!' You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now? It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know. He's sittin' by the phone - Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I - I just talked to him. He was just on the phone. Right. Don't give me any of your shit! Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going. We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk. You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back? You got money. That's a - That's a good look. What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean? Every time I ever see you, that's what I see. - with stupid braces on your teeth. Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security. Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas. ...all the luck in the world. God... I wish you... So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it? That's right. Do you know that? Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too? Don't make me come there. Answer me. You are. No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you? Okay?I understand. No problem. He's good. He's fine. Hm. I'm positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know? No. I ain't see anything like that. So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too. Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business. What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed. I always tell you the truth, Remo. Of course, Remo. I'll tell him, Remo. I know. What're you gonna do? I know. Yeah, I heard, yeah. I'll take care of it, Remo. How are you? Take him out! Take this motherfucker out! No more fuckin' dirty work! Fuck you, you motherfuck! No more! You see? Watch! Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right? You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy. Take it easy! Whoa. Calm down. Calm down, calm down. Shh! Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint. Don't know. Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about? Yeah. They'll do it. Angelo and Buster. Oh, he ain't nobody. What? Yeah, but they keep askin' about it. I know. I know. Nah. You would've heard somethin'. I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up. He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. You must have drunk too much. Let's get out of here. He's here. They're havin' a good time too. Mm. It's up to you. Yeah, but they're complaining. Yeah, thanks a lot. Fine. Everything's goin' good. Nicky sends his warmest regards. Remo. This is Nick. And this is Stacy. Hey. This is Shelly. I took care of everybody. She asleep? What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds? This peter's a motherfucker. Get up. Get up. Smarten up. Of course. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, how come I laid nine?Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here. She didn't know who to turn to. She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage. Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right? Yeah, she's here. Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me. ...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute. Well... Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay? It's me. Sammy. Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know? But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh? I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back. I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right? She was afraid to call you. I just told you. She called me. Ginger called me. Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy. Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker. Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me! That's the only reason! Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?! You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you! Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you - Back - Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it? You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself. Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television! You wanted to go on TV. You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?! They think you went batshit! I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?! Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible! You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?! No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal! What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out? Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head? Don't ask questions. Just be there. ...hundred yards further down the road. No, a... Meet me at three. Practice enough this week, you prick? I see you, you motherfuckers. Peekaboo, you fucks, you. The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too. Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself... Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal. A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me. It's none of my business? And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out? She came to talk to me... ...to me. Hey, she came to talk... The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point. Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident. Yeah. You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife. ...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?! A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore. I lost control? Yeah. What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me? Yeah? Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad. Yeah, that's out of context. Okay. You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.' That's quiet? Fine. All right, fine. Just say so. You should say so. Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license. You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it? Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know! If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way. Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time. You think he got the point? Hey, Ace. Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine. No, no it's okay. Listen... Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot? Hey, Rich. I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em. In other words, I'm fucked. Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like? Motherfucker. Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this? ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas... and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.' Do you believe this shit? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? All right. What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all. That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone. Why, somebody's complaining? Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right? So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him. But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons. Thanks, pal. All right, Ace? I'm sorry about this. Really. What? Ho- Hey, come here. What? No. So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place? Four aces, Doc. ...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players. To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers. It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him. With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her - Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand? Yeah, right, I'm sure. Ohh! But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to? So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose. Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything. I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there. Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home. You mean, I have your permission? What do you think about me movin' out here? What's the matter? You got a problem with that? Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here? Yeah. Okay, Sammy. ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim. You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you. Listen... What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?! What happened to the fuckin' tough guy? Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?! If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight. It was eight. Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game. They payin'? If his girlfriend was knocked up. He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon. You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that. ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it. Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night. Matter of fact... Yeah, thanks. Fuckin' kids at home! Here. Get the fuck out of here. Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?! You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?! No, no? You didn't? You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off? Yeah? Mm. Mm. Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal. I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso. Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep. You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what? I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail. That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it. Yeah. I think I want my money back. Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though. I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President. No, I don't want one. Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'? Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash. I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark? So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker. Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere. But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right? You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you! You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand? Go over there and apologize. Go! Get the fuck out of - Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick! Fuckin'... Is that what you did? You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself? He tries to do everything... Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born. ...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know. Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'... Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great. He's comin' over. Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck? Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem? Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to. I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me. ...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant. Oh, thanks, Eddy. I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know. Uh-huh. Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left. Yeah, I'm over here with him. I'm over here now. But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out... Want me to take this for you? Yeah. All right. Mm. Mm. I'll be right out. Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world. I mean, unless Ace made his bet. But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost. Definitely the most important guy in this room. Okay, yeah. All right. Be careful. All right, all right. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out! How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?! Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut! Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol- Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you? I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you? Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it. I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb- I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death. What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef? I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him. It's what you want? Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh? Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya. A sponsor. Is that what you want? Come on. Don't be scared. Yes, you are. Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this. Don't cry. He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that. Everything went to his head. Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he? Yes, you did. You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing. You did. You're right. No, he wouldn't. I would have. And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously. Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off. Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too. Hm. You know? See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust. Let me think about that. Yeah. Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead. What were you gonna say? Go ahead. What? What? I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere - And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay. I'll be there. You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do. You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear? It's all right. Yeah. Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy. You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff. And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse. All right? Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him. Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried. I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens. Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace. I know what you mean. Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what? No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all. You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much? I can see that. Sure. Sure. I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does. You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but... Oh, you did? I didn't know that. Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you. I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but - Okay, Sammy. Pleasure. Very nice to meet you. All right. Are they out now? They check in alone? - back to Nigeria. Yeah. All right. Boy, look at this place, huh? Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you? Oh, there aren't? What's that? Huh? What's that. There's no more. Thanks, hon. Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know. There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more. There's more! Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her. What a smart kid you are! Okay, eat. Why? You know why, right? Two? How many of these you gonna eat, huh? No, no, no, no! Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit! Frankie! I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot. I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad. Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here. Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out! Get out. Get out! Get out! Shh. Hide her car in the back! Dominick said they're in the motel? Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at? And you make it disappear, you know what I mean? And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.' Yeah, but I'm not sure yet. You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at. Who's this guy? Who's this guy? Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'. I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do? I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know? Yeah, what's to stop him? You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back? Yeah, what'd you tell him? Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say? Go fuck yourself. What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'. Sue me, you Jew fuck! You should pay as fast as you collect, you know. So are we. Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they? They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready. I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him. Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here. But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back. ...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop. But he never talked. ...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs... I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together. ...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions. Pleasure. Stacy. Hey, Shelly. You walk past me? Yeah? Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that? Every night, on the couch. I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff. Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs. What's takin' so long over there? Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around. You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in. Come here, come here. ...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here. You jag-off. You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'? Ace saw Vegas one way. Hold it, hold it. Here. 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten... Kill you, You motherfucker you! Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor. Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker! Charlie M? Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name! This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights! Fuck me? Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on. Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony. Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?! Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money! You're a little confused? I'm positive. I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it. All right, yeah. You got that thing for me? How you doin'? Tony.Mr. Chairman - Denying? No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here? Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records. Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on? Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip. What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.] I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.] ...done right, you gotta do it yourself. ...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth. You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this. All right, all right. But I - I - I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth. You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me? Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right. Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset. ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel. I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes... I'm sorry. I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'. Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head. I'm sorry. Receipts and bills and... everything's here. Oh, sorry -Here we go! Now move along. Yeah? Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy! Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?Yes, you were. You were in the m- You were in the building. You were wandering around. You were wandering around. You were wandering around. The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein. Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point. Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time. That's right. I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers. Hey, I need a room. Need a room. Hi, Ace. Do I hear a motion seconded? ...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application. Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...I-I'll do it. Okay. Just take it easy. Who's this? He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted. He wants a fifty-thousand marker. Now, he's really pissed. The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we... Sam, we got a problem. Here we go. Good luck. To Abraham Lincoln. This woman's an institution. Fuckin' asshole won't budge. We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite. Certainly. Senator. Nice to see you, Senator. He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin. We need this guy. ...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room... You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need... Having a good time? Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh? Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.It's always been our policy - But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired. ...and she doesn't always - Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows... ...position... ...trying to offer you the respect that your... Well, sir, I was just... Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out. They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere. What do you propose? The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.' And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run! These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from - He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this? He's out of his fuckin' mind. Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it. You got it. Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license. You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog. ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers. On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . . Philip, if you would rise. This is a very auspicious occasion.My fuckin' head. I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it. Yeah. Well, I'm a little confused here. You sure? What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'. How you doin'? Hey.Kill me, you fuck, kill me. Charlie M. Ch-Charlie M! Fuck you!This is not the way to treat people. You might regret this, Mr Rothstein. You're firin' me? I really think you're overreacting in this whole - I really think you're - Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes. Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam. Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you. Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more. Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry. I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you. All right, I will, I will. Yeah, okay. Well... Okay, I'll - Loose machines are right back over there. It won't happen again, Sam.You bet. Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. Thank you for your time. Well, could there be any position... further down the trough? You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar. But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back. Are, uh - - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro? Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges. Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines... and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired. Hey, house is doin' well. Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant. Oh, thank you, sir. Hey, it is my pleasure. Mr Rothstein... I'm Pat Webb.Thank you. Yeah. I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake. I just wanna get out of here. Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland... Can I get my winnings? Yes, uh... Hi. Yeah.It's good medicine. Open space. She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years. I didn't used to think it was real... You threatened to drive her downtown. She has agoraphobia. Now look what you did. Only kidding! Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs? Hal has it. But alive ! It's almost six. And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved. Sorry, Luv. I've got a date. I know. Do come and meet your guest. Look out for her. She's tougher than you think. The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay? I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us. Then, why don't you just die. I'm going. They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on. Make up your mind. Live or die. I'll get coffee. When are you going to call them? You slut ! No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair. What? What'd I do? I wouldn't. He'll be back. If you want him. The cute brutal type with handcuffs. Very sexy. No, dear. You're at your best with a bag in front of your face. Okay. You win. 'Dirty Harry' coming up. Oh my God! Help! HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER! Cellulite. What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym. Aerobics with housewives... Monsieur Andy can smell your coiffure. And guess what else? When was the last time you washed your hair? He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you. Did you give him an approval? A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for. Forget it. Are you kidding? You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which rots ... to garage a fleet of stretch limos. Well! Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door? The antenna is gone off her car again. I had no music, all the way to the market. Let me find a garage for it? Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah? What happened to the newspaper? Gaahhd! What a cop ! You busted me! The new one, in the Marina. She has a police radio scanner. It's always on. She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again. She's obsessed. She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it. She just got to sleep. Do you have to tell her about it now? Hey, no. Leave those here. If you really want her help. I mean if you really do, leave them. Let her see them. I'll see they're safe... Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep. It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark. We know, don't we, Princess? Give her a couple of hours. I know about this. Are you staying long? Shall I shut the door? Make your coffee? Make the beds? I'm okay. I really kind of enjoyed it.And you believed him when he told you he had done that. When was that? What first two murders. We don't know about them here, do we? What pattern was that? You said, first, he was lying. How do you know that, Doctor? 'Lying. He was lying.' I asked you what you thought, not what he did. Only part. What else? What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it. Without question? He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria? Couldn't another expert say he flunked the sexual sadist test? What curve are you marking on, Doctor?What day is this? In jail you lose track. This week. Friday. No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing. We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday. He's gonna hand me 500 bucks. Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away. I don't have it... Tell me what you want me to say. Anything. You get me out first. I never carried a gun! I never hurt nobody... I was? How you spell that? Who are you? She's supposed to have it. The door was already open... Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it. They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow. It has all about how he tried to kill her. I'm trying to tell you. It's on the lady's pillow... The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs... I brought a present for the lady, there. I'm looking for her, to give her the present...That Klutz. They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good. Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he? Damn! I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy! I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you. You come and visit. Listen, you want my advice? Steer clear. He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk. I'm offended. Right away I smell freak . Writin' about him and me and you bein' joined and he's gonna finish my symphony ? I didn't care for his drift. I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways. You hear I found Jesus? And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside. If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again. It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think? Something personal. Is he bothering you? Kurten! Is he bothering you? I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone. Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps. It's real well- written. You should read it -- you're in it. I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you? That son of a gun...! You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago. You read it yet.Lieutenant Quinn. Well, there's something missing in there. There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now. No. I didn't. Michael Johnson. I was.Don't ever forget how good you are. I heard. Good police work. Who gives a fuck? In all the years I never seen you cry. You loved him. Christ. I didn't lock the fucking drawer! You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself... You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead. Every time... Want to hear something weird? I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back. Doped up kids all over town. Park was full of them last night. Very easy pickin'. Goetz's type. Yeah, you did that too. You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying. Yeah. And you used that. Used me You're shitting ion your career. You outrank hi... It's none of my business anymore... Working late. You're a damn fool. Not what I meant; why me ? What am I wasting my time with this shit for? I don't want the job. Don't do that to her. She's worked too damned hard for it. She knows I'm Catholic! She never mentioned divorce! Not once! We were together six years, sir! He's not treating her right...Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor? That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick. So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you? Death is the only cure for people like me. Oh, please. I know what's coming, now. "Let me help you..." I don't have the talent for any of those things. All I have a talent for is death. And I am one of a kind. What do you think of your student now? I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument. Why did you do that? Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far? I worshipped you. You inspired me. I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others. I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you. We'll keep talking. Until they get here. Then... Don't talk to me about courage. I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear. You chocked. I know something else about you. No. Not yet. You know where. I don't care -- she's a cop. That's the important thing. Cop-ness, not sex-ness. It won't be perfect, but it'll be good. I need her; she's a cop. I have to kill a cop, and then... Oh, I think you will. Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me. What was that? What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight? You thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner... You like that action? Didn't that cop on TV look solemn ? The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart. Hi. It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor? She lies all the time. Why would I say I fed her if I didn't? Yes, I fed her. If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you. Again. Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things... "Spokes person ." So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops? You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself. There's something I want you to think about. The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive. To what end? You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop. Go get drunk. I am. Nikko? Saks. If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is. You have no authority to make a deal like that. That' s for the D.A... How'd you get in on the deal? You got a suspect... I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor. What's keeping those bums at Immigration? Nightmare in here... Just, I need results. And -- I am short-handed. Who else am I gonna give him? Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline. M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben. The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car. I gotta give Ruben to Nikko. What the hell you need her for? Where you going? Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on? You got no discipline in your operation. Christ. How old are you? You sure you want to be in this line of work? So what have we got? With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help. They bury you with help. Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus. Thing is, you saw it, the pictures. What? I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk. I can't believe this guy. Saks. He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!" Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat. I know. Get out here. Who've I got to beat up except the messenger? Does this give us anything to go on? You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib? Sergeant? How about I put Nikko on it? I'm telling you. Don't you ever address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and who I tell you to work. Would you step outside, Sergeant? What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson. Work the clues. There was no sperm. We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead! Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass. This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love. The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose. You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer. I said you were... I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost. We're sequestering that evidence. That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into... Shut up. What's going down with the sting in Chinatown? That gonna be off your plate in a week or what? Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying. She was just long-term leasing' you. Ah, Nickie. Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish. Plus I got real problems. I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J. There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position. But the thing is, how can I move you in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole? Don't give me six years! You never divorced Patty, did you? So what'd you expect from M.J.? She left you, Nikko. She's not your responsibility. She takes very good care of herself. If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business. Your business is to snap out of it.A little homeopathic cure for the willies. Fear of what... What did I do? I hate this... None of your fucking business. She don't want it. We know... Send the book to evidence... He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad? You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering. Where is it? You break into her apartment to deliver a gift? Where is it? Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again... You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer. Stay put. You know how to use this? I know, baby. I know. Open the door. Please. They all have one... Yes. What ?... Yes. I have to go... I'll get a locksmith. Shhh. It's okay. Just breathe. I'll fix it... Tell me what to do! The problem for me is... you're in the witness category. Know what I mean? No. I'm shy and I'm selective. Not yet. We're through for the night, aren't we? You go on. Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home. MaryJane. We call her M.J. I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran. It just did that... Let me get a little action started here. He's hacked into her Internet address. He's a hacker. The Boston Strangler, when was that...? You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown. I'll drive you down... Daryll Lee Cullum? I don't think so. If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers. You'd have a guard on your front door. I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day. Talk to Nikko...! The woman was in shock. She was totally out on ranks. I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack. Stop that, you son of a bitch! The place wasn't secure. I was doing my goddamn job! And, for the second time , I slept in her living room. She wants me to check the phone booth for a note. What's Abba? It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless? Who's... Excuse me? Excuse me ?! What do you... Look at him, grandstanding... You're right. I can't stand that bastard. Sorry. This is something new. Not the same guy, that's for sure. Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here. She's blue as hell. No marks on her neck. Asphyxiated? not the same -- no ligature marks. Outdoors... Needle marks, fresh, here. look at this... She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails. I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions... Is Niccoletti assigned here? Absolutely. You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape... You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that? I like women like that! Nada. Lemme make the call. What's wrong with him? You came in there with this attitude... Classy madonna. It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody. You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs? I'm sure she thinks it is. Aren't you at least interested in which one it is? Yeah, but she had divine guidance.You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over... Just get out of your vehicle... Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle... We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone. I know you won't mention it. She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for. Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement. Who prescribes the brandy? We know Helen. She's not exactly a credible collaborator. Especially late in the day... I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note. We don't see too many lady homicide detectives. You have my respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson? Hello. I am Meryhew Saks. The song is called "Murder By Numbers." The performers are a group called The Police. Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note. This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers. We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims. We have a team sweeping sperm banks. Now I want to say a few word to you local people. Your Commissioner asked for our assistance. The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year. We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy. Together we can be unbeatable. Which one is Inspector Halloran?Don't move! It's not cool. It's commie bullshit! You think it's cool? Cool? Listen to this bullshit. "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."Secret Service! It's cool! Yeah, cool. Now that's cool. Alright sir. I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files. It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.How are you going to take care of the cops? That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal. See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show. Let's keep her. Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait! And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap... As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder. Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters. Hack the Planet!Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth. Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something. Right. Shh! So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight? Yeah but oh man, wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh! Oh yeah? What's that? What's that? What's that? A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens. Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus? Snoop onto them... Ta-da! That's far out! Oh man. That's universally stupid, man! Looks like a hacker wrote it. Hold on a second! Super hero like even. Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo! Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight? Difficulty rating? Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark. Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho. I'm gonna hit you! It was him, man! Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff? Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing. Stupid, man. It's universally stupid. ...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks. Roger. Yeah? Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright? Well this hasn't happened yet. You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six. Oh wow, we are fried. Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things. What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.What? I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry. The sensitive type. Was that her top? Shit! What is it with this guy? Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door. The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf. Dragon book. Compiler design. Devil book. The Unix Bible. Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date. Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus. Dead. Yeah? Display? Did you talk to him? You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is? And what's he do? Who's that? Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass. No. No one special. Revenge. Hmmm. Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin! Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet. Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please? Mm-hmm. I'm taking over a TV network. Yeah, mom? I found it! I found it! Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole. I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone. You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you. That's bullshit. I told you, I don't play well with others. Blow me. Shit! Come on! Nah. I don't play well with others. I'm sorry. Who are you? We did it! Oh, shit! He got me. Okay. Let's go shopping. Fucked if I care, man. And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about... It nibbles. You see this? This isn't a virus. It's a worm! Burn! How did you know that? Razor and Blade. What's going on? No. Crash Override. You know, I've been having these really weird.. They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite. Wanna go for a swim? You look good in a dress. Yeah. What? I'm trying to help you. Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time. Yeah. It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money. Razor and Blade! They're flakes! Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson. Shit!! I'll hack the Gibson. I'll make it up to you! I got a record. I was Zero Cool. I didn't know what was on it. This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me. I know, I know who wrote it. Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started. And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around. This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas. I have to tell you something. Kate, listen. Okay. I'll copy it. I'm sorry, I can't. Do my ears deceive me? And you have to smile. Make it our first date. And if I win? Your slave? Name your stakes. Yeah. You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste? Yeah. RISC is good. Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that. It has a killer refresh rate. Yeah? It's cool, I'm just looking. I'm Crash Override. Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV! I said give me time. Pool on the roof must have a leak. I'll give it a shot. That's a nice score for a girl. Yeah! Sure. My... class. You mean I'm not in your class? It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there... Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques. Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem? Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari... Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers? Homicidal? Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office. Excuse me.The System Command Processor, it's the brain. A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer. It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do? There's a new virus in the database. The rabbit is in the administration system. We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files. I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23. Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker. Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net. Mr. Belford?I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me? Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know. Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from... Love, secret, and uh, sex. But not in that order, necessarily, right? You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right? Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around... Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh? I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle. What? whatwhatwhat? Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...What's up, man? I'm the Phreak! So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual? Sorry, I can't help you, okay? Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.Damn! Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts. ...as they snoop onto us. Yo, brain dead, the manual! This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha! Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit! Yo, man, you an amateur, man. Look at this, it's so lean and clean. Very impressive. I want it. Again? Yeah sure. Yes! Joey's getting stupid busy. Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man. Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes. They'll trace you like that man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun. Two days. What's this one eat? Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software! I got photographic memory. It's a curse! Lisa! Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM! That's Razor and Blade. Yo, showtime, showtime! Never heard of you. Done anything?212-555-4240. Uhhhmm... Uhhh.. ahahaha... Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh... Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.Just one moment. What number please? Hello, operator services. Thank you.One-handed! Yo, hit the lights. I want it to have my children! Do you think he could hack a Gibson? His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust? You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit. Cereal, man, you owe me a pack. Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron? Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit. What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything? Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things. Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round. Dead? Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem! Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. He isn't to consort with his computer friends. The secret service is really out to get him. Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go? No, don't know who he is. Do you? That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day. Curtis. Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man. Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on. Yo, what's up? Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords? D'you bring those Crayola books? You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless. You know, you're right about that. Check it, Friday. One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it... Joey, Joey... Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time? I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys. Hey, it's me. Any questions? Relax, Burn, he's my guest. I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop! Thank you. 555-4202. Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number. Nonono, thank YOU!This is the end, my friend. Thank you for calling! Give it up! Just give it up. Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence. You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit. Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay? Talk to me. Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them! What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched. Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears. Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file. The girl. The girl has the disc I need. Thank you! I'm fine. Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay? Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love. I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies? Loser. I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you. What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again! Good. Hello? Gill. Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it. Gill. No. He's either very smart or very stupid. Die, dickweeds! Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display! Let's echo 23, see what's up. Never fear. I is here. As in what, you hapless techno-weenie? My name is the Plague. Send a Flu-shot. Nothing, it's just a minor glitch. No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money. Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away. Not everything. But enough to implicate us. So, we get the mother, we get the boy. From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm. The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans. I just hacked into it. I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC. Sh, sh sh sh sh. Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm. Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars. I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own. I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file. Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it. The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility. Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks. A hacker planted the virus. Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love, sex, secret and... ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password? Once again, don't call me Eugene. A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.Hackers of the World, Unite! She's rabid, but cute. Waste the dude. ...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons! Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back! Welcome to our show!Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour. Thirty-five bucks. You haven't paid the cab. He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him. Mister D'Amour?Hey, anytime. Actually, no. This was enough. I'm out of here, man! Are you coming? Knew what? Trickery and divinity. Yeah, he says that all the time. I mean, there's no instructions-- What do you mean, they're not tricks? Take a look at this. doorway) And who's that? I could have lost my fucking hands. Nope. I love weird. Why? You ever been married? I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe. It'll be something hokey. I'm sure they'll have this place rigged. I think maybe he taught Swann. This is me. See ya around. Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix. Nix. I've heard a name. Someone they talk about in whispers. I gotta be careful. If Vinovich sees me talking to you. He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.For now. Are you planning to go back to New York? Another fucking magician. Jesus. And this Butterfield guy-- After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones. Where the fuck is he? New one on me. Okay. Let's see him. What makes you so sure? Tapert. So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield. What were you doing up there?You bet. Hello, L.A. Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled. How much? Yeah? Yeah. It's French. Thanks, Billy. Hokey enough for you? That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew. What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between -- Maybe they're not tricks. A Nix specialty? That's Butterfield... That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle. Which was presumably the idea. These are about Nix. Billy? This was on Miller's forehead. Any idea what it is? My life was too weird for her. Yeah. She was killed in a car crash. Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce. You heard right. How? Who is he? Nix? Who? They go together. Right. Right. D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry D'Amour. All right. It was... I told you -- Deep shit? Beats me. You did. Didn't you? Out! Out! What the fuck? I think so. I'm okay. I'm okay. I... have... to. ...yes? ... oh... God... No! No! No! Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot. I've got to help him. Hang on! It's all right. It's not hurting... Find Valentin! Find him! Get him in here! It's okay. Quaid and Jennifer-- And they all came... I'm sure. He's dead. Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now. Nothing you don't want. Nothing's going to happen to you. I'm here, aren't I? It's okay. He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he? What then? You said you weren't with him for love. Too much fame. Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours. So Swann was performing magic. not illusions? And what? You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions. He taught all this to Swann? Stuff? He was the real thing, right? Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal? Why don't you tell me the truth? Jennifer Desiderio, for one. She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon. I didn't leave. I was just digging around. Okay. I'll keep digging. What about Jennifer Desiderio? Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea? So why did you marry him? You didn't marry him for love. Why? Because he had you? I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right. He didn't have a lot of fans up there. Forget the fee. If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money. If I don't... ...my gamble. Either way... I get to spend some time... here. I can be very persuasive. Well... how about some of the other illusionists? I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look... Are they treating you okay? He's good. Sure. Do you? When do you want me to start? I'm no bodyguard. Harry. Where do I sign? Sorry. You asked. He's an illusionist. It's not exactly brain surgery. But obviously you still care what happens to him. Does that mean...? And you don't ask questions? Why not? What's the connection? You don't? Did your husband know Quaid? No. Not yet... Are you finished with me? --vanished. He got up and walked. I got a file on him two inches thick. He's a petty fraudster. This is something else. Ever heard of someone called the Puritan? Tapert's got nothing to do with this. He came here to get his palm read. I'm a private detective. I was hired to follow somebody for a few days. A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud. Great accent, by the way. Is it Brooklyn? With what? Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared? I'd like to hear them. You tell me. No? I thought you'd maybe have a theory. I heard he was the best. What about Swann's miracles? So could you walk on water? Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real? Heaven and Hell? You believe that? What about? Shut up. We've lost enough lives already. We've got to get you to a hospital. Shit... I want to see Swann face to face. Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake. Was that Swann's idea? And then... because I was getting too close to something -- --or someone, you called Swann You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes? You rigged the illusion to fail, right? No. Shut up! Yeah, I know. When will she be in? I want to speak to Dorothea. No. I like to know why things happen. Fuck regrettable! I want to know why. Left alone? Somebody's been murdered. You didn't hire me. She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her. What for? Why'd you come here? What the fuck are you doing here? Who is she? Are you sure? It's not a bad place. Warm. Great view. Any movie stars buried here? What's the difference? When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician. I saw him in Vegas once. Philip Swann? Havanas. You're not the smoker. So who is? Somebody's been smoking in here for months. Nah. You're driving it too carefully. Whose is the car? I'm going back to New York in-- Shit! I'm outta here. Then what do you want? Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay? I get a few drinks inside me -- What are you, my mother? Go away. Shit. And what does Jennifer think's real? Does anybody? What's her problem? I won't say anything. A Mister Quaid? Who is he? The Puritan? Hold on. Not much. Yeah. You could say that. What? You need an ambulance. Have you been in? Are they all in the business? I only wear ties for funerals. Well... nobody. For what? I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys. Sure. Vivovich. Not the Walter Wilder? Was he taking a lot of risks? I'm in from New York. I came to see Swann. Harry D'Amour. That. Where'd you learn that? Try. Can you do it? He did something with the ground. You didn't try hard enough. Fuck. Jesus... what the hell's going on in there? In my time, and nobody else's. Nobody's better off this wav! ... no... They got here before us. Jesus! Who else did? Did Valentin? Did she know where Nix was buried? And you believed him? Is that all? And he didn't have them? And you're not? Is that all? Didn't know you read minds. Oh Jeez. Help me. And she shot him I I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix. So Nix won't come looking for her? Oh yeah? Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now. That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it? Or murdered, like Nix. You know, it's such a fucking waste. You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick. I don't think so. You need me alive. How the fuck do you do that? Look, Ma, no wires. A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive. What? A couple of weeks. There's other guys as good as me, Loomis. I got to go. I'm late. No. I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation. And he's dead? Is he the Puritan? Who's not? Swann? What is? Why's that? What about Philip Swann? Well, you didn't forget me. I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield. No.Who is she? One question. Yeah. But not as cheap. Call me. Call me tomorrow. You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on? The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession. Get your ass back to Mew York.What about death? About? What do you mean, "all of us?" He won't. No. He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you. I saw him on T.V. Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life. I know him. I saw him.Liar! Wait... you still feel something for that bitch? But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was. You know I'll kill you when we're done. I have to. The woman has a new love in her life. Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me Because you've got nothing else to live for. You could still help me do that. I should have been honest with you, right from the start. I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways. I was born to murder the world. Swann? What are you doing? You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit? You don't think I've got it to give? I've got so much power to give you, Swann. All you have to do is...beg.Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm. Yes. Yes. Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there. Ask Pimm. Yes... I'm not afraid to die. There's something terrible... coming home... You can't change it. You have to walk... ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell. It's your destiny. Accept it. You're drawn to the dark side, over and over. And it's drawn to you. You don't like that. You've taken some strange journeys in your life. My God. Too late. Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?No. I'm not going near him. I'm putting in a new illusion tonight. Will you be there? I just saw him. Somebody killed him. Yeah. Remember Quaid? The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it's magic... I don't know. Yes? I can't... I can't go any further... This is where we killed him. At a guess... they just resurrected him. That's where we're all going. You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour. He's better off this way. Looks that way. Yes. No. I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick. No illusions. Just the truth. Are you ready for that? No. At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone. Jelly. Shit... He had something. He showed me how to bend the rules. A little levitation. A few fireworks. Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe. That's why I liked Nix. He promised me all these explanations. I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service. It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die. I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that. So I like playing games with people. Gives them something to wonder about... You think I'm an asshole. Will that do? No? I don't know what else to do. It's me betrayed him. Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her. I did it for Dorothea. He deserved it. Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour. Magicians get burned. Why? So you can fuck my wife? Now I'm going to have to kill you. You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour. They'll never find out. No! Yes. Yes. Not true. Why would I want to? And? Binding you. Don't touch me. He's got... got into my head. No! Fuck you.Oh yes. We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together. She has no real grip on reality. Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever. Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know. And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told. Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.Oh Christ! Oh Christ! I swear... this is the place Swann told me about. The rocks... Not yet. I'll tell you. I don't know. Don't. Please. Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann. I left three messages already. It's better he's gone. He would have done more harm than good. Crank call. I'll get the number changed. Good. There. Yes? ... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more. I'm sorry, D'Amour... Don't bother. Him too. Help me. D'Amour -- Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over? Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter? No. It was mine. I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after. I tried to pay you off. Yes. Yes. Are you satisfied now? Leave her alone -- You want more money, is that it? I can't let you in. I'm afraid she's not in. Why people die? Give it up, D'Amour. Go home. What for? You need to stay busy? Yes. It's regrettable She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain. Enough churning over the past. She wants it all left alone. A ticket home, You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief. Here's thirty thousand dollars. Looking for you. I tried the hotel. Swann's wife. Are you a believer, then? I don't think the dead much care. Probably. Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real. Never call him that. He's strictly an illusionist. Are you a gambling man? You know of him? You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world. Maybe I just bought it. Mine. Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day? I'm here to offer you a job. We've never met. I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour. About last night. It's one in the afternoon. Mr. D'Amour?No. There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer. That's what they call the Repository. Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room. It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation. You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists. Except most of us aren't gentlemen. For an introduction. People are pretty cagey. Who do you know? He knew Swann way back. He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit. You know Vinovich? You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way. What a tragedy. It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business. I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you. At birth. I don't know you -- What?Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." What's the difference? What's that, Sol? For me? I'll have the same thing. Huh? Uh... My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale. Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you? What do you mean? And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you? Anything for art, eh, Paul? I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed. I guess so. I never thought of it that way. Yeah, probably. Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was. Okay. So this is the story of how it happened. Okay. It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial. A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first.... Okay. You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far? Ready. Any time you are. You got it. Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? Good? Of course. Are you kidding? I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true. Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em. That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record. Ah-hah. You usually get two. Two, right? Hey, man, how's it going? We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning. It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor. Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things. Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time. That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away. Not a peep. Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you. Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds? Fuck you, kid. You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew. He's crazy. If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself? Yeah, well, I'm sorry too. It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life. Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales. Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind? How old, kid? So, what brings you to a dive like this? Hey, man, good to see you. Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work. Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace. They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle. I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures. You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend. I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot. It's my project. What you'd call my life's work. That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather. That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time. It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you. It would be an honor. Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap. Taking pictures? It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one. That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am. I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman. Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby. It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time. Yeah, I did. No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything. You run out of Schimmelpennincks? Seven eighty-five out of twenty. Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do. The Queen of England? The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think? Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today? There's just one thing I want to know. Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber. For keeps. It's all yours, baby. Five thousand bucks. Why don't you open it and find out? No, bully for you. Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush. No you're not. Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs. She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up. Still, you can't just write her off. So you're just going to give up and go home? Jesus Christ. This is all I need. Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves. And what's that supposed to mean? Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter. Yeah, like what? I think you'd better stop the car and let me out. You what? Where to? You don't give up, do you? I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth. Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time. Fifteen years ago? It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know. Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days? You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby. A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity. You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first. Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper. That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill. You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now? I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name. Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now. Was that your idea to call her Felicity? Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter. Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it? Like what? All right, sugar, what's on your mind? You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that? Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears. At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people. And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook? No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful. What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin? Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred. Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead. Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address. They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail. It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail? It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks. Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars. Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers. Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway. I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first. She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape. She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel. Ruby McNutt. My one true love. I almost got married once. I don't know. Maybe because I love you so much, boss. I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that. No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control. I could run this store in my sleep. Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name. You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that? Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for? And why the hell would you give me money? Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp. It's probably stolen anyway. What is this, some kind of joke? For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag? This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we? I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay? Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out. Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella? Of course it hurts. What does it look like? Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess. ... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me? When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open! That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again. It'll never be finished. How'd you do out there, Jimmy? Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it? Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke. It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you? Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid. A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out. Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain. Fifty-six. That girl had on a corset. Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties. They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now! I don't like this. I don't like it one bit. Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me! Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it? Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color. That's funny. His name is the same as yours. Say hi to Paul. And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior. That boy's one in a million. A real tiger. I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature. I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known. And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior. So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape. An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it? I'll tell you what happened to my arm. I'll tell you what happened. Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways." The name is Cyrus Cole. I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis. Benefits? Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it? It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow. I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up. Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do. Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages. Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas? Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you? Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it? It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks. Let's see what you did, Rembrandt. Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself. I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night. You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there? Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition. Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning. You going to sit here all day?I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that? I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack. Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works. Yeah? And why is that? So what's the time? You still have that watch Auggie gave you? Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?I thought maybe he was pretending. Does it hurt? Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels. Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell. Sure, Auggie, I got it. The store's closed. And when do I tell them it's open? I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep. Huh? Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished. Twelve-eleven. Twelve-twelve. Twelve-twelve. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Huh?Forty-one pages. Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay? Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming. I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it. Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission. How's Melville? I'll tell you all about it... ... but not here. It looks worse than it is. I'm okay. Not an easy book. Melville, huh? It's been a while. Wow. You don't fool around, do you? What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis? Your dissertation? What subject do you study? And the bookstore? Have you been working there long? Just like me. And your father? Is he from New York? So your mother grew up in Shanghai? I confess. Better make it charge. Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it? I mean, it's a good story. Yes, I suppose I do. I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use. You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it. It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her. Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you. She probably died. Did you ever go back to see her? Every word. I'm all ears. So. Are we ready? I have to pee. If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay? It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good. Anything good? Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea. You know anything about Christmas stories? Fine. Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day. Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down. Somebody's worried about my health. Uh, better make it one. Hi, Auggie. It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner. Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it? So what did he say when he called? Or didn't. There's no way of knowing, is there? I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary. You haven't heard from Rashid, have you? For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose. No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull. Assaultus interruptus. It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now. It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better. No, he's not. You are. Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that? He's got something to tell you, Auggie. The kid's sorry, Auggie. I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you. Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone? It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little. This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren. It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling. Slow down, huh? But they're all the same. What do you mean? It's kind of overwhelming. Amazing. I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project? I've never seen anything like it. They're all the same. I'd like to see your pictures some day. A photographer ... How'd you get started? So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter. I didn't know you took pictures. It's yours? Looks like someone forgot a camera. Do you think I could buy some before you leave? Are you closed? I wouldn't think of it. See you around, fellas. Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First. Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh? Definitely. I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth. Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it. Hey, Auggie. How's it going? And he's never tried to get in touch with his son? It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years. Jesus. You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind? Those are pretty hostile words. And? And you told your nephew about it? Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected? Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water? I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life. I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now. I shouldn't have let him go. And his parents? He doesn't go to the Trinity School? That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street. As far as I know, he went back to his parents. Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now! Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since. You mean Rashid? I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas. Thomas? Who's Thomas? The damn lock's broken again. And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game? How the hell did you get into the building? What can I do for you? Now ask him who his mother was. If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it? We came here to deliver some clean laundry. Research. I worked the scene right into my story. That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible. Hi, kid. Good. I'm glad that's settled! Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out. You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you. I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie. No wonder he was angry. Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys? If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions. Well? So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you? Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future. Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want? A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you. Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry. So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you. You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you? So how much does it come to? Good thinking. And started to run. Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up. So you're saying it wasn't like that at all. Here, catch. Is it yours? You don't believe me, huh? Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book. His only copy. I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book. It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes. Absolutely. We would be honored. Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing. Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me. I mean earlier. We could have planned something. Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me? Celebrate? What for? No, not the end. The beginning. His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father. All right. Listen carefully. About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered. Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it? Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it. If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it. If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares. Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go. Besides, I'm making up for lost time. I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late. Thanks. Ah, coffee. Smells good. Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we? Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive. Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong. It looks like they've met in this apartment. What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live. If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe. Why don't you go to the police? So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh? And? I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want? Close the door. Sit down in that chair. Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now. Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here. Where the hell do you think you're going? Where did you get that thing? Appreciation for what? Hey, it's you. Take good care of yourself, okay? Do you need some money? Some extra clothes? Are you going to be all right? No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around. It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it? And how long did I tell you you could stay? How long have you been here? It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it? If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise. It might be worth it. The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast. Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes. Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think? Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work? You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here. Eight-thirty. Time to wake up. Hey, kid, time to wake up. Rashid! Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over. Is that what you do? Draw pictures? Twelve, thirteen years ago. Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock. No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble. It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were. My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me. I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way. The world is in your head, remember? I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it. I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things. That's it. Just the two rooms. I didn't expect to see you again. Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights. I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it? But your body is in the world, isn't it? If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you? Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either. Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably. You can't be more specific than that? The what? Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it? In Manhattan? And where do Momsie and Popsie live? That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job. What is it? Family problems? Money problems? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help. Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger. Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it. Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne. You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock. Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up. Good. Lemonade it is. I'm Paul. Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee. You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance. Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years. I owe you something. No, wait. You can't just walk off. You saved my life. I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ... I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what? I'll take the iced coffee. You only live once, right? Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes? Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.No wonder it's such a screwed-up place. Like me, too. Actually, I'm his father. Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble. I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday. The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us. It's my birthday. Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you? Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other? It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer. What difference does it make? To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent. So I can get my job back. What do you care where it comes from? It's yours. No, it's five thousand dollars. Open it. It's for you. A little. Not much. Sure thing. See you later. Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there. A job? I definitely wouldn't turn down a job. Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head. Seventeen. Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus? Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole. Thomas. Thomas. That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings. Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you? Hi there, little brother. It's only temporary. On a freelance basis. You named the kid after yourself, huh? And have you mended them? I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm. Paul. Paul Benjamin. Five dollars an hour? I'll take it. You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights. Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis? What's your offer? It was just a thought. Not a one. I just tell it like it is, mister. If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me. Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable. It'll cost you five bucks. I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting. Just passing through. I'm not going to rob you, mister. Do I look like a thief? It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours. I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... . It's all right. I really do know them. Wow. They sure did a job on you. Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch. I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City. I'm not going to do it. What are you talking about? You can't be serious. He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks.... I suppose so. He never told me about it. The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits.... It wasn't my fault. It was more complicated than that. There was a reason. That money is my whole future. No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now. That's it. In a nutshell. Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact. That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it. And started to run. Yeah, I picked it up. Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you. Yeah, it might be. I don't know. Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that. Would he? His only copy? Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us. Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin? Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you? Here we are. Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters. I just did. It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far. The end. No way. The inspiration. Come on, just a little hint. That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too. So what's this story you're working on, anyway? Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish. You work too hard, you know that? What time did you get to bed last night? One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open. Let's not get too idealistic. That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe. It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet. The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him. You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right? I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead. I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood. To make sure I don't run into him again. Okay, okay. It's all so stupid. There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with. You don't really want to know. I don't have much time. Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock. I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio. Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. I don't know. For helping me out. I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation. You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street. Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. Absolutely. The world is my oyster. Whatever that means. You don't have to apologize. The coast is probably clear now anyway. I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ... But all good things have to come to an end, right? Two or three nights. Three nights. I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember? If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ... And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me. Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it? I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins. I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands. Eight-thirty? What time is it? Yeah, sometimes. I like to dabble, too. Drawing's a good thing. He's dead? Is your father an artist? Yeah, I can believe it. Nice drawing. Did you do that? But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan. This is the first house I've been in without a TV. Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay. I can take care of myself. Don't worry. Thanks, but I'll manage. People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York. The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head. Yeah, that's right. Here and there. Around. The what. I've kind of run away from home, you see. It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight. That's where the what comes in. Of course. Where else? East Seventy-fourth Street. Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles. You don't know me from a hole in the wall. Mostly what. Well, maybe just one. To be polite. Just one bottle. I believe in moderation. I mean breakfast. That's okay. I've already had lunch. Rashid. Rashid Cole. I don't drink coffee. On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no. That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you. Well, if you put it that way... It's okay, mister. No big deal. I just happened to be there. The right place at the right time. No harm done. Everything's okay now. I've got to be going. Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that. Yes, please. Yes, please. Medium rare, please.Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that. Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle. They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up. They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge. A mess of porridge. Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit. Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses. I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie. Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long. No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country. Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos? They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you. I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day. You don't take anything seriously, do you? Lovely. Sounds like another one of your stories to me. Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh. Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job. It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for? How long you been working for me, Auggie? Okay. I think everything's set. You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.Thanks. I knew you'd understand. It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster. Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales." Do me a favor, will you? What about for you? And what about for you? What'll it be, Auggie?What does that mean? Thanks for the tip. The refrigerator? I think I'll take them. And these? And these? And how much are these?Which one can I open first? Here! In the car! Woody! Buzz! Hey! Wow! Bye, house. But what if we leave them behind? He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone. Right here in the van. Mom, have you seen Woody? Pizza Planet! Yeah!!! Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom. Yeah?! Can I help pump the gas? I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there. Okay... But Mom, I can't find him! Mom! Do you know where Buzz is? Just one? Can I bring some toys? Pizza Planet?! Oh, cool! To infinity and beyond! Oh, yeah! Okay. Yeah! Can we leave this up 'til we move? Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom! Wow! Cool!Mm-hmmmmm. Merry Christmas, Sheriff. Rocky! The ramp! What are you doing over there? I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you. Well sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife. Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight? I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.Me? No, no, no, no... Are you? We're not aiming for the truck! This isn't flying. This is falling -- with style! Not today! You did it! Next stop. Andy. Woody?! What are you doing? Woody! The rocket! Look out!! NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!! Hold on, Woody! Woody! What?! Woody! It's the moving van. Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing. But why would Andy want me? Yeah, right. No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy. Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference. I can't help. I can't help anyone. Years of Academy training...wasted!! But -- the hat looked good. Tell me the hat looked good! The apron is a bit much, it's not my color... Look at me! I can't even fly out of a window! Oh, I'm a sham!! Don't you get it?! You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! One minute you're defending the whole galaxy... ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters. Shhh! Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed. Woody, stop it!! Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that! It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for hours -- Shield your eyes! Woody, we don't know what's out there! Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport -- I've set my laser from stun to kill. What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I was -- Spaceship. Where is it? I don't see the -- You mean it has hyperdrive? Sorry. Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit. Well, then let's climb abroad. Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? Go away. Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy. My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place -- Sheriff, this is no time to panic. According to my nava-computer, the -- But we're not on my planet, are we? I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet. Then we've no time to lose!! Trouble?! Where?! I could have stopped him. You mean that happy child? Sure is a hairy fellah. Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device? I'd better take a look anyway. What's going on? Where? You're mocking me, aren't you? Don't even think about it, cowboy! Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh? What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip?! Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. All right, then, I will. Stand back everyone! I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed! Can! Yes, I can. They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly. Excuse me. Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger. Toy? Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up. Watch yourself!! I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion? HO-YAAAHH!!!Something's screwy here. Everyone, it's Woody! Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good! What's with him? Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards! Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock! Oh, that is disgusting. He's in the psycho's bedroom! No, no, not the ear. Gimme the nose. C'mon! Oh, quit your whining and pay up. Heh-heh. Miss. G-6. I got dibs on his hat! Sorry there, old Spudhead. Oh, boy. Will ya take a look at all those presents?!Murderer! Son of a building block, it's Woody! How 'bout three out of five? Are you peeking? Ohhh! You sunk it! B-3. Let's string him up by his pull- string! Hey, watch it! I can't see a thing! How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy? Will you quit moving around?! Huh?! Huh?! I told you he was guilty. That ain't no happy child. Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you? Oh, really? I'm from Playskool. Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody. Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear? Oh, ya big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is! Toss 'im overboard! Come on. Let's get out of here. Save it for the jury. I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep! You murdering dog! Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?! You are a liar! Did you all take stupid pills this morning?! Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz? And now you want to let him back over here? Wait! Wait! I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?! That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer! Who is it this time? Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh... Laser-envy. A lunchbox...?! Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel. Aa-a-a-a-ah! Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?! He tortures toys -- just for fun. Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do? And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not actually from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but... Have you been replaced? Outta my way! Here I come, here I come -- Oh, no! Hey look! It's Buzz! Hey, Woody!? Where'd ya go? Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?! Yes! Yes! We promise! But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Were you scared? Tell me honestly. ROOAAAARR!!! He got it, Woody! There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel. Oh, I don't like confrontations. I thought he was at summer camp! Woody? Who's up there with you? They're getting bigger.I can't quite make out -- Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW! Mission accomplished. Well done, men. Pack it up, we're going home. It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame! Repeat! Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame! Okay, we're on the last present now... Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now. Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo. Yes SIR! Sir! No Sir!She's lying! Whatever she says it's not true! Patient is... ...pre-e-epped. I'll have to perform one of my...operations! She's sick! Look! Janie! Oh no, Hannah! Whaddaya mean, you don't know? Did I get my package in the mail? W-w-w-we? It's busted. What?! Huh? Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY! Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl. You'll blow up. I know you're tired! I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me? Yessss! Ah, ha, ha, ha...I got it, Woody! It's too short! We need more monkeys! We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex? It's Sid! What the heck is up there? Wait! There's a nice little one over there! I can't hold on much longer! Woody! Speed up! See? It is Buzz. Now give back the lights, Potato Head. I knew you'd come back, Woody! Woody?! Heh, heh, heh! Golly bob howdy -- Woody, what are you doing under the bed? Got it. Bad news?! Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want. I'm red this time. Right here, Woody!Say, isn't that mistletoe? Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention. We're almost there. It's a long story, Bo. I'll explain later. Here, catch this! Uh, let what? I don't -- Uh, what do you mean? Who? You'd think they've never seen a new toy before. Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I... Oh, hey - it was nothing. Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo. Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?! Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck! Ha ha!! To Infinity and Beyond!! Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!! Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up! Ha-ha!! Hold still, Buzz! The match! Great! Well, thanks for the ride. I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me! Nice work, fellahs. Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch! That was a stroke of genius. It's ok. Everything's under control. Shhhhhhh! We've got to get out of here...NOW. Yes Sir! Buzz!! What are you doing? I thought you were -- Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy. No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy. Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger. Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly. Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house. Oh, come on, Buzz. I...Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help. Come on, this way! Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius! Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz. I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here, Buzz. What happened to you? Don't tell me what to do! Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled! Back! Back, you savages! Back! Get away! Hoo-cha! Hoo-cha! Oh, you idiot! You're a toy! Use your karate chop action! They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick! I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH! I sure hope this isn't permanent. Oh, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death. YOU are the one that decided to climb into this -- Alright Buzz, get ready... C'mon, c'mon, that's it... Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf. Wait a minute! No Buzz! This way! There's a special ship. I just saw it! Ow! Watch where you're going! No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there. Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home. Buzz! Buzz, come back! WHAT?!! What are you talking about?! Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me -- This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!! Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!! No. Oh. Oh, that's good. Right? Buddy? Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz! Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble! Buzz, I would love to see you try. 'Course I'd love to see you as a crater. THAT is Sid! No! No, that's Scud, you idiot! That's why. Sid. Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS. Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien! You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys! Look! It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear! Oh, yeah, tough guy?! And another thing. Stop with this spaceman thing. It's getting on my nerves. Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me. That wasn't flying! That was falling with style! Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it. Can't! Can't! Can't! You can't! No, you can't. He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly -- The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present. T-O-Y. Toy. Yes. They're Andy's toys. Well, let's see, we've got double A's -- Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot. Hello-o-o... So, you see? We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz? You bet. Gimme a hug. Hi! Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly! It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks! Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me! No, no! Turn 'em around, turn 'em around! Stay calm, everyone!! It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish. No, no, no, wait! No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there! We've gotta help him!! No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here! No, it's not what you think, I swear! No! No, no, no, no! Nothing. No, I'm not! Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead. No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me! Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something! Now, it was an accident! Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me Wait a minute. You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head? I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny? Alright! That's it! All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy -- A lunchbox?! Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried. Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake. Gimme five, man! Hi ya, fellas. To infinity and beyond! Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. This is serious!! Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best. C'mon, they're not lying down on the job. Okay, save your batteries! If I send out the troops, will you all calm down? Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about. C'mon, guys! Every Christmas and birthday we go through this. I was close to being scared that time. Oh, how ya doin', Rex? Buzz. Buzz Lightyear. You are not worried, are you? Andy's coming, everybody! Back to your places. Hurry! There. So did I tell ya? Huh? Nothing to worry about. Last present! This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet! Sargent. Establish a recon post downstairs. Code red. You know what to do. Okay, thank you. At ease. Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky? That's right. Your toys. Somebody's poisoned the water hole... This town ain't big enough for the two of us! Reach for the sky!! Sid!!! This is ludicrous. Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl. Uh-oh. Slink! Hang on! Speed up! Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too. Boy, am I glad to see you guys! We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz? Oh, shut up! In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy. Uh-h-h-h...nothing! Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake. Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!! Sh-h-h-h-h!! Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news. No, Slink -- Hey, Slinky?Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see. What's she doing? What are you going to do with us? I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.So that...??? And your only goal is...??? Meaning...??? And it appeared sequentially after that in...? Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...? Forced you! Why would someone force you to take drugs? It's important to observe everything.I understand. There'd be no point. Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused. You don't know what's real and what's not. No, sir! I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet. And I have the experience, I know who the people are... I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL! Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital. Uh, what? No, sir! Uh, I didn't hear the... I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told. Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth. To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus. That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking. San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking. It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995. I got into trouble. I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it. It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter. They forced me to take drugs. I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street. Right! You're right. I have to fix this. I was here...as a kid. I think you were here, too. But you...looked just like you look now. I know this place! ... This is my dream. On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it." I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you. Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone. You were in my dream just now. I didn't recognize you. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy. Why are we doing this? Flowers! What flowers? I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things. I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid. It was on TV. They got your message, Kathryn. They played it for me. It was a bad recording...distorted. I didn't recognize your voice. You... you left them a message? A Carpet Cleaning Company? You want me to rob him? I want to be here. In this time. With you. I want to become...become a whole person. I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown. You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything... ...I had a dream about...something like that. I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid. Where a boy... It was? I didn't...know. I don't know -- I don't remember. No, not really. It's...it's in my mind. Like you said. I thought I was in...prison again. You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before... I...I...dreamed them. I don't understand what we're doing. No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he? Don't worry -- it's all okay now. I'm not crazy any more! I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me. I want to get well... No gun! Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe! The gun! ... I lost it It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay. I'll never have to live underground. I need help all right. They're coming after me. I'm..."mentally divergent". I would love to believe that. Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't sure. We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea? Yeah, sort of, I guess. I...I'm sorry I locked you up. I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy! No! I...don't think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree. You smell so good. That has your name on it. Give him cash. You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you? It was some kind of...war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here. I got shot. Look -- there's a gas station up ahead. I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid. We need gas. The guy was a total fruitcake. All I see are dead people. Everywhere. What's three more? Mason??? Lock it now! I told you what I want. Lock the door! I've got one now. I did him a favor. Now come on. Are you hurt? The man...with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He... They're keeping an eye on me. Look, I'm warning you. You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people! Nevermind. It's not real -- it's a hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here. Left! When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him. I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates. So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure. So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth. A secret army. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys. I've told you about them. They spread the virus. That's why we have to get to Philadelphia. I have to find them -- it's my assignment. My notes. Observations. Clues. No, I think it was always you. It's very strange. You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before. About an airport...before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have -- the only one. I'm a little kid in it. You were in my dream just now. Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you. Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one? Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff... My father told me that. "Never cry wolf." Then people won't believe you if...something really happens. "Never cry wolf!" Everybody's got a gun. In this city... You used to call me "James". It's the next step. I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone. Zs that a radio? Does it play music? You told me you'd help me. I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad. Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. I can read, remember? 1989. Six years for you. There's the sign! Right here! No more drugs. Please... Wait! This is only 1989! I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. It's not the right number yet. That's the problem. Damn! How can I contact them? What? No. That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things. It was some lady. She didn't know anything. No, 1995 is the past. 1995? What year is it? July?! This is April, right? I have to go. It's so clean. No germs. I love this air. This is wonderful air. Underground. I have to go. You wouldn't understand. No. They wanted identification. I don't have any identification. I wasn't trying to hurt them. Because I'm a good observer. Because I have a tough mind. I need to go. It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything. No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I'm supposed to be getting information. "James"! Nobody ever calls me that. I need to go now. No, no. I can't talk to them. It's called, "voice mail". I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present. Scientists. I'm supposed to report in to them. They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time. No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out. Listen, you dumb fuck! The thing mutates We live underground! The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats. We're like moles or worms. All we want to do is study the original... Bulishit! You're fucking with my head! Plan? What are you talking about? I don't have time to go upstairs. The police are looking for me. I need to know where it is and exactly what it is. I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! For the future! Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything. I can't stop you. I just want some information... Monkeys. Twelve of them. I'm here about some monkeys. You do know me. You helped me once. What...??? What....??? It's private. What are you talking about??? Look at those assholes, they're asking for it! Maybe people deserved to be wiped out! They hurt you! What's that mean? If you know how to escape, why don't you...? I'm not crazy. Germs?! I need to make a telephone call. Who am I supposed to shoot? It's about obeying, about doing what you're told. This part isn't about the virus, is it? The call I just made? Five minutes ago? How did you find me? Jo...Jose???? JOSE! Yes, sir. I couldn't call! You sent me to the wrong year! It was 1989. Uh, that message...me? Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I volunteered. I mashed the spider, didn't I?So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future? Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out? Does this bother you, Mr. Cole? Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that. You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist. You know the difference between what's real and what's not. He kidnapped you, Kathryn. You saw him murder someone. You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too. You were under tremendous emotional stress. Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now? You see what I mean? You're being defensive. Isn't she being defensive, Bob? Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull. He should have been in restraints. It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. why not just cop to it? Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do? I don't have to tell you I'm afraid. You're insane, Jeffrey. She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.This is it, James...what you've been working for. You're still a little... disoriented. He's drugged out of his mind! He's completely zoned out. We want tough minded people. Strong mentally. We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types. You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink. This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall? She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit! It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up. That's him. Shut up! Then how come she knows what's going on? That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist? And now she's spray- painting our building? Your psychiatrist? Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"? No! Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything. One dozen bolt cutters! Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?I'll be right here...just in case. James Cole. That's everything we got. None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants. Nothing. You want me to go in with you? You want to go in? Examine him? Were you listening? We got two officers in the hospital. Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse. Look at him! Still on his feet. Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that? -- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff. All they got was his name. They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!" Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?" You do remember that, don't you? I get it! This is your old plan, right? We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs. I am a new person! I'm completely adjusted. Witness the tux. It's Armani. Who chattered? Goines? Weller? County Hospital, right? 1989. The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right? Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too. Excuse me -- what did you say? That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH. Never saw him before in my life. Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do. Not, "what", babe! When! Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up -- try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan! Remember? I did my part. A lawsuit? You going to sue them? What're you writing? You a reporter? You know -- your plan. Wiping cut the human race! That's a great idea! But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. I didn't say a word about "you know what". Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty. I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS! TOWELS! LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS... Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'Cause I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken care of, see? I've sent out word. Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right? That's very sane. I can help you. You want me to, don't you? Get you out? "What about the germs?" I say. He goes, "I don't believe in germs. Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you believe in germs, don't you? In the 18th century there was no such thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway. Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think. He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick! He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this guy...crazy? Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"! A telephone call? That's communication with the outside world! Doctor's discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread. Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos everywhere! A plague of madness. In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill. I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon. But that's not why you're here. Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy. There's the TV. It's all right there. Commercials. We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated. What are we for then? We're consumers. Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what? You're mentally ill! That's a fact! If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices... SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND... What'd they give you? Thorazine? How much? Learn your drugs -- know your doses. THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT! YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT? NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC? You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter. Have I ever "developed" a virus? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy! What virus are we talking about, Dad? What...virus? WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS? You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?! I'll tell you why: because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet! Ex-psychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights...? WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND. THIS IS IMPORTANT. You really want to know?They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya want? Hey, man... Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call. I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... "weird" war we were in. You remember that? Here, take it, man! You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate! The phone call, man. The phone call. Me? Are you kiddin? You're the one! You were a hero, man. They gave you a pardon! And whadda you do? You come back and fuck with your teeth! Wow! Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts! Here, take this. Cole! Oh, God, Cole, where are we?But you know what's real now? It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. Did you make that call? I asked you, why did you volunteer? We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole. Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.There's more. A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him. + Bear with me here... They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive. We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it. You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?He says the hair is longer and lighter. &lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt; + The nose is sharper. Smaller too. + &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt; He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes. No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye. Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people. He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.I don't know. This is bad. Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth. I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York? Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up. I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight. So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight? Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point. I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus. The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity. Everybody I ever worked with, did time with. RIGHT THERE. FREEZE. Then who goes? Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point. You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup. They fucking know everything. DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS. We all go. How about it, Keaton? I'm sure you can understand my hesitation. You are a criminal. Can we stealth these guys? Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him. What do you care what he says? How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story? The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all about? If I'm going in, I want a stake. Me too. I can run. I got no problem with that. Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up. I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.Edie, please. That's enough, Edie. Alright. They ruined me tonight. They'll never stop. No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished. Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am. Goddamnit. Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say? Just forget about it. I'm having a stroke. Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing . This is not right. I don't want to know. It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do. How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that. This whole thing was a shakedown. Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet . Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing. It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty. Dig. Why don't you just calm down' His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him. He's alright. You heard right. Just do what I tell you. I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way. Russian, I think. I don't know. What is this? Something - I don't know. I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open? We'll make it. We'll make it. No killing? Three million? Fenster and Hockney? How are they going to do it? Well, I'm sorry. You okay? You watch your mouth. Tough break. What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not? Never heard of him. What fence? Who? They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore. Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you. Get out. I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things - What the hell do you want? Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that? We've met once or twice. Last time was in... Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been with what? Let's say for example - What time is it? I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser. You're lying. What did you say? We'll see. Neither do we. We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off. Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here. The answer is no. What about Redfoot? You set up the line-up. Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man? Who's your boss? Tell him we'll meet. We want to meet him. Who is he? You didn't know. A little of both. Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later. I shivved him. A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis. We're on vacation.Am I? 92 92 INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus. Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday. I am sorry, Mr. McManus. f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very + determined. Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it. Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us. A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot. Mr. Soze will be most - Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people. Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point. I work for Keyser Sate. My employer wishes to remain anonymous. My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.Keyser Soze And ? Who ? I don't get it. What was the money for? There was ninety-one million - Yeah. Jack. What are you doing here? Nothing. Something I - forget it. A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die. I'11 find him. No matter. He'll have to know how close we came. I know what I wanted to know about Keaton. Someplace else, then. I want to see him. When does he post bail? What'the fuck is that? Did they charge him with anything? What do you mean I can't see him? Kobayashi. I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead. You know damn well what I think. If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in? This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time. Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there. You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's. Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you. You're not safe on your own. Why lie about everything else, then? If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth. He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die. He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him. THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN. Keaton was Keyser Soze No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will. I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why? Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why' Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat? There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death. But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew. His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them. He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder. But Keaton... Then why didn't you help him? YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME. TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING . YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON . Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at. I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was. A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall. Why didn't you say anything? What call? Then what? What happened? You're stalling, Verbal. Can we just get back to Kobayashi? This is totally irrelevant. So why play into his hands? We can protect you. If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you. Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out. And this is why you never told the D.A. Do you believe in him, Verbal? And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.? Came from Redfoot. So this lawyer... Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52 SCENE DELETED 52 53 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 53 + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters. Is he the one that killed Keaton? NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison, You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes. What lawyer? I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York. Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total + of seven times when he was on the force. + In every case, witnesses either reversed + their testimony to the grand jury or died + before they could testify. When they t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either. Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold- + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold. + Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her. Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy. I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not. The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow? I'11 be sure to mention that to him. I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much. You know Ruby is in Attica? You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal? Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity . According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else. I just want to hear your story. Keaton was a piece of shit. He was a corrupt cop, Verbal. I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man. Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything. Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.What? Waste of time. Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again. Which is shit. Where? He won't go into the interrogation room. Two hours, tops. Weapons. Misdemeanor two. The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings. That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know. And I am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions. No, no, no, no, no. Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wiredHe wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him' Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask. The job got thrown to me by this lawyer. Get a grip. I didn't know. Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested. Business or personal? I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved. Take your time. Enjoy L.A. I've got a ton of work and no good people.Umm ... A glass of water would be nice. I hope I didn't disturb you. Did you hear what he just said? What are we gonna do? Roger really. People say I talk too much. Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered . What if I Keaton, I can't just - Hungarian? What-are they speaking? Who's Keyser Soze? What is it Keaton? Don't do this. Send her a card - something. Not if we do it my way. Maybe more. They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you. McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way. Forget it. I'11 probably shit blood tonight. I'11 be alright. I was out of line. Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool. Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place? They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this. You have to come. Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot. McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff. Don't hurt me. If you'll just let me - They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more. I wanted to talk to you. The other guys - How do you do? I walked. Ninety days, suspended. County. I was in for fraud. Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop. I'm not bait. No way. I post today. You think he's..? You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning. I knew him. He would never - This is all bullshit. Edie... NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. NO. No... Because he was my friend. Edie. He wanted me to live. But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone? I don't I said I never heard of him. I never heard of him. It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back? I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him. I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't. Wait a minute. I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's I wanted to. I thought we could make it. Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster. McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call. Give a guy a break, huh? The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us. Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything. That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois. Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me. After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again. Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail. I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me? You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say? I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal. Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE. Right. Kobayashi. No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead. There was a lawyer. Kobayashi. The D.A. gave me immunity. He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer. I don't know about that. You got him wrong. You keep trying to lay this whole ride on t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around. r I'm telling you straight, I swear. + That was all Fenster and McManus. He loved her. You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you. I'm not a rat. No. There's nothing in there about Ruby. He didn't have my lawyer. You know a religious guy named John Paul? Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time. That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible. You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan? Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit. I know he was good. I told the D.A. everything I know. Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -You know damn well, dead-man. This I had to see myself. Ready? How are you, Keaton?Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two? Weapons. Misdemeanor one. Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession. Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention. Immunity. No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity. My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.Counselor, you're insulting me. You're joking. I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars. Counselor, I will prosecute your client. May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here. The district attorney's office will comply provided -Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards. Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards. I don't know. Madison lives two blocks from their present location. There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you. If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself. Recognize this? How would you like your old job back? Whatever. We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android. My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate. On my life, I promise you I will. She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did. Don't worry, they have no idea where you are. Sid 6.7 is now armed. Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted. So were the first two cops to arrive on scene. Fine �� you want to stay here? This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use. She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick. If you can catch him. Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist. LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building. These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they? Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane. What about them? Don't give up, Parker. Not ever. Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first. New scar �� you making it okay in there? You were supposed to act as if everything was real. What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for? Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you. You may not believe this, Parker, You all right? Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach. Why didn't anybody tell me?! I think we both know who did. What's so urgent? You think he's smart? Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either. So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality? In other words, we collectively don't know shit. None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach. Any idea what Sid's going to do next? ... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty�four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in... I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.You already have staked your reputation. Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too. Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose. The fail-safe on�line, yet? He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards? I wish we could hear them. Why would they be going there? What are they doing in Los Feliz? But only you will know he's not human. Yes or no, Mr. Barnes? This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one. We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life. Catch him and your record's clean. You mean a nano�tech synthetic organism. Why wasn't I told? I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you. Not if you're with him every step of the way. That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby� trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter? You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field. We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re�assignment. Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell. This better not be a wild goose chase. You know how much man power you're talking about? Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where... Enough to level an entire city block. It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter. Did you find out where the bomb is? What did you find out? Barnes, where the hell have you been?! If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence. This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release. Think you can do it? Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do. I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive. Neither will the public. The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage. Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world. What the hell happened? Don't remind me. What did Cox pull him out early for?He hears...everything. I understand... I understand perfectly. I'M WHAT?! I'm still making adjustments... The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism. You need a maid. Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is. How do you kill it? This is supposed to be years away. It feels so.. .real. It's nano�technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules... Get that fucking thing away from me! Do I get to see it or not? Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours. If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR. He's developing a hemisphere imbalance. I wonder how that... How should I know? I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world. I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please! Help me get out of here. Of course you are. SID �� NO!!! I think I understand what you have in mind... All my work is my finest. What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here? My God... You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you? You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired! It was you, wasn't it? All they want to produce around here is mediocrity! Think hard -- it'll come to you... Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?Jesus Christ. I know who the dominant personality is. Lindenmeyer. I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else. You son-of�a�bitch, I'm going to kill you. It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying. In English, please. Can you tell us what's on the disc? If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself. When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head? Then I guess we're even. You son�of�a�bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How? Where's my gun? Their weapons missing? She wasn't part of the deal, Cox. What she's going to do is get in my way. Jesus Christ. Can you kill it? I've seen worse. It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee? You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games. Do me a favor �� keep sending them. You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year? But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days. I'm getting by. Real, my ass. It's an overblown game. Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho? He was a computer program for crissake. Why'd.. .you pull me out? Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today? You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to. Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates. Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena. If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel. No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target. How much C-4 is missing? Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards. Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been? How do you know I won't run? What happens if I can't catch him? Not from in here. Only because I got pulled out early. You won't want to watch. Turn around. Then shoot him already. How's your pulse? Where the hell are you going? Sid? Lindenmeyer? ...I think so...You? Because this pain�in�the�ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not. And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7. You don't know? You mean there's something you haven't asked me? A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where. Nice work. See something? Think he's keeping track of his creation? Part of him is. I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious. I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember? Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him. You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now? They're going to fry me for it, anyway. Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!! If you're gonna do it, better do it now. Both. Authority still makes me nervous. Real effective security... You like baseball? Start of what? What's the problem? Tell him. You know I am. Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it? Nothing. This is my area of expertise. Stop me. Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while? Relax. I know what you meant. Don't worry about it, all right? I forgot what real coffee tastes like... Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does. Welcome to police work. You better like coffee. Sounds to me like a well�educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next. What does that mean? You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to? Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house? She's beautiful, you know? Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter? Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere. Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone. What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son�of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else. Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality? This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you. Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts. Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7? For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977. Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one... I've been in prison, remember? I'm surprised you didn't write one about me. Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him... You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think? What are you doing? Do me one favor �� if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it. What happened when he was 17? Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file? I know who would know. Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends. Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene. Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody. Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar. Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it. Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive. Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie. I don't need a baby�sitter. I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that. Enough! Go to hell. Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more. If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence. You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it �� I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you. John died. A little less than yesterday. You actually listen to all those tapes? Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend? What are you talking about? Aren't you going to watch with me? You are going after Mayor Bennett. I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it? You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?! Where did you plant the C-4?! What C-4...was Cox talking about? Where did you plant the C-4?! What C-4...was Cox talking about? Why's that? DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD! You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!! You and me have nothing in common. The only thing I want to hear is your silence. Where's John?What I need is a nymphomaniac. I know. I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you... ... and you get nano�death. Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones. Separate the character module from the neural net... As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away. It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs... It's a physiological machine. Coordinated by polymer neural net. Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea. You're...such a wimp. Bastard... Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. I haven't been working on anything. HEY!!! At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about? Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow. As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever... You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived. What do you think I'm doing? Glad to... How can I ever thank�you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl? I am beautiful, aren't I? What do you expect me to do, thank him? You catching my drift? She's some of your finest work, Daryl. I had something a little different in mind. Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours? Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you? In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away. I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive. It was me, what? True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime. Should I have? Don't be angry with me, Daryl. BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD! I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now. Beam me up, Scotty! Thank-you, Daryl. You had me going for quite a while there, sport. I've got some final preparations to take care of�� Checking his watch, he stops suddenly. Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re�Election Rally... There you go �� best seat in the house. It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale. My...secret. Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night. Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night. I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you�� You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me. I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to? Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends. Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands? I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison. You know, we have so much in common �� we have such history together ��I've been thinking we should become friends. The symphony of collision... Performing solo. Enjoying the concert so far?It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform. I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene. I was assured the problem was corrected. Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real. Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember? As a matter of fact, I do. How does he know who I am? You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood? You've had a year�and�a�half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer. ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired. Of the six prison inmates you've tested �� all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -� only Mr. Barnes is still breathing. You embarrassed me in front of the highest�ranking law enforcement official in the country. Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me? Do they have to look so...robotic? As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you. ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month. To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
