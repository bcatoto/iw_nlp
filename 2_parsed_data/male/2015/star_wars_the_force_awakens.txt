Stay here. Look how old you've become. You know what I've come for. The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. I'll show you the dark side. You're so right. The old man gave it to you. Search him. Nothing, sir. Put him on board. Sir, the villagers. Kill them all. On my command! Nothing here. Go ahead! FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection. And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? Report to my division at once. What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion. I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable? I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. Where is it? Where... is it? It's in a droid. A BB unit. Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. I leave that to you. These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion. What about the droid? I'll pay for him. Sixty portions. Follow the girl and get that droid. Ren wants the prisoner. Turn here. Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here. "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that! I like that! Good to meet you, Poe! Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers-- Use the ventral cannons. Yes, sir. Bringing them online -- Yes, and he had help. From one of our own. ... The one from the village. FN- Sir. Ventral cannons hot. Fire. Hold on! I see it! Where are you going? No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! What - a droid?! I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning. No prior signs of non-conformity? This was his first offense. General. They've been hit. Destroyed? Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands. They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage. Poe! Poe! Poe!!! POE! Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must. How capable are your soldiers, General? I won't have you question my methods. They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army. My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth-- Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed. Careful, Ren. That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke. I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Water... water... water.. -- Awgh, GAH! What--?! Thief? OW! HEY! What?! I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. Poe didn't make it. (sees BB-8 is sad, Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry... Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah. I'm with the Resistance. Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different. Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. Come on! Come on, BB-8! No, we gotta move! Call in the air strike! Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! -- Are you okay? We can't outrun them! We need a pilot! You?! (then, indicates one Y'ever fly this thing? Great. (reacts to seat) Whoa! I can do this, I can do this-- Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! Stay low! It confuses their tracking! I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Try sitting in this thing! We need cover, quick! Damn it! Come on... come on... I'm getting pretty good at this! The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em! Okay! For what? Whooo! Finn. What's yours. Rey... Whoa! What's going on? Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. The droid... stole a freighter? Not exactly, sir. It had help. Anything else? The two were accompanied by a girl. What girl? How bad is it?! They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! (Throws a tool) This? You gotta tell us where the base is. I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? (BB-8 backs up) -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! (BB-8 COCKS his head) Droid, please. (searching, to BB-8) Go on BB-8, tell her. Please! Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. (searching for tape) What about you? (loses his mind) BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! ! This? Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? ... That can't be good. ... Oh no. It's the First Order. You said poisonous gas -- Can you unfix it? I got it. I'm okay. BB-8 get off me... Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. Hurry! Chewie, we're home. Where are the others? Where's the pilot? You? You can understand that thing? And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. Where'd you get this ship? Jakku?! That junkyard? Thank you! Junkyard! Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches! Who had it, Ducain? Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. I used to be. Han Solo? The Rebellion General? Wasn't he a war hero?! Twelve! Fourteen. Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- (who is she? Then:) Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet. My help? He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?! Good. I got three of 'em going to King Prana. THREE?! How'd you get them on board? I used to have a bigger crew. Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon. He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way. What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? There's one. Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it. Yes, I do. Every time. Bala-Tik. What's the problem? No. You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? A lot of 'em. Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money. I never made a deal with Kanjiklub! Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you. Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? Twice! What was the second time? Nowhere left for you to hide. First I've heard of it. Search the freighter. Close the blast doors from here? ... I got a bad feeling about this... Oh no, what? This was a mistake! They look like that. This way! It had me! But the door--! I got the door. Cover us! Chewie! You okay? (looks at bowcaster) Wow. Come on! Come on! You, close the door behind us! You take care of Chewie! Hey, where are you going? I hate that guy. I got one, he's back there. Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed -- I never ask that question until after I've done it. This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! No problem! Come on baby, don't let me down! What?! ... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th-- General! Our strategy must now change. The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Go. Oversee preparations. Yes, Supreme Leader. There's been an awakening. Have you felt it? Yes. There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. He means nothing to me. Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. We shall see. We shall see. Electrical overload! The coolant's leaking! -- Secondary tank, I got it! Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie! You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me! Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! (Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS) Which is fine. This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. What'd you do? Move, Ball. Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Good job, kid. And thanks. You're welcome. So, fugitives, huh? Let's see whatcha got. This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him. He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything. Do you know what happened to him? There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple. I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light. 'Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true. No, you rest. (To Rey and Finn) You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- D'you just call me "Solo"? Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers? Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always. You might need this. I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. You know how to use one of these? There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon. I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much. I'm thinking about it. Well? Jakku? Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Solo, why are we here again? To get your droid on a clean ship. Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet. We can trust her, right? Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare... Any of it. Han Solo! (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving) Hey, Maz! Where's my boyfriend? Chewie's working on the Falcon. I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it. Inform the First Order... I've found the droid. Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess. Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia. Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home! Leia doesn't want to see me. Please, we came here for your help. The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us. There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- What's this? What are you doing? Solo, what is she doing? I don't know, but it ain't good. If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. (eyes on Maz) You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Come with me. I can't. Keep it, kid. Who's the girl? I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. (to Big Head) Don't leave without me. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing... But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran. Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me. Take care of yourself. Please. Quiet, girl! That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! Han told me. (reaches out, hold The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it. The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it. Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic! The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey? I've had this for ages... Kept it locked away. Where'd you get that? A good question for another time. Take it! Find your friend! Those beasts! They're here! FN-417, hold position! Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. Come on, Chewie! Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go. I need a weapon. You have one! Hey, can I try that? I like this thing. Traitor! You okay, Big deal? Thanks! Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody! We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position! It's the Resistance. Quick! Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot! The girl I've heard so much about. Request air support! The map. You've seen it. Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need. Pull back the tree line! No, no, no, no... WOMAN!! He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone! Yeah, yeah, I know... You changed your hair. No, new jacket. ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Poe. Poe Dameron. You're alive! What happened to you? No, no, no. It wasn't just me. Oh here. Poe -- I need your help. (surprised she knows) Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner-- That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast. Leia... Do what? She heads off. I'm trying to be helpful! I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again. Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. There was nothing we could've done. (hard for him to say) There was too much Vader in him. We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at. We lost our son, forever. If Luke couldn't reach him, how could General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. You're my guest. You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (Rey stares at him) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea. Tell me about the droid. He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. We'll see. She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And the droid? Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system. Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon. Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance. If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me. What did you say? I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. And I'll drop my weapon. Begin charging the weapon! Yes, sir. Weapon charging. They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. A laser cannon? We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. It's another Death Star. So it's big. How is it possible to power a weapon of this size? It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. Okay, how do we blow it up? (all eyes on him) There's always a way to do that. (at first hesitant) In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... There is one. Precinct 47. Here. If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. ... Maybe the planet. They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. We disable the shields. Kid, you worked there, what do you got? (beat, then:) I can do it. I like this guy. I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet-- We'll get you there. If I told you, you wouldn't like it. Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. Now you tell me? That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good. Some things never change. Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area. She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. How are we getting in? Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Alright, Chewie, get ready. And Now! I get any higher, they'll see us! Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to-- The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way. What was your job when you were based here? Sanitation. Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields? I don't. I'm just here to get Rey. People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! That's not how the Force works--! Oh really, you're cold? Come on! Report. Hey! The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields? I have an idea about that. Remember me? Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge. Bring it down. Bring it down. Follow me. You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields. You're making a big mistake. Do it. Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey. Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. (to Finn, cruel) You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all. I disagree. What do we do with her? Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor? Yeah, there is... General, their shields are down! Give Poe full authorization to attack. Black Leader, go to sub-lights. On your call. Dropping out of lightspeed. Approaching target. Dispatch all squadrons... Yes, General. But no damage! We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. You sure you're up for this? Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to The Oscillator's still standing. X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! Are you all right? Good. What happened -- did he hurt you? We came back for you. What'd he say? How did you get away? Escape now. Hug later. I got one behind me. See it? Watch out for ground fire! They're in trouble. We can't leave. (to Finn, re: Chewie) My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em. Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed. That girl knows her stuff. We'll set the charges at every other column. You're right. That's a better idea. (checks his detonator) You take the top. I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here. Find them. Ben! Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Take off that mask. You don't need it. What do you think you'll see if I do? The face of my son. Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him. That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. No. The Supreme Leader is wise. Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. It's too late. No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Yes. Anything. Thank you. Solo. The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. The Falcon's this way. We're not done yet. It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... Come get it. We just lost R-1! Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in! Roger! I'm hit! Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! Weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds. Prepare to fire. You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force! Lieutenant, get back to your station! (stops, fleetingly) Just look. We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. It is time to complete his training. Yes! Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat. Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We must go tell the others at once!
