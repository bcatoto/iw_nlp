You done impressing yourself, ace? Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!! It was alright for a while, you know. But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago. We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests. If you were married you got a state-room. Otherwise it was bunks. There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months. I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers. So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together. Where're you? This ain't no drill, slick. Make me proud. Goddamnit! D'you tell him we need it right now? Nice shot, Lins. Forget it, Sonny. They're gone. Yeah, yeah... yeah. It's turning. How you guys doing? We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security. Now you know exactly as much as I do. So just get your gear off and get up to control. There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes. Thanks. How you feeling, big guy? Okay, Jammer. No problem. You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights. We'll stay in voice contact. Just hold onto the rope. Five more minutes. Okay? I'm taking you back out. Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just breathe easy. Hey, you okay? Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes. Okay so far. Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig. Kirkhill? That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole. Hey, Perry! Hello, Mrs. Brigman. Who then? 'Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel. Hi, lady. Oh God, Lins... I-- It is insane. WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!?? What's the plan? FUCK LOGIC!! Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up-- Don't argue, goddamnit, just-- Alright, put this on. Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time. Look at this... Time I get back you'll be-- I know! I know! But we better come up with something. I don't know how! Okay... okay. We gotta get you out of here. Son of a bitch! Can't get to it. Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools? Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this. Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us. We better get this flooding stopped. Good hundred yards, I'd say. Wonderful. There's some light from somewhere... Try again. It's flooding like a son of the bitch. You totaled it, huh? Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek. Can we negotiate later? There's Big Geek. Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh? Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side. He's jammed the mechanism. Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water. I think it likes you. Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command. He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis. And he's got a nuclear weapon. So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while? Chill out, Lindsey!! Lindsey! Wait a second-- How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'? No. God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around. Look. I'm just trying to hold this situation together. I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria-- Jesus, Lindsey-- If you say so. It could be anything. Hey, Lins... I'm glad your here. The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours. What about O-2? Need some help? What's the scoop, ace? Hippy, just relax. You're making the women nervous. What do you think he saw? His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator. Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me... But you think it's something else. What? One of ours? Fine. Be that way. Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or anything? I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh. What happened? So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW. You still seeing him? Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit. I don't know. Divorce ain't final. Forgot to take it off. Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me. No, I think you were. Come on, admit it. I think you were worried about me. You wanna know what I think? Wow, you're right! Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves. Coulda been a disaster. I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down. Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb. Who else? You never did like being called that, did you? Well, well. Mrs. Brigman. I'm switching off now. Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it. So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me. Your rig? Wasn't up to me. Hi, Lins. I thought you were in Houston. Did you find Wilhite? Coffey, we're a little pressed for time. Let's go, guys. Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around. It won't work. You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here. Look, it's three AM. These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep. You better start cutting them some slack. Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek. All right. Do it! Is that it? Is this right? Meet me in the moonpool. Move fast. Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that? Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it. Why bring it here? Yeah, for now. Our first priority's to get something to breathe. That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus. Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy. What's the matter with you? Just get around so your lights are on the hatch. God, I hate that bitch. Hafta... go on to... the moonpool. Only way. Take the first watch in sonar. Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance. One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay? 'Fish'? He's convulsing! We're here now. Let's get her done. Hey, you guys are milking that job.I can't... make it... podner. Yuh? It's his mixture! Too much oxygen! Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud. It ain't. I'm sorry... That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss. Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke. Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly. Y'all could be more specific. Missed what? You watch yourself. Okay, here we go. Start equalizing, y'all. Howdy, y'all. Hey, Lindsey! I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings. Give me that!! Just checking is out, huh? How come? Are we talkin' little space friend here? Quiet! Quiet! Hippy, you pussy. Those guys ain't so tough. I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.No. Monk, Schoenick... secure the package. We'll go in through that large breach. I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive. I can't afford slack, Brigman. We'll take reading as we go. If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away. Simple. Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission. I believe the stress is affecting you. Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer. You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't. I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras. We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion. 24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile. Radiation is nominal. The warheads must still be intact. Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. We're on a tight timeline. Wilhite, anything? Cab One, radiation readings? Cab One, do you see it yet? Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out. We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman. Lady, we better fish or cut bait.Yeah! I mean, I don't know... it looks right. Got it. Over. Yeah. The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands? It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins. Come on, man. What else could it be? Do we just leave him there? That's Perry. Everything is. No, I mean it. Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly. Something's going on. Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident. Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something. Check. Then I just hang with these guys, right? Yeah, well you never should have married her then. Virgil? SHIT! That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV. Right on! Hot rods of the Gods. Right, Lins? Hey, no really! It could be NTIs. The CIA has known about them for years. They abduct people all the time. There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who-- Turn it up, bozo. What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months? Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender. Uh, oh... 12000 feet. Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this. He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself. That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat! I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there. A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot. Okay, gimme a couple hours on this. Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy. When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit. Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada. Non-Terrestrial Intelligence. NTIs. Yeah, I like that better then UFOs. Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects. We got Russian subs creeping around. Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man. Give our folks medals, know what I mean? 1840... 50... 60... 70... Cab Three, check. Right behind you. Gotcha, Cab Three. Who is that? That You, Lindsey? You boss is having a full-on meltdown. Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside! It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe. Perry, stand by on the ROV. Sorry about this, little buddy. Better you than me, know what I mean? Hey! How deep?Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me. Yeah, okay. Okay. No! I'm okay now. I just don't... I can't go any further in. I... they're all dead, Bud. They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know... Lord Almighty. Where are we? How deep's the drop-off here? What's goin' on, Boss? Bud! Hippy's on the bitch-box. It's a call from topside. That new company man.What's the timer set for? Getting a reading? Stand by on the ROV. Check this out. Deep. It's classified... you know. Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you. Fluid breathing system. We just got them. We use it if we need to go really deep. Through three miles of water? I don't know. He's hallucinating badly. He can still make it. He's losing it. Talk to him. Keep him with us. Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria. 4800 feet. It's official. High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.No way that could just be seawater. She went front-office on you. Tighten that for me, right there. That's it. Okay, good reason. Then what? Doesn't mean you had to marry her. Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension. So there you were-- Right through the brainpan. Deader'n dogshit, boss. Piece of cake, baby. I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.What is that? You drop your dive light? Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer. Do you read, over? This is Deepcore-- You got it?! You got it? I'm alright, I'm dealing. She-hit.
