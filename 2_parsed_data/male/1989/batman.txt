Mr. Wayne is out for the day. Yes? Which bathroom is that, sir? I'd say about thirty feet, sir. Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it. Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you. Upstairs. He's quite docile. ... Very good, sir. Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly. He asked me to convey his regrets.... Murderer... What are you talking about? Take me. Let the boy go. I had to save you, Vicki. I -- -- Please trust me. Is this what you wanted? I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me. No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will. Untraceable. It's very elegant. They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source. Photo database. I'll do your photos now. So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most. They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights. Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child. That's why I wear a target on my chest. Better. It's not on the market yet. Quite a while. I took the scenic route. Thank you, Vicki. I'll take you with me. All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours. The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So -- Please. I'll have to ask you for that film. ...Not even a 'thank you'? How much do you weigh? Too many people. Come on! SHIELDS!! He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT! I know. I called them. GET IN THE CAR!!If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have... ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste. How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century? It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good. I know the feeling. It won't last. He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age. Where's the boy? It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control. Thank you, Alfred. I hope you'll excuse me. It was a great pleasure meeting you. And you. Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too. Do you want a drink? Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it? I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large. What is it you want? You're just back from Corto Maltese. I saw your combat photos. Quite a departure for you. I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale. Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it. Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me? Ohhhh... You don't mean that. In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out? All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited. All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened. Hang on. I have to leave a message. Got it! I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum. Finding out where she is. Keep her on the line! The does it. It's going to be this weekend. I feel naked without it. Very thoughtful. Don't touch it. Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save. What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one? Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process. No one would miss me. Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous? Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing. I realize... the way things have gone between us... ... I wish you'd reconsider. I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you. I know it's late. I -- Are you there? ... Looks like a convention. I said I'd call you the minute I got free. And I did -- And here we are. I don't sing very well. Maybe we should just kiss. I'll take you home if you'd like. Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it. I see. If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much. In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror. There's terror everywhere. If you train yourself to look for it. What did you see? Odd desire for anyone. No. Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. Look, I bore myself silly. Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese? Too much work. I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred. Good. With any luck we'll run into each other. I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while? Do you still think the Joker cares about money?? Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration. I suggest a nice big bomb. He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources. We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by -- Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws. All right, Bruce, what do you suggest? We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks! Boss! Jesus! They've -- WHAT?? WHAT? We got 'em!About how pretty you are, pretty boy. Maybe he'd like to know -- Got it all figured, huh? Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins. -- Maybe he don't know what we know. I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you. I'm on top of it. If there's a problem -- Sorry. We had another bat sighting.You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man. You shouldn'ta -- My brother's a priest, man. There was no blood, man. My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you... Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body. That ain't what I heard. That ain't what I heard at all. I heard the bat got him. I dunno, man. After what happened to Johnny Gobs - - Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE. Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal -- It's not the girl, Jack. Sooner or later you would've tried to take me. You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime. Jack? Thank God. I can't believe it's you. I heard you'd been -- Oh, Jack. -- Don't forget your lucky deck. Because I want someone I can trust. Very good idea, Jack. In fact -- -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.What are you talking about? Why, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future. Eckhardt... our problems are your problems. Don't let your job interfere with your business. -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent. I missed you, Lieutenant. HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!! JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK? I've died once already. It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it. Is that what you "heard"? It's me. "Sugar Bumps." I understand. Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in? Okay, a break-in. Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live. You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously. Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all... ... You made me what I am today. Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor! Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot. MOVE! Can't you do something?? They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT! SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE -- SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!! Take 'em! I want his head! That's it. Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends. I've considered that possibility. Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!! Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions! I want ten million and one. Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up. Joker here. Can we talk? Miss Vale, was it something I said? Do you want to sniff my flower? What? I improved her a little... Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask. Strong stomach, huh? I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all. ... Behind the makeup? A visual record, yes. A before-and- after kind of thing. This could make your reputation. Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you? Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe. The small one. You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment. How high up would you say that is? Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right? Because I... ... Because she'd never speak to me again. See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you. Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word. I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki. That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good. "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant. Great. Give me a grant. I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. Alexander Knox. Holy shit. Holy... Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?! HOLY SHIT!! Great. How?? What do you say? Let's head for the lights. Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way. Jesus, Vicki! Where is it?? Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope. CRAZY BAT-STARD! Not what? The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He -- -- I can't believe it. I was right!! Bruce Wayne is out of his mind. Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over. Right. And they know him. And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for -- ... Okay, then, I have a confession to make. I'm the Batman. ... Oh? Why is that, Vicki? Everybody needs a hobby. You explain it, Vicki. He walks out on his own party. Half an hour later, who turns up? Batman. Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. No place to change. Yeah? According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva. Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master. Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to? Yep. He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop? Jim Gordon Nice snap, huh? Pulitzer Prize, 1963. Why? Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious. I do this for a living. There's a phone. You can call him up and cancel. Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through women. Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up and asked you for a date? Shit. HEY, MIRANDA! C'MERE! Now pay close attention to this. Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne. Well, he must like the way he looks. He's got a mirror in every room. What were you thinking? Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. This guy must be the most worthless man in America. I bet they like him for his big charity balls. Likes to kill? KNOX Women find him magnetic. Holy shit... Where does one man get all this junk? Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually know all these people? Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger? Oh, absolutely. Bruce and I are very close. Small so far. I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent. Oh, it's too good. We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers. God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this. Too much glamor, huh. What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo? Apes in Kenya? Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. If I had a good enough hint.Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect. All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in -- I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'Do you want this money or don't you? Now shut up! Shut up -- No wonder you're such a chickenshit. Now shut up. There ain't no bat. God! How old are you? There ain't no bat. No shit. It was all over the pavement. Gimme a break, will you? Shut up. Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right? No big loss. What are you, scared of heights?That's it? And what happens if we say no? I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
