Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help? Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language. Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on. ... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him. I don't think he'd feel it. Maybe we should bail? Getting very weird. This the right place? This should be it... First decent idea you've had. ... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side. Nick, we can't just -- Hey, when in Rome -- I didn't know. You didn't take, did you...? You hear things. I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me. Nick, have I been a good partner? Nick... You up? Where is the subway station, please. Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York. You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla. I call, right? I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days. You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene. They say we got to turn around and come right back. That's what they say. I got a plan. What are you missing? Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia. ... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere. What are you doing? Maybe we should do something? The Wolf? What? I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him. Who do you think the Jap is? What are they doing now? Whoa, I knew you were going to say that. I absolutely anticipated that, Nick. But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him -- ... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's -- Nick, let's go hunting. Bag Cavello. I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater. Why? Back-up. Let go... So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust? Wait up. You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window -- Hey, hey, where you goin'? ... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine. I think you did great. Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs. I think she got to you, pappy. Hey, all right. What does Ichiro mean, anyway? You all right? You okay? You cool, Ich? What'd she say? Pussy, ass, soft personnel.What does Charlie mean? Cool? That I should let you pay for the drinks. Kampai. Joyce can be nice. Squid? How can you be so sure? Think we'll get him, Nick? Louder, pal, louder. Yes... Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla. You know, Nick, we can't lose. Luck. I'm sorry. Thank you. You have one? Someone attacked him. I don't know. I couldn't tell. I followed them. An hour from the train station. I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting. I like him waiting. Kampai. I can't... No. Nick, you can't do this. No... For Sugai. Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you. Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick. No. I won't put myself in danger for you anymore. It's illegal, Nick. It's very small. He'll never speak to a Gaiijin. What...? Why? A resort city, Beppu. Nick! San is an honorable title. Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san. ... A Godfather. His man was killed at the printing plant. Nick -- I'm not drunk... You can trust me. I'll check it out. You can't come in. They don't want -- You were too far behind. Yakuza. Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue -- Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki -- Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous... Nick... Sure. You toler -- yes, tolerate me. There she is! Nick... You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.' Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days. He might not even be in Tokyo. He says they're very nice. He wants to know if you have anymore. We can ask someone I used to work with. A criminal. Someone I pay money to... I stole them. I've continued working on the case! I'll get him for you, Nick. You must leave? I couldn't keep up. My shame is complete. It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we... ... keep something of their's. A tie, a pen. They made you leave your hotel... ... you caused a disturbance. I don't, that's all. I don't deserve Ohashi's respect. It's Ichiro. Ich. Nick! ... We got to keep looking. Track him down! Great balls of fire! No, this is the place for the young Yakuza. "Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire." To the killer. Jerry Lee Lewis. The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's. And call me Ich. Where would you look for the mafia?Then take it from him. Don't be. This is my stop. She's such a long way home for you. I like your friend, Joyce. You're lucky. You are a lucky man. Where you come from a man can stand out. It's expected. Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out. Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules. Looking in. Always afraid. Ugly little lives... Keep the change.Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket... He couldn't find his ass with both hands. It's incredible. Hit him or something. I'd feel better if we had some heat. I hope not. You said that in the last two places. Let's grab some food. I said let's go, Charlie. Let's go. In Rome, I'll bow. Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun. The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad. I was new, didn't know shit. When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor. It's on the top of my personnel file. They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way. I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie. Go to sleep, Charlie. Number five with a bullet. No. What'd you say? Not a prayer. Beats forty hours on a plane. I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas. Saving your life. Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm. Some party. Frank Abolofia. Charlie, don't do anything. Promise me? Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know? Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked. -- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up. -- I should tear your head off. Charlie... It's not regulation. And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat. Get rid of it. What's this? He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City. Casinos. -- Cavello. Ronnie Cavello. Home. Thanks. You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor. And don't call me 'pappy.' Are you expecting anyone? Give me a break, would you? High spirits, desire, commitment. Connie... Short shift? We can't lose. Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you? Call for help. You all right? Why's that? What's that for? Me too. A wife. She left. Now we've got nothing to negotiate with. We need the plate to negotiate with. Joyce? How many men? I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me. You did great, Ichiro. Just one, compadre... Kampai. Start it. Not now, man, okay, not now. Work with me. Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside. It's done. You don't have to come. Let's go. Him first. So I bring some cheese? What's in the box? It's a new deal. ... coming with me tomorrow? Big enough. I'll be a nice Gaiijin. Because he knows how to get to our man. I want to go talk to him. Where does this Sugai live? A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him. Ich, my name is Nick. Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick. I want to yank Kobo. Shut-up. We're through. I mean it. This is the end of the line, Matsumoto. If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend -- Gaiijin. She disappeared... shit! Good. Very good... Smells like Bayonne at low tide. Ichiro -- Four goddamn days. This is going nowhere... If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside. You're doing fine, Ich. Now drop it, okay? Are we getting married? Did I say that? What'd I tell you? No. Don't say anything. Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize! Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night. What's he saying? A snitch? Know her? How'd you get this? I can see that. Yeah... Why weren't you at the platform? What happened? Why the hell not? You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever. Leave the rice cake outside and go home! Give us a break... What's the problem here? That's what you said in the last three piss pots. Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's. Let's book, Charlie. If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night. Where're you going, Ichiro? Where do we start looking for this guy? I'd like that. Might be different in New York. Can't make you change your mind? What if I chant? Why would you care? No one's keeping him here. We're in? Tell them I'm not. Who am I supposed to be? I don't remember you saying no. Not if it works. I'll meet you at the train? What do you chant? Where's the wife? He drinks. You could fake it. It's my last shot. I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night. I need someone to translate for me. Unavailable. I need your help, Joyce. You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying. He's on duty. Sure, but then I just pull out the photos. Maybe I'm a quicker learner. You have a helluva way of answering. You can count on the truth from people who don't like you. I could use some help. Show me around. I'll pay you for your time. Gaiijin? There was a change in plans. Don't give him any more. Sugai won't give it to me, you know that. I'm amused. Time, I've got plenty of. Guess I'm on a roll. Save it, I already took the tour. I'm taking you back. Right. He killed a police officer. I planned on catching him, Captain. He was my partner. Why me? What...? What if I say no? What? Why? Yeah. Not in that company. This by this... I have to get to Sugai. If anything happens to her while I'm here -- For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help. Let me out of here! Hey...! HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR! While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch. What's this? Can we skip the poetry, inspector? Because I want you to tell me. Could you fill me in? Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this. Work with me. I want your best detective. We're police officers. I want a gun. Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents. After a court convicts him. He belongs to me. That wasn't our deal. Good. I don't have to. If I say no? With these? You trust me? Why tell me this? The Feds would be onto you in a month. The families who control the casinos? I want him. I'm impressed. But let's use the short form. I'm looking for --Goodbye, officer. -- Do you know where she is, detective? Do you know how to find her? Even where to start? We will find them. You had my help, detective. Your plane leaves at six. Two officers will escort you. Twenty-four hours, detective. Look. Your visa has expired. Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported. The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here. Why don't you ask your chief detective? Do you know what this is? You're foreigners. It is not allowed. You lost a man we wanted for some time. It was very incompetent on your part, officer.... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds. They'll be all over Abolofia's place. Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time. Your plane's at nine a.m. Be on it. That's orders. Period. How? You don't know the place. You don't know the language. Get on the plane. They're blaming it on you. Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner! It's not your job. They said send a detective if I could spare one. I can always spare you. Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan. It's a nice, safe country. You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight. He's wanted in Japan. They want him first. Then we can have him. Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers. The Japanese embassy is very interested. Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective. One guy do all the damage? The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer. Hotel room and rental car were full of it. Dope? How big a package we talking about?
