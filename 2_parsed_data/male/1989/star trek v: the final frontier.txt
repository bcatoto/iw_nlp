My pain? Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly. Bring me the ship or I will destroy you! He doubts me. You doubt me? Then I shall make use of this starship. This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier? And how did you breach the Barrier? Magnificent. You are the first to find me. It is I. The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle! Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down. Rescued at last. But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position. Following new course. Warp seven. New course? You have no authority. What's going on here? Sulu, what are you doing? And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates. Admit it. We're lost. What's Emergency Landing Plan B? DO it. Go to Red Alert. Raise shields. Position, Bird of Prey?I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces. We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances. You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet. This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences. This is the Starship Enterprise.No, but you can bet they will. Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely. Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk. The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs... The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages. I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III. Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we? Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.Understood. Kirk out. Have the Klingons responded? Oh, please. With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant. On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?" You caught me on my way to the shower. Bob? Can we have it quiet? Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now! Mr. Scott, you're amazing. Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it. Which way to the turbo shaft? If we could send a distress signal... Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way. I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott. Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on. You told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened? Go, Sulu. Transporter room. Status. Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth. Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu. Put it on the screen. Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please? Why didn't you beep my communicator? Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back. Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart Spock? Spock, I thought I was going to die. Spock? What is this? Spock... don't. Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge. To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge. Spock. Fire the rockets! Spock... the booster rockets. It must be all those marsh melons. Hmmm? The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here. New word. "b".. "a"... um... "a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word. You're right. I'm a little out of practice. Uh....that's an "s." That's a little vague, Spock - Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not. But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned. Is what possible? This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he? How do you know? There's got to be a way out of this place. He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's... Why didn't you tell me this before? I gotta sit down. There, you see? See? You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother. You mean he's your brother brother? You made that up! Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't... I ordered you to defend this ship. You stay out of this! Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger. Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass! What you have done is betray every man on this ship. Damnit, Spock. God damnit! Let me do something. An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him. Be one with the horse. Spock. We don't have 1.2 hours. Mr. Sulu. Execute. That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City. Damn. Let's go. Fascinating. Why? What do you mean? Who is it he reminds you of? But he does seem familiar? Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan? What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost. General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd. Not General Korrd. I could use a shower. Goodnight, Spock. Goodnight, Bones. Go to sleep, Spock. Yes, Spock? Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim. Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in? The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in. Doctor, if you please. "Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..." Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?" "Pack Up Your Troubles." That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing? What are you doing? I've always known... I'll die alone. Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me. Oh, God Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one... On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while? MM.? Because it's there. I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain... Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods? Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully... What makes you think I won't turn us around? No special conditions? About the ship... You are mad! Your vision? Wait! You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier. No. I refuse. No... I didn't. Spock... What have you done to my friends? The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew? I'm afraid of nothing. You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier. I'll take you to the bridge. In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually. Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take- James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know. Perhaps I have a way to bring one here. What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship. Join my quest. The power was within you. Let us explore it together. Your pain runs deep. Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.I don't have a clue. But the shuttle- Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked. Closing. Shuttle en route. She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you. Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it. Captain, we can't trust anyone now. Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up. Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push. Aye, Captain How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job... I think you gave me too much time, Captain. Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition. Or yours. He's not? Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise. They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard. Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most. Uhura, I thought you were on leave. "Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we? Borgus Frat.I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother. Not possible. You were never alone. Welcome aboard, Captain. I believe we are witnessing my birth. It's all right, Captain. Proceed. ...mark two. The emergency channel, open. If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate. It would appear we are too heavy. Uh-uh. I believe I have found a faster way. There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room. "c."... "k." A "t." I am here, Captain. Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known. There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist. That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan. Is it possible? He did have pointed ears. The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape. This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof. I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry. Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers. I have a half brother. Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother. I did not. No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek. You ordered me to kill my brother. If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead. If you think it would help. Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me. Captain, what have I done - You must allow us to act. Exactly 15.5 seconds. Yes, Captain. Yes, Captain? At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours. To land any closer would risk detection. Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563. Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear. When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return. He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic. He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors. The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief. There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary. I do not often think of the past. He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth. I cannot be certain. Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have. The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command. Yes. Goodnight, Doctor. Yes, Captain. Life is not a dream. Jim. Captain? I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words. That song did not come up in my research, Captain. Are we leaving, Captain? Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong. I am preparing to toast a marsh melon. I don't understand. Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain. Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock. I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods. I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation. Ah, Captain? And that is? I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken. I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me. Sybok, we must find a way... Sybok. Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God! Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you. I belong here. I cannot go with you. Do you? I hide no pain. No. I will not. Sybok, you must surrender. I am a Starfleet Officer. It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-It runs deep. Share it with me. I couldn't help but notice you pain. The ship.... No, no, it's not possible. Why? Why have you done this to my friend? He has his doubts... It will be your chariot! It could. Yes. With a starship! We sought only your infinite wisdom. It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it. Qual se tu? Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted. What's going on? Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates. Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind? A Federation starship. Spock... What have I done? Because you, too, must know. No conditions. The ship needs its Captain. Am I? We'll see. Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side. But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true? Now learn something about yourself. I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that? I don't control minds. I free them. Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality. What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear. Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out? I trust your message was received? We must change our course at once. What are you doing? No! No reply. Remain on course. But I thought Captain Chekov.. I see. Very clever, Captain. Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say? Who are you? I must have your starship. No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me. This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity... I don't understand.. Reveal yourself to me! I don't understand... Why not? Spock? I know you better than that. Each man's pain is unique. You know I'm right. Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk. Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge? No. You must kill me. Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help. I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big. Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
