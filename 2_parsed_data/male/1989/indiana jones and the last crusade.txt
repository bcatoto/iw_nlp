May we go home now, please? Did you say...? Uh, uh... Yes. Yes. My reputation precedes me. Oh, what?... your servant, sir. Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh... Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies? Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour. Oh, Sallah! What a relief! Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly! What about you? Yes. Now we know. Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city. Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map. It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm... Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean. Look, Indy. The Roman numerals! Where? It looks like a converted church. Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him? I'll tell him we'll take two. But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith. The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly. What is it? It's today's mail. And it's been opened. What has the old fool got himself into now? Yes. My treat. Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection. All your life. You've got it! Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way! Haaa! No, Henry. Try not to talk. Look what you did! But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword. Henry, the pen -- Henry! What are you doing here?! Arghhh! Oh! You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend. I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit... Oh, well. That's good. Thank you. Schneider? Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse. Tapestries? Are you expected?Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind. Care to wet your whistle, Marcus? I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal. Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you. We're through! You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right. Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo. The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me. Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history? Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones? We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared. We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail. You could be more right than you know. This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would. This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete. Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy. As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away. Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones. Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact. Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway. Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail! Every man's dream. Including your father's, I believe. Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail. Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to! The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea. My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper. Can you translate the inscription? That was our assessment as well. Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. Have a look over here. This might interest you. My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.Got lost in his own museum, huh? The Name of God... The Word of God... It's war. What? It's a rescue, old boy. Come on. Marcus! After you, Junior. Ready. We named the dog Indiana. What did you find, Junior? Me?... Illumination. Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize. Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!! But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I". Penitent. Penitent... The penitent man. The penitent... "Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass." Junior... You call this archaeology? Now, who are all these people? What do you think you're doing?! Get down! This is intolerable! It's a new experience for me. Those people are trying to kill us! Nice landing. More or less. Son, I'm sorry. They got us. What happens at eleven o'clock? I didn't know you could fly a plane. I don't know. We'll find out. Then what are you complaining about? Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges. "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth." Very well. I'm here now. You left just when you were becoming interesting. Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance. Actually, I was a wonderful father. And do I detect a rebuke? Hmmm... What did we talk about? Ships that pass in the night... Well, I'm as human as the next man. You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience. When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment. Good. What did you get? Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her. That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me? Marcus would agree with me. Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail. I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember. Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm. Three devices of such lethal cunning. Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge. There is more in the Diary than just the map. My Diary's in Berlin. You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin! Stop! Stop! Stop! What about the boat? We're not going on the boat? ...the solution presents itself. This is intolerable! Oh. What? What? What? And the chair. The floor's on fire! See?! I ought to tell you something. Feels like a cigarette lighter. What am I looking for? You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear! So did I. She talks in her sleep. Umh? Don't worry. He won't. Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?? Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? So it wouldn't fall into their hands!! I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers. You did!! You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you? They want my diary. Rats? If only I could have been with you. ...you did it. Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior... And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...? He was actually there? You saw him? I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard? Through the library? Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it. Good point. Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them. Thank God! I'll never forgive myself -- Oh, it breaks the heart. But what are you doing here? It is you Junior! Junior! Then wait -- count to twenty. Out!It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God. I'm going after Dad. Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun. Alexandretta. Now we know. The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon." But where exactly? How's the head? Dad was onto something here! Marcus -- I've seen this window before. That doesn't look much like a library. I don't know. Maybe he'll know us. Ah, Venice... Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now. Do you believe the Grail actually exists? Do you believe, Marcus? It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me? Venice, Italy! Dad? I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head! Your treat. All my life! You know how long I've been looking for that?! Marcus! I did it! How dare he?! Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries? Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries. I'm through! Shooting me won't get you anywhere. As what? A Nazi stooge like you? DONOVAN! You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father? Yes? That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet. I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think. What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing. An old man's dream. The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before. "Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever." Where did this come from? Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think. I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive. Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you. Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here. Elsa! Elsa, don't move! I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up. All I have to do is squeeze. Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think? My father didn't want it incinerated. Where is it? I want it. So it did. This one. I think he's in here. Don't know. Think of something. What do you know about this place? No. You like the way I do things. Knock it off. You're not mad. At least I let you tag along. Uh-huh. This. Mine, too. I said don't go between them! I said go around! Don't wander off. He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them! It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet. It must be one of these... Pretty sure. The Ark of the Covenant. Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades. Except he's lost, and I'm not. Bingo. My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves. Tomorrow I'll steal you another. It would make me very happy. I usually don't either. Fraulein -- will you permit me? Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy! And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you. Yes? Yes, sir! Haaa! Uh-huh. Ready? I like Indiana. Junior?! Dad... What did you find, Dad? I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad. "J". The penitent man is humble... The penitent man is humble before God. The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man... Dad?! Get out of there, Dad! Dad? Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation. Dad, we're well out of range. This could be close. It happens to me all the time. I know, Dad! Thanks. Dad, are we hit?! Dad -- eleven o'clock!! Fly... yes. Land... no. What does that mean? Well... I can't think of anything. Dad, how can you? What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years. When? A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that. We didn't talk. We never talked. Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake. I was the next man. That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather! Relax. I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany. This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom. Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ! What about Marcus? Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den? But what are they? Can't you remember? Booby traps? What final challenge? All right Dad -- tell me. You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map. Brody's this way. What? Come on, Dad. Come on! Dad! I'm out, Dad! Head for the fireplace! Dad! Dad! Dad! All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do. What??? Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here. Try and burn through the ropes. My lucky charm. Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum! Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do! Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better. How did you she was a Nazi? She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi? No! Don't Shoot! I came here to save you. Will you take it easy! Look, can we discuss this later? Well, uh... Yeah? Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad? There were rats, Dad. No, Dad. You did. Forty years. Alexandretta. It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy. Well, what was left of him. Found it. Right. I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs. Dad, they come in through the doors. No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here. Don't worry -- I'm fine. And the head. You hit me, Dad! I came to get you! What do you think? Don't call me that, please. No, Dad. You listen to me -- It's important! Dad! I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean? That was seven hundred years ago. Who are you? Where's my father? Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count? No camels! I don't need camels. I'm going after those horses. Come on -- come on! What happened to Marcus, Sallah? I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father. And why were you trying to kill me? Who are you? All right! Where's my father This is your last chance. Then we'll die. Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me! My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too? Why are you trying to kill us?In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours? The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe. My name is Kazim. If you let me go, I will tell you where he is. No, Doctor Jones. It's yours! My soul is prepared. How's yours? If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die. No. Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me. You're strangely dressed... for a knight. A long time to wait. The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it. I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.The dog!? You are named after the dog... Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Run! Papers, sir. Got it here. There is no museum in Iskenderun. And I am his. Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going? You are on your own? Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy? They have them. In the belly of that steel beast. Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody -- But, Indy -- I'll take the camels. That car belonged to my brother-in- law. Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them. Get that camel out of the way!
