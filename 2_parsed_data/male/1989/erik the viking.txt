But, Aud... I... I came to find someone... No... no... There is something I must ask the Gods... Not quite... The second note to wake the Gods... Yes -- I believe you do. I... but I... Of course. I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this! That's right! And thanks for the Cloak Invisible! Goodbye, Aud... No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him. I'll bring it back. Where's the Cloak Invisible? Just give me a hand. Halfdan the Black. We mustn't let him land! And the week before that? Five this week; how many the week before? And I thought you said it was something special... "The fifth one this week"! I've never been to bed with anybody! You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you? We never went to bed together. Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well... It was different... HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else? You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else? What... you mean "got into bed with" them? Yes. What? What's the matter? These? What are THESE? They're swords. What are what? How d'you KNOW we're "friends"? WELCOME? WHAT did you say? We blew the Horn Resounding. But... How is it you can see me? You can all see me? But -- LOKI! Where did YOU come from? And will the dead ever return, Freya? I will go and wake them up! Is there nothing men can do? Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue... The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is. It is day, of course, Freya. I see the world. I shouldn't have come. But it IS! Look! Yes... oh, yes... Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big. You don't know Halfdan the Black. He wants to kill US! Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder! He's trying to stop us waking the Gods. They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow! You've got to let me go! Yes? The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf. Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword... No. No, no... It was very... er, nice. No. Really. Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing. Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us. No... no... We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we? I'm sure it's lovely. Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is... Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and -- That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're... Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing. How? No... we don't... I don't know! I just did! Odin! Is THAT Odin? Well... no... I'll ask the Gods to give you life again! Why? I've come to take you back to the land of the living. Tell me your name? Why should you care? You told them I raped you -- why? I didn't mean to! Oh, thanks. Louder. Scream. I just said I didn't feel like raping you. Oh! Stop talking as if we were married! To pay for the next expedition, of course. Oh well -- you've GOT to do them. Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all. About NOT raping you... I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone. I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all? I don't suppose... no... No. It isn't rape then, is it? No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people... Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em. Sh! Shut up. Yes. Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast. It's not magic! It's just a trick! But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn! I know! You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed? What's wrong with making friends? No. How deep IS the ocean? It saved my father! I know. Snorri! Get your oar out! Come on, move it! He was lucky... Sit there. What? "But" what? Find it... AND cross it! I... I... KILLED her... She got me thinking... I met this girl... Where does it all get us, Grandpa? We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet... What's it all about? Faster! Slower! In... Out... Slower! Nobody can row at that speed! Row! Row! Row! Well, you ARE! Look out! You'll see! What "magic"? Look, the sky is blue... ROW! Shut up. You there. You there and you there. What are YOU doing here? But you're the Gods! Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed. Because... you're... you're the Gods.... Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time. You must help us. You'll be sucked down too! No! Let go, Snorri! Oh... I feel a little... oh... To the oars! Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men. Well, come on! Row! That's better. That's true. You'd better sit there. You there, and Ornulf there. Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there... Now stop it! No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods. Right. Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent... Oh... right! Well... CHEERS everybody! What's the matter with them? Oh... er... yes... Nobody gets killed. There is another way. What are you talking about? So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! How about making friends? And you, Keitel Blacksmith. What do you think? What's the matter with Bjorn? Keitel Blacksmith? I have to go... Sven! We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard... Is THIS Hy-Brasil? She MUST have a knife or something... ROW! We haven't got a spare place. Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING? It doesn't matter WHERE you sit! Hey, you two! What's going on? I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try. We'd be the first! What's the matter? Are you afraid to try? What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge? And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?No, don't say anything else! I think we should go... Just say something cheerful. You need to say a bit more than that! Who gets killed?That's my boy! So? What'd you do to her? It's always the women that start the trouble. Who have you been talking to? You talking piffle, son? What? We're missing all the fun...Well, where is he then? Vanish into thin air? How did he do that? Nothing... I just immerse you in water... It can't do you any HARM... What's all the panic about? Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick." You know, my son, our lord said... No, it is NOT. Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian. Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert... I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.Make your mind up. Sorry! Sorry. I want to die... No, I don't! He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway. Oh! Who cares? We're HOME! That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory. That's it! Bastard. Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL. I know. I know. How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick? No, I'm not.Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge! What is it? Well, what else do we do? But... But how could he know... unless... Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place. Wait, Erik! For your own sake... For the others... I... I'm not worth risking your life for. Let me go, Sven. Aaagh! Get away, Snorri. What? It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... I... I... It's not my business any more! Made by YOU, Loki! Like you got rid of Snorri! We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt! No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you! She knows it was our fault! Help! You'll drown us bo... Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot! Relax! YOU do it! How can we stops him now? Well... I... I thought... Together we stand! The Blacksmith's Code says I must... My brother blacksmiths! The bottom falls out of the sword business! They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky... Can't make enough axe-heads! Can't make enough swords! Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says... Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you... It's all right! It isn't happening! But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her... She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day. I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic... Ah! So you admit there IS someone! Well... where is he? Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course! Right! Where is he? Open up! I know you're in there! Open up! I know you're in there! The important thing is not to panic. Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning. Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing. You DO know how to play the horn, don't you? Is there something the matter with it? I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand. Not when we explain about the Great Blessing. Don't talk nonsense. Why? It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well... Careful! They're not supposed to hurt you. I'll tell you what... YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing... Well, how d'you think I feel? They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die! Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it? We're just not a very musical nation... Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM" And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to? REALLY? You're just saying that. But you don't want to hear it. A lot of people like our singing. You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you? What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing? Would you like us to sing to you? Well... isn't it great? Well... for a start... er... there's no killing... The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky. You will wait? Bye... sorry...SHE blew the Horn Resounding. How do we know this is the way? What d'you mean? It was my master Keitel's idea. Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans. By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business... I should have got rid of you long ago! You fool! You've lost your mind. Keep your mouth shut, Keitel! Shut up! Help! Help! I'm drowning! Help! I can't swim! I can't swim! You'll be able to throw it further than I could. Sh! Hurry! Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods? Wasn't it, Keitel? You can't let Erik do THAT. Honour and protect all blacksmiths. That's right. It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths. The Age of Ragnarok ends... But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods.. If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us. Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"... You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it. You could charge him what you like. Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.Look... Erik... Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other. So? Why should WE care? We don't HAVE to help anybody.No! Arrgh! I've got you! Weren't we supposed to? A magic dishcloth. Like fish. First we're flying -- now we're sinking! Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat? Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other. Now you've got all the big ones on one side. You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time. Trust me to get the missionary. It's SO nice to feel wanted. Thank you VERY much indeed. You mean we'd be dead? I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord. Your lord. Same thing, isn't it? There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER. You're wasting your time. You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard. What have you got there? What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith? Oh... Who's that? Well! Come on!I came to find my grandfather. Let me do something for myself for a change! Over the Edge of the World. Hy-Brasil? She hasn't got any. DEATH! I AM one, Dad! I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time. Yes it does! We could be at sea for months. Look, I bagged it last week. I was sitting there. But HOW? Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard. Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik. What are you talking about, Erik? I will join my grandfather there. Hang on... I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too... What are you talking about? Got you! Dad! Easy, Dad! There is nothing we can do... GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad! I'm just building up to it, Dad. Well, of course he is! DEATH TO DRAGONS! KILL! KILL! I must KILL! Kill! We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill! I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES! I must only let the red rage... But it's a responsibility... So did your father... You went berserk... I know, Dad. Tell him I'm coming! You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla! Thorfinn! You can't die! Shut up. Well... I'm game. Neither am I. You liar!What did he say? What "magic" have you brought, Erik? I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight. It's magic. The sun! That's it! SHUT UP! Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif. You may need a real Berserk. He hasn't. Do what? What do we have to do? The Dragon... I hate you! I hate you! And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"... He drove me mad! Helpless... Well, go on! Go berserk! There! THAT'S a true Berserk. Sh! HOLD it! HOLD it in! Stop it! It's no good going berserk against a dragon! Not now, Sven... You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle. But it's a responsibility being a Berserk. So did my father and his father before him. I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald... I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair... It's a tradition.Don't you FEEL it? I know. I know. He wants to KILL us. Halfdan the Black's here! That's terrible! You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends". Let's hack her to pieces. Very deep... usually... Erik! Row! What are you doing? It's Halfdan the Black! What are you talking about? Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night. But... FIND the Rainbow Bridge? Mum! Dad! Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that! And a sort of slightly sick feeling? Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach? He used to puke in his sleep. Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke. I mean many of the greatest sailors were. You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know. Are you all right? No... he's not... not... there... I'm not frightened... of anything... Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla. Me too. Well I'M certainly not, either. He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age! I never do... Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad. No, Mother. Yes, Mum. Yes, Mother.
