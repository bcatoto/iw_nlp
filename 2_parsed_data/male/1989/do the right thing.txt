My brother. You got my back. We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there. He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers. Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy? I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint. Ya see what I'm saying? Check this out. Y'know Sal's. I like 'em, but you don't play anything else. Is that the only tape you got? How you be? If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS. What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for? Motherfuck gentrification. Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street? Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block? Who told you to be in my neighborhood? I'll fuck you up quick two times. Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me?" You almost knocked me down. The word is "excuse me." Yo! Jade, I still love you. So, in other words, you are not down. Yeah, I asked him. I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's. He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall. And I--we--want some Black people up. Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian. Have you noticed something about them? Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame? Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa? No, are you? We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame. What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures? Boycott Sal's. Boycott Sal's. Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say. Two dollars! Forget it! Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker. How much? It's so nice to see a family hanging out together. No. I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world. You the man. I'm cool. I'm cool. Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here? How come you ain't got no brothers up? Mookie.I'm gonna leave now. I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases. I own a brownstone on this block. Excuse me. I'm very sorry. Yes?Squash it. I don't know how he does it. No! How long? It's been about a year. Make it plain. As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest. You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?I hope the block is still standing. Where did you sleep? I've done that before. Is it a good morning? I thank you. I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama. Maybe I should be heroic more often. I wasn't trying to be a hero. I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think. If I did, I might not have done it in second thought. Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. I'm not stopping. I'm on my way. I didn't know you had such beautiful hair. One day you'll be nice to me. We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice. At least civil. Besides that. Da Mayor don't bother nobody. Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you. Da Mayor just mind his business. I love everybody. I even love you. Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you? That's it. Doctor, always try to do the right thing. Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'. C'mere, Doctor. Mookie. You got a deal. Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches. Listen to me. How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor? Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store. How much will it cost me? What makes Sammy run? What makes Sammy run? How old are you?Fifty cents. How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying? I said my name is Eddie Lovell. My name is Eddie. Ten. Eddie Lovell.Motherfucker you. How many you say? C Duracell. Twenty "C" Duracells.WAKE UP! Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn. Here ya are. Keep the change. Alright. Let me play this record while I go to work on my chicken Parmigiana hero with extra cheese and extra sauce. C'mon, don't be shy. Mmm, smells good. This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie? What can you say? No! Too long! Too long. Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out. Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb. A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time. OK, but listen up. I'm gonna break it down. What was you saying? Don't worry about it. But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either. Him no white. Him no white. Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks. ML stands for ML. That's it. Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that. Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms. What? It's a motherfucking shame. Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street. I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place. Can ya dig it? Do I have to spell it out? Sweet Dick Willie. It's a fucking shame. Look at that. I'll be back on my feet. Soon enough. Don't worry about it.We're not hanging out. I'm being escorted back to work. No, you the man. You the man. Come back in a week, it will be squashed. Buggin' Out, I gotta work here. Ask Sal. What? That's it? OK. OK. Gotta go. Pretty soon I'll be making a move. I'm getting paid... One has nuthin' to do with the other. I might be, but you're not welcome here. You should see the way he looks at you. All Sal wants to do is hide the salami. Innocent! Nice! Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you. No, you're tripping. Don't come in Sal's. Alright, read my lips. Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'. I'll see you out. Yo, I'm gone. I'm coming. What responsibilities? Don't worry 'bout me. I always get paid. Slavery days are over. My name ain't Kunta Kinte. Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me. Later for Sal.

Can you pay me now? Sal, can you do me a favor? Big deal? If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is. Be off in a second. Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Se�or Love Daddy's show to you.

Tina, you're sweating. No rawness. Why you gotta curse? I'm gonna take off ya clothes. Trust me. Trust me. Then we'll do something else. A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.

It's e-vit-able. I didn't know you could read. Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black. That's what I think. Vito, what do you say? Sounds funny to me. As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers." And not Larry Bird? Who's your favorite movie star? Who's your favorite basketball player? Gotta go. See ya soon. Everybody happy now? Remember what I said. Smack him back. People are free to do what they wanna do. Who don't work? Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs. No elevator either and shit. Da Mayor ain't no bum. Fuck dat shit. I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for. Just coolin'. Hello, Sal. Hello, Vito. Pino, no joke. C'mon, answer. Pino, I work hard like everybody in here. We're outta here. That's what I think. If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life. Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass. Ya like him, huh? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I just got here. You sweep. I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow. I love you, Black. I understand. I'm listening. That's the dope. I'll be back after I make this delivery. Whaddup.

Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan. Keep dreaming. Fuck you. Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise. "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past." You really believe that shit? Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you? Shut up. The Boss! Bruuucce!!!! Eddie Murphy. Magic Johnson. You deaf or what? What? You talk to 'em. Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk. What do we pay Mookie for? He don't even work. I work harder than him and I'm your own son. Pop, I don't believe this shit. We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum-- You get paid to do what we say. Shaddup, Vito. You're still late. Mookie, late again. How many times I gotta tell you? And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout. Be on guard. Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him. I know so. He, them, they're not to be trusted. I know. Mookie is not to be trusted. No Moulan Yan can be trusted. The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here. In the back. You listening to me? Good. Vito, you trust that Mook too much. So does Pop. Good. I want you to listen. I love you. My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies. Fuck you and stay off the phone. Sez me. Me and you are gonna have a talk. Get the broom. He's nuts. Be right there, Pop. Listen to what I said. Pop, stop lying. 'Bout time, Pop. Pop, what else can I say? I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here. We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst. I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood. I don't like being around them, they're animals. Then we could try something else. Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood? Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive. Turn it off. Twenty minutes. How come you niggers are so stupid? Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on... See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders. He's making us lose business. C'mere. Don't get too friendly with da Mook.

Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.My brother. Ya back is got. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. Talk to me. I almost had to yoke him this afternoon. Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please. Who the fuck he think he is? Don Corleone and shit. Yeah, I know dat motherfucker. I don't like anything else. You don't like Public Enemy? It's the dope shit. I be. I'm living large. Twenty! Motherfucker! Twenty! D! D! D! You dumb motherfucker. Learn how to speak English first. D. D, not C. Twenty "D" Duracells. I love you, my brother. Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you... HATE! I just copped them. Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil. On the rebound. I was going to buy a slice.It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.

Keep it. Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone. How much? How much do I owe you? You don't know shit about shit. Do we now? We both do. You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time. Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed. Mookie, I always liked you. Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you. Whatdafuck do you want? Where we goin'? You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said. I didn't say nuthin'. You must have a guilty conscience. What are you guilty of? Yeah, do you know 'em? Here, you gotta delivery. Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it. Tonight, when we close. You know you don't get paid till we close tonight. We're still open. Can't do. Depends. Mookie! How is anybody gonna call in? Mookie, get offa da phone. Mookie, what took you so long? I got a business to run. Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome. Mookie, no cursing in the store. Hey! What did I say? Vito! Pino! Let's go. Shaddup! Jade, what can I fix you? You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys. So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority. I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none. This is America. Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all? Well, you don't. I'm your father, you better remember that. I didn't think so. We don't know nuthin' else. Too many pizzerias already there. Since when do you know what's best for us? Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think. You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers. Mookie, you're fucking up. That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito. I should have Vito go with you all the time. Pino, relax, will ya. Can you do better? I didn't think so.
