... Good evening, Louise. I see. Is his back feeling better? Good morning, Louise. ... I see. Yes. I've seen that done. ... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white. Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people. Yes. It is. Yes, I'm very hungry. I'm going to work in the garden. Yes. Goodbye, Louise. ... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it... Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born... ... Would you take me on a tour? Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one. ... Why... Hello, we thought we heard something...  I'm Thomas Franklin. Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener. ... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes. Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you. Yes. ... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate. Yes, Thomas - I understand. ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment? Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch. Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here? Yes. Louise will bring me lunch. Louise?... The maid?... But she should have left earlier today... I see... ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here? I live here. You live here? ... We don't have any record of that. Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas? ... How long have you been living here? Ever since I can remember, since I was a child. Since you were a child? Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden. ... Then you really are a gardener? Yes. Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance. Oh. Thank you. Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents? No. How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed? Compensated...? How were you paid? I was given meals, and a home... What about money? I never needed money. Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook? No, I do not have any of those. Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist? I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors. ... Joe? Who's Joe? Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952. 1952...? Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book. Some pictures...? Yes. Of men and women. ... Oh. Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago. Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there. Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine. Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden. ... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance. You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need? Have you served in the Army? No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television. How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes? No. Those trees were very young when I first arrived. Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance? No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers. Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance? No. That's where Joe fixed the bricks. ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance? No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile. You never been in a car? ... Well... From time to time I did sit in it... Just in here... It hasn't been outside since the Old Man hurt himself. I live in here. The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control. He has one just like it. Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased. Yes, I understand. I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats. It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style. Yes. I have seen styles on television. What are your plans now, Mr. Chance? I would like to stay and work in my garden. ... What do you make of all this? I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming... ... Yeah... ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think... Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure... ... Let's just keep everything legal. Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate. I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim. Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect. No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign. Come now, Mr. Chance. I have no claim, Thomas. But you won't sign, correct? Correct. Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out. Move out? I don't understand, Thomas. I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave... Call me if you change your mind about signing. C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite... Good day, Mr. Chance. Good day, Sally. ... Excuse me, would you please tell me where I could find a garden to work in? ... There is much to be done during the winter, I must start the seeds for the spring, I must work the soil... What you growin', man? ... What you doin' here, boy? I had to leave my garden. I want to find another. Bullshit. Who sent you here, boy? Did that chickenshit asshole Raphael send you here, boy? No. Thomas Franklin told me that I had to leave the Old Man's house, he's dead now, you know... Dead, my ass! Now get this, honkie - you go tell Raphael that I ain't takin' no jive from no Western Union messenger! You tell that asshole, if he got somethin' to tell me to get his ass here himself!  You got that, boy? Yes. I understand.  If I see Raphael I will tell him. Now, move, honkie! Before I cut your white ass! Yes. Of course. Good day. I'm very hungry now. Would you please bring me my lunch? I have seen your game! I have watched Elvin Hayes play it many times! They call him "Big E!" Excuse me... ... That tree is very sick. It should be cared for. Yes sir. I'll report it right away. Yes. That would be a good thing to do. Good day. Good day. I'm very sorry, sir... I... ... I can't move... My leg... ... My Lord... This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured... No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore. Can you walk? It's not broken, is it? It's very sore. Perhaps I should call an ambulance. Somebody ought to call the police! There's no need for police, it's just my leg. I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious. I agree. Let's have a look, do you mind? Of course. I would like to look. It's starting to swell, is it painful? Yes. There's no need for a hospital. I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand, I never saw the man. Thank you, ma'am. Please, sir. I've never ridden in an automobile. I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you? ... Yes. You can take me. Very good. ... My suitcase. Yes sir. I'll take care of that. Yes. I am. Yes. He's a very careful driver. It's feeling better, but it's still very sore. Your family doctor? I agree. Yes ma'am. Yes. Thank you. I would like to watch television. Hello, Eve. My name is Chance. No. I'm a gardener. No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita. Yes. I lost my remote control. I like to watch. This is fine. Yes. Good evening, Mrs. Rand. I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by. Yes, ma'am. Yes, I think he should examine my leg. ... I've never been in one of these. It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's been ill... Does it have a television? No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself. I see. How long do we stay in here? How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ... The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner. I understand. I've seen it done before. Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all. You were wrong, it did hurt. But not for long... It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone. Yes. I think so, too. However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after. I see. You can pull your trousers up, now. Oh, fine. Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg. ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out. ... Straight out? Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's? Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me. Thomas? Who's Thomas? Thomas Franklin, an attorney. An attorney? Yes. Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys? There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one. Oh, I see... ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit... Thank you. Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere. Yes, I could stay here. Thank you. Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician? No. I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort. Yes, I will. Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here. A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days. Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man. How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace. At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor. No, Eve... I'm sorry. ... That is a very small room. Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house. Yes. It seems to be. ... I see. I feel very good in here. Yes. I like that very much. This won't take long, Mr. Gardiner. Please hold still when I ask. Do you know Raphael? No sir, I don't believe I do. Oh. I have a message for him. Yes, sir. A Black man gave me the message. Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still. Yes. You look very sick. Hold still, please, Mr. Gardiner. I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television. Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner. I agree. Yes. I am very hungry. To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence. No. It won't do that. No. The Old Man died and Louise left. No, thank you. My house has been closed. Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys. No. I like it here. Yes. Chauncey is fine. ... And please call me Robert. Yes, Robert. I will. Does this house have a garden? I see. I would like to work in your garden. I am a very good gardener. Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow. But I don't have that any more... ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs. It's a very pleasant room, Ben. Yes, thank you. No Ben. I don't know everything about you. That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men. Thank you, Robert. No, Ben. I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore. Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed. I agree. ... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't contain myself... I knew you were going to come out with another one of your jests about the elevator... Excuse me, sir... ... Hmmm... Elevator. ... Yes sir - elevator! Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much. Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before. I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man... Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies? That's good. Good night, Eve. Did you want a car, sir? Yes. I would like a car. Yes, sir. Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg? It's fine today, Robert. Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that. Please, sit in the chair. I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably... ... Any pain here? Yes, Robert. But it's not bad. ... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness? Hardly any, Robert. Your limousine, sir. Oh, thank you. ... Were you going somewhere? No, Robert. ... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe. Yes, Robert. I know about the President. ... Oh? You've heard? Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President. He does, does he? Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock. Why, that's terrific, Chauncey. How do I know when it's ten o'clock? ... It's five of, you'd best get on in there. Thank you, Robert. I would like to walk today. Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you? Oh, really? May I help you, Mr. Gardiner? Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital. ... Sir? Yes. ... Did you wish to see someone, sir? Yes, I would like to see Ben. Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir. Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore. You're looking much better today, Ben. I understand. Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben. Good morning, Mr. Wilson. Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice to see you again. Thank you. How have you been? Fine, thank you. We have an additional guest with us today, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner. I see... Okay, let's go to work. I see, Ben. Yes, Ben. That's a good idea. I agree, Ben. Good morning, Mr. Rand. Just fine, thank you, sir.  And you must be Mr. Gardiner. Yes. Just a formality, Mr. Gardiner. Thank you very much. Ben! It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific! Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet. Good morning, Mr. President. ... Hello. Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure. You look much taller on television, Mr. President. ... Oh, really... Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner... Yes, I will. Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to... Yes? I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben. ... Well? Well, Ben... I... That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance. Yes? Oh... Hello. Good morning. I'm Riff, Secret Service. ... Yes. Of course. It's that serious, huh? Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives? As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden. ... In the garden? That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again... ... Spring and summer... Yes, I see... Fall and winter. Yes, indeed... Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner? Yes. That is correct. ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must admit, that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements I've heard in a very, very long time. ... Many of us forget that nature and society are one! Yes, though we have tried to cut ourselves off from nature, we are still a part of it! Like nature, our economic system remains, in the long run, stable and rational. And that is why we must not fear to be at its mercy!  ... I envy your good, solid sense, Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely what we lack on Capitol Hill.  I must be going.  Mr. Gardiner, this visit has been enlightening... Yes. It has. ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you? Yes. I will. Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello. I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts. Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life! Take care of yourself, Ben. Mr. Gardiner... Yes, Ben - he is. I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President. Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background. Gardiner, yes, sir. And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible. No problem, Chief. No, Ben. I understand. Thank you, Ben. I'm sorry that you are so sick, Ben. Hello, Eve. Yes. It's feeling much better now. Fine. He's very nice. Yes. He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young. ... Mentor...? Yes. I was. Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid. Oh, no. She brought me my meals. What is that? Oh, I like that very much. ... And there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nation's history. And there are so many of you demanding that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course. Well, let me tell you, gentlemen, I have been conducting multiple-level consultations with members of the Cabinet, House and Senate. I have conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the country. And this very morning I had an in-depth discussion with your founder and Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand and his close friend and advisor Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... ... Well, gentlemen, I found this to be a most rewarding conference... To quote Mr. Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted in the national soil, the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny.' Excuse us, please. Gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter, instead, let us anticipate the rapid growth of springtime, let us await the rewards of summer. As in a garden of the earth, let us learn to accept and appreciate the times when the trees are bare as well as the times when we pick the fruit. So am I, Eve. ... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben... He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet... Thank you. Yes. Yes, Eve. You'll be all right. Hello. Hello, Sid. No. I'm not busy. The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that. Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that. I have nothing more to say. Hmmm. Elevator. No. Oh, yes. Yes, I have seen that show on television. Yes. I would like to be on that show. No. I like this attic very much. ... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown. Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to... He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin! Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to... I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt. I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time. I've got to take a leak. Right, Chief. I believe these garments will be quite appropriate, Mr. Gardiner. Yes. They are fine. Excuse me, sir. Hello, Eve. Thank you, Eve. How is Ben feeling? That's good. I like to watch, too. ... Nothing. ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch... Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.' Hello, Morton. Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis. I see. Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years? Yes. It's a very good show. I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner. Here you go, Mr. Gardiner. Thank you. I'm very thirsty. Yes, sir - it's hot under those lights. Now, if the host wants to ask you a question, he'll raise his left forefinger to his left eyebrow. Then you'll stop, and he'll say something, and then you'll answer. Okay, Mr. Gardiner, you're all set. Yes. You're welcome. Yes. That is surprising. I hope so. No. I don't object. Which view? Yes. I was there with Ben. Yes. Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds. Gloomy predictions? That insolent son of a bitch! In a garden, things grow - but first some things must wither; some trees lose their leaves before they grow new leaves... ... Then they grow thicker and stronger and taller. Some trees die, but fresh saplings replace them. Gardens need a lot of care and a lot of love. ... And if you give your garden a lot of love, and if you work very hard and have a lot of patience, in the proper season you will see it grow to be very beautiful... It's that gardener! No! He's a real gardener! ... That bastard... Yes. We need a very good gardener. I understand. Oh, yes. It is possible for one side of the garden to be flooded, and the other side to be dry... ... Some plants do well in the sun, and others grow better in the cool of the shade. ... It is the gardener's responsibility to take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry. It is the gardener's responsibility not to plant a sun-loving flower in the shade of a high wall... ... It is the responsibility of the gardener to adjust to the bad seasons as well as enjoy the good ones. If the gardener does his job, everything will be fine. Thank you. I am a very serious gardener. Oh, Jesus... Okay, I'll see you in twenty minutes. Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner... Look, Johanna... Marvelous! Just marvelous, Mr. Gardiner! What spirit you have, what confidence! Exactly what this country needs! ... Darling... What's wrong? ... It didn't make any sense to me at all. I didn't know what the hell he was talking about... Yeah? Well, I don't understand what was up his sleeve when he pulled that stunt with us? What was he doing? And why? You know, Sally - I really feel like I've been had, and you know what that means, don't you?... It means that any political future I had is right down the toilet! ... Jesus, the thought of spending the rest of my life as an attorney, that is really a downer... And, Christ, Sally, I almost forgot Johanna is starting to think something's going on between... ... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check! Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed! Sid, it's useless! Up yours, Sid. You try again, I quit! An outstanding speech, sir. May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner? Yes. Thank you, Perkins. And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please. Certainly, Ben. Yes. I would like to escort Eve. No, thank you. I see. Good night, Eve. Good morning, gentlemen. This is not what I requested. No, sir. This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that. Right, Chief. So...? Where the hell is it? We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh... What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman? Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent. I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman. Yes, sir. Suits hand-made by a tailor in Chicago in 1918. The tailor went out of business in 1929, then took his own life.  ... His shoes were hand-made in 1928. The cobbler has long since been dead. Underwear, all of the finest cloth, factory destroyed by fire in 1938. The man carries no identification; no wallet, no driver's license, no credit cards. ... He carries one item along with him, a fine Swiss pocket-watch crafted at the turn of the century; so far they have been unable to ascertain where or when purchase was made. ... He has never dyed his hair. ... Computers have analyzed Gardiner's vocal characteristics; it is impossible to determine his ethnic background, they feel his accent may be northeastern, but they will not commit to that. ... Fingerprint check proved negative, no identification possible. ... That's it, Mr. President. Miss Davis - I'd like my eggs poached this morning, please. ... So what does all that add up to? Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer. I would appreciate that. Come in! No, Eve. I don't read the papers. I like the President. He is a very nice man. No, Eve. I like you to be here. Yes, Eve. I know that. Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open. Yes. That could be true. Fine. Mr. Thomas Franklin, please. Is Thomas Franklin in? Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby, would you please tell Mr. Franklin that I would like to talk to him? It concerns Chauncey Gardiner. Mr. Gardiner, what did you think of the Post's editorial on the President's speech? I didn't read it. But air - you must have at least glanced at it. No. I did not glance at it. Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of optimism,' what was your reaction to that? I did not read that either. Well, how do you feel about that phrase, 'Peculiar brand of optimism?' I do not know what it means. Sorry to persist, air, but it would be of great interest to me to know what newspapers you do read. I do not read any newspapers. I watch TV. ... Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that you find television's coverage of the news superior to that of the newspapers? I like to watch TV. Thank you, Mr. Gardiner, for what is probably the most honest admission to come from a public figure in years. Few men in public life have the courage not to read newspapers none have the guts to admit it. You're welcome. Thank you, Eve. Mrs. Rand, how good to see you. And you must be Mr. Gardiner, correct? Yes. Hello, Dennis. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Yes. It is. Hello, Sophia. ... How are the kids getting along? Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy... Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack? Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you... Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as... ... Yes, come in! Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments. Oh? What? We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time. Good. Anything else? Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted. Hello... His... His... I agree. Yes, Eve. I shall yield too. Ben is very ill. Yes, I agree, I think so too. Yes, I understand. We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch. I certainly do. Do you think so? Do you think so? Oh, good. Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please? Yes. I like that name very much. Yes, Eve. That would be good. Thank you. Something rather big in the wind, I'd say. So whose files were destroyed? The CIA's or the FBI's? ... But why? The question is why? Why would they destroy Gardiner's files? What is it about his past they are trying to cover up? ... A criminal record? A membership in a subversive organization? Homosexual, perhaps? ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act? I have no idea... Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions. Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden? Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it. I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word. Of course, Doctor, I understand. Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin. Certainly, glad to be of help. Hello, Ronald. I can't write. I can't read. Yes. I like to watch. What sort of bed is it? Right - everything. We could do it now, we can go upstairs. ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs. I like to watch. Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone? Yes. I like to watch very much. Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too. We can go this way. I want to tell Eve. Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand? Yes. Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd. ... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling. No, that won't do any good. ... Is it me? Is there something I've done? Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you... It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator... It's not that, I just... Yeah, Kaufman - what is it? Chief, we have a break in the case. Our man at the Washington Post says they are working on a story that either the CIA or the FBI destroyed Gardiner's files before anyone could get to them. What? Why? I can't say at this time - neither agency will admit to a thing. Okay, get both Directors over here, I'll be right down. Can you see well? Yes, very well, thank you. Do you like it? Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good. ... Are you sure you like it? Yes, I do, it's very good. Really? Really!!! Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert... I don't want Robert. I see. Your foot! Give me your foot!! Thank you. But my leg is still a little sore. Are you sure you're not ill? Na zdorov'e! No. I was with a man. We went upstairs. He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while. Nor I, sir - it would be out of the question. Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers. Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out. Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...? I see. What about question three? Is it possible to erase all traces of a man? I don't think that's entirely true, Grover. And what do the boys around Intelligence think? Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think. Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations. Good night. Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise. Thank you. I like to watch. Yes. I like to watch. Yes. It's very good, Eve. Good night, Eve. It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it. That's very interesting, Eve. Yes. I would like to see Ben. Yes, Ben - are you going to die now? Oh, I see. A flower... Yes. I would like to do that. ... He's gone, Chauncey. Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people. Yes, I suppose that's true. Will you be leaving now, Robert? In a day or two, yes. Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed. ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr... ... Chance...? Yes. I love Eve very much. I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you? Yes, Robert - I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert. ... Millions of people across the world have heard of the passing of Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately, only relatively few will feel the pain and sadness at such a loss. To most, Benjamin Rand was a legend; to those of us gathered here today, Benjamin was a beloved friend. My personal association with Benjamin dates back many years, and my memories of our friendship will stay with me forever. I initially came in contact with the Rand name in 1943. 1 was a young lieutenant in the Air Corps, a navigator flying missions over Europe. That plane that I learned to know so well was manufactured by the Rand Aeronautics Corporation. Benjamin Rand was an industrial giant, known to be powerful and uncompromising, and yet, on a personal level, we have all felt his warmth and humor... ... I would like to share with you a few quotes, and a few feelings from our dear friend. ... 'I do not regret having political differences with men that I respect; I do regret, however, that our philosophies kept us apart.' ... 'I have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever... But, if I am to be honest with myself, I must admit that they have no use for me, either.' ... 'I was born into a position of extreme wealth, I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty -  I do not know the feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world. For a man in my position, that is inexcusable.'  'Life is a state of mind.' ... 'When I was a boy, I was told that the Lord fashioned us from his own image. That's when I decided to manufacture mirrors.' But what do we know of the man? Nothing! We have no inkling of his past! Correct, and that is an asset. A man's past can cripple him, his background turns into a swamp and invites scrutiny. To this time, he hasn't said anything that could be used against him. Well, I'm certainly open to the thought - it would be sheer lunacy to support the President for another term. No one will go along with that... Look at the facts, gentlemen, the response from his appearance on 'This Evening' was overwhelming; he has excited and awakened the people of this country at a time of despair. He's personable, elusive, yet seemingly honest. He's riding a crest of popularity that builds with every statement. As far as his thinking goes, he appears to be one of us. I firmly believe, gentlemen, that he is our only chance - Mr. Chauncey Gardiner! We're all going to miss him, Eve...  ... Where's Mr. Gardiner? ... He walked off... I can certainly understand that... Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve... I'll call you soon. I don't think so, he should be along soon... You really care for him, don't you, Eve? I think we'd better go look for him.  David! Look! Hello, Eve. Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
