They're not gonna call... I tell you  they're not gonna call. I blew it. I  don't know what I did wrong, but I � Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's  not about to drop an account that  represents more than two million in  gross billing receipts in a small  agency like this, without making us  sweat. Now just relax, okay?  Everything's gonna be fine. I don't think so, Jim. Maybe I  shouldn't have � I love you too, mommy... Good-night... Don't let the bedbugs bite... Here's to Ted Kramer. I wanna tell you something about  this little runt. He went out there  and sold the shit out of Revlon and  that's why we got the account. It  was his idea, it was his concept,  right down the line... All I can say... All I can say is  this is maybe one of the five best  days of my whole life... So anyway Jim and I are making the  pitch, right? And all of a sudden  this old guy starts to cough and I  keep on going and he keeps on coughing  and I keep on going and he keeps on  coughing and � Congratulations, Ted. That was a  hell of a job. Where you goin' Murray, it's early? Got to get home. Oh, Christ, I'm late... I gotta get  out of here. So anyway, I look over and this old  geezer is starting to turn blue and  I swear to God the only thing I can  think about is that this poor  sonofabitch is gonna die on me and  screw up the pitch. Hey, what's the rush? C'mon, walk me  a couple of blocks. Jim, I've got to go. I'm already  late � Listen, Ted... I just want to tell  you, when old man Schmidt retires  next year, I've got a pretty good  feeling they'll kick me upstairs... ...and when they do, I just want you  to know I'm takin' you along with  me. Y'know, Ted, I mean what I said back  there. You did a hell of a job on  this and I want you to know I'm  turning the whole show over to you. Wow! I mean it Ted, you're running this  one. I thought you might just like to  know that at five-fifteen this  afternoon we were officially handed  the Fire and Ice account by Revlon. That represents a gross billing in  excess of two million � What?! I'm sorry I'm late, all right? I'm  sorry I didn't call � I was busy  making a living. Okay, okay... What is it this time?  What did I do now?... Joanna, whatever it is, believe me,  I'm sorry. Now listen, before you do something  you'll really regret you'd better  stop and think - For God's sake, Joanna, would you at  least tell me what I did that's so  terrible! Would you do me that little  favor? So we've got problems. Everybody's  got problems � that's normal � I'm listening, Joanna � believe me,  I'm listening. My wife is walking  out on me after eight years of � I heard you, Joanna. I promise I  heard you. What about Billy? What? C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother � Okay, I understand and I promise I  won't try and stop you, but you can't  just go... Look, come inside and  talk... Just for a few minutes. Where are you going? Do you want me to help you get a  cab? Joanna!?... Joanna?! All right, Thelma... That's it. I've  had it. You can call your good friend  Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is  enough, okay? I mean, I don't know  what I did, but you can tell her  she's made her point. Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going  on. Ha! You tell me. All right, Thelma, you want to know  what's going on? I'll tell you what's  going on. I'll tell you exactly what's  going on. I came home tonight. We just got the  Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?! Do you  understand what that means? It means  that it was maybe one of the five  best days in my whole life. I walk in the house and before I can  say "How are you?", "Did you have a  nice day?" before I can say anything.  Pow she's out the door. Yeah, she said it wasn't any use  talking anymore. Hostile? Me? Thelma, I'm not hostile. I am anything but hostile. But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am  is, I am hurt. I am very hurt. And I  just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing... Why? That's all I  want to know... Why? Things? What kind of things? Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn  good life. She's got a husband that  loves her. She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home � Did it ever occur to you guys that  Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person  in the world to live with?! Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty  minutes late. You can set your watch  by it � Two. She is getting to be a real  hermit or recluse or whatever it is  you call it. Thelma, do you know  where I could be in this business if  I had a wife that entertained or  went out socially � Joanna said that? Then how come she never said anything  like that to me? Boy, you guys are really something,  y'know? I'd like to know one thing,  okay � just one little thing. Did  you tell Joanna she should leave me? Y'know something Thelma � you are  the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean  it. Joanna and I never had any trouble  until you and Charley split up. I'd like to know what the hell kind  of courage it takes to walk out on  your husband and your child? Where's mommy? Huh?... Oh God... What time is it? The little hand is on the six and  the big hand is on the nine. Where  is mommy? Oh, Christ... Ah, yeah... you want  to know why mom's not here, right? Okay, I'm going to tell you... It's  like this. Mommy and daddy had a  little argument and mommy decided  she wanted to go off by herself for  a little while. You know how sometimes  you get mad and want to go off and  be by yourself? Well, it's like that,  okay? Okay. Now how about some breakfast? When is mommy coming back? Soon. Very soon. I'll tell you what, kiddo � why don't  I fix us some French toast? Wow! French toast, really? Sure. Didn't I ever tell you French  toast was my specialty? I'll bet I  never told you that. Now then, the  first thing we need is... ...eggs! Right? This is terrific... isn't this  terrific? I'm having a good time... Are you  having a good time? You forgot the milk. That's right. You're absolutely  right... It's been a long time since  I made French toast. Look at this, isn't this something?! What about my orange juice? Right. One O.J. coming up. Daddy!!! Don't worry... Everything's fine... Goddam! Son of a bitch! It's okay. It's gonna be okay... When is mommy coming back? Soon. I told you before, very soon. Will she pick me up after school? No. If I'm not here, you go home  with Thelma and Kim. What if she forgets? I'll call Thelma and remind her,  okay? Don't worry. But what happens if she's on her way  to school and she gets runned over  by a truck and killed? What happens  them? Congratulations, Mr. Kramer. Terrific news, Ted. Hey... Look who was out celebrating  last night. Uh, Jim... Can I talk to you? Jesus Christ. That's a real  blockbuster. I always figured you guys had it  made. You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first  time in my life � the first time � I  feel like a loser. Listen, don't let it get you down. You're going to be fine. Me? I've never been better. I mean  having my wife walk out on me after  seven years of marriage agrees with  me just fine. Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on  the beat, okay? Three marriages, two  divorces... You're gonna be okay. I'm going to be okay. The way I see  it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a  matter of time. She'll be back... But... just in case... I mean, just  on the off chance she doesn't. What  are you going to do about the kid? I don't know, Jim. This whole thing  has happened so... Pow � like that. Look, it's none of my business, so  you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll  send Billy away to stay with relatives  for a while. Just until you get  yourself straightened out. I don't know, Jim... Ted, this may sound a little rough,  but we've just landed the biggest  account in the history of this agency,  right? And now it's up to us � that's  you and me � to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I  can't depend on you a hundred and  ten percent, twenty-four hours a  day, because you're worried about a  kid with a runny nose � Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's  coming back. I hope you're right, Ted... I really  hope you're right. Billy! Uh, huh... You got a letter from mom. When is she coming home?! "My dear, sweet Billy: Mommy has  gone away. Sometimes in the world  daddies go away and mommies bring up  their little boys. But sometimes a  mommy can go away too, and you have  your daddy to bring you up." "I have gone away because I must  find some interesting things to do  for myself in the world. Everybody  has to, and so do I. Being your mommy  was one thing, but there are other  things and this is what I have to  do. I did not get a chance to tell  you this, and that is why I am writing  you now." "I will always be your mommy and I  will always love you. I just won't  be your mommy in the house. But I  will be your mommy of the heart. And It's okay... It's okay. We'll talk  about it some other time. I don't know, Thel... This whole  thing has happened so... Pow, like  that. I'm gonna keep him, why? Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not  losing my child. Got it. I understand. I'm sure. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Slow down... Slow down... 'Night, Jim. Hey, Ted. C'mon in. I wanna' talk to  you. What's the big rush. C'mon in, put  your feet up, have a drink. Can't do it tonight. Gotta pick up  Billy. I'm late. Listen, I heard a terrific joke today.  There's this Polish skydiver � Sorry, Jim I've got to go. I'll talk  to you tomorrow. Murray? Jim O'Connor, why don't you  drop by and have a drink... Mrs. Kline, I'm sorry I'm late, but You're late. I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting  and � Goodbye. Bye. Bye. I was waiting a long time. It wasn't so long, I'm only... ...twenty minutes late. All the other mothers got here a  long time ago... How was school today? Okay... Same as usual... Billy, don't eat with your fingers. Sorry. Well, I see the Yankees finally won  a game. Mom, I mean dad? Yeah? Can I be excused? I'm not hungry. I  think I'll go to bed. Sure. Too much birthday cake, right? I guess... Goodnight. 'Night. Listen, pal, I'm sorry, okay? I know how you feel. Look, I remember one time when. I  was a couple of years younger than  you are now and... I was staying  with this cousin of mine and my  parents were supposed to come and  pick me up by three, but it got later  and later and they didn't and they  didn't show up and I remember I got  really scared that something had  happened to them and I remember when  they finally came instead of being  happy to see them I was very angry  and... Billy, I promise I'll never  do that to you again, okay?... Billy? Okay? No... No, actually it's only two  bedrooms. Look, my wife just walked out on me.  Okay? It's been a tough week. Ted. Ted. I'll be with you in a minute, Jim. You couldn't make that Saturday,  could you? Well, he's... ah, he's a good kid.  He's shy and... I think he's probably  very creative and... Sure. He's right in here. Mrs. Willewska, could you start on  Monday? Mom, I mean dad... Uh huh... That's not the right soap. We use  the kind in the green and yellow  box. C'mon, there's not much difference � We use the green and yellow. The pink stuff. Okay, what color cereal do we get? Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain  and buy him an ice. What? Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain,  buy him an ice. It'll kill twenty  minutes. I've got a lot more than twenty  minutes to kill. Tough... ...I get off duty at five-thirty. How long you been divorced? Three months. How can you tell? You've got that look. My lady and I  split two years ago in August and  I'm an old pro at this shit. First  thing, stay away from the Children's  Zoo. It's pure hell � if I never see  another chicken, I'll be happy. I'm here, darling. Don't worry... Billy? Billy? Billy?! Billy! Mommy! Mommy! Oh. I thought you were my mommy. Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen... Welcome to the greatest show on earth. Welcome to the... Greatest. Greatest... Show. Show... On earth. On earth. Mr. Kramer, I just wanted to tell  you what a wonderful boy your son  is. I don't know... I've been worried... I mean, with what he's been through  and everything. I � No... No... Billy is doing just fine. Well, you know it's not easy raising  a kid on your own and I thought if  we could get together and, uh, discuss Oh, God. Not 'til August. Excuse me. You said you wanted to  talk, Mr. Kramer. Yes, but... ah, not now... I've got an appointment... I forgot  all about it... I know... I know. No. Uh, uh. Tell him I asked for it  Friday. I want it Friday. Period. Fine. Yes. Remind me to pick up a "Crying  Chrissie" doll at lunch on Tuesday. If it's all right with you, Mother  Kramer, can we get down to work now? Hiya, Phyllis. These are the Revlon  contracts. I thought you ought to  check them out. Yes, what? Mmmmnph... I'll get you a cab... Do you like fried chicken? So do I... Like that?! And? Do you? So what's your problem? You ever think about getting married  again? How many onions does it say to use? D'you think you and Charley'll ever  get back together again? C'mon, Thel. So Charley had a little  fling. So what? All in all he was a  pretty good husband. Now look, you hold it like this... ...and you swing like this... Okay, Jim. Here's the report on... What the hell is this? Murray had some ideas about the Fire  and Ice campaign and he had the art  department make up a few roughs... I think they're kind of interesting. I don't. Jim, this isn't anything  like what we talked about. It's not  even close. Ted, basically it's still your  concept. Murray just added a few things, that's  all. Now hold it right there, I'm the one  that went in and sold Revlon on this  idea to start with, remember? You  said I was going to be � Yeah? It's for you. Yes? Look, Billy, I told you before, one  hour of T.V. a day, that's the rule...  No... I don't care what the other mothers  do... Listen, I can't talk now, I'm  in a meeting... Billy, I'll talk to you later, good- bye. Ted, I appreciate what you're saying,  but I really think you're just too  close to it right now. Murray's right. Look it's just some ideas, okay? I  mean nothing's locked in cement. I  promise you this is your show... Trust me on this one, Ted... Mom, I mean dad... In a minute... What do you do when an elephant sits  on your fence? You get a new fence. C'mon, Billy. I'm trying to work for  God's sake... Goddamnit, can't you watch what you're  doing! I'm sorry. Je-sus Christ! I catch all kind of  shit at the office because I'm not  pulling my weight because I'm busting  my butt trying to be a decent goddamn  father and � I'm sorry. That's terrific. That's really  terrific, but I notice I'm the one  that's cleaning up this � Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one  over. I'm sorry. Look, it's after your bedtime, okay?  Just do me a favor and go to bed,  okay? Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay? That's okay. It's just... I've been catching a  lot of flack at the office... That's okay... Perrier and lime... ...and scotch with soda. Okay, Phyllis, what's up? What?!? I don't believe it! That's crazy!  Why would Jim do something like that? I can't. I've got Billy to take care  of. I don't believe you. How should I know? So... what's so terrible about that? No. No, I don't believe it. Jim  O'Connor would never let anything  like that happen. He gave me my shot  in this business. If it wasn't for  Jim O'Connor I'd be � I don't know  where I'd be. He's a wonderful man... I don't want to hear another word  against him. Not another word. He's  a wonderful man... a wonderful man... All right, Jim. You said I was running  this show, right? You said no  decisions without my approval, right? Well what the hell is this? What's  going on, Jim? Well, ah... I thought it over and I  decided we're doing it Murray's way. Jim, this is garbage. This isn't  anything like what we talked to Revlon  about. None of it. You can't � That's my decision, Ted and that's  final. What is it? Salisbury steak. I hate it. You don't hate it. We had Salisbury  steak last week and you liked it  fine. No I didn't. I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross. All it is is onions and gravy. I'm allergic to onions. You are not allergic of onions. You've  had them lots of times. I want a pizza. No. This is fine. Just take a bite,  you'll like it fine. I think I'm going to throw up. Oh, for God's sake... Here. There, okay? Now that's just plain  old hamburger. Some of the brown stuff is still  there. Then eat around it. No. Now listen to me, young man. Do you  know what I had to go through to put  this goddamn food on the goddamn  table? I don't care. I hate it. I want pizza. Not on your life. That's it. I've  had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza! Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real  food like a normal human being! No! You want to know something?! You are  a spoiled selfish little brat! Now  eat � Goddamnit! Go to your room! Owwww... You're hurting me... You're  hurting me... I hate you... I hate  you... You're no bargain either, pal. I want my mommy... I want my mommy.. I want my... mm... ommy... I want  mmmy... mommy... Tough shit. You're stuck with me. I want my... mmmo... mmmy. I want  mmmy mmo... mmy... Daddy? Yeah? I'm sorry... That's okay, pal. Go back to sleep.  It's very late. Daddy? Uh huh? Are you... gonna go... away? Of course I'm not going away. I love  you very much. I'll be right here. That's why mommy left... isn't it?  'Cause I was bad... Oh, Christ... Oh, Christ... No, pal. Your mom loves you very  much. The reason she left didn't  have anything to do with you. Look, I don't know if this will make  any sense to you, okay? But I'll try  and explain. You see the reason your  mom left was because... Well, I guess  it was because I kept trying to make  her into a certain kind of person...  Make her be the way I thought a wife  was supposed to be. Only she wasn't  like that. She was... Well, she wasn't like that. And now,  when I think about it, I can see she  tried very hard to be like I wanted  � very hard. And when she couldn't,  then she tried to tell me about it.  Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I  thought that if I was happy, that  meant she was happy too. Only she  wasn't. The truth is, the only reason  she didn't leave a lot sooner was  because she loves you so much. Joanna  stayed until she couldn't stand me  any longer and then she left... But  it wasn't you, pal. It wasn't you. Is mom ever coming back? You mean for good? I don't think so. Oh... Now go to sleep. It's very late. Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. See you in the morning light. Dad? Yes? I love you... Thel, you ever hear from Joanna? California? She ever ask about me? What d'you tell her? Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, look! Presenting Billy Kramer's  Fantastic Superjet! Daddy! That's good, Billy... That's a brave  boy... Now then, how's that? Now  we've cleaned it out... There. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now then, you just wait here, Billy.  I want to talk to your dad for a  minute. Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught  the eye. But I'm going to have to take some  stitches. How many? Ten. Because of the position of the wound  and your son's age, I don't think  there will be much of a scar.  Otherwise I'd call in a plastic  surgeon. Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas � No. Mr. Kramer, there's � Fuck you. He's my son. I'm staying  with him. Ohhh... Ohhhh... Ohhhhh... It's okay, son... I'm here... Just a  little more to go... Don't worry,  son... I'm here... He's okay... Thel, can I ask you a  favor? I don't mean a little favor. I mean  a big F favor. Thelma, if I die � I didn't say I'm going to die, but  if I should � Thel, listen to me. If, on the million  to one shot that I should � That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy? I thought about it a lot and you're  the only person I know that I trust  with him. I mean, if anything happened  to me, he'd be okay with you. You're  a good mother. I know it's not an easy thing to  answer. Look, if it's too much responsibility You're sure? Thank you, Thel. Thank you very much. Hello? Ted? Joanna? Good evening, Mr. Kramer. We haven't  seen you for a long time. Mrs. Kramer,  she waits for you in the back. Thank you, John. So do you. The usual, Mr. Kramer. Thanks, Gino. Fine. Look at us, Joanna. Just like any  old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it. He's great... except... ...Except he had... he fell and he  cut his face. He... He has a scar,  Joanna, from about here to here. I can't help but feel somehow...  it's my fault. I keep thinking I  could've done something � stopped  it... What? You have? He is... You sat in that coffee shop across  from school � You've been living here, in the city? You want what?! Are you out of your mind?! You're  the one that walked out on him,  remember? Joanna, I don't give a � Such as? Come on, Joanna, what did you learn?  I'd really like to know. One thing, okay? Just tell me one  goddam thing you've learned. Joanna, go be a mother. Get married,  have kids. Don't get married, have  kids. Do whatever you want. I don't  give a damn. Just leave me out of it  � and leave my baby out of it. Joanna, go fuck yourself! Look, she walked out on her own child,  right? That's desertion, right? Mr.  Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an  open and shut case. Fine. Six. But she signed over custody. Here... I love you Billy Kramer. I love you too daddy. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs  bite... See you in the morning light... Look, ah... Ted. I just got word  from the guys at Revlon and... ah  they did some marketing tests on our  campaign and the results were... Disappointing. It only pulled a  fourteen share and they were hoping  for a twenty five minimum, and...  ah... they're not very happy and...  Well, the guys have decided they  want to... ah, re-think the entire  concept and... Look, I don't like  having to do this, okay?... But... I  mean, what I mean is... ah, I'm going  to have to... ah, let you go � Are you firing me, Jim? C'mon, Ted, don't get emotional.  Okay? Look, this isn't exactly an easy  thing for me to do, y'know? I swear  Murray and I did everything we could,  but those sons of bitches were out  for blood. I mean it was all I could  do to keep the account inside the  shop... Look, I promise, if I hear  of anything I'll let you know first  thing. Ted?... Ted?... Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm... Well, this looks very good.. Of course ...you understand this is the worst  time of the year to look for a job. What?! What do you mean, I don't  understand. Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about  leaving their job until after they  get their Christmas bonus. Look, you don't understand. I need a  job. I've got a kid and � I understand and I'm absolutely sure  something wonderful will turn up... ...after the first of the year. Uh, huh? Mr. Kramer? Please hold for Mr.  Shaunessy... Ted? They've set the court date. I  just heard today... It's... January sixth. Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some-  thing I ought to tell you. My... ah,  situation has... changed. I lost my  job. John? Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't  have a hope in hell of winning a  custody hearing if you're out of  work. Good Christ, Joanna, just get the  hell out of my life. Ted? Are you there? Yeah. Any prospects? Don't worry. I plan to have something  within twenty-four hours, John. How the hell are you going to do  that? I don't know. Mis-ter Kramer, as I mentioned  yesterday, this is a very bad time  of year to look for work. Now I'm  sure we'll have something for you by  mid-February, March at the latest. I need a job, now. No... No... No... There might be something at J. Walter  Thompson. But... ...I don't think they're really  serious. The position's been open  for two months and... They may just be on a fishing  expedition. I'm sure you'll be much happier if  you wait until after the first � Call up the people at J. Walter  Thompson. Set up an appointment at  four. Mis-ter Kramer, it's... ...almost four now. It's the Friday  before Christmas. Nobody is going to  want to � Either you call and set up the  appointment, or I'll call. And if I  call, you lose the commission. My, we are a hot shot aren't we? You bet your ass. So, Mr. Ackerman, as you can see  from my resume, my experience in  setting up the leisure package concept  means that I've spent a lot of time  working along the same lines as your  multiple buys and your regional  advertising ideas. I know the  pitfalls, but � and this is more  important � I know the potential  revenue for the company inherent in  these programs. Well, Mr. Kramer, I must say this  has been very impressive. I'd like  to think about it and get back to  you. Mr. Ackerman, is there anyone else  that I should see before you come to  a decision. Mr. Spencer, our Advertising Director. Could I see him right away? I'm sorry, but he's leaving this  evening for a two-week vacation.  I'll set up something the moment he  gets back. I'd like to see him now � before he  leaves. Mr. Kramer, I don't think � I want this position very much. Wait here. Mr. Spencer, Mr. Kramer. So you're the go-getter. All right,  you've got ten minutes. That's very interesting, Mr. Kramer.  I must say, it's very interesting.  Let me think about it. I'll let  Jack... ...know and he'll get in touch with  you. Excuse me, I believe you said I had  ten minutes. Well? That means I've got two minutes left.  I understand you're paying twenty- five. All right, I'll tell you what I'm  gonna do � I'll take the job at twenty- two-five. Now, that's twenty-five  hundred less than you're offering.  The only thing is, you have to say  yes right now. Not tomorrow. Not  next week. Not after the holidays.  It's worth it to me for a yes right  now and I'll take twenty-five hundred  less. Today only. One day only. Twenty-two  five. Mr. Kramer, can we talk privately  for a moment? Certainly. Mr. Kramer? Welcome aboard, Mr. Kramer. Well, gentlemen, I'm pleased to be  with you. Merry Christmas. You're a terrific kid, Billy Kramer. Hello? Ted? John Shaunessy here. I just got  a call from your wife's lawyer. She  wants to see the kid. What?! She wants what?! She's the mother. That means she's  within her legal rights. John, what if she kidnaps him. I've  heard all these � I don't know, John... I mean, to be  brutally honest, I'm not so sure  what kind of mental shape Joanna's  in right now. Y'know she admitted  she was seeing a shrink. You ever see her talk to the walls? No, but � Then you don't have a choice. Have  Billy at the Seventy-Fifth Street  entrance to Central Park, Saturday  at ten. Mommy! So, naturally, you assume that since  Joanna left, that would be a  compelling point against her, right? But it doesn't work that way. A major  decision was handed down by the  Appellate Court in 1969 � in the  case of Haskins vs. Haskins. Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court  ruled in favor of the mother, thus  establishing a precedent for awarding  the child to the mother even though  she previously abandoned the baby. Yeah? And? But it's not a year from now, is it? Mr. Kramer? Yes? I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked  me to look in on your son and prepare  an evaluation sheet. Oh, yes. Won't you come in. Where is the child? He's in his room, playing. Good. I'll see him in there. Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in  here with anyone? Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social  life discreetly. At the moment I am  seeing no one. Does that distress you? Not particularly. What does? The prospect of losing my child. Very well, I'd like to see him if I  may. Billy. This is Dr. Alvarez. She would  like to talk to you. Sure. I'd like to talk to Billy privately. Oh, yeah... What do you have here, Billy? Detroit. Have you ever been to Detroit? No. But I've been to Brooklyn. I see you have people there. What  are their names? That's Kim... and this one's Thelma  and that's Mrs. Willewska and this  is daddy and that's Batman and over  there is Robin. What about your mommy? Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy. Do you like to be with your mommy? Objection. You're leading the witness. Sure. What do you like best about her? Lunch in a restaurant. What do you like best about your  daddy? Playing. Tell me, does your daddy ever hit  you? Objection. Sure. Lots of times. When does he hit you? He hits me on the planet Kriptarium,  when I steal the buried treasure  from the famous peanut butter factory. In real life when does he hit you? My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why  would my daddy hit me? See. That's my name. It's my name too. Right. Wow! You like it? Wow! Is this really where you work? Is this really your desk? Yep. Is that really your chair? Uh huh... Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it? Sure. Did mommy ever see this? No, she never did. Are you going to get remarried? I don't know. I hadn't thought much  about it. Are you going to remarried Phyllis? No. Will you and mommy get remarried? No, son. Daddy and mommy will never  get remarried. Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw  this she'd remarried you. Oyez, oyez... The third Circuit Court  of the State of New York, Judge Atkins  presiding is now in session. All  rise... Overruled. The witness will answer,  please. I'll allow that. The witness will  answer please. Sustained. Sustained. Overruled. Please answer the question, Mrs.  Kramer. Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so  rough on her? Eight, almost nine years. Yes... It was good. He was a hard worker, a  lot of drive, a real hustler. Ted was a good worker. But, ah...  after his wife left him and he was  taking care of the kid on his own,  things started to change. Look, I  know he had problems, I understand  that. I've got problems, everybody's  got problems. But I've got a shop to  run, I can't let that kind of thing  get in the way... I guess I felt that Ted was letting  his duties at home interfere with  his responsibilities in the office. No. At the moment I am unemployed. If the petitioner has no further  witnesses, we will hear the respondent  tomorrow morning at 9:30. Mom � I mean, dad? Uh, huh? What did you do when you were little? I guess about the same kind of things  you do. Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?" Uh, uh... We didn't have television  then. You didn't have T.V.? Nope. It hadn't been invented yet. Was there apple juice when you were  little? Yeah, there was apple juice. Was there Burger King? Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as  Burger King. What else wasn't there? Well, let's see... There wasn't  McDonald's. And there wasn't  astronauts... And there wasn't frozen  yogurt. And there wasn't... When Joanna � � my ex-wife � when she was talking  before about how unhappy she was  during our marriage... Well, I guess  most of what she said was probably  true. There were a lot of things I  didn't understand � a lot of things  I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of  things Joanna wishes she could  change... But we can't. Some things,  once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe  she does. So do I. But the way it  was explained to me, that's not the  issue. The only thing that's supposed  to matter here is what's best for  Billy... When Joanna said why  shouldn't a woman have the same  ambitions as a man, I suppose she's  right. But by the same token what  law is it that says a woman is a  better parent simply by virtue of  her sex? I guess I've had to think a  lot about whatever it is that makes  somebody a good parent: constancy,  patience, understanding... love.  Where is it written that a man has  any less of those qualities than a  woman? Billy has a home with me,  I've tried to make it the best I  could. It's not perfect. I'm not a  perfect parent. I don't have enough patience.  Sometimes I forget he's just a little  kid... But I love him... More than  anything in this world I love him. I suppose. Sustained. Technically, the agency lost a big  account and seventy four people were  let go. I was one of them. Yes, but I'm with J. Walter Thompson  now. I don't think that will happen  again. Sustained. Are you introducing the question of  negligence here, counselor? I see. Well, you'll have to do better  than that. Do you have any affidavits  to support negligence? This is an isolated incident,  counselor, unless you can prove  otherwise. No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning. Yeah, well he did, didn't he. I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye. Any day. Uh, huh... You and Charley? Really? Hey, that's terrific. C'mon. Billy, Kim. Let's go. Well? Oh, Christ! I lost him? I lost him? Oh, no.. What if I fight it? I'll take my chances. Don't worry. I'll get the money. Oh, Christ no... I can't do that. I  just... can't... Excuse me... I'm sorry... I just... Please go away, Thel... I... I just  have to be by myself for a little  while... Please, Thel... Daddy! You're home early. Did you  get fired again? No, son, I didn't get fired. I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King  and then we watch a little T.V. and  then we get packed to go to the  country tomorrow. Just you and me...  How 'bout that? Joanna... This is by way of  introducing William Kramer. He is a  sweet child, as you will see. He is  allergic to grape juice, but will  more than make up for the loss in  apple juice. He is also allergic to  peanut butter from the health food  store, but not from the supermarket.  Don't ask me why. At times, in the night he will have  nightmares, one particular monster  is called The Face. The Face, as  best as I can determine, looks like  a circus clown without a body, and  from what the pediatrician says, and  what I have read, may be sexual fear  of losing his penis, or a fear of  his own anger, or just a circus clown  he saw once. His doctor, by the way, is still Ed  Davies. The Sundafed is for colds,  one tablespoon every four hours. I  will pack it in the blue suitcase. His best stories have been Babar and  Winnie the Pooh up to now, with Batman  moving up. His housekeeper has been  Etta Willewska and she is the main  reason for the note. She is a loving  woman, conscientious, very concerned  about Billy and more important, Billy  cares about her. I urge you to retain her. Her number  is 722-8099, and I think she will  take the job if it is offered. I'm  sure other things will come up. Ask  me what you need to and I guess  eventually we'll talk... That's all I can think of, except to  repeat what I said before, he's a  terrific kid. I'm grateful for the  time we've had together and I feel I  am a better man because of my son...  Ted. Billy, sometimes when a mother and a  father are divorced, there's a  discussion about who the child should  live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge. And a judge has  a lot of experience with divorces  and he decides who it would be best  for the child to live with. Why does he decide? Because... Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man. Like a principal? Bigger than a principal. The judge  sits in robes in a big chair... The  judge has thought a lot about us,  about you and me and your mom, and  he has decided... ...he has decided that it would be  best for you to live with your mom  Joanna in her apartment. And I'm very lucky. Because even  though you'll live with your mom  Joanna I'll get to see you once a  week for dinner and a couple of  weekends a month. I don't understand, daddy. What don't you understand, pal? Where will my bed be, where will I  sleep? At your mom's. She'll have a bed for  you in your own room. Where will my toys be? I'll send your toys there and I'm  sure you'll get some new ones. Who will read me my stories? Your mom. Daddy, what if The Face comes when  I'm at mommy's? Your mom knows all about The Face,  okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The  Face to beat it. Will you come and say good-night to  me every night? Look, it's getting cold. Why don't  you go inside where it's warm. I'll  be along in a minute. Go on, scoot. Hey? What's doin' with that bread?  Let's see a little hustle around  here. This is it, pal. Yes? Ted, it's Joanna. Can you meet me in  the lobby?... Alone? I'll be back in a minute. Okay, I'm here. Now why did you � Goddamnit, Joanna. What the � Joanna, what the hell is � What? Oh, God... Oh, my God... No more waiting in Coffee Shops... I  promise. Beautiful.
