I only called her ten minutes ago -- Here she is now. Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets  it wrong the first time. You're Jill?  Come on in. I've told my service to pick up any  calls coming in to my office phone. Make yourself at home. The  refrigerator's loaded. We even have some low-fat yogurt. Bye. Have you checked the children? Have you checked the children? Have you checked the children? Golden Bull... Hold on a minute. Hello? Dr. Mandrakis left the restaurant  about forty minutes ago. That's right. Operator... Is this an emergency? The number is 555-9431. Would you  like me to connect you? Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker. An anonymous caller? Has he threatened you? Has he been using obscene language? There's really nothing we can do  about it down here. Is the phone  listed in your name? It's probably just some weirdo. The  city's full of them. Believe it or  not, we get reports like this every  night. It's nothing to worry about. Have you tried whistling? If you can find a good loud whistle  somewhere in the house, blow it into  the phone hard, next time he calls.  Probably break his eardrum. He won't  bother you after that. Or you could just take your phone  off the hook. Well, as I say, there's nothing we  can really do to help you down here. You bet. Goodnight. Why haven't you checked the children? Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker. Oh, yeah. Did you try whistling? Out where? Did you see him? Is the house locked up? And the windows? Then you're safe. If he wanted to  break in, he wouldn't be calling  you. Tell you what. If this guy calls you  again -- Okay, calm down now. I can alert the  phone company so that if he calls  again we can try to trace the call.  What's your number there? And the address? Oh, yeah, I know where that is. All  right. If the guy calls again, try  to keep him on the line for at least  a minute so we can trace the call. It's the only way we can help you. By the way, what's your name? Jill, the important thing is to relax.  You're safe where you are. We've got  patrolmen cruising the area all night  long. Just stay calm. Will you do  that for me? In the meantime, we'll be watching  your line. Okay, Jill? Call again if there's any problem. Goodnight. It's me. I know. Yes. Don't. No. Your blood... all over me. You've called the police? Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen  to me! We've traced the call. It's coming  from within the house. A squad car's  on its way over there now... just  get out of that house! Are the parents here yet? Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes  ago. Christ! What a homecoming! They wanted to talk to someone. I  asked them to wait until you got  here. Come on in. We were only a block away when the  call went out. When we got here, the  guy was still waiting upstairs in  the children's bedroom. He was covered  with blood. Blood? Not his own. The children had been  dead for several hours. Jesus... He'd been using an old phone in their  bedroom that the parents had never  had disconnected. Who is he? We found a Merchant Seaman's card on  him. He's English. Entered the country  less than a week ago. How about the babysitter? She's going to be all right. So you're in business for yourself  now. Yes, sir, for the past three and a  half years. That's good. And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's  escape? Oh, yes. Do you think the police will... find  him? I know they haven't assigned anyone  to it specifically. It's an old case. An old case. Can you find him? Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not  this week, but I'll find him. He could be anywhere by now. I don't think so... because he's a  foreigner. He'll come back to the  city. After six years in confinement,  it's the only place that's familiar  to him. That's important. A man murders two children in cold  blood. A jury declares him insane.  How could such a person not be? He is sent to a state mental  institution where the security is...  less than perfect. And he escapes.  It... it isn't fair. I couldn't agree with you more. Thank you. How is Mrs. Mandrakis? I'm sorry. Please give her my best. Curt Duncan isn't going to run right  out and kill more children. I'm not  worried about that. We had him for six years... under  continuous therapy, some of it rather  forceful... ...and drugs... tranquilizers  depressants, lithium... Eventually, anyone will respond to  the treatment here. You gave him electric shock? Yeah, we zapped him a few times.  It's fairly standard. It says here thirty-eight... thirty- eight times. What will happen to him now, without  the drugs he was on? There'll be some deterioration. That's  inevitable, but we can't say how  much. During the time that you had him  here, did you discover any particular  habits of his, peculiarities, quirks,  anything that might help me find  him? It's all in the folder. Any letters from people back in  England? Family? That, too, is in the folder. Let's get something straight here,  Doctor. I've been 33 years in the  business of tracking people down and  putting them away. I spent almost a  year on Curt Duncan alone, with the  trial, the testimonies, the background  investigations. I didn't come here  today to look in your goddamn folders.  In fact, I wouldn't have come here  at all if you'd done your job right. Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital,  not a penitentiary. Everything that  pertains to one of our patients is  meticulously recorded in that  patient's folder... whether you can  make sense of it or not. Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid- schizophrenic. They see themselves  as victims, and they always blame  other people for the way they are.  When Duncan killed the Mandrakis  kids, it wasn't an act of hostility  against the children but against  their parents. He was getting back  at his own parents for traumas he  suffered in early childhood. The  criminal side of Curt Duncan is one  of terrible, symbolic vengeance. Assuming he isn't found right away...  what will happen to him? I think you'll find him. Somebody  will find him. He can't function out  there. He'll make a mistake. This is where he belongs. After six  years in here, he's suddenly gone  out to confront the world again. I  think he's in for a bit of a shock. Rackin' 'em up today, Bill? Doin' all right. C'mon in and shut the door. What'll it be? Hey! What'll it be? What kind of clothes was he wearing...  when he escaped? Ordinary street clothes. Not all of  our patients have to wear the green  Gucci gowns. Did he have any money with him? Probably. But not more than, say,  fifty dollars. Some of the patients  are given little jobs around the  ward, for which they are paid. It's  part of the rehabilitation. What's Guy du Mar-- Guy du Marraux syndrom. It's a psycho-motor dysfunction. Duncan had it? Only from time to time, which is  unusual. What is it? It attacks the nervous system. People  suffering from it are irresistibly  compelled to utter obscenities,  sometimes one, sometimes a whole  string of them. They can't control  it. Are you being serious? Yeah. Here, I'll give you an example. Duncan never had the twitch that  sometimes goes with it. And with  Duncan, as I said, the disease would  only manifest itself in periods of  extreme anxiety. When he was really  flipping out, in other words. Duncan was Catholic? Yeah. So am I. That makes three of us. Is that right? So we all share the  same guilt. Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly  after he was admitted here in 1972. -- to put the situation right. The  hypodermic needles are only used to  give you medication that will calm  you down. They make you feel good,  relaxed. All right? We're not putting anything in your  food either. The food is just food. No. I don't eat the food. It doesn't  taste right. That's Duncan. Curt, why are you fidgeting? Can't  you get comfortable? No, I'm not comfortable! Wait a -- Hey! Hold him down there. Grab him! Never  mind the chair! Pull him down... That's right...  Just lay him out... Lay him right  out... Steady... Pull out his knees... What, him? What's the matter? You don't like me  playing with myself? Hi. What you been up to? Next round's on me. After what I been through, I don't  mind anything. See, that's the whole point. My  mind... Your mind... Where do they  fit in? You know what I mean? Do you live around here? Listen, I didn't mean nothin'. I  don't live around here. See -- ? I think the lady wants to be left  alone. I think an apology is in order. That the best you can do? I think you'd better just move along,  pal. He'll be okay now, Bill. He just -- No! I want him out of here! Go on, beat it. I'm not going to say it again, mister. Who're you calling? You're welcome, baby! Okay? Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh,  Bill? A fight breaks out, there's gonna be  damages. Insurance company doesn't  pay without a police report... You see any damages? See ya 'round. No, it's over now... Donna. Donna! Hey! What the hell -- ! What is all this?! Happy birthday, Charlie! Don't shoot us, Charlie! How was I supposed to know? Will you tell me what this is about,  Cliff? Yeah, in a minute. I don't think I can take any more of  these surprises. Okay now, what's the big deal? Stand still. I want you to remember  this in the morning. If you want me to remember something  in the morning, then tell it to me  in the morning. Charlie, come on. All right, all right. What is it?  You're getting married. No. I got a job today, tracking  someone. That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll  find your man. It's Curt Duncan. What? You didn't know he got out? I need your cooperation on this one. Sure. Anything. ...Came to apologize. I... I'm new in town. Don't know anybody... New York. Ever been there? Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone  cold, unfriendly... I'm not from New York, actually. But  I'm very, very far from home. I thought we might get some coffee.  Can I buy you -- ? Someplace nearby? I got no place to go. Just, just a little coffee? Okay, tomorrow. When? I like you. It's okay. It's okay. I'll see you later... sometime. I  still want to buy you that drink. Jesus, I don't recognize anybody. Three years is a long time in a place  like this. Three and a half. Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin'? Hi... How long will you be here? Depends on how lucky I get. I'll only be coming around once,  maybe twice a week. You want to use your old desk?  Someplace to sit down? Is it vacant? Okay, man, move it out. Let's go. Wha -- ? Hey! Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake --  Jesus Christ! What happened to you? You get hit by a truck or what? I'm sorry, man, but you can't stay  in here. Go out to the park, lay in  the sunshine. You'll feel better.  Okay? God bless it! Hey! Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. All right! All right! Whaddya say, pardner. I'm dry as a  bone. You got any money? You neither, huh? My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P.  Guess I better go to work. Take 'er  easy now, pardner. My name's John Clifford. I'm a private  investigator. A private detective. I'd just like to talk, ask a few  questions. Listen, lady, I can be back in thirty  minutes with a search warrant and a  handful of cops, and I can probably  have you arrested, whether or not  the charges would stick. Now do you  want to let me in and talk? I'll show you a badge when you open  the goddamn door! I don't carry a badge. I'm issued a  license, a piece of paper, and I  left it at home. You're Tracy Fuller? Can we sit down? Do you recognize this man? He's escaped from the insane asylum.  In 1972, he murdered two children...  broke into a house and found them  asleep in bed. It was a little boy,  five an a half, and a little three- year-old girl. After the coroner's  investigation, their bodies were  taken to the mortuary, where the  undertaker took one look at them and  said he couldn't have their bodies  reconstructed for the funeral without  six days of steady work. Then he  asked what had been the murder weapon,  because looking at the mess in front  of him, he couldn't imagine what had  been used. The coroner told him there  had been no murder weapon. The killer  had used only his hands. The undertaker went to work and had  them done in four. What's the matter? Do you think he'll try to see you  again? Let's play it safe. Let's assume  that he will. Will you work with me? You again? What are your hours tonight? No hours. Bar's closed on Mondays. I want you to be open if that's  possible. No way. Monday's my night off. Come  back tomorr... This is tomorrow! Now what are your  hours? Any luck? I've come to say goodbye, and thank  you. You found him? I think so. Where? From here on, I go it alone. What's the point of chancing it,  Cliff? We'll let you take the credit. No. I'm going to kill him, Charlie. The closer I get to this guy, the  more I... It gets to me. I don't  know... I think you'd better go on home,  Cliff. You've fallen in. No. Not this time. This is the case  that makes up for a whole career. If  you can't understand it now, you  will in a few years. What part does money play in all  this? Play straight with me. For what I'm being paid, it's not  out of line. Who's hired you for this? So you're a hitman now. He murdered two kids in cold blood.  You were there, too. You could get busted. I understand that. What are you going to use? Jimmy needles. You're stretching our friendship,  Cliff. If you blow this at all -- You'll never hear from me again. Take your time. Do it right. Don't worry. Do you need any help preparing for  this thing? I'm ready. I'm just trying to think  where he could be in the meantime. Coffee. Black. No, thank you. Well! I can't say much for your  protocol, but your timing's dead on.  Here's to you, pardner. I'm looking for an old buddy of mine,  English fella. Name's Crazy Curt.  Any of you guys seen him? I owe him some money. Aaahh. Show me an honest man... Stands about so. Brown hair. Face  kind of banged up. Was in an accident. Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy,  not more'n an hour ago. Looked bad.  Crazy Curt, huh? Where? Hell, I can't remember. Prob'bly see  him again though. Tell you what. You  leave the money with me, I'll see he  gets it... as a favor to you. I have to talk to him. Whatsa matter? You don't trust me?  I'll have you know I used to be a  college professor. We can work  together. Sure. Keep the bottle. I'll be back. "Long life to the grape! For when  summer is flown, The age of our nectar  Shall gladden our own." That's  Shelley, you know. Hey, Hank, what're you doing open  tonight? Trying to make a buck. Keep it, honey. My treat. That how you make a buck? No luck. You see him? He still could be out there, though. Are you all right? I'm going to hang around outside for  awhile. I'll be back on and off again  all night. Are you sure you're okay? All right. Bolt your door. Don't let  anybody in, no matter what. I'll be seeing you. Listen. Thanks. I just have to talk to you. I want you to be my friend. Please... So this will be your first time? An old salt like you? You'll love it here. It's where they  make the bombs. It's where they make  the planes that carry the bombs; the  planes we saw over Singapore and  Manila. There she is. That's America. What's the matter? What about the lad? You can't leave  him. Hey, Crazy Curt! Hail fellow well met, and all that  jazz. It's our lucky day! A friend of your's got money for  you. We got to get back to the park  and meet him. C'mon. He'll be comin' for you, Crazy  Curt. S'got some money. We'll get us a little joy juice. C'mon! Hey!! You really are crazy!  C'mon! "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!  Rage! Blow, you cataracts and  hurricanoes, spout till you have  drench'd our steeples and drown'd  the cocks!" Duncan. Duncan. It's over now. Come  on out. My name's John Clifford. I'm a private  detective. I've been hired by  Alexander Mandrakis to take you back.  I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you... I'm not  going to hurt you... There'll be no  more pain... You're safe now... No! Mandrakis! No! I know. I don't think he'll come back here. Thanks... for all your help. I know it wasn't easy. Maybe, someday, I'll be able to... I'll be around. You like ice cream? What flavor? Okay. Mommy, what's for dinner? Could we  have hamburgers? Hello? Hey, how's my little tiger? Daddy, Junie threw my baseball down  the street; and I can't find it! Well, we'll look for it real hard  later. Let me talk to mommy. Okay. Bye, daddy. Hi, babe -- whaddya say you put on a  sexy dress, and I take you out to  dinner tonight? Just a little surprise. I'm leaving here now; be home in  half an hour. Bye, babe. Mommy, is Daddy gonna get me a new  baseball? Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis are out of  town. For how long? Three more weeks. It's just as well. Will you be here? Yes. Here. Call if you need me. ...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.  If I die before I wake, I pray the  Lord my soul to take. God bless Mommy  and Daddy and... ...and Granmom and Aunt Lucy and  Uncle George... ...and her. Now will you tell us a  story? Goodnight. I thought it was nice. Are the kids asleep? Honey, in ten seconds I eat the  staircase. I'm not wearing that thing! Bye, Carol. Hello? Oh, hi. I can't. I really have a lot of work  to do. I've eaten enough breadsticks to  turn into a pretzel. Oh, yeah. Brace yourself. Good. I got the sack today. The can... I was fired! You don't believe me? Well, Wally did call me into his  office today. And he did tell me I  didn't have my old job anymore. Are you ready for this? Regional! Nah, District. Enjoy your dinner, folks. I'll be the youngest District Manager  in the company's history. God, am I  hungry! It sure does. A lot. And a car. What's the matter? You don't like  your food? Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart? There's a telephone call for you. Have you checked the children? Jill, what's happening? What's wrong? Wait a minute! Just hold on!  Sweetheart, what was him? What are  you talking about? He was on the phone? Hello, Carol, it's Mr. Lockhart.  What's going on over there? Is everything all right? Are you sure? Carol, listen to me very carefully.  If there's a man in the house, if  there's any reason why you can't  talk to me right now, just answer  yes to me over the phone. That's  all. If there's any danger of any  kind, just say yes. Carol, I'm sorry about all the  hysterics. We're leaving the  restaurant now. We'll explain  everything when we get home. Before  we hang up, could you do just one  more thing for me, please? Would you go upstairs and, and check  on the children for me? What seems to be the problem here,  sir? Officer, I'm John Lockhart. Just a  second please, and I'll explain  everything. The babysitter. The guy got into the  house and killed the two children  upstairs. Oh, yeah, I remember something about  that. A Greek doctor... That's right. That's the one. It was in the seventh precinct... Carol? Carol? Jill! Nothing was wrong? If I ever get my hands on the guy  that made that call... He disguised it though, didn't he?  Same as before? Look, we promised never to talk about  this. What are we supposed to do? Leave  town? Take the kids and lock ourselves  up somewhere? Come on... Let's get a  good night's sleep, and in the morning  we can rethink this whole thing. Try to relax, honey. I'm here. We're  both here. The house is locked up.  The cops'll be just outside all night  long. We're safe now. Okay. Look. If it'll make you feel  any better... I'll keep it right here beside me  all night. You know I'm a light  sleeper and a damn good shot. Are  you satisfied? Hey, you're not putting me through  anything that you don't have to go  through yourself. I'm with you all  the way. Trust me. Okay? That's my girl. Now try to relax. We'll get some  sleep. You'll be surprised how  differently things will look in the  morning. What? Naw. Those kids'd sleep through an  earthquake. They're good kids. Here, take a couple of these. They're  just what the doctor ordered. You know, I read somewhere about  this psychological thing called  hysterical delusion or hysterical  recall or something. It had to do  with how an event from your past can  sneak up on you sometimes and fool  you when it's only just a memory. I  don't know. We'll talk about it in  the morning. Maybe there's someone  we can see about that... What's a word for "an outsider, of  sorts"? Trespasser. Uh-uh. Eight letters. Stranger. Uh-uh. Starts with an "I". Hey, Bert. A report just came in on  that guy, Curt Duncan. Broke outta the nuthouse two months  ago. Oh, yeah? You going to put that in  our report? Diamonds, Charlie. Diamonds was led. Course I'm going to put it in the  report. Maybe this gal tonight really  did get a call from him. Who knows? Your lead, Charlie. What the hell are you doing? That's  a trump. A card laid is a card played. Yeah, you're right. We'd better leave  that on Ruznik's desk in the morning. Toss 'em in. I got the rest. Jesus Kay-Reist! Hey, Tucker, lemme see that a minute. You guys have a stake on the house? Bernstein and Waller are checkin' it  every twenty minutes or so. Thanks. Hey, what's an eight letter word for  "an outsider, of sorts"? Starts with  an "I". Intruder! Right! Intruder! Hello? Cliff?... I think I got something  for you... Operator. Can you dial a local number for me? What is the number, please? 555-2183. Operator, what does that mean? I'm sorry, sir, that line seems to  be disconnected. Why don't I get a recording? I don't know, sir. Maybe the number  was just recently disconnected. Maybe  there's a temporary malfunction in  the wiring. Why don't you try it  again in the morning? Yeah, okay. Thanks. Yes? What? The man gave it to me... I don't know... He was... Wings on a  horse... Your husband's okay.
