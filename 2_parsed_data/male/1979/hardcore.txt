Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come. What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long. You mean I'm black?Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead. I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities. There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway. The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there. Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you. We aren't gonna arrest him for that... I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway. Do you really think he's in danger? Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?No. I don't think so. I don't really want... 'body to body contact.' No. I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call. No, just not the type. You're not exactly the type we're looking for. What are you doing? There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave. But is she, has... Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole? Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone. I'm getting angry. I want some answers. Where's the guy who runs this place? I'm getting angry. ...about this woman. I'm trying to find her. Do you know her? I said I just wanted to talk to you... I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars. What do you mean? You want a tip? What do you mean? No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do. I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me. What? Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here. No, I don't. There's a girl I want to ask you about. Well, I want to... You'll be fine. Okay. I'll take a half hour. I just want to ask some questions. Yeah. No. Okay. Just one. I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press. I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young. That's all you got, three girls? What girls you got here? I'm looking for Tod. Is he in? Yeah, yeah... Yeah. Yeah. How did you know? If you say so. Are you sure it's all right? Yeah. Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little... Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley? What's that shade of blue called? Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for. No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall. Don't you think it's a little too... bright? What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary. Is this all the display space we can get? Where is he, Niki? Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is. Where is he? Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live? Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about... Granville? I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex... ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes... Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out? Why do you say that? What makes you so sure? But what? Grand Rapids? Of course. They are the same. I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way. Where does he live. Why can't I meet him now? It's not quite the same thing. I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside. Yeah. Well, mostly. Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will. More or less. He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved. I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.' I can stop if you want. Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven. T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.' It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this? They believe in the 'TULIP.' Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination. Is Kristen safe? What does that mean? What does he do? They were here? What's T-J? I care about my daughter. I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson. Not very. But it's all you do. No. You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex. You used to work at Copper Penny? Is that the way it was with you? Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do? Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you? Say what? You know what I'm talking about. You won't keep growing at this rate. You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you. She's dead. Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago. Yeah. I'm her father. A friend. No. Ulcers. I don't drink, but you can go out. Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep. No. I am. Tonight. When you get out, we'll go. Why didn't you tell the other detective? Okay. My client pays for it anyway. Half now, half later. I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl. Three hundred? Something like that. How much do you make? How much do you make a week, Niki? If we went there, would you be able to find him? Where's he? Where is she? Do you know where she would be? Do you know where she lives? You know her? Um-hm. Live sound. Yeah. I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is. No. Are you Niki? I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together. The other girl is the star? Are you the star of this picture? Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money... Just leave me alone. Does she know anything about this? It's just a name. I just heard. Who is he? Who is Ratan? Why don't you tell me something for a change? You sure as hell haven't been any help. Yeah, sure. Do the police want to arrest me? What are you doing here? Get out! Get out. Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit. Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too. You like this, don't you. Showing me... this. Do you think she's safe? But the police... What's it called? What do you mean? Who made it? Where did you get that film? Where is she? Hmm. They are? No. That's like a stag film. No. What do you mean? Where is she? What have you found out? I'll be there. I've got a meeting... In G.R.? Why? Where are you? The connection sounds very good. Mast? Hello? And better? That's right. Who's paying you? If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language. ...What do you have to offer? So then, Mr. Mast... Well, what do they know? Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them... You don't want to know. Now, Wes, leave, please. For me. I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone. Just do what I say. Don't ask. Leave me alone. Go home. Go away. Wes, do me a favor. How did you find me? Pretty good. Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures. They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her. Wes, Anne, come here a moment. No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office. Where! Where does he hang out? Where is she? Where is the girl? I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good. I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working. It was called 'Slave of Love.' That's what I wanted to talk to you about. That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for. That's not true, Mr...? We're casting for an explicit sex action feature... Let's go. Ratan! Where's Ratan? You ain't goin' nowhere alone. I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you. Good. Okay. Well... Is this with a girl named Kristen? Rucker. Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know... I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide. I want to meet Ratan. No. Yeah. That's all right. No. But I... I'm just trying to find... Who owns this store? I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman... ...right here. This is from the movie I was talking about. It's a short film. Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?' What? Sounds all right. Jake. I thought you were a businessman. It's an investment. Not exactly... I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done... Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill? Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body. Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this. I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest. Yes. I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to. No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators. What do you think of that? Or this? Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off? I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her? I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest. I don't know. She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other. Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me. God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing. Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids. Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff. Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim. I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone. Hey man.Hold it, mister. Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off. Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?Big threat. TV would ream you. If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star. You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you... Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over. But I'm here to help you... What happened, pilgrim? Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen. Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can. You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed... One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country. How'd you hear about him? Where'd you hear that name? Like what? I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me. Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into. Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am. I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face. But this is my apartment. I'm only human, you know. Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong. I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something. I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy. A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why. Yeah. Probably. The police? They know less than you do. It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else. Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist. I don't know. I bought it at a store in L.A. I don't know. There's a little stall theatre up here. It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see. Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids. They're legal now. Yeah. You ever seen any of those? Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is? Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake? I don't know. I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is. This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all. What are you paying me for? Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel? I'm back in Grand Rapids. Yeah. Mr. Van Dorn? I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down. As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here. Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper. You are. Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them. No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around... Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe? Andy. Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care. Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in. To his own daughter? Huh? Maybe. Maybe not. I've been on another case. All day. I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses. I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing. I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal. I'm off that case. He fired me. I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me. Ssh. I'm on a stakeout. Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you? Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job? You're taking a big chance. The guy who bought you that ring. Granville's looking for you anyway. You know Granville's looking for you, Niki? Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble. I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff. You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.No. 'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now. You working in San Diego now?No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents. Here. Take your fifty cents back. You don't want anything for your fifty cents? I don't know nothing, man. I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops. That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody. I don't know what you're talking about. They're all about the same. You want something? What we got is just these here. What you see. It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase. Fifty cents admission.Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there. That film was a fake! Everything's phony... Who? You wait here. I'll find out where she is. I don't know what you're talking about. What do you want? Do I know you from somewhere? Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film. Take it or leave it. Um-hm. You got the five hundred? I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening. Who told you about this? You're talking about real excitement? What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan. What you got in mind? Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency? I hear you got money to spend. I hear you're interested in... interesting things.What will I tell the others? They care about you. What plan? What is going on? What? I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here. What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive. Jake? You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore. How's your business, Jake? I'll come with you. Let me pack some things. Is Marsha there? What happened? What is it, Jake? Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone. You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off? To anybody. You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything. I also want you to protect my brother- in-law. Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway? I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law. He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what. I'm worried about Jake. Oh.
