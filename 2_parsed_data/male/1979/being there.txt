I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you? ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr... ... Chance...? In a day or two, yes. Yes, I suppose that's true. ... He's gone, Chauncey. Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you? ... It's five of, you'd best get on in there. Why, that's terrific, Chauncey. He does, does he? ... Oh? You've heard? ... Oh. ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe. ... Were you going somewhere? ... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness? I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full... ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably... ... Any pain here? Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that. Please, sit in the chair. Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg? ... And please call me Robert. I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort. Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician? Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere. Oh, I see... ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit... Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys? An attorney? Thomas? Who's Thomas? Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's? Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg. ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out. You can pull your trousers up, now. However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after. It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone. But not for long... Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all. The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner. It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it. And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please. Some pain is to be expected... ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest. ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed. That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men. To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence. I think we'd better go look for him. David! You really care for him, don't you, Eve? I don't think so, he should be along soon... ... He walked off... He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet... ... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben... No, Eve... I'm sorry. At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor. How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace. Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man. A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days. Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here. Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin. I see. Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word. Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden? I have no idea...Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think. I don't think that's entirely true, Grover. Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner. Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still. Yes, sir. No sir, I don't believe I do.Yes, Robert - I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert. Yes. I love Eve very much. Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed. Will you be leaving now, Robert? Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people. Oh, really? I would like to walk today. Thank you, Robert. How do I know when it's ten o'clock? Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock. Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President. Yes, Robert. I know about the President. No, Robert. Hardly any, Robert. Yes, Robert. But it's not bad. It's fine today, Robert. Yes, Robert. I will. Yes, I will. No. Yes, I could stay here. Thank you. Thank you. There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one. Yes. Thomas Franklin, an attorney. Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me. ... Straight out? Oh, fine. I see. Yes. I think so, too. You were wrong, it did hurt. I understand. I've seen it done before. I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television. A Black man gave me the message. Oh. I have a message for him. Do you know Raphael? No. I like this attic very much. Yes. I would like to be on that show. Yes, I have seen that show on television. Oh, yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve. Hello, Eve. That's very interesting, Eve. Yes. It's very good, Eve. Yes. I like to watch. I like to watch. Thank you. Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise. He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while. No. I was with a man. We went upstairs. Hello, Dennis. Yes. Thank you, Eve. Yes. That could be true. Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open. Yes, Eve. I know that. No, Eve. I like you to be here. I like the President. He is a very nice man. No, Eve. I don't read the papers. Good night, Eve. I see. No, thank you. That's good. I like to watch, too. How is Ben feeling? Thank you, Eve. Hello, Eve. Yes, Eve. You'll be all right. So am I, Eve. Oh, I like that very much. What is that? Oh, no. She brought me my meals. Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid. Yes. I was. ... Mentor...? He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young. Yes. Fine. He's very nice. Yes. It's feeling much better now. Hello, Eve. Good night, Eve. That's good. Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies? I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man... Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before. Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much. I am a very good gardener. No. I like it here. No. The Old Man died and Louise left. No. It won't do that. Yes. I like to watch. This is fine. Yes. I lost my remote control. No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita. No. I'm a gardener. My name is Chance. Hello, Eve. I would like to watch television. Yes. Thank you. I agree. Your family doctor? It's feeling better, but it's still very sore. Yes. He's a very careful driver. Yes. I am. There's no need for a hospital. I have nothing more to say. Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that. The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much. No. I'm not busy. Hello, Sid. Yes. It's a very good show. I see. Hello, Morton. I see. Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert... Yes, I do, it's very good. Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good. Yes, very well, thank you. Thank you. Yes, Eve. That would be good. Yes. I like that name very much. Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name again, please? Oh, good. Do you think so? Do you think so? I certainly do. We are not far... ... our chairs almost touch. Yes, I understand. Yes, I agree, I think so too. Ben is very ill. Yes, Eve. I shall yield too. I agree. Yes. I would like to do that. A flower... Oh, I see. Yes, Ben - are you going to die now? Yes. I would like to escort Eve. Certainly, Ben. Thank you, Ben. I understand. No, Ben. I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President. Yes, Ben - he is. Yes. That is correct. I see, Ben. Thank you, Ben. ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben. I understand. You're looking much better today, Ben. Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore. I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore. No, Ben. It's a very pleasant room, Ben. But I don't have that any more... ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs. Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow. I see. I would like to work in your garden. Yes. Chauncey is fine. Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys. No, thank you. My house has been closed. Yes. I am very hungry. I agree. Yes. You look very sick. Yes. I like that very much. I feel very good in here. ... I see. Yes. I want to tell Eve. Yes. I like to watch very much. I like to watch. What sort of bed is it? Yes. I like to watch. I can't read. I can't write. Hello, Ronald. Yes, I would like to see Ben. Yes. Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital. Good day, Sally. Yes. I have seen styles on television. I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats. No. That's where Joe fixed the bricks. No. Yes. Of men and women. I never needed money. Oh. Thank you. Yes. Yes. ... My suitcase. ... Yes. You can take me. I've never ridden in an automobile. Yes. Of course. I would like to look. I agree. It's very sore. No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore. ... Hmmm... Elevator. Yes. It seems to be. ... That is a very small room. How long do we stay in here? I see. Does it have a television? Yes. I'm going to work in the garden. Yes, I'm very hungry. Yes. It is. Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people. ... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white. Yes. I've seen that done. ... I see. Good morning, Louise. Is his back feeling better? I see. ... Good evening, Louise. I am a very serious gardener. Thank you. Yes. We need a very good gardener. Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds. Yes. Yes. I was there with Ben. Which view? No. I don't object. I hope so. Yes. That is surprising. You're welcome. Yes. Move out? I don't understand, Thomas. Correct. I have no claim, Thomas. No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign. I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim. I would like to stay and work in my garden. Yes, I understand. The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control. He has one just like it. No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile. No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers. Those trees were very young when I first arrived. No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television. You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need? Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden. Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there. Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book. Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952. I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors. No, I do not have any of those. I was given meals, and a home... Compensated...? No. Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden. Ever since I can remember, since I was a child. Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas? I live here. I see... Yes. Louise will bring me lunch. Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch. Yes, Thomas - I understand. Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener. Yes. I will. Yes. It has. That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again... As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden. Yes, I will. You look much taller on television, Mr. President. Good morning, Mr. President.Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd. Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand? Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too. We can go this way. Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone? We could do it now, we can go upstairs. ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.Your foot! Give me your foot!! I don't want Robert. Really? Really!!! ... Are you sure you like it? Do you like it? Can you see well?Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve... It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator... ... Is it me? Is there something I've done? ... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling. Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you... Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...Certainly, glad to be of help. Of course, Doctor, I understand. Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it. Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions. ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act? I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave... Call me if you change your mind about signing. C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite... Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out. But you won't sign, correct? Come now, Mr. Chance. Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect. Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate. What are your plans now, Mr. Chance? Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased. ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance? Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance? Have you served in the Army? ... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance. Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine. Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago. 1952...? ... Joe? Who's Joe? Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist? Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook? How were you paid? How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed? Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents? Since you were a child? ... How long have you been living here? You live here? ... We don't have any record of that. ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here? Louise?... The maid?... But she should have left earlier today... Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here? ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment? ... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate. ... The gardener? ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes. Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure... ... Let's just keep everything legal. ... Yeah... ... What do you make of all this? Gladly... ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one. Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born... Look, Johanna... Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner... No! He's a real gardener! It's that gardener!Good day, Mr. Chance. It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style. Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance? How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes? ... Oh. Some pictures...? What about money? Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance. ... Then you really are a gardener? Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you. ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think... I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming... ... Would you take me on a tour? ... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner. Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years? Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis. Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'Yes sir. I'll take care of that. Very good. I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you? Please, sir. It's starting to swell, is it painful? Let's have a look, do you mind? I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious. Can you walk? It's not broken, is it? This is terrible, sir - I hope you're not badly injured...Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted. We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time. Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments. Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer. Yes, sir. Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent. We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh... Right, Chief. No, sir. Right, Chief. Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to... Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to... No problem, Chief. Gardiner, yes, sir.Sid, it's useless! Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed! ... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check! ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch... ... Nothing.Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations. Good night. And what do the boys around Intelligence think? Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...? Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers. Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you. Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello. ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you? ... Spring and summer... Yes, I see... Fall and winter. Yes, indeed... Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner? ... In the garden? Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives? Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to... Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner... ... Oh, really... ... Hello. I can certainly understand that... It's not that, I just... Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you... No, that won't do any good. Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as... Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack? ... How are the kids getting along? Good. Anything else? Oh? What? I would appreciate that. ... So what does all that add up to? I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman. What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman? So...? Where the hell is it? This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that. This is not what I requested. I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt. I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time. I've got to take a leak. He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin! ... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown. And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible. Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background. Mr. Gardiner... Take care of yourself, Ben. Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life! I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts. It's that serious, huh? That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance. Well, Ben... I... ... Well? I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben. Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure. Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you. Here, sit down, get off your feet. It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific! Ben!We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times! And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner! How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend! Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov! Yes, it is very good! So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one! So you know Krylov! Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you. Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree? And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far! To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy? ... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often? Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover. Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner. I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President. ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail. Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others. How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling? You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss. Hmmm... Take this down. I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."' I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance. But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week? What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible. Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language. Yes? What have you found? Thank you, Colonel. Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod. A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself! That could be possible...Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir. ... Did you wish to see someone, sir? ... Sir? May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?... Yes sir - elevator! Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house. How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ... No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself. Yes, ma'am. I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by. Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
