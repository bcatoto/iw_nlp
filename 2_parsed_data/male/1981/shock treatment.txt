BREAKING OUT BREAKING OUT BREAKING OUTNothing. Just...memories! They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn. I tell you what's cooking. She made the blind see and it was a gift! Who was it from? Let's hear an 'F" for... Sank you! Velcome! Sank you! Time to check with Flavors. Fools! A wreck. Of course. Good! I'm gonna be there. You got it! Congratulations! It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton. You got it! As Janet's parents this should be really easy. Your last clue... Mental Instability. You have thirty seconds. SIN-I-FUL But...how? After breakfast. You're sounding tense, Janet. Maybe I could give you a little massage? Home? Right! An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep. On the contrary. He wants to see your ratings soar. He needs a woman of exceptional desirability. It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep. Of course! D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment! Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet? Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage. We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad. Introduce yourselves. In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin. Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley. I am in Farley's employ -- and... ...we're discussing a network deal. Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research. Out of self comes selflessness. Who trusts experts? Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see. Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene. Dentonvale has been sold. No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE But I don't need treadment. I'm not going, Janet. I don't want to get up there. YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSESOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHERTHE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues? What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block. I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week. And Hank says Danny's moved to New York. To better himself. I'd forgotten. Mental instability? YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCEYOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu. Absolutely correct. Sure thing.Foods! Fast! Fabulous! Flavors! Farley!Show yourself. The real you. The secret you. We're the experts. With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on. SOLD??!! SPONSOR!!! Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled. If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract? Arrest that man! He's committed to our care. Brad! Of course. He was in great danger of harming himself. EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK You've got a really tight team around you. And everybody needs you! He will. But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings. You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous. And Farley's given you that chance. You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead. You are the most desirable creature that ever walked. Absolutely true. Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty. I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself. Look at yourself. It's classical. Almost a textbook case... Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you. There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy. Just one or two details. Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives? Good! Well there's still hope. Lots of hope. In the old series we didn't have a convertible. CRIMINAL THAT MINIMAL OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME... YOU PLAY FOR BROKE... WHAT A JOKE... YOU'RE NO GOOD YOU'RE NO GOOD And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning. That's an extremely negative response. It's you we're concerned about, Janet. What does he know about it? HE!!?? How dare this person take advantage of my weakness. I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you! Ah. Mr. And Mrs. Majors. How wonderful to see you. I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing. So it seems. Why Janet? How did you come by this scenario? Dear old Bert's settled everything. He's a lame dog, remember? But even he wouldn't want to see you like this. It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for? The question is, does Brad want to see you? Quite frankly, he hates you. But they only think they're happy. Of course. This could be worse than the old series. SIN-I-FUL CRIMINAL YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING... YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE... WHAT A JOKE... YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD This is the nerve center of operations, Janet. You must stay here tonight. That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush. Yes, Janet. Leave the crying to Brad. Yes how are you, Janet? Are you happy? Our field. I don't think he intends to go that far. Our speciality. We understand you've been going through a rather trying time. We all love Janet...Who do we love? She walks in beauty... Isn't she lovely? And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion. No.SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT Faith, Betty. But make sure it's your own. President? Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up. Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley? In a little masquerade? Care to indulge? Yes, Betty. But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset. Yes. Macabre, isn't it. The blind leading the blind. A 'stately pleasure home' indeed. Clever of you to find this spot, Betty. Yes, Betty. Now Betty, don't overreact. ...closed? Ah yes. Farley Flavors. You know, I find it... It's happened before. Remember Lieutenant Orpheus? He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back. McKinley?...McKinley? Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front? What an ideal couple. A free thinker. Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man. Judge Wright? Now, Betty? First name terms, surely! Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly... In a way...SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERSBREAKING OUT BREAKING OUT BREAKING OUTDon't worry, Janet. Brad'll probably get just what he needs. Dentonvale...say, that's for... I'm sorry to hear that, Janet. Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise... Vance! Vance Parker. Hey! What are you trying to do? Get yourself committed?What? What's cookin', Bert? I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours. Check. The quacks are willing tools? How's Brad? Later, Brenda. Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment? You bet, Bert. No! I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here! You too, Betty! I'll leave you young things to it. Yeah, well. Here, Betty. I just came to give you this. Oh. Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I? THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE ...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton. Ah, Macy. Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME NIGHT NIGHTF for... F for... F for... F for...
