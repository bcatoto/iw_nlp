What the fu... Norwegian... Jans Bolen. Gotta be from the Norwegian camp. How far's that? 'Bout eighty kilos southwest. That far? You catch anything he was saying? Yeah. I caught that he wanted the  better part of my ass to come apart. Don't "ouch" me. Two stitches. It  just grazed you. Stir crazy. Cabin fever... Who knows. I'll be here a while. Shell's pretty  deep. It's no go. Well, get to somebody. Anybody. We've  got to report this mess. Look, I haven't been able to reach  shit in two weeks. Doubt if anybody's  talked to anybody on the whole  continent. Maybe we at war with Norway. Was wondering when "El Capitan" was  going to get a chance to use his pop  gun. How long have they been stationed  there? Says here about eight weeks. That's not enough time for guys to  go bonkers. Bullshit, Bwana, sweetheart. Five  minutes is enough to put a man over  down here. Damn straight. I mean Palmer been the way he is  since the first day. How many in their party? Started with six. There'd be four  others left. How do you know? ...Guys as crazy as that could have  done a lot of damage to their own  before they got to us. Nothing we can do about that. Yes, there is. I'd like to go up. In this weather? Bennings? A tad? Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift  if... Forget it, Palmer. Doc, you're a  pain in the ass. Norris, go get MacReady. MacReady ain't going nowhere. Bunkered  in till spring. Just go get him. Anyway, he's probably ripped. Bishop to knight four. Pawn takes queen at knight four. Rook to knight six. Check. You jerking off or just pissed? Get your gear on. Screw regulations! Four guys could  be crawling around on their bellies  out there! Look, if you're going to keep  bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered  to take him up... Four! Mac's really taking it up, huh? Anybody there?! We're Americans! My God, what in hell happened here? They're not Swedish, goddamn it,  they're Norwegian, MacRe -- Christ... ...Laboratory. All in Norwegian. Could be important work. Might as  well bring it back. Watch it. Turn that crap down, Nauls. You can  hear it all over the camp! Oui, Bwana. Can do. Hey, man...! You reach anybody yet? We're a thousand miles from anybody  else, man. It's going to get a hell  of a lot worse before it gets better. Well, stick to it. Hello boy. Clark! Will you kennel this goddamn  dog? Hey, Clark?! ...Seems they were spending a lot of  time at a place four miles northeast  of their camp. What were they involved in? About nine more hours. Probably right. MacReady and I were listening to  some of these cassettes on the way  back. Like you gentlemen to hear it. Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it? Could be anything... Men in  isolation... some beef that  snowballed... got out of hand... Maybe the whole camp got bent...   Something they ate. What about food  poisoning, Doc? Maybe. There's something else we want you  to see. We found this. I know he's pretty badly burned...  but could fire have done this? Blair, I'd like you and Fuchs to  help me with autopsies on this one  and the one Garry shot this morning. Nothing wrong with this one.   Physiologically, anyway. Find anything toxic? No drugs... alcohol. Nothing. I don't understand. It's tissue from one of these sinewy  rods. What in the world kind of cell  structure is this? That's the point. I don't get you, Blair. I'm not sure it is any kind of cell  structure. Biologically speaking. This really isn't my field, Blair.  Let's wrap for the day. What's got into... I don't know what the hell's in there,  but it's weird and pissed off,  whatever it is. Mac, where are you? What's going on, damn it? No! Wait!! We're on fire! Extinguishers. It's okay now, man. It's dead. It's  over. You see. I know. Mr. Childs killed it. I saw. Right, man. Right. Here. This is where they were spending  most of their time. Was that dog, the Norwegian dog? I just can't comprehend any of this.  It was just a dog. That tape MacReady showed us this  morning... Couldn't make much of it myself. I've asked him to try and locate the  site. Okay with you? Sure. You think there's a connection? Maybe. One of their sites would be directly  over here. Wow... Magnesium of some type... or some  kind of strange alloy. And those poor dumb bastards had to  go and blow the hell out of it. You know damn well what we both make  of it. Seismic activity has been pushing  this are up from way down for a long  time... ...This ice it was buried in...   It's over a hundred thousand years  old. Where's that big ol' steel pot of  mine?! Damn! Happens all the time, man. They're  falling out of the skies like flies.  Government knows all about it...   Chariots of the Gods, man... They  practically own South America. I  mean they taught the Incas everything  they knew... Read von Daniken! Have you read von  Daniken? Get your facts straight! Jesus, why would those guys ever  want to leave Norway...? Which one you muthers been tossing  his dirty underwear in the kitchen  trash?! I want my kitchen clean. Germ free! It was here... got to that dog... It  was here in this camp... So...? So what? It's over with. Whatever that Norwegian dog was...   It... It was capable of changing its  form... ...when it attacked our dog... it  somehow was able to digest... or...  absorb it... and in the process shaped  its own cells to imitate our dog's  cells exactly... ...This for instance isn't dog at  all -- it's imitation... We got to  it before it had time to finish or... Finish what? ...I think the whole process would  have taken an hour... maybe more.  And then I suppose both would have  changed back to dog form. Well, that Thing in the ice sure  weren't no dog. Of course not... But whatever it was  revived, it... Well, The Thing was  probably disoriented... and realized  it couldn't survive for long in our  atmosphere... But being the incredibly  adaptable creature it was... it tried  to become something that could...  Before the Norwegians killed it...  it somehow got to this dog. What do you mean "got" to the dog? It was a life form that was able to  imitate and reproduce, whatever it  ate or absorbed, cell for cell. The concept is staggering. I know...  I... I don't fully understand it  myself. I think we're talking about an  organism... that could imitate other  life forms... perfectly... It could  have gone on and on... It could have  become one dog... It could have become  as many dogs as it wanted to -- and  without losing any of its original  mass... You been into Childs' weed, Blair? Look, I know it's hard to believe... So what's our problem? Well... there's still some cell  activity... it's not entirely dead  yet. You can't do this! You can't burn  these remains... Well, I'm not going to let this  happen... I just can't believe it... We're  going to go down as the biggest bunch  of assholes in history... Clark, did you notice anything strange  about that dog? Just anything at  all? Any little thing? No. Just that he recovered real  quick... That night when I found him  in the rec room, he had already  scraped off his bandage. Before I  put him with the others, I redressed  his wound and noticed it had healed  up real good... That night? Yeah. What was he doing in the rec room? Well, after I worked on him -- thought  I'd let him rest. Left the room for  a bit. When I came back, he was gone. Well, where was he? Where did he go? Don't know. Looked for him for a  bit... couldn't find him. You're saying he wasn't put into the  kennel until the night? Well... yeah. How long were you with the dog? Alone,  I mean? Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked  an artery... I don't know... An  hour... hour and a half... What the hell you looking at me like  that for? Nothing. Nothing at all. ...It could have gotten to somebody... Anybody sick? No, I... I don't mean infection...  or disease... Any luck yet? Couple seconds of an Argentine disco  station. Well, stick with it. I want you at  it round the clock. We got to get  help in here... No... No, you can't let anyone in  here... That dog was all over this  camp... ...Goddamn fools... Listen to me, Garry. Please... If the weather clears enough before  we reach anybody -- I'm sending you  and Doc up to MacMurdo... The hell you won't, MacReady! Don't you understand?! That Thing  didn't want to become a dog... Damn you, Blair! You've already got  everybody half-hysterical around  here. You can't let anybody leave! I've got six dead Norwegians on my  hands, a burned up flying saucer,  and we've just destroyed the  scientific find of the century. Now  fuck off! Rook takes bishop at Queen four --  Rook take pawn at Queen two -- Rook  takes Queen at Queen one -- Checkmate. Blair. He's gone berserk. Anybody interferes, I'll kill!  Nobody's getting in or out of this  camp... ...You think I'm crazy? Fine! Most  of you don't know what's going on --  but I'm damn well sure some of you  do! The back window. A couple of us could  maybe surprise him. ...You think this Thing wants to  become an animal? Dogs can't make it  1000 miles to the sea. No skua gulls  to imitate this time of year... No  penguins this far inland... Don't  you understand?! It wanted to become  us! ...Can't you see...? If one cell of  this Thing got out it could imitate  every living thing on Earth. Nothing  could stop it! Nothing! No, you're not! I don't trust any of  you! Why am I here? It's for your own protection, Blair. I don't know who to trust. Watch Clark. Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't  kennel the dog. I'll see what I can do. But they  didn't teach me much about fixing  these things. They didn't teach you much about  working them either. Put this in Blair's juice before you  take him his tray. The dogs... Doesn't look broken. No. Door was wide open. I know I  latched it. All three of them took off. How long do you suppose they've been  gone? I haven't seen them since their last  feeding. Could be as much as twenty- four hours. You're not thinking of going after  them, are you? What in the hell for? Even if Blair's  right -- they'll just die out there.  No food. They're over a thousand  miles from anything. Chopper aren't going to be ready for  days. You're not going to catch them in  one of those with the start they  got. Oh, I got you. Not too long. Besides, what are you going to do  when you catch up to them? ...I'm telling you I don't remember  leaving the kennel unlatched... ...Would I even have told you they  were gone if I had anything to hide? But why didn't you kennel that dog  right away? I told you I couldn't find... ...get that out of my face. Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't  the judge and executioner around  here! Hold on, damn it. We're getting  nowhere... If this bit of Blair's  about absorbing and imitating is  true... then that dog could have  gotten to anybody. And if it got to Clark... Clark could  have gotten to anybody. Theoretically any of us could be  whatever the hell this thing is. It's just too damn wild -- I can't  believe it. So what? I wear a size large, too. Well, what we going to do? Can there be... some kind of test?  To find out who's what? A serum test possibly. Right. Why not? What's that? It's a simple blood typing test.  This Thing's blood chemistry is  different than ours. Basically we  mix someone's blood with  uncontaminated human blood. If we  don't get the proper serum reaction --  then that person isn't human. We've got blood plasma in storage. How long will it take you to prepare  this? A couple of hours. Well, get to it. How's that Thing get to the dogs? I  though we stopped it in time. And that was enough? Garry. The rest of you! Come here! Somebody got to the blood... sabotaged  it. Oh, my God. No. Somebody opened it. Closed it.  And then locked it. I guess I'm the only one. And I've got the only key. I think so. Somebody else sure as hell thought  so. Ah... no one... I give it to Copper  when he needs it... I don't see how... when I'm finished  I return it right away. When was the last time you used it? A day or so ago... I guess. I suppose... well, it's possible  someone might have lifted it from  me. But... Look, I haven't been near that...  that refrigerator. Copper's the only one who has any  business with it. Now... wait a second, Garry, you've  been in here on several occasions... And the Doc thought of the test. Hey, Sanchez! Put that down! No. I'll put this right through your  head. You guys going to let him give orders?  I mean he could be one of those  Things. I don't know about Copper. But I  didn't go near that plasma... But I guess you'll all rest easier  if someone else is in charge. Can't see anyone objecting to you,  Norris. Sorry, gentlemen... ...Don't think I'd be up to it.  Haven't been feeling well lately. Morphine? You know I was pretty close  to that dog, too. We should sleep in shifts. How we going to try and find out  who's... you know, who's who? I'll try.  I could sure use Copper's  help though. Where's that magneto? Can't find a  darn thing around here any more. I'll do it. You're going to break  the needle in my arm. That thing's too smart to be hiding  any more of its clothes, MacReady. Nothing yet. But, MacReady, I've  been thinking... If our dogs changed  by swallowing parts of that other  one... We better see to it that  everyone prepares their own food and  we eat out of cans. Childs, where's that magneto from  Chopper One? No it ain't there. Would I be asking  if it were there? I got your goodies, superdude. What you doin'? Nobody's getting in here. You can  tell them all that! Well, who the hell you think wants  to get in there with you? Now why'd you go and... And I don't want any more food with  sedatives in it. I know what you're  up to. Don't think I don't. And if  anyone tries to get in here -- I've  got rope. I'll hang myself before it  gets to me. You promise? Crazy white scientist motherfucker... Gotta go to the can, Childs. Childs! That a fuse? I'm working it! Nothing's happening! It's shorted out or something! Somebody's taken it. I can't find  it! MacReady, that you? It's the generator I think! No power. The fuel pump... it's gone... You've got to get up to supply, Mca.  If we don't get this thing started  soon, it'll freeze on us and we'll  never get it going. Mac, where the hell is that pump!! Somebody definitely messed with it. Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is... Where were the flashlights? Tons of stuff's been missing around  here. Magnetos, cables, wire... Kitchen things, too... Was dark... find a light... I rather don't like your tone... Enough... Why? I ain't going with Sanchez. I ain't going with him. I'll go with  Childs... Well, screw you, man! I ain't going with you! What'd we ever do to these Things  anyway... What? Right. I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd  like to come back inside... I don't  want to stay out here any more...   Funny things... I hear funny things  out here. Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You  must let me back in... I won't harm  anyone... I promise... I promise! I'm much better now! I'll  be good!! I'm all better!! Don't  leave me here!! I'm getting worried about you. You  ought to have a checkup. Let's just not get worried about  anything just now. After all this mess then. After all this mess. Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut. Where's the roof?! This storm do that? Goddamn white women. Somebody broke in. Childs!! Don't get near 'em. The plants!  They're alive. Those things can  imitate anything... We got to burn 'em. Whoever put this through him... ...is one bad-ass and strong muther. Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't  that its number -- to get more  recruits. Why Fuchs? MacReady!! Forty... Forty-five minutes. All of you! Come here! Where's MacReady? Cut him loose of the line up by his  shack. When we were up poking around his  place... I found this... ...It was stashed in his old coal  furnace... wind must have dislodged  it... I don't think he saw me find  it. ...Made sure I got ahead of him on  the towline on the way back... cut  him loose. MacReady...? He's one of them. When do you think it got to him? Could have been anytime. Anywhere. Look, man... When the lights went out... Would have been a perfect time... Right. Garry was missing... ...And Sanchez... Fuck you, Palmer. This is just what it wants... to pit  us against each other. Bullshit! He's got to know damn well  I cut it! Let's open it. You think he's changed into one of  those Things? He hasn't had enough time. Let's open it. Now... He's so close. Maybe our best chance  to blow him away. What if we're wrong about him? The supply window! What we going to... All right... all right... we've got  no choice now... It's cool, man. We ain't near you,  man... Stay cool... Yeah, man, really. Just relax. I don't think he's breathing. Damn it, quit the bickering and give  me a hand. Wheel that fibrillator  over here. Palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold  the mask over his face... Childs,  grab his shoulders. Quiet down... ...turn that thing on. Now hold him. Enough, MacReady! Again... More current this time,  Sanchez... Damn you, MacReady! God... what...? What you got in mind, MacReady? What kind of test? Let's rush him. He's not going to  blow us all up. He's dead. What are you going to do? Drink it? Thank you. Pure nonsense. This won't prove a  damn thing. I know you gentlemen have been through  a lot. But when you find the time...  I'd rather not spend the rest of the  winter tied to this couch. Shut the damn hell up. What is it? Where was he trying to go? What about Childs? Make 'em short. They'll go off quicker  if we need to use them. What if it doesn't come? You crazy? He might be inside already? He might just wait us out. One thousand volts. Should be enough. You hear that? Hear what? It's got into the pub! It's turned  on the stereo! What?! It's in between us and them!! How we  going to get back?! I can't hear you. What's he saying? MacReady! We been cut off!! Get back!! Screw the generator!! Got Sanchez... World War Three  wouldn't mess with this fucker...   Can go through walls... And it's  like all over the place... Position, my ass... I'm going to bump this up, much as I  can. Boulder Dam might do it. How long's it been? Maybe it ain't coming. Bet the last place you ever go.
