Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong  friends. This time it will cost you. And you thought I'd given up. Yes, too bad. You could warn them...  if only you spoke Hovitos. Kill him! Don't mind him. That's Reggie.  Wouldn't hurt a soul. The world's full of them, you know. Come on now, Sport, show a little of  the old backbone. Do you think the idol will ever show  up? I couldn't get the McNabe, Professor.  Someone's got it checked out 'til  next month when classes start. Will there be anything else? No, they're beautiful. The Museum  will buy them as usual. No questions  asked. I brought along some people today. Government. Don't worry, it's not about your  business. They're from the Army. Army Intelligence. They're looking  for Abner. You know nothing of his whereabouts? Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of  it. Tanis. They must have discovered the  lost ruins. Frankly, we're a little suspicious...  An American being mentioned so  prominently in a secret Nazi cable. Then what do they want him for? What would the Nazis want with this -  this Staff of Ra? I can tell you that. Over the last  two years the Nazis have had teams  of archeologists running around the  world looking for all kinds of  religious artifacts. What is this Staff of Ra, anyway? What's this Ark look like? Good God! I'm beginning to understand Hitler's  interest in this thing. I've got to talk to you. Indy, it's important. They want you to go for it. And  they'll pay. Of course. General Hok's a tough customer. They  don't call him the Wild Boar for  nothing. And he's tied in with the  Japanese. Buzz Kehoe, Army Intelligence. You've  met Bang Chow. Some German agents got here two hours  ago. Luckily, Bang was able to have  them detained at Customs. We'll have  to hurry. Jesus! Are you all right! What now? Gmoiska! Shurga rintoik! Aye! That'll be your last word. He's our man! All of Allah's creatures are welcome  here. You please us by letting us  please you. All Arabs look alike to them, Indy. We found it three days ago. I broke  through myself. The Frenchman is helping them. I'm afraid this has put the Germans  close to finding the Well of the  Souls. But I know someone who might. You  can go to see him tomorrow. Indy... something bothers me. It is the Ark. If it is there, at  Tanis... It is not something man was  meant to disturb... Death has always  surrounded it. It is not of this  earth. The gentleman in the corner sent it.  He would like you to join him. Good evening, Dr. Jones. It was not I who brought the girl  into this dirty business. Sit down, please, before you fall  down. We can behave as civilized  people. I'm afraid it will be your  last opportunity. These Arabs will not interfere in  the white man's business. They do  not care if we kill each other off. Terribly difficult finding a decent  vintage here. You were quite vigorous  in Shanghai. Unfortunately, our friend  the Wild Boar had taken the precaution  of making several copies of the piece. How odd that is should end this way  for us, after so many... stimulating  encounters. I almost regret it. Where  shall I find a new adversary so close  to my own level? I know you despise me. We always  hate in others that which we most  fear in ourselves. And you and I are  very much alike. We have always done the same kind of  work. Our methods have not differed  as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy  reflection of you. But it would have  taken only a nudge to make you the  same as me, to push you out of the  light. You know it to be true! How nice.  And how ironic the timing. Do you realize what the Ark is? It's a transmitter. A radio for  talking to God! And now it is within  my grasp. When the time is right. When I am  finished with it. Yes. Very. You may consider yourself  fortunate that your involvement  concludes here. I was lucky to get away with my life.  The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded  about the whole matter. You have not changed. But, please,  do not reach for your weapon until  you are ready to die. Next time, Indiana Jones, it will  take more than children to save you. I thought we would find you there. Better than the United States Marines,  eh? Yes, I know. I am sorry. More reason than ever to beat the  bastards. Life goes on, Indy. There is the proof. I have much to tell you, Indy. This morning. Belloq and the boss  German, Shliemann. When they came  out of the map room, we were given a  new spot in which to dig... out away  from the camp. Come. Look. This is a warning... not to disturb  the Ark of the Covenant. Yes... it is here. It says it is... ten jamirs high... About seventy-five inches. Wait! I am not finished... "And one jamir to honor the Hebrew  God whose Ark this is." A home run, my friend, grand slam! We have a saying - "A little luck is  better than much smartness." Indy,  pardner, you are very lucky fellow. Bad dates. There! That is the map room! Just after eight. Hey! You, the skinny one! Yes, you. What are you doing there? Well bring that rope over here, you  cur. Bring us some of that! Now, idiot! Water. Bring us water. Hey, you! More water over here! Why aren't you at the digs? Come  here! No, dummkopf, I said come! I cautioned you about being premature  with that communiquï¿½ to Berlin.  Archeology is not an exact science.  If does not adhere to time schedules. Nothing. I have made no promises. I  said only that it looked very  favorable. Perhaps the Ark will still  be found in an adjoining chamber.  Based on the information in our  possession, my calculations were  correct. Perhaps some bit of evidence  still eludes us. Perhaps I tell you, she knows nothing useful. Asps. Very dangerous. Believe me, you made a mistake. If  you would just give me something to  placate them. Some bit of information. I cannot control them. Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you  doing in such a nasty place? No thank you, my friend. I think we are all very comfortable  up here. After all these years, it is most  considerate of you to aid me in this  way. The girl was mine! Goodbye, mademoiselle. Indiana Jones... adieu! We must get the Ark away from this  place immediately! Holy smoke, my friends! I am so  pleased you are not dead. The Ark! They're taking it on a truck  to Cairo. Mister Jones! The Captain he say - You have most important friends. I sent my man for you. You and the  girl must disappear. We have a place  in the hold. Go, my friend! And be very careful! Not a trace yet, sir! Jones is dead. We killed him. He was of no use to  us. The girl, however, has certain  value where we are headed. She will  bring a very good price. If that  cargo you have taken was your goal,  then go in peace with it. But leave  us the girl. It will reduce our loss  on this trip. That girl goes with me. It will be  part of my compensation. I'm sure  the Fuhrer would approve. If she fails to please me, you can  do with her as you wish. Colonel Shliemann, all torpedoes are  loaded. I think not, Colonel. Nothing is to  be gained. We are not at war. The tents have been arranged in  accordance with your radioed  instructions, sir. Good. We must take the Ark there  now. Let me ask you this - Would you be  more comfortable opening the Ark in  Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding  out only then if the sacred pieces  of the Covenant are inside? Knowing,  only then, whether you have  accomplished your mission and obtained  the one, true Ark? Jones, your persistence surprises  even me. You are going to give  mercenaries a bad name. No! Not in the presence of the Ark!  Take him outside. Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am  even a little sorry you will miss  this moment. We must cover the drums! Protect  them from the bullets! And we trust you found the settlement  satisfactory? Good, good. Then I guess that about does it. When can we have the Ark? I thought we answered that. It's  someplace very safe - Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure  you. We have top men working on it  right now. Top men. We appreciate that. And we won't  hesitate to call on you.
