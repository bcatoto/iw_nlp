No. No! No. No. No. No. No. No.No one brought them here! No one wanted them here! Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations. No. You've had your chance. All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it. You be quiet, woman, and let me speak. Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me! Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something! Hopeless. It's hopeless. Will you shut up!?!! I swear, I don't know this girl. What? Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake! Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police. I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I... Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex. Pull over. I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time. I should be committed. I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! I guess I am out of my fucking mind. Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex? Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific! I'm freezing. See you later. A doper werewolf. Okay. Yeah, I do, but go to work. Werewolves simply do not exist. Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive. Do me an enormous favor? That's good, Alex. Reassure me. I wasn't hallucinating. I was awake and he was in my room. Good. Will you be here in about fifteen minutes? Alex? It's nice to see you. There is only one bed. Lovely. Charming. Very nice. Yeah, I would think so, too. I was dreaming again? Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think? My friend Jack was just here. I'll let you know the next full moon. I'm a werewolf. Now I'm embarrassed. Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it. Not just a patient -- me. Will you think about it? I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship. Will you come with me? I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them. No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while. I'm sorry I woke you up. Yes, go on. What? Oh, yes, please. My best friend. My very best friend. Now what do you want to talk about? I'm twenty-seven. How old are you? How old are you? It's okay. I want to talk to you. I dream of death mostly. Do you like it? I was. What are you reading? You're a very beautiful girl. Will you give me a break? This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food. Call me David. Aw come on, Alex! Aw come on, Miss Price! Leave the pills. I'll take them later. How is that? Please, really. I'm not hungry. I'm not very hungry, thank you. Yes? A wolf. It was a wolf. It wasn't a lunatic. That's what I want you to do, you moron! Who is this girl? Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss! Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit! Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me! Officer, I killed those people last night. Why are you doing this to me? That's easy for you to say - you're already dead. Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you. Why are you doing this to me, Jack? Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi? Do you have bad dreams, too? What are you going to see? Alex? What time is it? I was having a nightmare. Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself. You really think I'm crazy, don't you? Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that. Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb? Did you see Jack? Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands. I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog. Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre. Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about. How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about. There were witnesses? Lunatic? Two weeks? How long have I been here? Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here? The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London? London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream. Where am I? I could hang myself. How shall I do it? Hello. Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack. I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it. You look awful. Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'? What can I say, Jack? Hi, Jack. I will not accept this! Now go away! What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit! I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream. Jack, are you really dead? A monster. I know, I know. Get out of here, Jack! I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf. Okay, you've seen me. Now go away. What are you doing here? You're not real. Nurse! Oh God! Alex! Nurse! Nurse! You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue! Jack, please go away. Please go away. Stop it, Jack. What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit! What?! Will you be quiet?! What's wrong with you? Shut up! Shut up, you zombie! I'm not listening! If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead! Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf? What?! I'm going completely crazy. Rudy Levine the shmuck? I can't stand it. Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person. Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace? Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger! This is too much. I can't handle this. Get the fuck out of here, Jack. Are you going to help me up? Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!! Where are we going? Jack? It sounds far away. See anything? Walk away, Jack. A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away. It's in front of us. Let's just keep walking. What's the plan? It's moving. Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving. I don't know. Come on. Yeah. No, but he was on the moors. Heathcliffe. The Hound of the Baskervilles. A coyote. Could be a lot of things. I heard that. I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you. I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly. I have no idea. Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob. That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea. Come on, I'm freezing. I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road. Come on, Jack, shall we go?!! Jack, we'd better go. You ask them. Wrong. I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters. You ask them. Maybe the owners are from Texas. What about it? Listen, at least it's warm in here. Hello. Shall we? I assume full responsibility. A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol. Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol? Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol? We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that? It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull. If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you. I don't know. I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break. She's a jerk. I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body. Right. Well, I like it here. You're not having a good time are you? Jack. Yes.I doubt it. But it's something to do. Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog. Tea would be nice. I expect you shortly. Shall I send a car? You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help? Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand? Could you get here without any trouble? Is David acting strangely? Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television? The zoo? Is he rational? Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he? Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy. Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others. David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon? You've absolutely no idea where David might be? I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf. They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there. I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things. Warn him? What did he say? Has his friend appeared to him again? Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies? It's a full moon. Where is he? Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David. Come to my office, Miss Price. Did he say a wolf? The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price. That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed. What exactly did he call out? Oh, Miss Price? Go about your duties. Can I be of service, Miss Price? Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital. Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price. Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake. David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly. I really don't know. No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here. You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of. Yes. Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you? You've never had bad dreams before? In time I'm sure it will all come back to you. So they said. Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now. You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten. You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago. Miss Price! Miss Price, please! Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead. I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences. You're in a hospital in London. Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins. What can we do to assist you? Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him. Why don't we ask him? You were saying? Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard? Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea? Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls! What here? Excuse me. Yes? Send them in. Yes? I see. You've heard nothing about the incident? What's that? I suppose Guinness will suffice. Campari and soda would do nicely.If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death. Because this must be stopped. Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy. David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly. I want you to meet some people. What about the zoo? Thank you. If I was still alive, I probably would. You don't have to say anything. Hi, David. The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life! You must believe me. What do you think? You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late. David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become... Yes. David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on. I wanted to see you. Don't be an asshole, David. Come here. It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others. The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me. Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance. David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins. You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night. Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days. Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.' You survived and now you shall continue the curse. It's you, David. The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed. I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted. On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf. We were attacked by a werewolf. I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know. David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you. David! Life mocks me even in death. So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed. Debbie Klein cried a lot. Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came. I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come. David! You're hurting my feelings. I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me. Thanks a lot. Nice to see you. You really scared me, you shithead. I'll tell you when we get there. Yeah. Not far enough. Come on. No. Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away. Nice doggie. Good boy. Oh shit. What is that? Do you think it's a dog? Plan? It's circling us. Come on, where? Shit! David, what is that? I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb. It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'. Heathcliffe didn't howl. Pecos Bill. There aren't any coyotes in England. Yeah? What was it? Did you hear that? Say, David... Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural. What do you think was wrong? I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob. Beware the moon? What the hell was that all about? Apparently so. What do you mean? I'm starving. Go on, ask them. Right. Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man. Ask them what the candles are for. It's a five-pointed star. Look at that. Nice looking group. Nice to see you. Okay. David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault. That's not a spear. It's a pike. That's a wolf's head. The Slaughtered Lamb? She says she 'likes me too much'. It is impossible for a body like that to be dull. I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really. Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared... Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there? You're talking about the woman I love. Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time. Do you think she'll meet me in Rome? I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later. Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place? David. Good. Are you cold? Remember the Alamo? Oh. Then you have some hot tea? Hot chocolate? Do you have any hot soup?Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you. The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think... Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors? No, thank you, Doctor. Dr. Hirsch? I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that. That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day. And what, Sergeant? Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock. Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors? No, thank you.I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them. What do you mean, 'how did he look'? The American? Yes, duck.We'll find him, not to worry. I don't rightly know, sir. Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and... He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man. Sorry. I'd like some tea, please.
