We met, this morning. I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right. I'm going sailing. Are you finished? I could fight you on this. There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer. Now, look... Your father was a friend. Goddamn it... I watched you grow up. How do you end up treating me like this? You intractable son-of-a-bitch. If your father could see you now... Because it's fair. Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares... The stock will turn. Will you really hold me to it over pennies ? Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter. We're up eight cents per share. Projections were far too optimistic."Whereas once I was blind, now I can see." Night, Nick. Best of luck. You want to know what it is? What it's all about? John. Chapter nine. Verse twenty-five. Hm? No, about a year ago. I was working out of Los Angeles. Did you? Kudos.Yeah, yeah. She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane. Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that. Yeah. This... ? Oh, this is just... this is the bill. Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors. They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks. Pop-gun. I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ? Because you hate me. Because you had to be here, when mom died. Because you had to do it alone. Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too. I'd have been here... You're behind this, aren't you? You and your sick friends. Well, make it stop! No! You're one of them. Of course, it makes perfect sense! You're part of it... No. Do you? Can't be too hard, can it? I don't think we should be here out in the open like this. Really? Okay... okay. How do you know? It's them. They did this. You think I know? I paid them more to make it stop. Everything. I'm a goddamn human-pinata... It doesn't stop, Nick. I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again. They won't leave me alone... They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you. And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the real fucking begins. You dodged a bullet. C.R.S. Who do you think? Jesus H., thank your lucky charms. To think what I almost got you into. They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that. Shhhhhhh. Wait... wait... Just drive, man. It's fucking nuts! I know... Do it for YOU. It doesn't matter... I thought you'd like this. Best thing I ever did. If you don't want to do it, DON'T... Why would you say that? But, will you? Will you? Tell me you'll call. Call them. Trust me. It's a profound life experience. You've heard of it. You've seen other people having it. They're an entertainment service, but more than that. They make your life fun. Their only guarantee is you will not be bored. Trust me. Call that number. Call that number. For you. I don't need anything from you. I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday. So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order. No. Yeah. Nowhere in particular. Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore? Too bad, I liked her. So, you're all alone in the House of Pain? Elizabeth? How long's it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you? So do you. And to think I was worried... Not after I'm done with it. Actually, I've been here. In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'. They gave me a free jacket at the door. That's why it's a classic. Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ? Happy Birthday, man. Hey there, Nickie.How much is it? A few thousand, at least. A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it. And, they didn't take that watch? We'll help with the police, if you want to bother. As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion? You say you were mugged? Have you gone to the police? Robbed? It always is. No money, no identification or passport. You are in a fix. What did happen to you?Like, this way... sort of... It was a different floor then... I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone. You don't need me... What are you gonna do anyway? You won't get your money back. What whistle? There's no fucking whistle. This is fucking dangerous. No, I can't. I'm sorry and all, but... They own the whole building. They just move from floor to floor. Goddamnit, why do they do that? Nobody knows, pal. Nobody gets the big picture... Jason, Tommy, cut it out! Look, it was just a job. Nothing personal, ya know? I play my part, improvise a little. That's what I'm good at. Hey, everyone -- snack time! Here... here you go... That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist. It's never happened. We've never had an unsatisfied customer. One guarantee. Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction. It's all down to this... Sorry to keep you waiting. Cursory examination. Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing. You'll be out of here in no time. An hour for those... maybe another for the physical. First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing. Second, you don't have to decide today. Take the silly tests, fill out the forms. One day, the game begins. You either love it or hate it. Decide then. We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation. That was my sales pitch. May I make two suggestions... ? We provide whatever's lacking. It's different every time. Tailored specifically to each participant. Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you. Oh... it's a game. We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs... I don't write the questions. I just review them. You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T. For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like. We'll run a T.R.W.... Your brother was a client with our London branch. We do a sort of informal scoring. His numbers were outstanding. Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown... V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N... A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting... Oh, here we go... Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.Didn't I give you two? Hm? Show Mr. Van Orton to his room. Ah, Mr. Van Orton. Here you go...I'll be right with you. Clean out your locker. You don't talk to me like that. Christine! Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said. The police took him. They left this address, in case anyone... He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit... There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room. We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior. It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable... Your brother. Will you come with me? You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...No. This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland. I thought you two should meet. You could. But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel. Remember Daniel Grant? Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?" He's gone sailing, Alan. He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are. I'll be done in a minute. You misspoke before. You're not "stepping down." I'm taking you out at the knees. The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore. I'm firing you. Action's taken. Confidence restored. Stock goes up. I sell my shares. It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father. Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship? Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away? What? You're talking tomorrow. Today is what counts. It probably will. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time. Why should I settle for that? My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions. But, the expectation was ten. And, in this case, expectation is everything. Admittedly... You promised you'd meet projections, Alan. A dollar sixty per share you said. So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit. I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years... I've heard good things about their London branch. You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense. Did you play recently? I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street. Underwear? Boyfriend? Single? Studied acting, I assume? Big family... small? Like... where are you from? I realize. Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself. What about dinner sometime, when you get back? Would that be... ? Where are you going in such a hurry? Claire. Pleased to meet you. I didn't know what else to call you. Hi. Didn't get a chance to say goodbye. No! Don't move, you bitch... ! Stop it! No... That's not true... No! You take another step, I'll shoot! They're trying to kill me... Shut up! Stop talking... Stop talking to them! I saw them kill him! Bullshit. They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him... Fuck you. What are you doing? Guess you missed it. It's mine... What the fuck are you... ? ... what... ? They will! You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you! Call them, tell them to get the boss up here. Tell them I'll kill you... You call them... Who's responsible?! You tell me... I want to know who's behind this. Who did this to me... how, why... ? Get us out! Get us out of here... I'm back from the dead. What... what do you mean? What do you mean? I checked them myself. I made the calls... What do we do? Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me. Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million. You ruined people's lives. Scams, con games. How many? How many times have you done this? I'm interested. It might be best if we didn't talk. Who the fuck cares? I didn't say anything. Overseas operator? Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich. What are you talking about... ? How? How could they have gotten anything? That's a lie... Then, what good are you? Who are "they?" You can talk while I drive us to the police. Get out of my car! Get out. What is this!? No! I'm sick of this... Wha... ? Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me. Take the picture out. You? I'm tired. I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance. Do you mind if I sit? I thought... Well... the red bra. It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine. You're saying it's not you? Is this you? Come here... Can we talk? Seriously? What did they say? Keep it. Goodnight, Christy. It was nice meeting you. The maitre d' called you Christine. Goodnight. I know the owner of Campton Place. I could talk to him in the morning. I don't spend much time looking out the window. I'll call you a taxi. A fresh shirt... Hm? Oh, yes. Investment banking. Moving money from place to place. That tall, bright building. Near there. I think not. Why... ? Nicholas. Nicholas Van Orton. That one did. There goes a thousand dollars. You're the one who started running. You deserted me. Yes... well... Don't panic. When security gets here, we simply explain what happened... Consumer Recreation Services. It's their building. They... This is C.R.S. It's not like anyone could actually open it. There's a ladder here. Oh. FIne. Please... It's much easier this way. Come on, step up... This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there? I'll give you a boost. "... wait for help." Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to. Read what it says: "Warning, do not attempt to open. If elevator stops, use emergency... " Don't even think about it. Long story. I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin. It was a gift... from my brother. How do you know that's the way? Where are you going? I don't understand why they're getting you involved. I'm sorry, about this... The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away... It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks. Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself. I was trying to tell you... it's a game. You've got to be kidding. Hold on... They want your driver's license number. Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner. I get a note... This is nuts. Alright... okay... This can't be real... Oh, God... ! I don't think he's breathing. I don't know... he fell. Excuse me, I need to explain... I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this? I'm not sure how this works. Do you have something for me... ? I got this note... Pardon me... Miss... ? Terrific. I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill. Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water. A bad month. You did the exact same thing to me last week. Please, don't do that... Did she? Where's Christine? The waitress. Split it? Really? What? You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean... Stop it! Stop this. It's not true... Listen to yourself. Why would I do anything like what you're describing? No, it doesn't! Those keys were put there. I didn't even know... What? Connie... How did those... ? Do you know how to change a tire? The phone's dead. We're going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself. It's a flat tire. That's all. Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid? What have they been doing to you? Slow down, take a breath... How do you mean, exactly? Yeah, almost... Who? What are you doing? What's this all about, Connie? Tell me where we're going. Okay, okay... okay? I just... you know I hate surprises. I'm going to call. I'll call them, okay? Are you still on mediction? I said I would... Okay. Like a stroke? This isn't an escort service? Fun? Why? "Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs? You shouldn't have. Really? You need anything? Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright? I redecorated. What about you? Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito. Never better. About me? You look good. Which grad-school? They'll be wanting it back. "Seymour Butts." I never get tired of that one. Conrad, what a surprise. Gesundheit. Yes, very lucky. Yes. I don't speak Spanish. All I need is to get back... just enough for that. Yes. What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran. Two men, a few blocks away. They took my wallet, money... all of it. So... Well, where to begin. It's complicated... I'll call. I really will. You're going? Well, thanks again. Good to see you, Rachel... Thanks for coming, Mel. I'll get your car back. Right now it's, uh... at the zoo. Sorry. I'll explain someday. It's just a t.v. He's just an actor. It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends. If I could have you back in my life... in some small way. It would be important. The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time. I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me. I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it. For shutting you out, for not being there. I... Anyway, I hope you can forgive me. I know, look at me, well... What happened? I don't know. I don't even really know. I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while. I need your car, Elizabeth. Guess! Where'd you pick up your checks? Where? Shut up. Cuff him to the rail. I don't want money. I'm pulling back the curtain. I'm here to meet the wizard. Drive in. Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle. They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in. How do I find them? Their offices are empty. I'm tired of dealing with peons. I need to get to whoever's in charge. Get rid of them. You mean, dis satisfied. You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay? Don't worry. It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team". Physical? How long will these take? Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing? And if nothing's lacking? Humor me with specifics. What kind of vacation? A game? No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling? What's all this for? No, thank you. What is? I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother... First they try to kill me, now you? Put your damn clothes back on. Don't take another step. I can't tell you how not interested I am. You know, these fit... perfectly. I need the police. No, you didn't... Is there a room key? The key? Have we met? Goodnight. Where was she? Did you worry about him? I'm just like him. Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me. Was he morose, or...? I mean... He came to my mind recently, that's all. I'm not sure. There's been a break in. Lock this door and stay here. Don't move a muscle. Did the alarm go off? The house... they... you didn't see... ? Ilsa... you're alright? No, thank you. Goodnight. Fine. Okay. I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult. Thank you. Goodnight. Thank you. Look, where is he?! His behavior... ? Where's my brother? What's this about? Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you. What's the trouble? Cancel lunch. Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts. "Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts. What gentleman, Maria? What? I don't like her. I know who she is. Take a message. Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it. Let me think... Hordes of men in tuxedos. Everyone's droning. Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick... The Hinchberger wedding. No. The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser. No. Nice touch. Does the game use real bullets... ? Is Alan Baer "the Game?" Is that what this is? Why are you following me? You warm my heart. Attempted murder. He hasn't called back. Sam... Thank you. It's what they do. It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of... Depraved children. Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink? Just what I told you. Find out about a company called C.R.S. Consumer Recreation Services. Someone's playing hardball. It's complicated. Can I ask a favor? It was a misunderstanding. That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable. I am now your enemy. Follow me. Don't ask. I wasn't expecting you. Nothing. Nothing at all.Hey... ! Friend... why don't you back off. Look... what I'm doing is none of your business... I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just driving... What the fuck... ?!Bravo, young man. you have to tell me what this was all about sometime. I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the finest mental-health facility available. I mean that sincerely, don't thank me. Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment... What about the house? Very well. If you tell me not to worry, I shan't. You're joking. Nothing else? Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know? You know you can. How concerned should I be? Nicholas... What's happened... I checked it personally. Attractive... Wanted to wish you luck. Not that you'll need it. Anything wrong... ?
