Why not? Why not? What do you mean by that? You're a musician? Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you? We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled. Maid? Relative? Do you own a video camera? The angle. The high angle shot on the tape. Very strange. What's that, Ed? We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place. Ours, Ed. What a fuckin' job. Yeah... Laurent. Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to. Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently? You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone. If anything else happens, you'll call us. We'll keep a watch on the house. Anybody else have a key to the house. Right... This just glided along. And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead? He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead? Yes, I believe so. I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in? Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now? Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy. Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?No. We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night. Never saw him before in my life. Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do. They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything. The police called us. You don't look so good. Sit down. Sit down a minute. Do ya good. The night before you showed up in the slammer... You really don't remember the other night, do you? Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya. Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever". Then he's coming home with his mother and me. Have you made any charges against him? Same as always. Pete takes care of himself. His condition? What do you mean? The wife killer? You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here. You talk to him? Where's Pete? Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.You just gonna let him go? One of the guards must have leaked it. Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide. I've got men searching the building and the grounds now. He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway. He's in the infirmary, being examined. I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before. Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell. Yeah, Mack? Who is it? That's not Fred Madison? Now, Mack, what's the situation?I'll get a manual. and study it. No. I won't ever tailgate. I... I didn't say anything...There's no such thing as a bad coincidence. You know what I think? His or ours? You recognize that guy? Yeah. Or not so recently? Or something. As best we can. Might be a good time to try using it again. Like you'd get if it was hand held. How'd the camera get so high like that? Did you use the alarm system since we were here last? Tone deaf. What's your axe? There's no other bedroom? Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid. It kept going off for some reason. False alarms. How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened. I like to remember things my own way. Yes, I thought my wife... This is our bedroom. I don't. I don't know him. But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he? Dick Laurent? Andy, who is that guy? The first night... Not the last two. Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you... No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed. That's it. But my head... Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin. The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin. No, no. I want to go in. My... My head. Where's Alice? That's absurd. What do you mean? You're where right now? No, no I don't. Are you sure? I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met? No... of course not. I thought there might be somebody inside. I told you to stay in the car! He's got some fucked up friends. What job? Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place. Let's go home. Just a minute. I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on. Where would you feel safe? No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember. What? I wish I knew. Thanks, guys. So? All right. Don't you want to watch it? What's that? Another tape? Who the hell owns that dog? You're up early. You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you. I had a dream about you last night... You were asleep when I got home, yes. From the club. You didn't answer. I called, you know. When you didn't come to the club. Same one you were reading the other night? Good book, huh? Maybe. Does it say anything on the tape? Who's it from? What's that? That's why I married you. It's nice to know I can still make you laugh. What are you going to do?The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning. What is it? I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor. What's bothering you, Madison? Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in? Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it. Something wrong?Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here. I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson? No, sir, it's not. I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.The heart, I guess. Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely. Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad. How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.FUCKIN' "A". SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR. CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.? WHAT DID YOU SAY? That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine. You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right? I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete. You're doin, okay? That's good, Pete. Yeah... How ya doin', Pete? You know who it is. Hey, Pete... How ya doin'? I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes. Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this... ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?... I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?... How ya doin', Pete? You're my man, Pete. If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today. I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today? You will. Suit yourself, champ. Yeah.

Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate. Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride. All right! It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go. I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right. I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?Alice who? At your house. Of course. In fact, I'm there right now. At your house. Don't you remember? We've met before, haven't we?I'm, okay... You okay? Yeah. What?

Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight? What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy? Why are ya goin' so early? Okay. Okay... Yeah. Call him. Andy? You liked it. In pornos? How'd it happen, Alice? How'd you get in with these fuckin' people? Pornos. What's he do? What deal? You like it? Have you partied with him? We should stop seeing each other. So what do we do? Are you positive he knows?

What else about that night?... Did anything happen? Sure. Sure I do. Whatiya mean? I don't remember... What happened that night? What night? I don't know. Sorry... I... Sure. Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin". Yeah?...Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you. We just killed a couple of people... At your house. Don't you remember?All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later. For now, he's free to leave. No. His physical condition. Yes. A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison. We'll get a tail put on him. What's the word on the street? How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts? If he's not Madison, then where's Madison? Did you ask him who he is? Where is he now? Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be? Repeat that, Bill. Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this? Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can. Mel, let's get Peter in here. What about yesterday? You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday? A headache? He's not Madison? Who is this man? What is this, Rogoff?
