I'll take half of your action. What's the line? Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him. Apartment 306. Come on. Just get in. We gotta go. Where's the stereo? Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things. No shit! He's good! Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one. This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you. I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job. Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist. Dinner's on you. Floor seats. Maybe we can get a throw phone in there. Not that we know of. I don't know. No -- you can't do that. SWAT wants to go in. Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us. This cousin of yours... What's his name? Could I please have a little water? I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci? Where did you find an old recording like that? Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it. May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions. It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.I won't get away with it. Don't make do it, Mike. Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job. I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town. What happened, Mike. I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off. So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.I hate fucking Springfield. Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch. Tell my dad. Huh? It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis. Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me. They want Walter dead! Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that? You can't help me, man.Automatic. What?! Am I gettin' the car? Really? Then where's my FUCKING car! Where's the car?Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second. You signed out twice. Hold on a second here. Johnny who? Who are you again?Roper, we're into it... Roper... Being faxed over now. We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out. Solis said to keep you clear of this. Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out. Earl. That's right. That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't... The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for... Hi, Roper.Clarence Teal. Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation. Of course. You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street? Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson. Memories... Memory Lane or something... Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945. What happened? Is there a problem? Who is it? Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery. Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail? Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!... You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you. Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!... They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want. God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now. You don't want to know. Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door! You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement. You told Antonucci that shit came from me. Wait a minute, lemme see that. I what? Is there a problem? Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright? That's not going to look too good on your service record. I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them? Spread it out. Open the bag, dump everything on the table. Shut the fuck up and do what I say! Open your shirt. You can't kill me like this. I'll give you something. No. You just do shit for me right now. For now that's all. I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there. I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again. Are you in charge, Roper? Alright, Roper. You want to come... come. You don't have to come here.Is that where you're family lives? I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now. Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him? They have less power over you if you look into my eyes. How can I help you with the particles? Tell me what's wrong. This has nothing to do with Walter. Who's controlling your mind? I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave. I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building... Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything. How are we going to get me in there? Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence. So what do you want to do? And what if you can't live with it? And what about the ones you don't save? How many have you lost? I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy. It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope. Bullshit! Would it have happened to you? You're crazy. What the fuck is going on. He's got the girl. And doing a very good job of it. There's your answer. He's smart. Police corruption. It's everywhere. Is it always like this? How long you been coming here? You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick. We won. We won! COME ON, RUSSELL! COME ON RUSSELL!... Who the fuck's Russell?! They need to run first and second? The 6 horse is still last. To run last? The 6 horse is last. You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you. I'm just practicing my lying. I don't know why she'd pick him over you. Now she's going out with Greg Barnett? Fine. I do. I have two words for you... Seek help. You're a compulsive gambler? Why did he do it? A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine. My name's McCall. I'm unarmed. To save lives. Yes. You tell me. Thou shall have no other God before me. Yes. It's against my nature. I'm not good at lying. What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off? So what do I say to this guy? I can't do that. Tell me what you need. No. I think so. I think I can handle that one. Around. Barnett's tough competition. Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett. Do you really? We see each other every couple of months. No, no, no... She's from Hoboken. She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married. She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school. Yeah, I've got a girlfriend. I don't gamble. Why? You like my ass? Well, if I have to, I have to. I don't really like to drink. Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide. We could fill it with water. Is there something wrong with that? You caught me on an "up" day. How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco? It was okay. Been to Toronto. My mother was born there. Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while. Furthest point I could find from New York. National Marksman Competition. They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement. I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be. What's the point of this? I know. I've rarely shot anyone. Like it had to be done. Only at the very end. If you say so. Sorry... Habit. I'm ready to do it. And I'm going to be here more than two weeks. Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out. Only that floor. Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa? And why the fuck would you do that for me? Doing what? Cleaning toilets? What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed. She's the one to blame. Not me. I ain't interested in your life story. You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her. You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.It was Warriors plus 6 this morning. Good. I don't want to be late. You want me to go up with you? Fuck the stereo. What's that smell? Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out. It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett. You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization. Yeah, okay. "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar. Deal. You're my hero. We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone. He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence. You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there. What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week? They're not usually graduate students. Hello, guys. You got it. Manual or automatic? You want a convertible or hardtop? You're gettin' the car. The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie. Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals. It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you. I need to get something straight first. And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents. How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits. Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration? What do you got on Korda? Anything on Korda so far? I have to go face to face. We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor? What's the suspect's name? ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes... ...a car. Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post? I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it. Yeah. It's all there. Satisfied? I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me. What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off? Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage. You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay. Is that all? Yep. Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible. Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business. Stay put. McCall, you all right? Good question. That's a chance I gotta take. He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her. You've got to decide that for yourself. You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave. I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it. That it is. Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them. It might have happened no matter who was up there. Pull up alongside. I don't know, but I've got to get on there. Damnit! He's cutting down the visibility. See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty. Occasionally you lose. About six years. My partner took me. How much you wanna bet? We lost. The jockey! Yeah, first and second. He'll be running at the quarter pole. To run late! That's okay. That's his style. Still needs work. So what do you want?... An autograph. Ronnie... Yeah, so. We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second. I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks. I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta. See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out. What do you think? You know why I like the track? Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire. Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side... What did you see? Okay, stop. So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives? Why? Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right? What's the first commandment? You know the ten commandments? Get good at it. If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie. You could say something like, "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out." Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it. Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit. I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts. It'll come. Try again. First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you." Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that? You think you can learn, McCall? Yeah, you think so, but it comes up. Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage. Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage. Where did you hear that? No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it. That's a lot of commitment. I admire that. Every couple of months, huh? Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey? She grow up in Livingtston, too? Explain how that works. You living together? You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you? You got a girlfriend? You have to. It's a tradition. Come on. Let's go for a drink. Not the ones I'm at. How are we gonna get him out of there? I'm not sure. I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was. So you're looking for "fast advancement". You're a real excitable sort, aren't you? How did you like Toronto? You'd never been out of New York? You don't like New York? With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here? Recruited you from where? So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco? I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that. A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow. Try to remember that. SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know. It rarely has to be done. How do you feel after a shooting. You ever been in a hostage situation? We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin? Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende? You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator. Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that. Is the hostage injured? Have you evacuated anyone? Which apartment? Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version. My name's Scott Roper. Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count. I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work. Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job. Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything. Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her. Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why? Let me show you something, Ray. I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay. I know how you feel, Ray. First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way. The hell I am! You crazy? With all those people around? You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?' Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word. I'm talking about... What are you talking about? I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'. Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality. A deeper level? Yeah. Hmm? Hmm? Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit. Do it! Stay here, don't move. It's all over, babe, it's all over. Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie. Use your imagination. Korda escaped. How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy. ...Let me just show you. For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff... I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about. You like this place? He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend. When? What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him? Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again. It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world. Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up. What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here. Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar. What do you think? I've been craving that stuff all week. That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much? I was going to catch the last half on TV. As a matter of fact, I do. I wanted to get this out of the way. Ronnie... You think I didn't need you? Something I guess I can't have anymore. Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work. I've proved that, didn't I? It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him. I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone. That a new picture? Can I come in? You heard. I'm not drunk. Yet. Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy. Please. I'm begging you. This Greg is really getting in my way. Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease. Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters. Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair. Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name. I worship you. This baseball player you're going out with... He's no good for you. SHIT! Where's the damn wire?! Stay up there, Girl... I'm en route. E.T.A. in five. Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl... Come on! Are these yours? What have you promised them? Any verification on numbers. What do we got? Who's running it! Who's running it? I want to be put on this case. He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said... I want to be put on this case. And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background... Repoed this morning. The car is part of the deal. You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound. And a car. Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars. The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress... Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation? Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks. Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside? Your concern is heartwarming. Define concern. Depends. What's up? What? Tell him to give me a raise.Yeah, they are but... Just that I'd talk to my superiors. We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for. 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside. Kimura and Glass will head the investigation. Roper... You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it. I can't do that. The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man. I'll provide you with transportation. What happened to your Trans Am? Impound isn't a rent-a-car company. Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own. Okay, I think I could swing that. What do you think would be in order? What kind of appreciation are we talking about? You let us worry about that. His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed. It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you. What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it? There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up. Are you going to make this hard for me? Roper. He says, "Thank you very much." I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second. Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head... It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack... ...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
