We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark. No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move. 37 usages of Himbry located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless. Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off... We're aware of that. We know that, son. On national television. Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person. They've broken their pattern. Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name... We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims. Take the neighborhood. Have you checked the...Yeah. She dumped me. Not one bit. Definitely Whitney. I think he's doing Dolly. Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying? I WAS A SORORITY SLUT. My documentary is due on Tuesday. How do you put up with this Greek shit? Yeah, we�re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I�m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It�s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth. Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel? Good question. You took the bait. That�s quick. Go on, untie him. Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise. I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me. I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay? It's under control. Let us decide that. I think it's out of your control. Lemme take you home. About what? I'm sorry honey. I got behind. Sid, you don't have to. I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'? How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard... We had to have financing. Oh yeah. We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It�s been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails? Just for you, Sid. Or it found us. And we didn�t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money�s worth. Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing�s been done. Hope you�re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you. We�re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned. The way I see it. We�ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II. Until now. You�d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It�s a whole world, Sid. You�re really popular amongst the demented. I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line... I find his work overwrought. I really don�t like that comparison, honey. Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life? Need some help, honey. Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless? What guy? You weren't supposed to leave her alone. Where's Sid? And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit. Two.That doesn't work, sir. What now? Can't we hold him? How's the name search going? I can do it, Captain. The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction. There's nothing. I'm coming down. No, wait here. He filmed his victims. C'mon. Let's go. Over here. Let's find out. Hallie? The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision. They're roomates. We'd break some furniture. Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am... And it's sexier in the dark. That's not the way it's done. A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that? You broke my heart. Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked. Meaning? Not good. I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled. I know that. I think you're all an act. You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate. So what made you change your mind about Sidney? No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do. How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation? Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience." No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be. Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself. Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock. Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears. I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me. Miss Weathers. Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay. Humor me, Sid. The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe. Just in case... Don't worry... Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you. As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy. They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie. They thought it was a publicity stunt.It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties. And white. No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek. Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro. Is that cool? Just to leave her like that? How many guys they have on you? Sid, I'll seeya tonight. Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite. I'll stop by the Deltas tonight. I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid? Have they questioned you yet, Sid?Don't forget to set the alarm. No, it's me. I'm inquisitive. Why would you wanna do that? What if I said you? That's too bad. Why aren't you there? Where is everybody? That's okay. Someone who wants to talk to you. Who is this? Watch your back. No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon. You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over. It's what you want from me. Stay away from the cop. I'm everywhere. You're pretty when you're angry. What if your life depended on it? That's not the way we play the game. I'll give you one guess. Do you want to die? Closer than you think. What's your favorite scary movie? But she's standing right next to you. Gale?You freakin? No way. Where's Sid? Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life? "And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY." I could use some therapy. What's your subject? Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie... But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it. "And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you." "If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way... I got a surprise for you. Is Sid in therapy? Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight. I have to watch rehearsal. Lucas and his Romper Room stage. Easy black boy. Her old boyfriend? I've been waiting for you, baby. I counted four. What was that? Where you going? What are you talking about? Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night...harmonica style is okay. ..we only promote safe rubbered sex. We've set you each at a five dollar quota. ..this week's TKE kegger...The young girl is slashed again. The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again. The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless... The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running... A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.We can still Sandra Bullock it. You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay. Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya? I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy. Shush. Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone. But... We got free tickets. It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add. SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close? What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up? She's not here right now. Hello? Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling. I gotta coupla of those buttons myself. I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home? If he's innocent he'll have an alibi. Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing. I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.I would say we are now officially baffled. You're sure about this two person thing? He's broken his pattern. Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action. The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision. Attic, garage, basement, nothing.Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way. Where is your attacker? Are you in danger now?
