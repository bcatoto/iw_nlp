You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers ! Yes, sir ! Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers. We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot... Jeez, we musta killed a million already...! No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material. Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster. Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires... I didn't see him ! Mobile Infantery rules ! No, this hurts. I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together. You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around. Whad'ya talkin about ? Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out. Our love will grow, dear, year by year... Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead. You rich kids... are all the same ! What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ? Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me ! You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get... I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ? Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain. You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths. Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P. Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability... Please continue, Sergeant. I got Games & Theory. Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention. If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance. Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ? Your father will never let you. Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ? I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it. Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know. Don't think about it... go on instinct. You got it bad. Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss. Others are waiting. You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.Looks like rain. Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son. Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can. ...CUT OFF ! Teenagers ! A year at Harvard and you'll see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives. Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean. Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ? I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation ! You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer... Sorry. Carl's a fine boy... A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ? Oh, is that how it is ? Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it. Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station ! Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life. This came for you today. I presume on your request.AAAAAAAAAAA ! I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder. Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir. Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders ! Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job. Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment. At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...Saddle up, Roughnecks ! Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way... Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet... We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know. We're the old men, Ace. Not enough, I guess. What about it, Diz ? He was our teacher... He was great. Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...? Death to all bugs ! YAAAAAAAA ! What do I want with a scar ? I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool. It's what I deserve. Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys ! Well, maybe you better look again. Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job. It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...! Something... I've got...you don't. What an honor... Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir. Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir. Sir... I guess I do, sir. Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir. Sir, no, sir. Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir. You always told me you couldn't do human... I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better. The Roughnecks are always ready, sir. Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for. Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ? Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death. I don't believe it ! All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not. Eight point... no, uh, seven... I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know. I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe. Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ? How do you make him do that ? In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts. Ace of spades. Yeah, but I want Carmen. Did you read her mind ? What's the hurry ? Up. We gotta be near A Company by now. We've gotta go get her ! See you on the bounce ! How are you, Carl ? I like it. It's kinda...you. What happened to your eye ? That was just a mix up. We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit. I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch. Should I be ? I try just to be happy I'm still alive. It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ? What happened to your hair ? Shhhh...! Do you mean it ? Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size. I love you. I'm gonna miss you. He left this morning. He couldn't say where. Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ? You're late. I'll go for that. Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo ! Did you get Starside R&D ? He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't... Naw, I made it, Carl made it. I love you, Carmen. Who cares ? I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service. I don't even know if you're my girl. I can't help it. You two have so much in common. What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot. Yeah, sure, I guess. None at all... We won. Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak. Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet. It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't... Isn't it great to be in love ? Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ? What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager ! Carl can wait. Why not ? It's all I think about anymore. Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ? Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math. 35% on the math final ! No one could be that dumb with numbers. Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal... Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug. I have good reflexes. Who ? Good for you. No, you're gonna be alright, Diz ! All bands. Diz, see what you can do. They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy. Hey, Diz... I said no. Want me to pull rank ? Nah, I don't do that anymore... I'm gonna need a squad leader. What's that, Diz ? Well, see ya. Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it. I don't stay where I'm not wanted. Cover me. What ? Man, they're defended... no way in. You saying you didn't ? You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along. No thanks, Diz. You're the best. Uh, look, Diz... Can't we just be friends, Diz ? Well, anyone who gets you is lucky. You still gonna play for Brazil ? Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen... Just throw me the ball, Diz. What ? A lot can happen in three minutes. It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home. I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it. I won't quit ! Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school ! Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there. I'm eighteen. It's my decision. No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really. Mr. Rasczak. It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years. A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service... Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared. He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile. I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach. I wouldn't mind. Seeing as how we're about all that's left of 1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement. You top kick ? Sir, yes it is, sir. Sir, yes, sir ! Sir, thank you, sir ! I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir. Courage, I guess. No, sir. Here in Buenos Aires. I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid... Hi, mom. Well, yeah, sure... Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now ! I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am ! Uh, no. Aw, don't get mushy. Don't be a hero... Alright, we're gonna carry you... How bad are you, pal ? Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole ! Can you walk ? Move out. Yeah, that's right. I'm gonna save Carmen. We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy. What's your problem now, Lieutenant ? Saddle up, boys, that's our trash ! You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down - You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant ! This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission. Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers. You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ? I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ? Don't get any ideas. She's my girl. Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy ! Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission ! SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now ! Give'em hell, sir ! We're not leaving you here, sir ! Hit your jets, sir ! Cover us, Ace ! Yes, sir ! What's going on, Diz ? Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir ! Yes, sir... Yes, sir. All dead except one, sir. Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team. Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ? I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen. I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year. Mister Rasczak ? Uh, I don't know. The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because... Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ? Are your parents currently citizens ? No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ? Keep trying, Sergeant. They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ? Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower ! We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ? My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap- Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed... I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P. This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant. Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time... I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat... AAAAAAAAAAAA ! Sergeant, secure the boat ! Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ? What's that look like to you, Rico ? Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval. Who's that with you ? Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics. Never pass up a good thing, eh ? Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ? Kill the bitch. I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better. Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ? Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico. Good for you. Go find out. Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something. What is it, Rico ? Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass. The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy ! What is your position ? This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !Just giving you something to remember me by, baby. It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you... I do. How do you feel about him now ? That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ? Where are you going ? You're upset, that's alright. I'm sorry, Carmen. Carmen...? Hey, bugs don't take prisoners. I'm not kidding. Marriage is - Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it. So ? If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ? I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen. Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here. Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude. Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ? THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG ! Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle. She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together. Well, whad'ya know... You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said... Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ? Profile's wrong... there. Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with. They revoke our flight status. Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed. This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet. Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other... Only when I give you an order. I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate. Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ? I'm all ears. I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow. So what are you doing later ? I'm getting better. That's it, we're empty ma'am ! Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed... Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one... This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here... Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke. Been better, buddy. Not a problem. Let's go. That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico. What do you think you're doing ? Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here- The Rodger Young just burned up... Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...! I'll take the first group. This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ? On whose authority, Corporal ? You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ? Best in the Fleet ! You can never be sure.Doesn't look like it to me. Is that your signature, Rico ? The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ? Don't stand there dumb... GO ! Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
