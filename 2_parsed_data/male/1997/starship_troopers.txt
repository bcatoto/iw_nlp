I'm doing my part... Me, too... Are you ? Join the mobile infantery and save the world ! Service guarantees citizen-ship. Would you like to know more ? The Bugs send another meteor our way ! But this time we are ready ! Planetary defenses are better than ever ! Would you like to know more ? Klendathu, source of the bug meteor attacks, orbits a twin star system whose brutal gravitational  forces produce an unlimited supply of meteorites... To ensure the safety of our solar system, Klendathu must be eliminated ! Would you like to know more ? We break net now and take you live to Klendathu Com'on, let's go !ON THE BOUNCE FOLLOW THEM...! GO ! GO ! THIS WAY ! KITTEN ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Oh, God... Oh, God, help me... please help me... Sorry, Mr. Rasczak. Gee, we always thought you were the supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak. My mother always says that violence never solves anything. The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not. Uh, I don't know. Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla ? How should I know ? You're captain of the team ! Good for you. You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie. What's the hurry ? Others are waiting. Did you read her mind ? Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss. Yeah, but I want Carmen. You got it bad. Don't forget about this afternoon. He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss. Who ? I have good reflexes. Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug. Better put your goggles on. Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal... 35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers. Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math. Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ? Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? It's all I think about anymore. Why not ? Carl can wait. What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager ! Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ? Don't think about it... go on instinct. Ace of spades. Statistically speaking you should've accidentally In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves  I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts. Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why  some people are sensitive and some aren't. Federal studies like this might provide a clue. I wouldn't want to know what everyone was thinking. Four of spades. Cyrano, you big yellow turd ! He just wants attention. You don't play with  him like you used to. Go bug Mom, Cyrano. How do you make him do that ? I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it. Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that to me. Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet. C'mon let's go. Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ? Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ? I've been thinking about applying for  Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe. Your father will never let you. I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd  make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know. Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ? Eight point... no, uh, seven... If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance. All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen,  and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not. Love... how excruciatingly pathetic.  Now try and pay attention. Queen of hearts. Well, what do you know about that ! Tesla's tough. They tumble good and they hit HARD. We tumble good, too. Kick three, fade left. On two. Time's running out. A lot can happen in three minutes. Hut... hut ! I'm getting better. So what are you doing later ? I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow. I'm all ears. Don't get any ideas. She's my girl. You can never be sure. WATCH THE BLITZ...! Flip six, three hole. Rico ? Hey ! What ? You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ? Just throw me the ball, Diz. Hut ! Aw, don't get mushy. This came for you today. I presume on your request. A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service... Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life. It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years. Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean. Mr. Rasczak. Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a  recruiting station ! No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really. Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it. I'm eighteen. It's my decision. Uh, no. A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ? Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there. A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training  for inferior people so they can call  themselves "citizens" and take airs for  the rest of their lives. Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest  kid at school ! Sorry. Carl's a fine boy... I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am ! Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now ! Teenagers ! Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so let's turn down the lights and make it a slow one. Hey, Rico, wanna dance ? Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen... Too bad for her if she's not around. You know, it's sad... Most of us probably won't see each other again after tonight. You still gonna play for Brazil ? Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start. Well, anyone who gets you is lucky. How come we never got together ? Can't we just be friends, Diz ? Sure. Uh, look, Diz... Guess you gotta go. You're the best. Isn't it great to be in love ? It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't... Outa the way you two ! Aw, you're in love with me...  You just dont know it yet. Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak. Mister Rasczak ? I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year. I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen. Well, my parents are against it, and I  know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ? Yeah, we know each other from the game.  No hard feeling, eh, chum ? None at all... We won. Always. Yeah, sure, I guess. What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot. You two have so much in common. I can't help it. I don't even know if you're my girl. I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service. Who cares ? Hey, you, there's a place for that ! I love you, Carmen. Carmen, it's late. Get inside. I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ? Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from now on, Mr. Ibanez. Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you and your rich family. The Federation'll give her everything she needs. Fresh meat for the grinder, eh ? That's us. Where do we sign ? Here and here and here. Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service. Follow the blue line. There is no guarantee of service. We don't need all of you. It costs a great deal to train human beings for useful tasks. Many jobs are hazardous to your health. If you are chosen and do not wish to serve you may resign at anytime simply by completing  form 1240/A. Thank you for exercising you constitutonal rights. They took my sister, they'll take anybody. Oh, this is the part that hurts ! No talking please. I'm going to ask you some  questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ? Here in Buenos Aires. Are your parents currently citizens ? No, sir. Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ? Courage, I guess. Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because... I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir. I'm happy to tell you that you've been accepted for Federal Service. Wow, that's great. Looks like you're quite an athlete. Boy, look at those reaction stats. My job is to dertermine what you're best suited for. I want to be a pilot, sir. Sorry, son, no way. Your school records say you don't have the math skills. That rules out the scientific and engineering applications, and I'm afraid we reserve non-military options for candidates who are frankly less able-bodied than you are, son... It looks like the only thing you're good for is cannon fodder. I'm putting you down for the Mobile Infantery. ...of my own free will, without promise, coercion, or inducement, after having been duly advised and warned of the meaning and consequence of this oath, do now enroll in the Federal Service of the Terran Federation for not less than two years and as much longer as may be required  by the needs of the Service... Naw, I made it, Carl made it. He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't... They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted, but at the end of the day I go home. How'd you kids do ? Good for you. We need every pilot we can get. Did you get Starside R&D ? No. I don't believe it ! I got Games & Theory. Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo ! Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute you. What about you, son ? Infantery, sir. Well, good for you. The Mobile Infantery made me the man I am today. I'll go for that. Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away from each other, and chances are we'll never see each other again, but sure... My father's probably gonna kill me. You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer... I won't quit ! I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation ! I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision.  I made it. You walk out that door, you're cut off, young man... You understand me ? Alright, THAT'S IT, YOU'RE... ...CUT OFF ! Well, yeah, sure... Don't talk about my girl that way. You're late. Me, too. I'm wearing everything I own. Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ? He left this morning. He couldn't say where. I'm gonna miss you. I love you. Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size. Do you mean it ? From all over the known Galaxy, prospectice citizens work together to make a better tomorrow ! Would you like to know more ? A murderer was captured and tried today. Sentence:DEATH. Tonight at six, all net, all channels. Would you like to know more ? If you think you are psychic, maybe you are. Harness your unique abilities and take advantage of the many Federal benefits available for psychic citizens. Would you like to know more ? Disregarding Federal warnings, Mormon  extremists established Port Joe Smith, a settlement of 300 on Tango Urilla, a system just inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Too late they realized tha Tango Urilla had already been chosen by other colonists -- Arachnids ! The council asks future colonists to obey all  official Federal warnings. Would you like to know more ? The problem with you is that none of you are good enough the way you are. I am your senior drill instructor, Career Sergeant Zim. Do you think I'm funny ? Do I make you laugh ? Do you think I'm a comedian ? The first and last words out of your stinking holes will be "sir". Do you get me ? See the armory ? Run around it ! RUN, I SAID. Bronski, keep pace ! You are now all brothers and sisters in the same family, my family, the Mobile Infantery. I will be your mother. I will be your father. If you do not  please me I will throw you out of my family because I hate all slackers and  negative hackers. Do you get me ? Sir, yes, sir ! Anytime you think I'm being to tough, anytime you think I'm being unfair... QUIT ! Grab your gear and take a stroll down "Washout Lane".  Get me ? Sir, yes, sir ! I wonder if there's a handful of guts in the whole bunch. Who thinks they've got what it takes to knock me down ? You alright, Breckinridge ? MEDIC ! Clean break... Doc'll have him back on active duty by tomorrow. Good. Who's next ? He's good alright. He'll have to get past me. MEDIC ! Some of you may not �make it. WHY IS THAT WEAPON ON THE GROUND ? You might think I am unfair. Is that all you got ? You hit like kitten, Smith ! This is a punch. You will not like me. But if you survive you will thank me because you will be born again hard. You will be a new person. You will be a Cap Trooper. And then, MAYBE, you'll  be good enough... ...to serve in my family. Sir, I don't understands who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway... All you gotta do is push a button, sir ! Put your hand on the post, private. AWK ! The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand. MEDIC ! Sir, recruit Flores, reporting for duty , sir. I see you specifically requested transfer from Fort Cronkite to this training group... Sir, I heard it was the best, sir ! It is the best... BUT WHAT MAKES YOU I'd like to disable Zim...! Aw, you either got what it takes or you don't. At ease, soldier. It's all the same muck. Better get in line like everyone else, Ace. You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies. What an honor... Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me ! Hey, amigo, come chow with me. No thanks, Diz. What's your malfunction, Rico ? You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along. What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ? You saying you didn't ? What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ? Something... I've got...you don't. You rich kids... are all the same ! It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...! Coming through ! C'mon, move it, you apes ! I'm going career... officer's training. That's why I wanna be squad leader. They look for that. Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job. Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead. Well, maybe you better look again. Aw, who asked you to be so nosey ? Well, some say he turned his back on the family fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for a girl... missed a spot there, bucko... which is  funny because Johnny says I joined up to be with him, but why would I do that ? He doesn't even like me. I know it's not much, but it's home. Over there's my bunk where I dream about you every night... Hey, do you mind ? I bet it's that girl I was talking about... Her name's Carmen, I think. Carmen ! Ooh la la, Carmencita ! Hey, where you going ? Come back...! He's getting awy... Grab him...! Boot's pretty tough, and sometimes I think I won't make it, but then I imagine you're watching me, and that gives me someting... I try harder. Thanks to you, I think I might have  a shot at squad leader. Uh-oh, I gotta pack it in. I hope you're having fun, hope you're careful. No training accidents for you, eh ? I want to kiss you so badly. I want to feel you next to me, I- I love you truly, so truly, dear...! Our love will grow, dear, year by year... Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys ! Orbit in five, Ibanez ! First one there gets to fly ! Oh no, not Ibanez again, she's crazy ! Geez, I thought I liked to fly fast ! I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to  fly this crate. Only when I give you an order. Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other... This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet. Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed. They revoke our flight status. Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one... The object of this exercise is to capture your enemy's flag before your enemy captures yours. These weapons have been modified for this exercise. If your enemy hits you, your suit will fail. You will be unable to move. You will be as good as dead. Man, they're defended... no way in. Flip six, three hole. What ? High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score... Cover me. You got it. Thanks, pal. Kid's got some moves... Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader ! Sir, thank you, sir ! Don't stand there dumb... GO ! YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa...! Zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose, I guess. I just want you guys to know that I'll never do anything that I haven't asked you to do first. Couldn't've done it without you, Diz. Friends ? Yeah, sure... friends. Levy... Shujumi... Rico. Bet it's from my girl. Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that ! Shhhh...! All it takes is the love of a good woman... Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out. It's what I deserve. Whad'ya talkin  about ? I joined up for her. I wouldn't even  be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool. You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick  around. Thanks, Ace. With the Marauder's visual capabilities, all you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME CARE on my firing line. Do you get me ? The live firing combat range is the  closest simulation of actual combat we can provide. If you do not hit  your target, it will shoot you... The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team  score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ? Sir, yes, sir ! Perfect score for this exercise is 300. B company came through last week with 285. I expect you to do better. CROSSFIRE ! EVERYBODY DOWN ! Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes point. Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover the flanks. Djana'd, you're rear guard. Move out. What's the problem ? Let me see. Oh, God... uh... MEDIC ! Rico, you are relieved of squad command. Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico to the C.O.'s Office. Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir. Sir, no, sir. Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir. Sir, no, sir ! Sir... I guess I do, sir. Alright, let's go, Rico. Bite on this. It helps. I know. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with. Profile's wrong... there. Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ? You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said... Well, whad'ya know... She got a command... and she thinks we  oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together. I have a feeling about us. We're good together, way ahead of the curve in  every department. I seem to be able to anticipate your needs.  You know what I want... Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle. Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed... THERE !GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG ! Sweet Jesus...! Trajectory indicates it came out of  the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Hull's compromised.  We're lucky to be alive, ma'am. It stinks, you goin. I don't stay where I'm not wanted. If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo. Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I  guess that proves I just can't cut it. Your call's going through, Rico. Take it there. Hi, mom. Johnny ! Where's your uniform...? Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ? It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it  would be alright if I came home. I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid... Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can. Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son. Looks like rain. Your transmission has been terminated due to atmospheric interference. Please try your call again later. Well, see ya. You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny. What's that, Diz ? That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen ! Hey, Kitten, what's going on ? ... early estimates. Millions dead, a city in  ruins... Oh, jeez, is that Geneva ? ... Buenos Aires has been wiped of the Earth. Nothing lives in what was once called the Latin Paradise... Aw, Johnny, geez... It's home. The Federal Court met moments ago and voted unanimously for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat. The meteor derived from here, near Klendathu, in the Arachnid's home system... I'm serious, sir. I'll go anywhere. I want combat. Yes, sir, I get you. Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir. Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't  learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir. Is that your signature, Rico ? Sir, yes it is, sir. Doesn't look like it to me. Get outa here, private. Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow, then ANGER ! The only good bug is a dead bug ! Would you like to know more ? Cap Troopers establish a foothold on Dantana, a planet system at the outer edge of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Casualties are high, but casualties won't stop the Mobile Infantery ! Would you like to know more ? Everyone's doing their share. Are you ? The war effort needs your effort at work, at home, in your community. Would you like to know more ? We are a generation commanded by fate to defend humankind ! We must meet the threat with our valor, our blood, with our very lives, to insure that human civilization, not insect, dominates this galaxy now and always. Sky Marshall Dienes announces plans for an offensive against Klendathu, source of the  bug meteor that destroyed Buenos Aires. We now break net and take you live to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Yum, yum yum ...! Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole,  lotta dead bugs, am I right ? Yeah, well, I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill'em all ! How can you tell ? Great scars. I like the jewelry. Hey, amigo, where can I get an earring like yours ? Port Joe Smith, Outer Rings, Dantana... Every time I come back from a drop, my gunny gives me a bone. I got three now. You don't see a lot of guys with three. Waht's it like... combat ? I guess it's not so bad. I mean as  long as you don't get any on you. Oh, you'll know when it happens. See you on the bounce. I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together. What do I want with a scar ? What, your skin's too pretty ? C'mon, everyone's doing it ! Carmen... ? What happened to your hair ? It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ? I try just to be happy I'm still alive. Should I be ? Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ? Best in the Fleet ! I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ? Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they  naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude. You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ? You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ? Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers. Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here. It's alright. What's he gonna do ? Whoa, easy there, buddy... Nice punch. Hey, it's just a vestigal response to  procreation... bitch. Forget it, Johnny. Cap Troopers and Fleet weren't meant to mix ! It hurts...! No, this hurts. YAAAAAAAA ! Mobile Infantery rules ! Death to all bugs ! Don't get any on you ! Officer on deck ! At ease. Alright... we got hot poop straight from the top: Willy's Wildcats is in with the first wave. Means more bugs for us to kill... Now if you follow orders and remember your training, I guarantee you'll make it back alive. Any questions ? Alright... next we got a little last minute briefing from Military Intelli-gence I think you're gonna like... Everyday Federal scientists are looking for new ways to kill bugs and you can help... To defeat the enemy, we must know the enemy. Take for instance your basic Arachnid warrior. Minimal IQ, armored,  completely lethal. You can blow a limb off... ... and it's still 86% combat effec-tive. But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good. Now while you are out killing bugs, we want you to be our eyes and ears. The bugs use some kind of plasma burst to divert meteors and aim them toward Earth. We need to know how they do this. If you encounter any plasma, report it immediately to your superior. Good luck and good hunting ! Move out ! Smash the entire area, kill anything that has more'n a couple legs , and don't any of you loafers come back aboard with unexpended bombs. Get me ? Yes, sir ! Five seconds... Drop is 35% complete, ma'am. ...surface in twenty-fivr seconds ...LZ has been identified ...beacon is in place... That's it, we're empty ma'am ! ...surface in fifteen seconds... deploying chute now... ...surface in five... four ... three... Up there on the ridge ! We'll nuke those bug positions from theAAAAAAAA ! KILL IT ! Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...? I didn't see him ! Ace, what're we doing ? I uh... uh... Don't waste your ammon on the  workers ! Look out ! C'mon, Katrina was right. We  gotta get out of here ! It's a general retreat ! The boats are coming down. C'mon, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE ! Retrieval ! KITTEN ! AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Johnny !JOHNNY !WHERE ARE YOU ? JOHNNY !Johnny...! Medic... MEDIC...! Oh, God... Oh, God, help me... please help me...! Take my hand ! Crsisis for Humankind ! Fleet official  admit they underestimated the  Arachnid's defensive capability. Would you like to know more ? Accepting responsibility for Klendathu, Sky Marshall Dienes resigns. His successor, Sky Marshall Tahat Meru, outlines her new strategy. Until we understand the bug better, we  must proceed with caution... We can ill afford another Klendathu. To explain the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids, Federal Scientists postulate the existence of a leadership caste...BRAIN BUGS ! Families oof those who have died or become incapacitated by Federal Service are entitled  to benefits ! If you see the name of a loved one, please do not call. A Federation official will call you. Would you like to know more ? Affirmative, Rodger Young...one zero zero  niner five two... welcome back. Give me hand, willya ? I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen. If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ? So ? Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it. I'm not kidding. Marriage is - Hey, bugs don't take prisoners. Carmen...? I'm sorry, Carmen. You're upset, that's alright. Two more days. Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires... He was our teacher... He was great. Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster. The Roughnecks killed more bugs than any other outfit in 2nd Brigade... Only took 15% casualties on Big K. Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement. You top kick ? I wouldn't mind. Where you been besides Big K ? I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach. Is your Lieutenant as bad as they say ? Same for me... me, too... Sounds like he is quite a guy. Attention ! We get you, sir ! There. Fire in the hole ! Looks like you've got a little bug problem, ma'am... WATCH OUT ! Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team. Way to go, amigo ! I'm gonna need a squad leader. No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive  material. What about it, Diz ? Looks like I'm your girl, sir. What kind of stinkin' bug is that ? Agghh ! It's making me sick...! Sir, look ! Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...? Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir. That'd be me, sir. I'm hot, sir ! Now comes the part I hate the most. What's that ? We go down into the colony and make sure all the queens are dead. He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile. Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared. All dead except one, sir. Yes, sir. C'mon... Nah, I don't do that anymore... You used to dance... I said no. Want me to pull rank ? Well, excuse me, sir... Yes, sir... Lieutenant, Brigade's on the com... Hey, Diz... What ? May I have the honor ? At 0821 we received a distress call from  Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement... Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why  MICOM wants onsite assessment. Take your group down to P and have a  look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job. Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders ! That'll be all, Major. Dismissed. This conference is over. Do your duty, Lieutenant. That's an order. Yes, sir ! Planet P ? What kind of name is that ? They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy. I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder. BUGS...! Johnny, watch out ! AAAAAAAAAAA ! Yes, sir. It's here, sir. Diz, see what you can do. I'm on it ! Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir. Lieutenant, I think you're gonna wanna see this, sir. Dirty bugs came in right when they  were having chow ! Officer on the deck, sir. Get out... you gotta get me out...! At ease, Lieutenant. Thank God for you, for all of you...this is grand... so where's the boat ? I was forced to hide, of course. The security of the Federation in this theater of operations was at stake ! Diz, what's with the uplink ? Workin on it...! They get in your mind... they make you do things ! Look here... They did it to Farley...! Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were biding their time... waiting for the most opportune moment ! They weren't gonna do it to me. Oh no ! I know too many secrets ! Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my boys and girls...! I know... I wish you'd shoot me... Lieutenant, we got trouble ! What's going on, Diz ? I got power ! Gimme a minute ! We don't have a minute ! Boat coming down, sir ! I'm empty...all nuked out... Me, too ! Jeez, we musta killed a million already...! Not enough, I guess. Yes, sir ! Getting low here, sir ! 300 rounds and counting, sir ! Yes, sir ! Cover us, Ace ! Hit your jets, sir ! We're not leaving you here, sir ! Give'em hell, sir ! AAAAAAA ! GET IT OFF ME Hang on, Diz... don't die on me... I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ? No, you're gonna be alright, Diz ! It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny... Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock...! On whose authority, Corporal ? This would be mine, sir. Acting  Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission. I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! JOHNNY HEH HEH CAN'T HEH We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit. That was just a mix up. What happened to your eye ? I like it. It's kinda...you. Where are you going ? That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ? How do you feel about him now ? I do. Dizzy bought the farm. She was my good friend, and friens are the best  luck anyone gets... But in war, we must go on without our friends. We take with us their memory, and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death. Let me tell you what it is: Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting. Officer on deck ! Please continue, Sergeant. Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug  for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug  you kill honors her death. Womb to tomb, cap trooper ! Womb to tomb ! How are you, Carl ? Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability... Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ? Elegant proof of intelligence,  isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P. A colony has to reach a certain size before it produces a Brain... we think 300 generations. Woulda too expensive to launch an operation if there wasn't a Brain... You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths. Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for. Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain. The Roughnecks are always ready, sir. I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ? I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better. It's good to see you two. It reminds me of the way things were before... See you on the bounce ! Officer on the deck ! I only have two rules. Rule one, everyone fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself. Do you get me ? We get you, sir ! Who're all these kids ? We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot... We're the old men, Ace. We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know. Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers. Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet... Alright, cut it out. We will deploy from skimmers in teams of six. If the bugs open up a battery, we put it out of business. Any questions ? Would'ya mind moving your boat ? Better talk to the boss. You're standing on my H.Q.,  Lieutenant ! This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be  safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ? You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down - Rodger Young, prepare to receice  outgoing fire...! I'll take the first group. Saddle up, boys, that's our trash ! Yes, ma'am ! Warp in 5... 4... What's your problem now, Lieutenant ? The Rodger Young just burned up... Any survivors ? Affirmative ! Carmen, this is Roughneck base camp... What is your present  location ? We've gotta go get her ! You know as well as I do she's probably already dead. We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy. Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here- Form a perimeter ! Make yourself useful, fly boy... AAAAAAAAAAA ! Ace, get on the com. Tell Fleet we need retrieval... Sugar, salvage some armor and suit up Lieutenant Barcalow. Thanks. Fleet Command says retrieval's no go. The battle group's at safe distance... and we got another problem. Looks like they're gonna hose us down... Alright... Listen up, Roughnecks. We're gonna head west down through bug city, pick up any Rodger Young  survivors we run across, and join A Company. Get me ? We get you, sir ! What do you think you're doing ? I'm gonna save Carmen. That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico. Yeah, that's right. Let's go. Move out. Bug hunt ! BUG HUNT ! Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way... Yes, sir ! Sugar, close the tunnel...! You know what this is...? Sure you do... You're a big fat smart bug, aren't you ? I'll take you with me. Take my hand ! Roughnecks...NOW ! AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Weapon ! Are you hurt ? Ah geez... Can you walk ? Not a problem. Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin  bug hole ! It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you... Yeah, if I live through this,  they'll probably hang me. Now com'on, let's move out ! Up. We gotta be near A Company  by now. FALL BACK ! How bad are you, pal ? Been better, buddy. Alright, we're gonna carry you... Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get  upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke. Don't be a hero... This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here... Just giving you something to remember me by, baby. GO.GO GO GO GO...! What's it thinking, Colonel ? It's afraid. Sir, I'd like to turn myself in. Dereliction of duty by an officer during wartime. And you freely admit to it ? Yes, sir. Is what this man says true, Lieutenant ?
