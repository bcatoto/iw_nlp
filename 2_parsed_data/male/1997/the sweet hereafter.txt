Why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me this? I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn't deal Case? Leave us alone, Stephens. Leave the people of this town alone. You can't help. Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now? Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month. Because that's what I'm about to do. Not unless you can raise the dead. No you don't. Mister, I don't want to know your name. Goodnight, Nicole. I'm not sure. And she really liked you. She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or... Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity. Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it. Why? Yeah. I'll be back around nine. They just finished supper. Hi, Nicole. Say hello for me. How is Nicole? Is she around? The children. I used to like it here. I used to care about what happened. Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away. Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary. Because I saw it. I saw it happen... I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids. That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other. This was a community. Why? You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board. We all did. We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards. We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad. The rescue squad. Because they didn't act fast enough. That's wrong, Sam. You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years. This is never going to go away... If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing. But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam. Force me to testify in court. He came by the garage this afternoon. Gave me this piece of paper. I've tried to stay out of it. But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam. You've gone and got yourself this lawyer. Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos. Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it. Why not? How? It does concern me. Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth. It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing. You think that caused the accident, Risa? That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer. Or maybe they're the same thing. Yes. Well I don't. Why? You believe that? Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it. I stopped by the station a while ago. I stared at the bus. I could almost hear the kids inside. There was a lawyer there. He told me he'd gotten you signed up. Is that true? Good night. I better get back. Sure. Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them. Behind the bus. It's natural. That's because he misses you. What are you thinking? What time's he coming home? Does this mean I can't take a shower? A while. She said she's got to be home by nine. Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight. She'll be there around six.We've only got honey. I didn't ask if you wanted milk. But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to... You want a cup of tea or something?Okay. Oh. So he was mean? The people in the town? Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats? Nicole? I want to sit beside you tomorrow. Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow? Nicole? What's vermin again? Oh. What's a ditty again?I'll tell her that. I will. Alison. Mitchell. It was nice to see you again, Ally. Nothing. We made it to the hospital. I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to. But I was prepared to go all the way. I didn't know. I was in a panic. I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell. Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital. I finally got a doctor on the line. He sounded young, but cool. He was confident, but there was a nervousness. He have been an intern. This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this. He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was. I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing. It was laboured. I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen. I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face. I'm...so sorry. It turns to steaming piss. Yes. Do you find there's something strange about this meat? That's where I'm going. To see her. She didn't. Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units... Sunnyridge. That was a long time Which clinic? Which one? Are you still in touch? Yes...fine. We're...not together. Ally Jones. And what does he do again? I'm just fine, Ally. What about you? Ally. That's right. Yes. Alison Jones. I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel... That's my daughter. Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead. She's a drug addict. I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel. That's my daughter. Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead. She's a drug addict. The Walkers have agreed. The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents. It's important to initiate proceedings right away. Things get covered up. People lie. That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight. You can help each other. Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group. No, Mr. Ansel. I wouldn't sue you. I can help you. I understand. My name is... Why would he be frightened? That's what he said, is it? There might have been a word or two that slipped by. Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure. Yes. Excuse me? It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event. Mrs. Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect. I did. Yes. He does. Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years. That would complicate things. What's that, Dolores? Did they give him special care? Did his parents attend to that? You mentioned that he had a learning disability. Were his parents...attentive to him? And what's that? Berry-picking. Berries. You talked about it? Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures...run-ins with the law... From what? For rabbits? And they loved Bear. Do they have any reputation for drugs? Yes. What do you mean by 'hippies'? What do you mean by that, Dolores? I'll...take it straight. No. A little sugar though. How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto? How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning? A cup of tea would be nice. Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto? I want to talk to you. Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question. So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that? Yes. Dolores...and even your mom and dad. But I'll make sure you go last. I'm absolutely positive. There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this. I don't want you to lie. They work for the people we're trying to sue. Their job is to try to minimize damages. Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs. No good guys or bad guys. Just our side and their side. It would be strange if you didn't feel that way. That you didn't die? Like the other children? You hate that. I have no questions. Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'. Note my objection. She said, 'As I'm talking.' I object to that form of question. Note that. I object to the form of that question. Note that. Have they ever been busted? Crafts? What do they do? That's good. Judges like adopted Indian boys. Tell me more about the Ottos. Indian? Tell me about the Ottos. That's great, Wendell. That's the sort of thing I need to know. So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on. People who will help our cause. That's the local bar? When? What about Doreen? Hard to say. I might have...some business here. Do you have a room? Here we go. Is this it? How old is she? You always think you're prepared for these things. Need a hand? I love you, Zoe. I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you. No matter what happens. I'll take care of you. Yes. I can hear you breathing too. Of...course I do. I just thought...I could get you another Do you have the blood test? What for? What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want. Yes. Yes. That's not news, Zoe. Tell me your news, Zoe. Yes. Give me your news, Zoe. News? Yes. Yes, I'll accept the charges. I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act... Yes. The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now. Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe. Why are you calling me, Zoe? I'm in a car wash. Well, let's see what we get. If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp... Is there shrimp on it? What is it? I'm afraid this meat is overdone. If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount. If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing. It's a standard agreement. No. Listen to me, Mrs Otto. Listen very carefully. I do know what's best. Excuse me? Mrs. Otto, there is no such thing as an accident. The word doesn't mean anything to me. As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner. Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement. They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference. That's what's done, Mrs. Otto. I've seen it happen so many times before. It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years. Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal. A few million at the very most. The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus. You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto? That's why I'm here. To give your anger a voice. To be your It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger. Not their grief. Yes. The Walkers spoke very highly of you. Please. Please, let me explain. I'll only take a moment of your time. I'm a lawyer. I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand. I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk. How does the family survive? Any criminal record? In what way? No.Thanks. Perfect. Almost three. Tell me about it. Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag. I know my wife packed one in there...I'm sorry. It's not enough. For hospital bills. For Nicole. No, Billy. We can't drop the lawsuit. You know how much we need the money. C'mon, you know that won't... That won't happen, Billy. Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys. The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus. I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time. That'll be the end of it. So? I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers. Okay, fine. So...stay out of it. Because it's what we have to do. Well, it being so depressing and all. But it's reality. You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea. Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits. We're hardly unique here, Billy. I mean, I can understand how you feel. I don't see how that concerns you, Billy. So what brings you out tonight? Hey, Billy! What brings you out on a night like this? C'mon in. Take a load off. Is he coming over now? Right away? Was he drinking? Could you tell? Did he say what about? There's talk of that. It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off. I don't know. Okay. Yes. Well, okay. I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning. That's okay with you? What do you mean? You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess. Hard to talk to. Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I'd take you over. Are you sleeping? Nothing good on your T.V.? What are you up to, Nicole? Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families. The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more. Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence. He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man. Partly. But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover. That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer. To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest. You're going to need special care for a long time to come. It's not going to be easy. Not for you, not for any of us. Because we love you so much. And it's going to cost money. More than we can imagine. It's because of the accident, Nicole. Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers. A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included. Well, yes. He's your lawyer too. He's a lawyer. He's our lawyer. Oh. I better get some spackle. Sure. I'll fix it right away. And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see. Do you like the colour? Pretty slick, eh? How do you like it, Nicole? Don't even try to remember. Does it fit? What's that? What took so long? What's so funny? I am. Really. It was awesome. Of course. You're going to blow everyone away. That was great.Thank you, Nicole. And what was the weather like at this time? Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior? Was the bus on time? What do you remember about the accident? You remember this? There wasn't time? Why not? Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll? You saw the speedometer? You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time? Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this? How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection? You could see the speedometer? Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole? Why were you scared? This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking? Why were you scared? Yes. I will offer that report. Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you observed at that time? You are? You remember that much? Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up? And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning? And where did you sit that morning? Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning? Was anyone waiting for the bus with you? What time in the morning was this? Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?Don't know. Food banks, welfare, church charity. They scrape by. Can't get off that shitty dump they live on. What little money comes in goes to booze. Probably half a dozen traffic convictions. Drunk driving. Lost his licence. That's why he don't work no more. Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up. Used to be smart enough. Kyle Lambston's a drunk. Nobody likes him. He's a nasty piece of work. Are you a reporter? Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed. Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters. They're all inbred. Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night. Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts. That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town. He's about to lose his house and car. Yeah, right.Oh God, I'm scared. I can hear you breathing, Daddy. You don't believe me? You don't fucking believe me? You can't ask me that! Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money. I need money. Welcome to hard times, Daddy. I tested positive. Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register? No. But this is. They wouldn't take my blood. Okay. I went to sell blood yesterday. That's how it is. I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood. You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you? You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer. Don't you want to hear? I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy. Some big news. Daddy? Why can't you talk to me? DADDY!!! 'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm? Is that what you're thinking, Daddy? So what's the problem? Why am I calling you? You're my father. I'm not supposed to call you? What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy? Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window? How old was I, Daddy? Five or six? I got absolutely soaked, remember? A car wash! Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash. Make sure you've got the windows closed.
