Vincent, where's the shore? We're too far out. We have to go back! How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done <i>any</i> of this? I will prove it to you. Come swim with me now, Vincent. Now--tonight. You didn't beat me that day. I beat <i>myself</i>. It's for the best. It's over. Come with me now, Vincent. You've gone as far as you can go.I'm sorry, there's no way we can. How much extra? I like football. Er, no... He's right, Maria. That's right. We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.I'll take care of it. And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name. You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know. I guess so. Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit. No? What's keeping you? So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.It's not <i>exactly</i> him. We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night. What more do you want? Positive saliva match. The cup was definitely used since the original sweep. Where do we start? From what budget? We don't have the manpower. He's not here. It's a blind alley. That's the last. You know their workforce. Two-thirds at least fall into the category. We'll be closing down their operation for days. At least go with a fingertip sample or urine. None of the ID photos match the enhancement. It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. You've seen their security system. They know who works there. Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals. It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window. No. But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past. The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for. We're already getting complaints about frivolous search. With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky. Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet. This <i>is</i> the most likely location-- What a pity. I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections-- Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found. This was an angry killing. Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death? According to this, he's a sick man. Congenital heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes. With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests-- I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not... ...universally loved. He was leading the cut-backs in the program. You're looking at a room full of motives. Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges... I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir. It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission. We're already counting backwards. Twelve have a mission within the week. Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat. I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be. We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal. So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders. Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us. I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place. One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further. Would you care to look--in the telescope? What a relief. We have to be certain. Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around. Often.You have more in common than you know. Don't be deceived, Irene. These are just the clothes. He has to wear them. Something I could never do. He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes. That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded. Again? Now <i>you're</i> here. Who are your "friends"? Hello, sweatheart. Come on up. Hello. At least you're honest. Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it. You're both going to a lot of trouble-- Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own. I'm sure you're sincere... ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself. Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it. My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off? Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him? I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>. Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight? Six one. I got the better end of the deal. I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream. I'm travelling too. In case you get back before I do. No, but you might need them when you get back. I have your samples ready. I could always walk. I've been faking it. Not bad, Jerome. I was never very good at it, remember? Hello? I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer. How long? Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself. You may as well invite her here. Where are you taking her? I'm sure you'll be very convincing. Again? Where are we going? She doesn't <i>have</i> to know. She doesn't <i>want</i> to know. You're not thinking of telling her, are you? You <i>are</i> a catch. No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up". What's wrong with her? How was your evening? If I were you I'd worry about myself. Haven't you forgotten something? I don't feel too good. I think I'm still drunk from last night. If you say so. The stripe. Is that all? So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled. I'm sure I could have. And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless? How could they recognize you? <i>I</i> don't recognize you. Anyway, you don't have a choice. You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now. No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing. This is a minor inconvenience is all it is. We've taken worse heat than this. Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered. You can't quit on me now. I've put too much into this. Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>. I had other offers, you know. I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine. You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself? We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned. Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash to you. They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years. I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life-- Could be worse. They could have found it in your eye. Where? What makes them think that? What are you talking about? Any particular reason? I'm proud of you, Vincent. --I walked right in front of it. I was never more sober in my life. You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know I'm scared of heights. I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life. How long do you stay up there before you go? What <i>is</i> that one? At least up there your piss will be worth something. You'll all be showering in it, right? I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!! You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going. Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week-- you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction. Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately. So what? You didn't kill him, did you? This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it? What an act of benevolence--a service to the community. So that's it. Now there's nothing between you and ignition. You wish. Who died? Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent. You don't know what a relief it is not to be me. Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job? God, you're serious, aren't you? God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet? You really need that much? Noone orders southpaws anymore. It needs work. Wrong color. It's silver. It's not easy living up to this. If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.There's a way. You can wear lifts. Why are you inventing problems? You two are a couple of goddam clones. You look so right together, I want to double my fee. Yeah. It happened in Australasia. He checked in yesterday. No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck. As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life. Excuse me, <i>your</i> life. No problem. Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors-- He has the heart of an ox. He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star. Vincent, come down. I've found him. Vincent...Vincent... I think I could do something provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.I've found him too. Not that. These new personality corrections I've been reading about. My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.Where did you get this? Luca could still be an accomplice. So we have two choices. Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or... ...he <i>is</i> here. We test again. You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act. Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line. I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission. We'll vacuum these streets if we have to. What are you waiting for? I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time! Get it. From outside, if you have to. No, we've missed something. We Hoover again. Something's not right. Blood. From the vein. A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you. Intravenous. Don't underestimate these imposters. He was afraid of being exposed. That's why he did it. Of course. He's a "de-gene-erate". He works at Gattaca. Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom? Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder. A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits? This is a murder investigation. The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets. I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky. Widen the sweep. The West side. Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca. Hoover some of the classier establishments. Random car stops. Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies. Do you need any more than that? --There's that word again. I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective. Not exactly a slave to probability. Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb? We're in the wrong place. We're wasting time. Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found. All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself. --I've already run it. There's no record of any living relative. Who knows with these "deficients"? His profile indicates a proclivity for violence. No. Not <i>likely</i>. So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead. --What <i>about</i> his profile? No, <i>this</i> is your man. Grudges? A man's dead, Detective. At least it's nothing contagious. This time I will supervise each test personally. No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep. If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him. I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective. In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt. You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst. Thank you, no. This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor. We believe we have a suspect. Surely you know what you have. How often do you test, Director? A fingerprint. There's something to be said for nostalgia. What did you find? Hugo! I've found him! They said the same thing about myopia and obesity. You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful? Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human. From where I sit the world could stand a little improving. You worried about the cost? Why not?Too late for that. We're closer to the other side. Now is your chance to find out. Who are you trying to convince? Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible? God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing. But <i>you</i> did, once. Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail? There are a few million miles to go yet. You almost sound like you believe that. By the way, I left some trash in your locker. I'll see what I can do. I guess I'm a slow learner. Not yet, I'm afraid. Thank you. Where are you going? Why have you done this? Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples where I'm going. How the hell did you get here. How are you, Jerome? How would you like to be yourself for the day? By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?" Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad. How are you?" We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer. Will you be okay? Everybody goes there. Michael's. She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong. I'm sorry. I've got plans. Of course not. But she's have to know eventually. You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since. Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing. Never stopped you before. And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald. Not thirsty? We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week. Good choice. I've got enough on my mind without that. You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation. You really had other offers? I'm sorry. I think I was crying. They'll recognize me. --You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. We should cut our losses. Come on--we're taking off. In a corridor. They found my eyelash. They think I offed the Director. We can't stay here. Call German. It's all right. --What car?--Go to sleep. It's okay, Eugene. Up there they wouldn't be a problem. A day or so. 11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew. And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered. Keep going!! Keep going!! Let's get out of here. You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got my final physical tomorrow. That's not the point. The place is crawling with Hoovers. He was still warm when they confirmed. They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag. The Mission Director. What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene? It's not too late to back out. Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home. <i>More</i> than that. You'll get used to it. You had to be a right-hander. What about this? I have to know where you come from. A year is a long time. We could go together one day. I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later. That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn. But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your-- --nose. How perfect does your child have to be? You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left. We'll get it later. Irene, please. Come on. It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here. Let's walk. Those checks take forever. You've never been here? Let me order for you. I guess somebody beat me to it. Of course. What exactly is wrong? You'll be next. Why would I be angry? It was beautiful. Yes...<i>yes</i>... Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene. Does it have a name? Where? It was a mercy-killing after all. Have they found our friend? We were just looking. I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you? Why don't we say we were together? So we don't know for sure about you, either. Were <i>you</i> alone? Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about <i>you?</i> Where were you last night? No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone. Last night? I was at home. No bother. Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser-- There's a problem, Lamar. What's this, Lamar? Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes. I'll tell you at the end of the week. Only every time I'm in here.I don't know exactly, Jerome. German. Suit yourself. What's wrong with it? You okay, Jerome? He's too tall. Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be? Even with lifts I'm never that tall. How tall are you? I'd have to bleach my hair. That's the hair color in his profile? How do I square the accident? I hope he's not just a body. German, is that you? What do you think?
