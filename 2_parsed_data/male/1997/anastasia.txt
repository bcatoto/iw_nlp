PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE -- Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces? Boy, don't you hate it when that happens? I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead... I'm getting a chest cold.. Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that. You'd lose your security deposit? My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound... Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia. Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ... Trust me, it's her! Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive. So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague. Someone's gotta clean that up... No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached. Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry. Oh my God! Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...I'll never let go! Anya... where are we? I'm glad you found what you were looking for. No! Well, yes, but Anya, wait! Don't be You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know. Nervous? It's okay. Didn't hurt.. Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry! Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost. Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you? Sad? It's not you - it's the dress! It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over. It's the best fork of all Every Russian family has one.. You are the Princess. You must enjoy causing me pain! Come on! Now just get off the train. Trying... to... breathe... Come on up! That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs ... stretch then that way. I was all out of dynamite! I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up! Do you always punch people first thing in the morning? You never thought of the possibility? Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris. We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. Why do you want to go to Paris? Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . . You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother? What happened to your parents? People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive. That makes her an orphan too Who are you?! That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy. Ouch! That really hurt! She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too! Watch me. What do you mean? But it's not the money, Vlad. It worked in Odessa... How is our current financial status? See? The Princess is under there ... Pray he's color-blind... Yes. And I hate that in a woman. You're a princess... "Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it. Hurry up with those papers. She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . . Look! It's her. What was that? We will. We have to. Come on, Vlad - she's out there. Run, Anya - go... You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the... What do you want?! Rasputin! And tell me that she's happy. Promise me she'll have her home. I should go Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry... No. Empress, you -- What I found your was your granddaughter! I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me! Please, if you'd just listen... I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...Anya! What if we can't find anyone who loves us?! But what if we can't ever find where we came from?! Where is your home, Anya? Are you running away?I did no such thing! I had nothing to do with it! Rasputin! You're alive . . .Shut up! Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris? She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him. What do you think is the most humiliating way to die? Bartok... a question. Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her. Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ... Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?! I cursed then all! How do you know? Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching. Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend? I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out! And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings? What? I'll show you! STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia. The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia... I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be. So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh? After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! ! You gave the orders! Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave? Fortunately, I am to be married. With your highness, permission. Yes, your highness. Yes, your highness. I shant! Come out! I can do alterations. Did I tell you that? We're just going to refresh your memory... Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean. We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie. Is everyone all right? She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . . Good day! Providing travel papers is illeagal! I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you. Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . . Who did you hear it from? So where will you go? But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down! Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner. Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her. Are you feeling all right? We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich! The "Odessa Dunk"? If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic. Ah! Let us begin! What do we do now? Well, she certainly has a mind of her own. Royalty do not help people with their luggage. What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness". Wake up, young lady, that's our train. Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster? Ew. . . the honest type. He's her? That was your dinner! I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris! It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl! Perhaps you could convince her? Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana? Are you impressed with our Anastasia? May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
