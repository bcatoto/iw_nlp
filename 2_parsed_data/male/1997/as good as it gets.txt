Yes. No. I also regrew my beard... but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you... when it comes to people you... Two years ago... I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app -- There's not going to be a debate. You must leave. If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...I'm sorry that I'm not taking you. Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon. No, I promise... not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me. Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him. Hey, hey... Haaa... bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago... the hand will come back... they're sure... Won't worry about it. You go ahead. If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know. Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive? Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him? It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone. Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon. Hey -- you called me... I... What? It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note. She's nice. Do it. Sure -- take him to the vet. No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow. Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust... How's Verdell doing? You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow. Thanks for looking after him. You're taking him... yes... you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try... because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no." Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him. I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer. Have a nice day. Party! You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me. Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch. Simon, you've got to get dressed.Shall I get her for you? Actually, I don't think so. They require a tie and jacket but we have some available. Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket. Good evening.I'm gonna grab you. I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you. Just let me talk. I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence... ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good... Hey, I've got a great compliment for you. I'm feeling... I've been feeling better. If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls. It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk. Maybe we could live without the wise cracks. Boyfriend? It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine. I had to see you... What a break... Were you asleep? ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try. 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy. Were you asleep? So long. I should've danced with you. Okay to say something now? Cute. The two might go together. That seems like a good choice. How you doing? Hello. I'll take you... why not? Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home. This one has a special meaning. What do you mean? You said you liked it. Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there. Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home. Sorry, didn't realize she was right there. Did you have sex with her? It was a mistake. I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake. It's one idea... There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might... Well, ah... that's a personal question. You don't owe me that. Never. Takes months to know... They work little by little. Talking like this is exhausting. Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out. Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills. One baked -- one fries. Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries? Can we order first? Okay. That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails. No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me. No... ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it. I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before. No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either. Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out. Dancing? Yes... sure. I'll take the sofa. That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good. ... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano. You like sad stories -- you want mine. Nonsense! Welcome. I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything. I was going to do that for you. Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag. Whether crabs are in season there now... Oh. We might. Yes. We can. Let's. Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next. That you might ask -- I'm not certain. Are you still coming? Is there another way to see it? Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go. What's that got to do with it? Bettes tells me he's doing fine. You take off when you have to. Two days. I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook. I want you to go on this trip. Now I want you to do something for me. Nice of you... thank you. Lovely. No... no thank you notes. Hey, what I did for you is working out? Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore. He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore. What's this? So you'll be at work? Okay!!!! Anything else?!? What needs clearing up? You waiting for me to say something? What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow. To get you back at work so you can wait on me. Note. Put it in the note. I was working... can't you just drop me a thank-you note? Carol the waitress? Yeah, yeah... any chance you'll get back to work today? How ya doing? I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!! What about your mother? Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter. I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject. This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying... I'm hungry. You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten. Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke... What's with the dark? Otherwise, you're not ugly. If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty. How old are you? It's okay -- I'll sit here. Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake. Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around. Okay. His name? No. What's wrong with your son, anyway? I see the help -- judgement call. Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend... now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe. We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will. The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee. I've got Jews at my table. I'm starving. Hey, elephant girl, call her or something... just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait. Do it!!! What are you trying to do to me? No. No. Get Carol. Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time... I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here? You changed the room around... You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease? Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in. Help! Last word freak. Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much. Like the wind but I'm not doing it. Think white and get serious. Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good. Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here. About a dog. "What?" Look at you... You sense a mark. Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.' I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days. It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off. Okay by me. It's been five weeks... another few won't kill me. He's a pain in the ass. Hey, where are you going? You can't do this. I can't take a dog. Nobody's ever been in here before. I'm not saying nothing to you. Police! Police! Fucking crooked police... doughnut-munching morons help me! Assault and battery and you're black. No touch. No touch. No touch. Hope you find him. I love that dog. What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now? No, it's all right. I'll just watch. Wait here. What? Hi. You have hard shells, right? Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here. Sure thing. Absolutely. Is he dead yet? Ask him. Just move on. No one here killed him. How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole. I forgot to lock the door. Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go. Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late. Absolutely not. Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble. It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water. I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out. Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life. No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp. I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"... ... and she doesn't want contact with me. I'm dying here. You going to come talk to me or not? Look, we both want the dog -- and... They did a nice job... Cozy, huh? I think you gotta camp it here... I told you to go on in. Does it matter? Good-bye. Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now. What are you talking about? You got real problems. ... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and... I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run... I give you that one... Nice packing. Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not... Do you ever get an erection for a woman? Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money. This stuff is pointless. Never a break. Never. Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up. Yeah... I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back... But the tiredness -- boy... Not just sleepy. I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here? I brought you Chinese soup. Stupid dog. I don't get it. Yo, yo, yo... Now we'll both call him. I carry bacon in my pocket. Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me... it's not affection. It's a trick. Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up. No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time. Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression. Where are all your queer party friends? That cleaning woman doesn't... It smells like shit in here? Maybe I'll bring him some food by. I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing. That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like... Okay, then. Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone... don't knock ... not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart? Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden? Do you realize that I work at him? Well, that's a load off. Yeeeess!!! 'Love was... ' How're you doing? Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food... I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall. What's he look like? I think of a man and take away reason and accountability. Oh God, this is like a nightmare. What's it mean?We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again. Oh, is he dead? What? Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?I love you... Let him take you home. You think you're kidding. I'll take care of myself -- I just love her. How're you doing? That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls... But you're beautiful... your skin glows. I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks. I've got to sketch you. Good night. How to die, mostly. Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts. Uh-huh... No!!! Can you not be violent? Was this supposed to be your room? No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along. Well... Do you want to know what happened with my parents? I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her. So am I, Frank. You are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea... How could you do that? He'll hurt him. So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell? Jackie, will you hand me the mirror? He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he? I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?... Just tell me. Well, I can't reach them. Terrify me? Sorry. What are those cards? No. Please, don't force him. I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction. What's wrong? Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard. You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down. But you know where you're lucky? Picking on me won't help. Did you like it that much? Okay... you tell me why -- "You're dying here." Because... ... you love her? What did she say? I'm coming. Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then... I love you. Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me. What are you talking about? Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause... Another place where? I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted. I'm going back with you. ... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye. You consider your life easy. Melvin... Not it at all, really. Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it. That's very thoughtful. I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died. But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain. Got any easier questions? Thanks. Would you leave now, please? Come on, sweetheart... Oh, my gosh. Get out. Rot in hell, Melvin. Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you? Get out. Please, just leave. Go away. If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well. Thank you for walking him. Verdell? Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart? By the way, thanks for saving me. Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall? Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making. No... actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d... No, I didn't. Did you... do something to him? I found Verdell, Mr. Udall. Maybe this can wait. Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please. Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that. Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall. Which color was that? My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like? Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! Have you seen Verdell? Why are you doing this? Just a second -- he has to go. Yes... well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good. No... Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching... an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity. Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it. Exactly what is your previous experience?Uh-huh. He's good... And I'm an expert on doctors. Hi... Did you know there are doctors who come to your house? Not bad. I'm sorry.No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there... I just want to tell you... Please!! NO!!! Wait -- I want to see the painting. So you're practically finished, huh? The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right... is that correct? I haven't done it right? How about that pose? This is not fun... Give me some direction.
