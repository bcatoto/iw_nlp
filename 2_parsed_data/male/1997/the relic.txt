No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out. That lock was torn off from the inside . Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert. Looks like the curse is still at work. Anything missin'? I'm sorry, sir. You okay?Why not? The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself. Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe. Doesn't look like it. We're damned lucky. This statue is priceless. Someone broke into this room. Beauregard! You scared me half to death. My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone! We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help! Sweet Jesus! He'll be back. Relax. We're in good shape. Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious. There's no reason to call off the opening now. You haven't got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug. It's too late now. Guests are arriving. The Mayor's car is pulling up. I appreciate that. I don't want to scare people. Do they have to wear uniforms? We've been operating in the red for years. That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit. It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No. I don't want to think about that. If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block. Eight to the right! Look! I found it! To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while... Just a minute. I'm shaking! Take the gun. That thing won't come after us, right? It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement. Poor fools. Battery's dead. Shit. Calm down. I found it! I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone. Behind you. I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.There's some kind of animal loose in the museum. Pendergast's alone. He needs help. I want volunteers to go with me. Great. No. It better be good. I have to help Pendergast. Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me. The rest of you can go with Cuthbert! Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move. Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours -- I'll go down and speak to him. I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast. I think you should call it off. We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you. It's a little late, you son of a bitch. There's a friggin' monster loose in here! Get the FBI, the fire department. Find metal cutters, cut through. And bring a cannon. The damn thing is huge. Where the hell are you? Ippolito! Get back here! You said the system couldn't fail! What doors? That would leave one exit for hundreds of people. You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books. We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells. One more question. I see a big hole. If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails? That's great if you're stopping a burglar. Not our goal here. Are there motion detectors? The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito. Why don't you just tell me how this space station works. The sub-basement, huh? Great idea. Everybody. Get behind me. I smell it. It's here. The sub-basement? Pendergast! Help! It's right behind us! I think I should come with you. How big is the sub-basement? You've been holding out on me Pendergast. You have a suspect capable of this? I don't like animals. Never have. Dog bit me when I was little. After that I gave up on pets. Animals are irrational. Give me a psychotic killer any day. If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain. My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo. It was late August. Over ninety. The polar bear was inside his cave. Kids didn't know he was in there. All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear. By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces. The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming -- Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain? What happened to them? Oh. You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger? They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice touch. I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework". You're kidding. So the method of death is the only connection? Who didn't? Big news. Out of Brazil, wasn't it? Call me Vince. Then you won't like this one. It's a piece of shit. I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind? Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast. I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down. Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man. Been tossing his cookies for over an hour. Not a likely suspect. Careful. That mess on the ground is brains. We need light in here, stat. What's left of it. Vince D'Agosta. Am I out? Who are you? The undertaker? Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed? Pardon my French, but bull shit. Look. It's some kind of letter. This place is a maze. I'd say we're in its home. What's that doing here? What does it say? All right everybody, hold up! Not so loud. All right. Kawakita, cover the rear. How much ammo do we have to make a stand? I know. There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out. Got my hands full here. What is it?The virus itself might have positive applications. They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made. Greg isn't joining us? This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof! Did you hear that? My God. He says that Mbwun is real! May I see that? I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone. Look who's here, Margo. Remember, it has poor eyesight. It hunts with its sense of smell. So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes! Come back and get me. I'm coming with you. We can't. We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe. I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do. The building must be swarming with police by now. It won't take long for them to get through the doors. It's one of the fire doors. Good Lord, Margo. We're trapped! Don't stop now. Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a flashlight? It's like ringing the dinner bell. Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine. So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night. Quadrupedal! The other name for Mbwun. "He Who Walks on All Fours." That's not so unusual. Many plants carry viruses. Like the burls on Maple trees. Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched. Like the claw. They're eggs. Margo, these aren't seed pods. You're right. I'm not sure. As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant. Let me see the plant press. I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked. If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here. Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success. The museum is in debt. Contributions and public funding have dried up. Admissions no longer cover overhead. The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit. Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red. If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems. Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years. That's quite enough. This isn't a death sentence. Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. I'll garden. I'll write. You must. Come on. I'll walk you back to the elevator. Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art. With all due respect, dear, that's bull. You dance rings around me with your new technology. You've left me in the dust. Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed -- No, Margo. This is one problem you can't solve. You have to stay out of it. The fact is, I want to retire. Please. Don't humiliate me further. That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news. Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants? Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm. Now Margo, don't overreact. Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow. My leaving makes perfect sense. This isn't exactly early retirement. I've overstayed the party a bit. Yes. Bit of a shock. But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood. And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era -- They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta. What's that? Margo, this is too dangerous. You always think you can solve everything. This time you don't have enough information. The animal might behave in unexpected ways. Leave her here with me. Don't put her in danger. We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate. I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years. Not really. Just the sub-basement. Yes. "Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates. You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days. So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded. We've made an incredible find. I enclose a representation of Mbwun. Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate. I know because I've seen the beast." It's from John. Those two arrows were his insignia. It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions. This means there must be an animal loose in the museum! Something tried to get into this room! Yes. John made quite a study of the whole museum. He had a copy of my original plans. They fill seven floors. We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world. Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens. Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems. Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display. Happy to be useful. It's rare enough these days. According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.Way cool. Then you know where the dinosaurs are. Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit? What do you do? You work here? You're color blind. They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's. Like this. Not that big. We were just lost, okay? And we went down this curvy staircase. At the bottom was a big shadow. I don't know. But I think it's bad. Quiet! Don't be a wuss. Come on. Chicken. This is a great short cut. She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs. That lady said they were on the fourth floor.I made it outside. I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here. Help is on the way. Just sit tight. D'Agosta? Ippolito. Come in. Like hell! I told you! They seal off all the cells. They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure -- The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall! You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant. There are safeguards built in. We have back-up systems with redundancies. There's no way these computers can fail. In every exhibition room. The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five. We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors. It's fool proof, basically. I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip. If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft. This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant. You'll just scare people off. I can handle the security behind scenes with this system. It's state of the art.Fifteen... what's next? Oh Jesus... For Chrissake, I'll do it. What's the combination?! Hurry up! Let's go! Forget it! What's the combination? Where's the walk-in safe? Oh no. I smell it. Jesus, what is this? Oh... my... God! It's alright. I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone. What is this place? Look. It's Hobbes! He's all right. There's something out there! Let's go get it now! That's why we came down here, isn't it? Argo! Hobbes! Holy mother, what is that? Heel Argo! Hobbes! Heel! They've got something. The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast. Maybe we should head back.Dear God. Where are we, Lieutenant? I don't know. I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America. Dr. John Whittlesley. What's that? I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection. Oh shit. You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing. It's still back there! What happened?! It's important. Please. You have to come! Pendergast, too. She's found out something. Dr. Green has to see you! Lieutenant! It's me. Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you. Got to finish this thesis sometime. Is Dr. Frock safe! Eats them? So what? 4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland." These plant fibers are loaded with hormones! What kind of egg is it? Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand? Impossible. The sample must be contaminated. What do you make of it, Margo? What's that? Someone's been murdered. Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either. Torn limb from limb. There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me. Telegraph. Telephone. Tell Kawakita. I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary. This is Dr. Frock's last week. Frock's been fired. Margo, you haven't heard? If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.They were yellow! It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes. And it snuffled the ground like a dog. Well almost. Depends which house. It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise. Big as a house. What is it? I don't want to go this way. We're not supposed to go back there. Let's ditch and find them ourselves. This room sucks.I understand. But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down. Yes. If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence. I've read about the Museum's financial troubles. I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches. Nice to see you, Lieutenant. Go out the north exit! There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases. Run! I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out. Vince? There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit. This door's locked. Try shooting the hinges off. We haven't got time. You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight. Apparently it's huge. This isn't an animal, Vince. I've been on this case four months, remember? I've learned a few things. Correct. If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test. No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster. I believed them. How do you explain the part about Beauregard? Unfortunately, no. If you don't mind, this could be important. No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat. Yes. That's my case. Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated. Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board. Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago? Twelve bodies on board. Lieutenant -- Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar. In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things. An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser. Amazing. I have a copy of this in my office at home. Whose footprints? Where's the head? Mind if I have a look? The body? Not at all. I think we may be working on the same case. If so, I could use your help. Special Agent Pendergast. FBI. The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps? Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa. I hope you liked it. We've met. The Hacksaw Murders. '89. Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants? Footsteps! He's right. I don't believe it. You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please? Where is that? Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide? You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum. Read it out loud. I wouldn't be so sure. And failed. These doors are solid steel. Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley? How many storage areas are there? Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock. Keep the animal quiet. Another storage room. Quiet. Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer. Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone. He's right. Follow me. Get back! Now! Stop! Shut them up! Keep the light up. I can't see. Not yet. Let's try the fork to the left. Hard to read in this light. The ink is so faded. I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display. You have to. Do it now! He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot. Call him, Margo. I have to shoot. Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it! I don't believe it. What? We're not going to make the storage room! It's coming. Run. Oh God! Help! It's deceptively simple. Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse. How? For what? Then it won't go after the others? It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean? What happened? It's scared of me. Hide quickly! No. The planetarium is in the next cell. This is one of the fire doors... Vince! That was D'Agosta. You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger. But what can we do? Our guns are useless -- But this isn't the jungle! This is New York. How did it get here? A thing like that crossed two continents. It makes no sense! I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish. Like nothing I ever saw. I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that. No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light. Gone. No. I think I'm hallucinating. We need someone to take us to the secure storage area. Genetic damage? What was it? They're all heavily armed. Dr. Green... All right. If you're positive. Where did you see it? I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up. What happened? All right. I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps. Where would we find it? Would you mind showing it to me? I don't think so. I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun. Did Whittlesley's monster have claws? Something came up in autopsy tonight. Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw. What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one? What happened? A monster? Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for? You were afraid of him, weren't you? I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley. Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times. I also found a record of your restraining order. You were going to be married. You loved him. The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten. Just like Beauregard. One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision. The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact. Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims. Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. That boat washed up in my district. Everyone on board was killed. You have time to talk? Maybe not. No. I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley. How does it work? Special Agent Pendergast. FBI. Forgive me. I guess I was snooping. What is this?
