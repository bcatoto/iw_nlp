I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape. No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice. You know exactly where they are! The case was stolen? The case..with the stones... Where is it? What're you laughing about? At your service. Appipulai Leeloo Minai.. You are a monster, Zorg! Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another. They are robots! No thank you. ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it. Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you. ...Why on earth do the stones interest you? I remember you now..the so called art dealer. ...We're saved! That's what I'm saying. Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work. Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work! Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite? Leeloo's in trouble? You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause. What are you doing? Of course. We have to save the world. We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission.. I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston. It means, "Never without my permission". She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip. Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over! Thank you so much for your help Mr...? She's an exception.. Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins.. There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it! This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect! He's a she! The girl? Who are you? That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her? Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations. What are we going to do? Thank you, Mr. President. White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity. Yes..thank God.. And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it. We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions. Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important. Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL. Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose! It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here! Where's Leeloo? Good work, my son. Now all we need is a way to get there. Perfect. There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names... Yes. Of course.. Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know. Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves! The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!! I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part! It's a miracle!!!You're all safe. Thanks be to God! On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one. I got it! Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel! They really made her... I didn't know your size. Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time.. What's she doing? Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being? Father, will you please explain what's going on? What is?Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare.. So, just how big was this fare? Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here. In your dreams! See you tonight! How many points you got left on your license? You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive. How do I look? Don't exist bud. You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there. Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing. I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training. Hey bud! Finger here.When EVIL returns so shall we. Time is of no importance, only life is important. When mankind comes to its senses. We will return. Take them and put them in a safe place.And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying? There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light. Don't tell me you don't know how all this works? When is she not in trouble? Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo. Trying to save your ass so you can save the world. Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks. Good luck.. What kind of mission? Is that the usual way priests go on vacation? That's what I thought. Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat? I know. I was there when she arrived. I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better? Dallas. Korben Dallas. They all like this in your family, father? So you do know her. You noticed... I brought the girl remember? She dropped in on me... holding this. She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here. Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest. I'm sorry, but... the Stones... Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again. I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time! I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are! ...So Cornelius was telling the truth! Leeloo... is... she's... Who? Leeloo.. 5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect.. Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist.. Hello? Uh... at least fifty. Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!! I don't need one. Like shit. I just found a picture of you. I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one. At least, the cat comes back. I was talking to the cat. Yeah? Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter? ...What's your name? I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured... Vito Cornelius? You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor. It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive. ...'Scuse me? ...Ma??? Hello? ...Not yet. Yeah? Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me. All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly.. I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about? Other than that... You all right? Yes ma.. Hi Ma... ...Hello? Found it? Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate? I'm sorry.. Thanks for reminding me.. I had the worst goddamn nightmare. How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I didn't. Is that all? Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!! What did you say? What did you do? Solid little jobs, aren't they? Fuck it! Hold tight! It's like a cab isn't it? I'll be right back. Not without Leeloo. We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader. Six to the left. One to the right. You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it? Yeah, very big, a giant. I don't think this is a good time... I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own. I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal? Uh... not really. ...Hi. Oh, yes you will... ...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back. I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished. She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please... It's my wife. ...Shit! One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive. I'm not going. You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet? I've had enough good news for today And the third one? Just one... why me? Where have I heard this song before? What mission? I love you... Because... Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight! Exactly. You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things... Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it! You can sleep tomorrow... come on... It's up to you now, Angel! I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones. Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work? I told you not to read all that crap! Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say? The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long. It's difficult. I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate. No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful! Where you going? You noticed.. You get that off the screen? Here we go again... Uh... Apipoussan? I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need. You learned 900 languages in five minutes?! Which one? Finished what? Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience.. Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is! Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos... Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you. It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better. Oh god! You hear that? Uh..you're welcome. I suppose that means "Hi" ? At least I won lunch. The last two messages I got? The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife. I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news. You're welcome.. You gotta push the little yellow button... You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded.. Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model? Been here long?Yeah... then I sighed... like this. Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing! Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure. I don't even know what I'm looking for! You know how to fly this thing? Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here? Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think? He's on vacation. Got it... I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me... ...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose? Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams... My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here! Crystal. ...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates. And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service? Does it get any better or what!Thanks.. It's not? Uh.. Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow! The cash man!Three of us will never fit in there! I thought you were divorced. What is it? Why not? Old tricks are the best tricks eh? You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets. Don't you open your messages? You're the only one left alive... Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated. Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission. You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'? To save the world. Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance. Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center. This thing solid? Wonderful! Is there any danger? Some kind of virus? Sounds like a freak of nature to me. Talk English Doc. Have you identified it? This is all that survived? They just landed in the desert. Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one. The-Stones weren't aboard the ship. I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father. Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop? You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards. But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here? Is there anything that can stop it? And then? That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready. Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now! One more reason to shoot first eh? How much time is left? I want your best man on this! ...What do you mean? And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage? Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it? Gentlemen? Recommendations. Options. What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is. I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General. Is that better? Staedert, do you read me?We will be ready, Lord. Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries! Will the elements be gone now forever from this place? The Fifth Element... Drink! Then let us toast to your fame! Here Billy.. Only too well... here you must be parched.. Amen.. Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..To fame.. salud.. A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous. Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications. "..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."...I can't wait to be among you. How's our deal coming along? Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg? ...Not far, now. Am I disturbing you?Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy.. You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch! How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure! Not going to open?6... 5... 30 seconds... This is a police control action.. You have nine points left on your license.. Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4... Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..I know... Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years. Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same business! ...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. So full of..life! Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass. ...would you like a drink? Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain... Why? What's wrong with me? Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me... I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones? Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again I'm fucked! I'm not at the hotel! Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine. Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone. How's that? Can you hear me better now? The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally! Fine, just fine! I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now. But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled. Got it. Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last! No... not at all. Where are you?
