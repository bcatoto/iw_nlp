An hour, two at most. The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder. Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it. Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six. Good luck to you, Rose. I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose. Hurry, Rose. Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right. What? You have to get to a boat right away! Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats? Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. The ship will sink. About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here. But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled. Thank you, Rose.That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it. Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory. You see this? Right here? Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help. Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.I told you you wanted to take this call. Rose Calvert. No, trust me, you want to take this call. There's a satellite call for you. The partners want to know how it's going?I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her. We're too late. I make my own luck. Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance. Come on. We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... ...isn't letting any men in at all. This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her. It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book. She knows. All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late. Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath. It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship. Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. Mind your step. You're precious to me, Rose. What do I tell your mother? Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you -- Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat? Not the better half. Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on. That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back... ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other. Search him. You will never behave like that again! Do you understand? Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting. I had hoped you would come to me last night. It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the -- Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats. Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do? You wanted to see the propellers? An accident?! What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?! He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap. Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money. I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck. I always win, Jack. One way or another. Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning. You're a good liar. Get in... hurry up, it's almost full. There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us. Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come. Just a soupcon of lemon... ...it improves the flavor with champagne. This should be amusing. Good. Settled then. I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?The boats are all going. I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine. You know somebody? You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!! Capito?? I go to America!! Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!! What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --Oy, mate... that was a close shave. Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same. Cor... look at that, would ya. Well I can. You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.Almost as good as you. I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch. No thanks. I'm heading back. No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much. Can I bum a cigarette? Sure. Count me in. We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy? How you two doin'? Of course not. That's not the point. Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you! Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!! 'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys! Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time... Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. Sorry Fabrizio. Never let go. You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise. Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me. You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me? No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it. Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized... I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything. Right. Get in the boat, Rose. We'll find out. I'll wait here. You have to go for help. So... how did you find out I didn't do it? See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one. That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't! This is horseshit. Right. Now it's worse. It's bad. It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay. Looks okay. I don't see anything. This is crazy. It's okay. I'm alright. Are you nervous? Where to, Miss? Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh! Pretty tough for a valet, this fella. He does landscapes. What is it? A sapphire? Should I be expecting him anytime soon? Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. Hey... Monet! Sssshh. Come here. You're right. Only you can do that. I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out. No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright. Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and -- That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven. Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address. You're not one of them. There's been a mistake. Just move with me. Don't think. You're still my best girl, Cora. Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin. I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it. They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely. Sure. If you like. Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff. Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing. Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece. I'm sorry. Really... I am. You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar. You wouldn'ta jumped. I see you. No, no! Just with her hands. She had beautiful hands. Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off. Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. Just some sketches. Well, I guess I will tonight. It is that simple. So don't marry him. So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella. Is he your boyfriend? That penguin last night, is he one of them? Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead. That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out. You're welcome. Rose. Well, here you are. Jack. That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down. So, you got a name by the way? Uh, yes. Of course. After you. Hello again. I've got you. I won't let go. I'm Jack Dawson. That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship. Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here. Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the -- Ever been to Wisconsin? Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold. I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you. You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand. No you won't. Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ! They're a bloody sight warmer than we are. Bollocks.How much time? The pumps -- That's right. Excuse me. We've struck ice. I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in. No, but we're making excellent time. And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful. Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller. Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
