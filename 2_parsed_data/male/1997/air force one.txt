cross it... The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out. Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them? Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up. Do you see the maintenance panel?Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here. Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control. Lemme take a look. Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in. We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way. Stay cool. Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it? Two and three are heading toward the Boeing. Who's flying the fucking plane? Put your pilot on. Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here. Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.I prefered the terrorists. This doesn't make sense. That kid's name was Jim Marshall. We don't know that.The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise. Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be. Representative Taylor is working on a compromise. It was a good ad-lib, sir. Sir, you threw out page two.That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice. They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel. They aren't answering their hails. Walter, if you have a point, make it. Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands. He's dead then. They must have killed him. To swear you in as President. Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying. Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard. I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff. We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace. General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.My loyalty was never to my country. Because it is my duty. Yes, Mr. President. That's affirmative. Roger. Air Force One, acknowledged. tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP. About goddamn time. Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia. Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq. We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left. Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior. Well it worked. why did they do that? We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for. Nine. Dead. Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet. They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights. Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails. The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.Ga get it. Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots. Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over. Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs. Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One. This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard. We copy. Stand by... Tower? Stand by. Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.You are a resilient man, Mr. It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality. That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school? Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means? So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age. You must be tired. It'll wake you up. No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe. The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and... refuels in mid-air. Call the White House. Where are we now? We're not going to make it. Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs. How? Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us. Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable. A secret service agent. It must be. Who did this? Any of us? How many others killed? The rest of the secret service? We've already been inspected. Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell. How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell? And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell. Please tell me your name. Thank you. And all these rooms here? A dubious distinction, no? This is a remarkable aircraft. Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you in person. You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things. Three... Four... The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children. You will be the first to pay for that mistake. Say something dear. Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here. So is this. Come now, you're upsetting the little one. But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people. I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary. Yes Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night. I know he left you behind. Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand... Now, or he dies, please. Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day. Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die. No you won't. You'll compromise... like always. If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down. There goes your ride. The taste of defeat is bitter, no? You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness. You were a hostage to everyone else long before you were a hostage to Good. Good. You'll do it? Pity. Mr. Gibbs. Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release. No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs. Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.Finally, we can bargain. Madame Vice president. We have an options paper. chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks. Twenty minutes? Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.Sir, we stay with the President. Yes, sir. Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide. We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane... Gravity. The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage. Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.Okay, I'm slowing us down. It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay. How you doing, sweetie? Alice... I... Alice! How `bout a hug for the old man. How was... ...the ballet? Hey, you guys back already? It's cut. Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here. Got it. Sluggish... I think it's jammed too. No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding. Uh, we got a problem here. How we doing, Colonel? Got it. I'm doing what I can. He's busy being dead. You read my mind. U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One. An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in. Put together a score sheet. I'll make some calls. Thanks. Wrote it last night. Goddamn right I did. I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit. What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib? You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore. Why? Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this? Hold on, Alice. Let my daughter go or I'll take you out! One thing I've learned as Someday, you'll regret my nature. Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone. Stop. This administration does not negotiate with terrorists. She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me. Over my dead body. That isn't necessary. I'll not going without my family. Got it. Get `em ready. You... come with me. They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries. We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back. Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there? Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me. They've gotta be joking. Flying the plane. Call Petrov... I'll be back. Please... don't start with me. Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer. Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign. This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval. I'll make it up to you, I promise. I wish it were that easy... I miss you. And I miss her. You know what? And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule. What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man? She's a big girl. She understands. Rose, I don't have time for this. Can't it wait? Someone should give you a raise. White House Situation room. No good. I said they disabled the communications system. Excuse me? Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood? You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target. Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway. Did they say anything about my family? But... Where's my family? What's going on? No. no. no. Wait. Wait. Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the.... You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone. Don't cut me off. This is an emergency. This is the President. Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there? We're hooked. Hove into position. DO YOU SEE TEEM? They better. Fuel's almost gone. Twenty-five years. Shit. Iraq? Shep, you're fired. My god. I think that was a MiG. Shepherd. I never left. Where's my wife and daughter? Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right? Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation. That's my job. I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please. Did we tape the Duke game? It's bait. Don't take it. Right... Christ I'm tired. Do me a favor and keep me away from the press. This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee. Besides, Shep, I told you... I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns. I might still have a few chips left. No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say? I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.You're pointing a gun at me. Scared. We're scared. I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office. Maria... Maria Mitchell. Here's a press kit. I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews. Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center. I guess it depends on your perspective. You don't know the half of it. Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation? We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary. Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth. We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations. We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to. The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you. Now if you're all cleared? You can follow me then.Two... THREE. GO! One. We're handling it, sir. We're under attack.WE'RE HOOKED! IT'S OPEN! Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment. How long's it been since you flew, sir? Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq. A MiG? Where the hell are we? Sir... Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board? Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room. Yes, sir. You give me ulcers. We'll just say it was in bad taste. Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television. You can't afford to leave that hanging. Other way around, sir. We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge. The second amendment types'll love that. With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch. He and the NRA don't like the wording. You wanna knock of f? CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch.Copy, Air Force One. Tower, here. Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower. Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over. Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.The Chief Justice? What on earth for? If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage. If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission. They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means? Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike. But they start executing hostages in Can we do that? Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean? I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel. Yes. You've made yourself quite clear. You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads. Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes. Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution? But this is different, sir. You're the President. and if that means negotiating... They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
