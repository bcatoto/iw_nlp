Ha-ha! Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition! Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to... Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it? Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me? No it isn't! You're dead! Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit! AHHHHHHH! Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight? Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that. Hope I didn't hurt him too bad. Yeah. Apparently. It's all in the tongue. Another bottle? What a coincidence, I am someone! Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too. Oh God. Shit... Okay. Be careful. These tunnels must loop around and connect. Right. Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers. Whoa... What does it say? It's making me hungry. God. I can't believe it. Really. Didn't even have to ask. Where? No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal? Shake a paw? I couldn't do it. Not to you. What...? What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh? That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it! It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me. Fuck me... Yeah. French fries... What the fuck!? You too!? Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch. Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go. I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux. Shit. What have I done? Stall them! I'll meet you out back. Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be. I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this. I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit. A cure? You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit. What?! He told you? When? I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf. I don't... I... I can't remember... No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second... Hello? Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that. Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling? Serafine... This looks familiar... That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard. Wait, I know this... A votre sante. Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing... So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with? Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick! It's okay. I can see fine. What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour? My treat? Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you! I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower! Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists. Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look. I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium. The planet earth. It's good to be back. Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit. Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence... Serafine...? So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting. Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something... Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir. Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up. In an underground club? I'd like to see that. And who's Claude? Like an underground club? Medusa... What's this? some kind of club? Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day. Hey, Sorry if I was out of line. What? Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately? Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you? Sure. I can follow that. You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita. Yeah, that's the word. And you are? Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone - Shit! No... I... There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God... It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes! GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!! FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!! Looks like he lied to you too. Ha. Some wonder drug... You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself! Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away. Sure. Don't you? Hey, I'm new here, what do you want? So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out? Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up. Claude...? Bullshit! You're bluffing! You'll never get the chance. Or else what? You'll kill me? He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin... My uncle's in a coma you moron! Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this... What about me? But... I don't remember anything, I swear... This is... it's like a sick joke, I - Oh no... no.... Oh shit... No... What?! You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much? It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper. Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something... Because Gaston was after it. Uncle Terrence. Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people. Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM? What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News... Why the fuck would I do that? Not you too - Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him. Yeah? Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off? What? Psychic awareness. Right. Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous - I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew. Claude. Uncle Terrence, you're... Where is it! Please! The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?! I went to St. Severin church. Now look - Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM? Sort of... Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence - Uncle Terrence? Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower. And what about you? Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death. Shit. I feel sick. What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise... Alright. Let me write a letter. Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell! Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me! Not that I know. Why would he pick this one? Yeah. I guess so. Did he say anything? Before the coma? I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle? Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws. What do you mean, maniacs? Legume? You mean, a vegetable? Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die? Jesus... Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What? That's McDermott, but yeah.Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go. Enough. Cut him loose. Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive? Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands? Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power! I told him it wasn't ready... That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death. Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation. Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it... It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to. I don't believe we've been introduced. "Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed." These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper. You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too. My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon. You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild. Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate. Andy... He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time. You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep? The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness. It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known. I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy. Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha. No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting. God, well don't let him go! Catch him! Serafine? Is that you? What's going on? Allo?Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did. Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who - It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine! Pull over! Now! You on drugs? Huh? Okay, what the hell are you up to? "Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America? Hey! You shouldn't be down there!Yes sir. But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable. Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert. Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.Nothing's happening! Why isn't it doing anything!? Cure!? Ha-ha-ha! Another step and he's dead! Do you think I'm an idiot? What's the problem? If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions? The ADM. Let's go. And you call me a moron... What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance? Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies! No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend! Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM! Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else! Before the coma! Bullshit! Your uncle told you! Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it? In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul� d'Americain.My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that. But that would be illegal... I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie. I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you. Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh? He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow. That's not all... Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you. We know you were with her. You recognize her? I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy! I told you. These murders are not normal. I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth - Now! I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red. What did she say? What've you got? What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you? You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris? You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful. Two more nights in this lunar cycle. Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least. Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy. Well? Here. Merde.Either way works for us... Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look... Merde! I can't believe this! Tell you what, we'll jump together. Also like sex with my wife. Just like sex with my wife. Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says... An eye for an eye... Merde! Just missed! Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you. Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture? Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre! Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's - Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing. But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go. Good man. Now can I have my arms back? No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you! What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh? I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I. Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help. I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious? Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness. Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land. Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new - Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas. Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know... No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume. How well did, er, do you know him? He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better. This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues... Andrew Mc-dair-mo? You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance? Saint Severin... Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo. Double merde. Merde. Okay. So maybe you were right. Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while? He says -I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you? Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business. AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH! Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there! The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it? Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell. Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I? Andy? Andy is that you?
