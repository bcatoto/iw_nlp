Justin? Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you? ...do you copy? You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins. I can see why they sent you along. I heard it. I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker... Will it work? ...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before. Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark. But Justin... The containment, Second Containment... We have a man down... I'll be all over it. ...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on... From what? ...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...! You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that... Time to play Spam in the can. Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in. Solid as a rock. Hey, Smith... We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole. We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU. You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix. Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me. What? You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record? I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!" I'm telling you, I saw it... You weren't there. I saw it. It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal... Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this? Coffee. Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee? What...? I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon. I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead. Can you shut it down? How? The Bridge is gone. Let me breathe, let me breathe... What's happening? Is that an offer?Please... kill... Please... What happened? No. I don't believe in that sort of thing. But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen... And what it's brought back with it. It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell." Do you hear it? Right there. It gets worse. They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself." I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation. No. "Another man?" Who? He'll live... if we ever make it back. To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep. Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement... His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all. We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated... Trauma. One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out... Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood... He's crashing... Pressure? What's wrong? A power drain -- What's wrong?Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors. It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day. That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible. Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage. We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew... I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes. I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle? I want our best people on this. Where's Miller? It's been two years since she died. He's over it. What's on your mind? That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship. You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein. It's not that simple. Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.I think I found something... Holy shit... I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing. Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here. I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man. So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened? That means top-secret, Cooper. Ballast. Oh my god OH MY GOD... From the Other Place... ...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left. The dark inside me. It won't stop, it goes on and on and on... I'm going in. I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge... We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour. How do you know all this? But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please... ...I don't want to die...! Skipper, you gotta help me... Almost done, I just gotta check one thing... Yes, sir! Everything green on my boards, Skipper.The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four. Some things you don't get over. He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it. And then there's his wife. Does he know that? The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss. You're not seriously considering sending him? Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response. The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years. Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes. I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this. Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures. Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks. You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives. On my way. I'll get him. Hold on, Coop... Coop, where are you... You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens... You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years? EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak. This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway? Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer -- Don't start with me, Cooper. Oh God... Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I... Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor. DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead. "Save yourself. From Hell." What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed? Hear what? It's not a distress call. It's a warning. Go on. What is it? I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of. And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide. Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things. I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close. We'll make it. I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers. Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared. How is he? No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers. And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why. He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ... Justin. I won't let you die. You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright? Justin. Patch me through to him. Justin, finish your sweep. Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on. Start the countdown. Thanks. Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us. That's a negative, Starck. Do it. Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan... Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers. ...you okay? Peters... Can anybody hear me... ...how's the client? Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters... Alive? The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here. What you got, Peters? The blood came from somewhere, Peters... Starck, you still showing those readings? Peters is right, no one's here. So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan? Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze. Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark. I am sorry. But now we have to go to work. I put in for a replacement for you but no one... What's the hold up? You can't have them. Go to hell. Starck... Cooper... You're lying...! Then what, what are you? Tell me... You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit! What are you? Then who the fuck are you? If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too. What are you talking about? Your eyes... Son of a bitch! Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home. Watch me. We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed. Fuck this ship. It's done. Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is. Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark. "...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us. We're leaving. That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor. The "Other Place," what is that...? Where has it been for the past seven years? To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it? You said this ship creates a gateway... That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit! I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock. Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know." Do it. We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time. We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad. We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it. What the hell is that? Dr. Weir? Explanation? It's 2041... What about it? You have something, Dr. Weir? Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men. No one goes near that thing. I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits. If it worked. It's insane. How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core? What could cause them? What's in the Core? Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?" One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him. Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock. They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward. Negative. Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep. I can see that, what're they for? Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright? -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is! I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job. Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board -- Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge. Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster. What does it say? Where has it been for the last seven years? Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way. Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why. The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks. Smith? Smith! Fuck! Get out of there now! Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock. One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark. Smith, get out of there... What is it, Smith? Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her. Now what? Thank you. Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly. That's enough! We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air. I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark? You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me? No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks? Do we have enough time for a weld? Smith, where the hell have you been?! Starck, give me a read. Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby? Starck... Where is it? I noticed. Starck, anybody home? Dr. Weir...! I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady. What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?" We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out... Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening... ...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees... What is that? I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in? He's dead... ...repeat, we're armed... We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow... No. I'll be right back. We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put... BLOW THE FUCKER UP. Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place. Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir. Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can! I'm on my way, Starck. Stay here! Don't stop working! What? What's going on in there, Starck? I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about. What I want is to survive the next ten hours. If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time? Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible. We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories... To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive? Go ahead. "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me? What is it, Starck? Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something... No. It was someone else. Do it. Dr. Weir... Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found. So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions? What's causing the readings? What about the life readings you picked up? We can take the filters from the Clark... Carbon dioxide? How much oh-two do we have? But you can breathe it. Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought. Everybody okay? Keep your eyes open. Radiation interference? Come around to three-three-four... Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go! And Cooper... Put some pants on. Starck, why aren't you on the bridge? Let's go. Justin?Roger that. It's holding... She's holding...! What about the accumulator...? You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down. You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel. I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you. Where is it, where is it... No, no, we just got her back together... Come again, Skipper? I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark. Skipper... She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere. Captain, we got a problem. Sir. ...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew... Understood. I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time. Captain Miller, you copy? But... They're gone. We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead. We don't have time to fart. We have a situation here... Captain Miller... It is now. We're locked in. Love to. Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit! 1500 meters. We're getting too close... We've got some weather. Yes, sir. Something like that, yeah. That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know... We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop. One-four degrees... Heading three-three-four... Jesus... Locked and cocked. Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out... I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked. What? The safety circuit's failed! What the hell is that? Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber... Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker... Dead ahead, 5000 meters. Hey... I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship... Get them back -- Explosive decompression. Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off... 1000 meters... Range 3000 meters and closing. Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this... You can't do that. 30 hours to Neptune orbit. I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion. I don't know what happened to Justin. Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible... No, he didn't. The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now. No, thank you. What? Thank you. A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them. It's the Event Horizon. She's come back. Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax? You wanted to see me, Admiral? That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering. Background radiation. Perfectly safe. You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side. I built it. ...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal. It's called a gravity drive. Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship. The crew? Could they still be alive? This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all! The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream. I have to go. I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle. This is Weir. NOOO! I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me. There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING. Better if I just show you. I'm not the Devil. You know. Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller? Weir is dead. What makes you think I'll miss? Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is? It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil. It's a liberating experience. I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see. I told you... She won't let you leave... You can't leave. She won't let you. You... You can't do that! What about my ship? Don't... don't do this... You're insane. You've lost your mind. You can't, your orders are specific... I DON'T KNOW! I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time. I don't know... I don't know... Yes... What do you want me to say? Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations -- Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane. I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain. Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries. The Core...! I don't know. Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible... Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened... The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead. Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years. The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034. The date. There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control. If it worked, yes. "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day... It's complicated... It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark. Yes. It beats dying, Mister Smith. No one? Any survivors? Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead. In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat. You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering. That is not acceptable -- Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship... Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure... That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there. NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message... That's what we're here to find out. It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive. And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace. Until now. I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space. Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity... Captain Miller, I just want to say... Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge? No. I saw nothing. Can you see a body? Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that? You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew? They're explosive charges. Claire... Wasn't that ship destroyed? He's been past Mars? Yes. Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith. It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support. We're losing atmosphere... That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship. Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer? She's not ugly. Where is she? Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here... ...to "point B," here. Now: what's the shortest distance between two points? It means nothing. The forward airlock. I'm alright. Please. It wants me. I have to go. No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years. Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now. Yes. Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all. That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light. What is it? Ship's log. Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan? Do they have pressure? Wrong. The shortest distance between two points... Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity... Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
