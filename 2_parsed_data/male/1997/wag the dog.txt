What do you know about them? Yes. Well, I'm working on it.... Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject. You wanna change this subject, you better have a War. What do you need? It's gotta be quick , it's gotta be dramatic , you got to have an enemy . Okay? What do you need in an enemy? Somebody you fear. Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know. Shifty . Who knows anything about em... Why not , what've they ever done for us ...? Also: they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber ... ...that's the general idea. What did they find out about the Gulf War? One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of Legos . Who's gonna tell'em. The American "people"? Who would find out? What's it gonna cost? We aren't going to have a war.

Would you do it again ...? In't that why you're here? I guess so . N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against? Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who? Sweden and Togo ? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against? That time has passed . It's passed . It's over . The War of the Future is Nuclear Terrorism . It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments , have blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared . You have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the future , and if you're not gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will fall. N'you're gonna be out in the street. And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you: you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life," well, Chuck, this is your way of life. Innit? And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting. And there ain't no war but ours. Would you go to War to do that? Why do they go to War? Why do people go to war? I have a question for you. Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents. But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick. And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same. Your country and your job. What are you interested in? S'only got to hold for another few days. Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you. My name is Ronald Brean. Course there's a war. I'm watching it on Television. Then show a little spunk. There Is no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing... Where'd you go to school, Kid. Wellesly? What do you think? What I need from you: I need a base of operations. Some place in the District. I need some clean money ... Well, that's what we're doing here... Earn your money. ...He's ill, the Plane is sick... ...you the Press Office? This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny. And, to hold it together, I need two days. There is no B-2 Bomber: here's what you do ahout that: whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?" "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested." "Deploy the B-2, Why ?" "In the Crisis." That's what I'm telling you. The two things: the two things: Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed. And the B-2 Bomber... Clear me a space. Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. TIMES , You're goddamn right. And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. Alright, now, here: he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow. When's he coming back...? But you always knew you couldn't take the credit.... No, the deal isn't changed. The Deal isn't changed. You can't ... what is it? Money? Money ? You want Money? Stanley. Stanley... you knew the... Stanley. You knew the deal when you signed on . No, I don't think you can do that, Stanley... No, I don't think you can do that. What're you doing? A proud tradition. No. You're right.

What am I gonna do? I'm gonna "Fade Away." What are you gonna do? Ain't that the truth. Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he might , but why take a chance? Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em vote for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain. Make them pay for him.

We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there are no nuclear devices on the Canadian border. There are no nuclear devices in Albania. Z'at put us in something of a pickle? Albania has no nuclear capacity. Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland. The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border. The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening. There is no War. Quite touching. I know who you are, Mr. Ames. Guess who I am. I have. To preserve their Way of Life.

Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens I say "courage." I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform you , that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn. I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe." Ladies and Gentleman, we will not treat him like an Old Shoe, we...

It falls to me to reveal to you a secret . To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and women , trained and pledged their strength , their skills , and, if called upon, their lives , in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three... But that group has been, in the main, subdued. Now: How did we come by this information? And. Who subdued that group? From whence did it come? Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents. Of Armed and Violent Dissidents... The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled. We are in contaot with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government credits his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and has not. That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.WHERE'S MY FUCKING PIIIILLLLLLL ...? ...where is my pill? Where's my pill...? "...where's my pill..."
