Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place. We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can. Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey? For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later. You're all through with this now? Who knows you have these? Is Sandy part of this? Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved? Okay? Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift. Jeffrey! Come on in. It's blue. blue velvet. Blue. It's Blue Velvet. I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance. Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you. Yes. The criminals are winning. Okay. If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures. Jeffrey? And it's horrible too. I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand. I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business. Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy. Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more. But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't. Come into the study a minute. Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way. By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it? Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it. You did? A human ear? Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he? Yes.We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.

Oh yeah?. Have you seen any? Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house? Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on? No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry. Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed. Yeah. How's Dad? I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have. Oh my God. Is her son OK? Does Dorothy know her husband is dead? Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment. Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!! Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom. Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!! Yes sir. Only you. and the photo lab. No. not at all. I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and. . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this. Yeah. Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you. What color is it? What is this? What color is it? Yeah. I get it. Why do you do it? I guess you've seen some bad things. Is that why you say it's horrible? Anything you can tell me? These are beautiful. How's the case coming? Yes? It must be great. I understand. I'm just real curious like you said. Excuse me, Mrs. Williams. Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did. Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store? Are you Detective Williams? I promise, Dorothy. I promise. Don?. Where is he? Who, Dorothy? Shh. I'll tell you. It's okay. it's okay. Yeah, it's me. Oh no. You look beautiful to me. What? I'll call you. I think I better go. I guess I should go. No. not really. but also because I really want you to be alright. Yes. You called me Jeffrey. Dorothy. no! I'm glad you do. There's no disease, I can tell you. You. what? I didn't mean to hurt you. No. it's not Don. Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! Sometimes I think I do. Do you love me? Look, snap out of it, will ya? Come on Dorothy. Shut up. Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone. That wouldn't be too good, would it? Yes. No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you. . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police. What do you want? Whatiya mean? I'm doing it. Sure I do. That's good. I sure don't hate you. Frank is coming? I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy. Hello. No. I should go. Yes. I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.? No. But you're in very big trouble. Who is Don? No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble? No. Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble? There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it. Nice guy. Who's he? Frank? .can you stand up? . same here. That's not crazy. I like you too. . I. uh. Hi. can I come in? O.K. Don't say that. Then don't talk about killing. Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. No. What is happening? No. Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!! What was it? What? Yes, I like you. No. please. I won't. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's okay. It's okay. No. I'll go then. Nothing. Are you alright? No. Yes. I . I don't know. Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave. No. Come on. Never before this. Then you got undressed. Well. You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more. . I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed. I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. Nobody. I wanted to see you. Jeffrey nothing. Jeffrey. That oughta do it. Nope. it's new stuff. no smell. Pest control. gotta do your apartment. Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there? Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me? He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue. Yes. Nothing. What? Here's to Ben. Heineken. On a ride. I don't want to go. No thanks. Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here. Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me. Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now. ... Sandy?. I should go with her, Sandy. OK. Let's get her over to your father's. No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house? Yes. Dorothy! ... Dorothy! Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you. My father has a gun at home. Frank!! You want to dance? Let's wait for some slow one. Really. you want to dance with someone else? I can't dance fast. I like that idea. that's a real good idea. ... You look beautiful. I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime. Where to? Nothing. really! It's good to see you. Just some fatherly advice. Okay. Okay. great! No. Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on? Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble. You worry about me really? Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much. I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret. Yeah. Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove? That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today? You want to go talk to him? I'm really sorry. See ya tomorrow. Okay. okay. Can I give you a kiss good night? Okay, Sandy. I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay? I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera. Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl. Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.? That's what I thought. That doesn't bother you, does it? Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know. Yes. . Actually. I've been in twice. I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble. . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man. No way. I'm about to blow up. I'm sorry, I didn't. What's with Mike? Well. Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean? Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved. That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay? Okay. thanks. Are you sure? Yeah. Look. it can wait till Sunday. Oh, okay. can I call? I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went. Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit. Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay? It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car? Why not? Here's to. an interesting experience. Two. I'd like an ice-cold Heineken. Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there. First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment. Okay. You better get out before someone sees us. Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good? First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings. I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder. Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that. You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight? Pretty clever. Are you game for more? Yeah. I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh? Yes and no. Did you recognize him? Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened? Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner. Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name? Let's go. Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright? Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think? Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window. Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later. Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan? There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe. I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon. I don't want to cause any trouble. I'd like to talk to you about something. You hungry or thirsty, or both? Yeah. Good bye. Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you. I don't know. he moved away. It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father. I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world. I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice. You really do hear a lot, don't you? Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything? Did they find out anything when they questioned her? Where are they? I guess you have to get back home soon? It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in? The ear is from a missing person maybe? Were all these people questioned this afternoon? Do you know who was brought in for questioning? Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything? What do you know about the ear?. anything? I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital. What else is new?. right? How is Central these days? No. You're not bothering me. You a senior? Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something. Oh yeah? Yeah, how did you know? Good deal Dad. How ya doin' Dad? It's good to see you, Dad. Are you feeling okay? Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good. Hi Dad. Nothing. I'm fine. God. you scared me. Can I use the car tonight? No, I'm just gonna walk around. I'm going out for awhile. Thanks a lot, Mom. What? Yeah? Well. Okay. What time are visiting hours? Be right down. This is it. For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term. Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed. Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much. No. you're right. Well. No. Sandy? ...Sandy, please. Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes? That sounds great! Say "goodnight" to Sandy. Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake. Yeah. Yeah. okay. No. No thank you. Yeah, I know. Alright. I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go. Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE! Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins? I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered. I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense. Looks like you'd make a good runner. Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house. Come on out a minute, okay? Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute? I don't know why we have to watch T.V. What are watchin' this junk for? Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better. Good to see you, son. uh uh. uh uh. Hey Jeff.There ya go. Right here Frank. You want me to pour it? Okay Frank.Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you. He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby. Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs. He's comin' back?. What for? Bull. Frank gone?
