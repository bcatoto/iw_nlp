There I was, passing the wine, passing the bread, I suddenly felt like the priest at Masst Or maybe Mass started out as a wine tasting, and Jesus was a salesman. what do you think? He goes into -- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf? He throws away some of the glasses. Duboeuf has a nose and a palate -- like a gift from God. He can taste a single grape before the harvest... and describe the beaujolais it's going to produce. She laughs. You know how many bottles I have in this store? Open any one of 'em, I'll tell you the vintage and vintner, b lindfolded. He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties. She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band. She whips them over his eyes. He laughs. Victoria's Secret 95. She passes her glass under his nose. Gabriella, I picked these wines. All I can smell is your perfume. She laughs. I even bought it for you. She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers her breast to the glass and then to his mouth. Beychevelle '83. Lot of body. Very aggressive. He pulls off the panty blindfold, kisses her on the mouth softly, then fully. It means something to me. Oh, yeah... We're pretty good. He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting room. You think you're gonna steal my car, asshole? The younger man whirls around. You scared me, man. A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from behind the wheel. This is not your car, sir. This car belongs to the Star Leasing Company. Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a higher wattage than the security lights. I can collect either the money or the car. Given how much you owe, I figure it's the car. The younger man has almost hacked through the chain. Pop the. trunk. We inventory the property at the yard. He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as soon as the exit is clear. I just want to show you something. Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the still-running car. What are you doing? The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk. Do you drink? Not on the job. What is this, booze? Two cases of single malt whiskey aged in the barrel before he was born. The Caddy's overdue. So are you. Drink it with the kid. Teach him what smooth is. Enjoy yourselves. Isn't that worth a few days' breather... My accountant's a fuck-up. So am I, maybe, for not firing him. The bolt cutters clip through. The chain falls. We're clear. It's late, Jason. I'm going out tonight. Alex exhales. You can't'fish all night and work all day. Working for you doesn't exactly tax my mind. No wonder you drop bottles. Fire me. Do you do it on purpose? Fishing bought me my bike. I almost knocked it over trying to get out of the car. I wasn't sure you were coming home. Use a regular knife. This has a better edge. Feel it (pointing it at Alex, -- feel it. Their voices are rising. Pointed, it's a fucking weapon. Put it away. Hell with you. Jason exits to the stairs. And keep your voice down. Your mother's asleep. If you got home on time once in a while, maybe she could skip the chemical help. Alex is also on the stairs. You have no idea, none, zip, what goes on in a marriage. Yeah, well, I'm learning more than I want to. It's not an argument. I asked him to clean up downstairs. A modicum of cooperation, you know? A modicum. What's that. Modicum my ass. He pushes past his mother toward his own room. Suzanne follows him down the hallway, leaving. Alex behind. Then go to bed. Hey! What! Jason has gone into his room. He slams the door. I know, Mom. Whatever. She walks out. You'll like this one better. I've been so busy. We could sneak away for a week.. Would you like that? Last time was different. :. Bite... Henryl Fish ont The line screams out. Jason's ready. He sets the hook. Time to go to work, man! C'mon. scratching. HENRY, 33. He wears a red Panama hat that's Who we got? Let's find out. He hauls back on the rod, the line rises from the ocean, they both recognize the fish at the end. Fucking sharks. Miami's fished out of the good stuff. Damn. He spits over the side. Jason grins. This one's got more to worry about than you do. He starts to reel in the fish. Henry moves to the wheel.- Just shoot 'Jaws' in the water. I want to know the sucker's good and dead 'fore he sets a fin in my boat. You got a barb on that hook? . Oh, yeah. Jason braces for the fight. The Gulf, man, that's the place. And what makes you think fifty-fifty is right? My boat. My gas. My skill. (slicing off the fins) ... My fins. You cool? I'm cool. We cool. Jason guns his Ducati. Rob, has Jason shown up? A man's French-accented VOICE answers him from the store. You have his paycheck there? All ready. You no like my company? Fine. Who cares. Bring me more fin, you retire. You no want to retire? Good. Don't charge starving Chinese so much for these things. You ever caught a shark? You ever cook one? Lemme -- lemme show you something. Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display a fresh gash across his arm. He was already gaffed onto the side of the boat, good as dead. Two hours dead! And I was still too close to the mouth. Revenge is the last instinct to go, did you know that? The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint. -- Work's a dangerous thing. (smiling with lots of Jason weaves through traffic, expert enough to take chances that goose the adrenalin. Just get in the car. You stink. I washed. There's Wash IN Dries in the glove compartment. Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one, rubs his hands. ... I'm trying here, Jason -- I really am. When you didn't want to go to college, I took your side, I said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish college, and I've done all right. I gave you a job', a steady check, which is more than anybody else has done. And what do I get back? Shit. I've tried to teach you the business -- the care, the finesse... Jason laughs dismissively. Well, look at it this way, Jason, someday you'll have your boat and I'll have my vineyard, and the best part '11 be they're nowhere near each other. I'll send you a Christmas card. Save the stamp. Hi, mike -- what's the score? Dolphins down by nine, minute forty to go. It's over. Don't underestimate Marino. Mike ticks off the appointment, raises the gate. I told you, they don't have it this year. With a wave of acknowledgment for Mike, Alex.. drives onto the grounds. Judas! Grinning, Mike routinely writes down the license plate number. Wine delivery. The INTERCOM CLICKS off. They hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. The door opens. Jason's eyes focus. He's hooked. Gabriella is smiling at Alex. She has her arms full of clean burp cloths. (with a modest chuckle) How are you? She glances politely toward Jason, not at all expecting what she sees. A circuit connects between them. Gabriella takes care of Baby Reese. This is my stepson, Jason. Hi. You can wear it anywhere you like, Mrs. Reese -- except out of the country. Gabriella leads Alex and Jason aboard. Frank likes Alex and is glad to see him. Alex can't help glancing at Dina's long legs.. She smiles. Alex, should we insure the wine while we're at it? His arms tired,'Alex is happy to set down the case. Aren't you covered on your home policy? How much wine are we talking about? Jason follows Gabriella down below, the VOICES on the deck fading. Big boat. Gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him. They're both kids. The fittings are definitely -- yeah on the ugly side. But damn, she's solid. (proud, defensive) I like.boats. Gabriella shows him the climatized, built-in wine closet next to the galley. He starts to rack the bottles while she watches. He talks to stop her from leaving. So where you headed? They don't want to take the baby. You don't like them. Gabriella laughs. Doesn't have to be. Worst kind. Where's that? I don't know, I never been there. You don't seem too nuts. She laughs. -- so back to the safe it goes -- Dina lifts up the baby and smells its bottom. Dina, that's disgusting. Don't encourage her, Alex. Her mouth is big enough. Dina is hurt. (to the agent) I'll show you that painting in our stateroom. The agent follows him away. (kindly; to Dina) Do you want to see the label? She hides her hurt by not looking at him. -- when you're skimming along the water, nothing between you and the bottom of the sea but a layer of wood, your thoughts... end. All that noise inside your head? Gabriella nods, understanding exactly. . . . Stops. Dina's VOICE booms over the INTERCOM, startling both of them. The BABY is FUSSING. Gabriella makes a gesture of apology to Jason. You should come out with me sometime. She smiles without answering and goes topside. His eyes follow her. A Deckhand comes down the ladder with the remaining case of wine for him to stock. You doing up to the house, Gabriella? (off her nod) Want to take this with you? He sweeps the policies into a large manila envelope, drops the 'pouch in with them, ties the string, hands it to her. Put it on my desk. He looks at his wife with her glass, Alex with his glass, and doesn't like it. His voice hardens slightly. Are we all set, Alex? I'm going to check the storage room, see what else'll travel. I know I put some vintage Armagnac in there, maybe some Porto? He heads down the gangplank. He's a vendor, Dina. It's like drinking with the help. So I'll messenger over the rider for your signature -- Frank laughs out loud, in a better mood: -- You still here? Dina laughs, too. Did he ever come on to you? Look how beautiful you are. He's an idiot if he didn't. Now she sees the necklace. Just put it on for a minute. Look at yourself. She slaps at his hands half-heartedly, but it's so tempting. See what you deserve. into her ear) Not against your skin. He starts to pleat her T-shirt loose from her jeans. She doesn't resist. They watch each other in the mirror. Ah... shit... He hurriedly unhooks the necklace and puts it back in the pouch, gathers up the insurance papers and Polaroids that had spilled and slides them back in the envelope with the pouch.' Gabriella is tucking in her T-shirt. She closes the closet door. Jason's VOICE is closer, more impatient, at the bottom of the stairs. I was in the bathroom. He walks down the stairs. A wooden case of liquor is by the terrace doors, where he left it. Give me a hand, will you? I'm not as young as you are. Reflected in the tall entry mirror, Gabriella's back as she walks away down the hall. I'm out, I'm home. You play for the possibilities, Dave. So do I. Or else why get up in the morning. VICTOR SPANSKY neatly stacks his modest winnings. He's tall, thick-shouldered, 55, with a gray crew-cut, tinted glasses, and a smoker's cough. He does nothing in a hurry. You didn't lose that much. There's an optimist in every game. Alex, I don't appreciate -- (overriding htm, He's got peepee in his veins! Life for that guy's a habit and stained pants. You know what I mean? Dave laughs, feeling better. Try. Good night. They all AD-LIB "Good night," "See you next week," etc., as they file out. Alex and Victor are the last in the room. Alex puts on his jacket. Paltry pickings tonight. Alex looks at the small amount of cash on the table. You want to cut for what's here. Victor chuckles.. Sure. Why not. He pushes his cash forward into a pot with Alex's. Alex fans the deck across the table. What-are you doing with your life, Victor?. Victor makes a small gesture, indicating the cards. This, more or less. He pulls a card -- he has good hands -- and turns it up. A king of spades. A smile tugs at his mouth. Beat that. Alex produces the Polaroid of Dina's necklace from his inside jacket pocket. Very pretty. I remember when it was the cover of the auction catalogue. The Duchess of Windsor's baubles. Bought for a young wife, I remember. Who I'm sure worked just as hard as the Duchess. it's appraised at a million three hundred thousand dollars. a laugh. Victor tosses the photo back on the table with And they say there's no inflation. I have access. Victor shakes his head no. I'm retired. And broke. I don't need that much. Bullshit. You need as much as I do. Victor's eyes blink behind his glasses. What kind of access? For curiosity's sake. I have a friend in the house. A girlfriend. How sweet. I�can distract her. She'd never know, I don't want her to know... I like her too much. I don't trust amateurs, either.. He gets up and walks to the door. Don't take it personally,. Alex. I don't trust the phone company,, the jury system, or the Israeli government. So why should I trust you. Because I know a good thing when I see it. Alex flips over a card. It's the king of clubs. Victor... Victor has been distracted by Alex's proposition. Now he comes back to scoop up his money. Alex sweeps the cards back into a stack, leaving only the photo on the table. ... But this is fifty-fifty.. I saw the light still on. I'm glad you're up. C'mon, c'mon, be nice. I told you I was playing poker tonight. He hands her the glass. She takes a sip. I won. Let's not get into this, honey. Her voice is tired. I know -- He reaches for his wallet. I got you a new one. He holds out the card, which she slowly takes fingers. Everything's about to change. Suzanne has heard that too often from him. all the time! I am making an effort heret Did you never have a fight with his father? -- A saint. I should've guessed. Must be at the right amid of God this very minute. Suzanne doesn't bother replying. She turns off the light, pulls the sheet to her shoulders. Alex sits down on the window seat to enjoy the champagne in the dark. -- the humidifier wasn't holding a steady percentage, there may be a problem with the regulator -- so I'd better check it right away. ... Sure, this afternoon's fine. Hanging up, he rocks back in his chair and squeezes his eyes shut. Then he rests his forehead against the heels of his hands for a moment, considering what he's considering. You want to hand me down a good cognac? I'm going out to the Reeses. I'll deliver it for you. He wants to talk. He dusts off the bottle. -- not to want to take a chance, with a month away. That's what I thought. Second honeymoon. -- It may need a part replaced. --,Dina... this is not a great idea. Used to getting her way, she's not easily dissuaded. A long moment later, the door opens. Dina and Alex are reassembled, but there's a tension and a breathlessness about them Gabriella recognizes. Have a good cruise. I'll take care of this. Like it? I think I look younger, don't you? You look ridiculous. Fine. I don't have an ego. (zipping up his You want to change your mind? No. Victor opens the front door.- After you. As Alex walks toward the door, he catches sight of a free- standing hospital respirator in the bedroom. He looks at Victor, who waits for him with an unchanging smile. They go out together. -- Is your makeup melting? Offended, Victor reaches over to honk the horn. Alex stops him, opens the driver's door. Brilliant, Alex. We've violated the law before we even get started. Tell me we're at the wrong house. Alex raises a hand to wave, Victor turns. Mike, the guard, is rolling toward them on a security cart. He pulls over. There you are, Mike. Don't flip the gate like that. I was helping you out. I checked off the appointment, didn't you see it? He rings the doorbell again. They sailed out this morning. I know., but the nanny's supposed to be here -- Victor rolls his eyes, unseen. The nanny. -- The Venezuelan? They fired her. (with a snigger) Don't pay to be too good-looking in these jobs. Victor interrupts the gossip. He -sounds exactly like a repairman. I got a schedule to keep, Mr_ Gates. Is this gonna be another day? It can't wait. He'll lose his entire wine collection if the humidifier isn't fixed. What's your name? Harold Freeman. Mike notes the name "Harold" stitched onto his coveralls. Okay. Stay here. I'll get the keys. He rides away on his cart. Victor sits down in the shade to wait. He stifles a cough. Dear God. A cop on the job. You all right? (a little too sharply) Why wouldn't I be? She turns her head, and he sees that she has been crying. His smile goes. You looking for Alex? You missed him. I told her. The PHONE RINGS. Robert answers it; wine business. He's out of the conversation. So now you're in trouble. Then why've you-been crying? Congratulations. You hated it there! What's wrong with cats? So let's go get married. Gabriella looks at him. They connect.again; it scares her. You're not too much older. Are you going past the wharf? You can gimme a ride. He's already walking around the car to get in the other side. Gabriella smiles in spite of herself and reaches over to unlock the door for him. It's my lunch break.. Did you do something? Or was it just... Like they're a factory? Hang a left. I know. Just turn! She whips the car through the turn, narrowly missing another car. -- Cool. She laughs; she's starting to relax. Can you fix the thing, Harold? Or does it have to be replaced? I'll tell you after I see the condition of the pipes. Coolant might be leaking. Where's the attic access? Goddamn fiberglass -- His head drops through the hatch. -- Either of, you know how to kill the water to the house? What are you doing? Mike looks up, wet and muddy. I been waiting for you. My shift. His uniform is crisp, and his nature is alert and suspicious. The valve's stuck. That's the sprinkler valve. Mike climbs out of the bushes with injured dignity. Okay, you do it. Is he the homeowner? No. Harold? Victor hears the FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. He keeps searching, but the pressure tells, and his breathing becomes a wheeze. Down there, wasn't it? The guard doesn't let him change direction. Keep going. You can turn the water back on. It's not the pipes. Wearing work gloves, he repositions the hatch cover. Nobody's supposed to be in the house unaccompanied. Is that our fault? No. All right, then. The guard glances up at the hatch. In that moment victor winks at Alex; he scored. You can learn on the fish around here, but you can't eat 'em. They're junk fish. Oh, you think you're ready for that kind of commitment? My father used to bring me here. She hears something in his tone. He's dead. He drowned in a storm. She shivers involuntarily. He was a fisherman. I feel close to him when I'm on the water. -- Eight. I'd just turned eight. She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this. She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek. They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse, kisses her on the lips. - Beautiful. Unusual cut. Look at the fire. Hold it up to the light. He hands the necklace to Alex, who lifts it up to look at it. Victor reaches into a drawer. In itHttheeree'ss a gun and a camera. He takes out the camera. necklace. The flash jerks Alex's picture of Alex with gaze from the What the fuck are you doing?? I always take a photograph of the goods. To avoid any disagreement in the sale. The insurance photo is hopeless. You ask yourself how do they stay in business. Alex advances on him. You put me in the shot. Speaking of insurance. Alex is closing on him. His voice is low and menacing. Give me the film, Victor._ victor's hand glides into the drawer. Alex sensibly stops short. ,(pleasantly) We'll tear it up together whet. we have the money. Honor among thieves is a myth, you know. victor's hand reappears, holding not a gun but an airline ticket, which he gives to Alex. What's this supposed to be? I thought it over. I can't move it. I'm on parole. I'm known. You're not. So you'll fly to Newark, take a shuttle into the city, catch a cab, take a walk, find an address, I'll give you the name -- pas.de probleme, as they say in Bordeaux. He's being condescending.' Meaning you're too chickenshit to do it yourself. Maybe I am. All right, I am. Fuck... He looks at the ticket. I don't fly economy. You can do anything you want out here -- you can swim nude, you can Her laugh cuts him off. (flustered, irritated) That's not what I meant. She dives into the water. He kicks off his shoes, dives in after her. together. Hey, quit laughin'. I'm saving your life here. ... May I speak with Gabriella? Puedo hablar con Gabriella? (making a face) No, yo no quiero dejar un mesajo, gracias. Voy a llamarla mas tarde. ...Si. Buenas tardes. He hangs up and speed-dials a number from the typed list on the wall. ... Hey, Ted -- it's Alex Gates. I need a couple of tickets to New York for tonight, first class. (his jaw tightens) Don't sweat the account, I'll pay You waited long enough to tell me. Gabriella arranges her clothes. No, you're not. She scrambles to her feet. ... Sure. He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with injured dignity. Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in front of her. Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does. She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion. He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to I'm sorry. She turns her head toward him. I'm sorry! I got your note. Fuck the Reeses. We're taking a trip, honey. Pack a bag. I'll pick you up in an hour. Napa. I got a problem with a supplier. Boutique wineries -- they're all owned by ex-lawyers. I need to see the wholesaler. Honey, I don't have to. I will, out of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the agent. I don't want to fight with you on my way out the door. I don't have time for this. Yanking the tickets out of her hand before she can react, he pushes past her with his bag. She follows him down the stairs. I worked my ass off for you with that store. Eight years of twelve- hour days and one-day weekends! So don't tell me I haven't treated you well. When I get back. Sssh, calm down -- She tries to slap him again, but he gets hold of her hand. -- Give me my keys, I need my keys. I don't want to hurt you. (breathless from the hasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers. -- Hey, hey. What the hell happened in there? Not enough. What'd you hit him with? Pull over, pull over. He wrenches the wheel and steers the car to the curb. I'm driving. We'll head for the Gulf, see what we like. He sounds like her contemporary, not her kid. Do you still miss him? Slowly she shakes her head no. Mugged-by your wife. How ironic. I'll fucking kill her. When do the Reeses come home? Not for a month. Plenty of time. Victor sighs. How long a drive is it? To the Gulf? Three hours. He removes the towel from his head. You're going to need stitches. Do you have a sewing kit? I'll stop at my doctor's. I darned my own socks in prison. Order something for me, okay? I'm stiff, I need to walk around. He's already walking away. Concern and exasperation cancel each other; she goes inside. My grandmother asked me to bring in a necklace of hers -- Jason takes the velvet pouch out of his pocket, unlaces it, spreads out the necklace on the counter. He leans forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with a loupe. When the jeweler looks up, he's angry. Your grandmother lets you carry around a million dollars worth of jewelry? Go put it back where you found it. The jeweler pours the necklace back in the pouch, cinches it closed, slaps it on top of the case. -- Those aren't real diamonds. Tell your grandmother to bring it in. The jeweler BUZZES the door to release it. Jason grabs the velvet pouch, strides out. We'll starve. The waitress laughs as she strolls away. Let's pack it up, picnic on the beach someplace. Adrenalin does that. She eats with gusto. Jason is staring at the water. I can't believe you did that. I didn't even say goodbye. -- How much money do we have? Suzanne doesn't reply. There's a cash discount. Ten percent. I should have given you the king- size. Suzanne isn't offended. You look great! Suzanne laughs. I'm right here. Suzanne shoves her fingers through her damp hair, swallows to clear her voice. What dog? She lies down again. -- I'm on watch. Don't worry. -- eight-faceted cut... quite unique... could be the whole piece or individual stones, preference for the whole piece. Will you put out the word?... No, I'm consulting for the insurance company, isn't life strange? -- Love and kisses. He hangs up. His cheeriness vanishes. He coughs, more like a gag, and heads for the bathroom. I've called the whole network of fences from here to Tampa. Let's hope we'll find her before she sells. Hey! What's wrong? This is not a water-view suite in Marbella! Did you notice? There's no fruit and champagne from the management. I don't see Swiss chocolate on the pillows. My masseuse is not at the door. And I am fucking dying, Alex! Jesus. Victor. I don't intend to cough to death in a county clinic because you screwed up! That's not fair. The plan was for you to move the necklace. I wouldn't have had the goddamn thing. Come on... sit down... try to relax. He reaches for victor's cigarettes and crumples the package in his fist. Victor looks at his ruined smokes. I'm not good at giving up things. (aside; to Suzanne) Can I see you in the office after lunch, please? (concentrating on the Do you buy estate diamonds? Sure. Jason takes out a zip-lock bag and lays it on the counter, one of the diamonds inside. The jeweler takes it out with respect and holds it under his loupe. If Jason's nervous, it doesn't show. It belonged to my mother. The jeweler's heard every version. He doesn't care. .Price is the same. I can give you eighty-five hundred. You don't need another grab-ass job. I been out talking to peoplel There's charter outfits a coupla towns up the coast. (NAMES OF TOWNS). They need skippers, they need crews. She stands up, brushes off the sand, rolls up her towel. Hey, I thought you were coming back in. She smiles and waves goodbye. She and Jason keep walking. He no longer looks like a boy. Seen them, by any chance? Why are you asking? My wife and son. He's been selling fish around these parts. He's totally believable. The bartender feels for his pain and takes another look at the photo, shakes his head no. She's a little classier than our usual clientele, y'know? Maybe you could pass it down anyway. Sure, man. joins Alex in the booth. Victor raises his hand. Alex instinctively pulls his head back. Don't move. He leans across the table and plucks the last stitch out of Alex's wound. Alex winces. It's been irritating me all day. Did I hurt you? Threat implied. Alex stares him down. Hunches a catch like a depth finder. Victor is already out of the booth. Who are you? His father. I thought his father was dead. (shaking his head) Well, you look bad all right, but not dead. Hungover, that's all. I'm his stepfather. (with a chuckle) Oh, man, now I see why he blew town. victor's insulted enough to lose his patience and his poise. The question before us is where did he go. Henry says nothing. He wants to be paid. Victor whips out a fifty-dollar bill from his top pocket. Henry reaches for it, but victor holds it back, wanting an answer first. He wouldn't be on the Gulf. He hated the Gulf. Alex has moved up to the bar to listen behind him, unnoticed. He shakes his head at victor. He's down in the Keys somewhere. Victor puts the fifty back in his own pocket. Henry stands aggressively. That ain't cool in my book! In a swift, unexpected move, victor jams Henry back down on his bar stool. The bartender starts toward them. Alex slips out the door. The stool and Henry are toppling over. Victor catches them both, sets Henry upright. Now sit there,. and calm down. Victor is ill, but not weak. Henry looks away, the classic signal of submission. Thank you. They can't be too far. Victor stares at him. I never understand your optimism. Or he wouldn't have lied. I think you made a friend. Victor turns around, Alex keeps walking. is in the doorway to the bar. What's it to you if I see the kid? Victor smiles. (just to be sure) Mom? The cabin is silent. He uses his fishing knife to pop loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically starts to jam the paneling back in place. It won't hold. I forgot my tackle box. Napa's farther north. Victor comes out of the bathroom. He's waiting for news. She wants to talk to you. Oh, please. Why? Just fucking say hello, okay? Victor takes the phone. Hello, dear. Alex snatches the phone back from him. Happy? Satisfied? I'm working. Thanks, honey. I'll call-you tomorrow. G'd'night . He hangs up, excited. Victor has already started to pack. And you had no faith.. I'll save the party hats until it's in our hands. Modest, nondescript. Victor parallel parks jewelry store with his usual careful manner. I miss the Cadillac. Top down. Air on. You have pimp's tastes, Alex. At least my car's inconspicuous. Alex starts to get out. Victor doesn't. You all right? A lot of these jewelers might know my face. It's risky. How about for me? Victor takes out the photo of Alex with the necklace and holds it up for him. Nobody's seen this yet. You're sick. I'll do it. Alex throws open the door and barrels out of the car. (with a shrug) Said it was his mother's. A seventeen-year-old kid waltzes in with a diamond as big as your toenail, and you don't wonder?? You shouldn't have touched iti You know that! All right, okay. When we recover the rest of the necklace, I'll be back. Do not, do not sell it. I'll see what I can do for you, Raines. i appreciate that. Smart lady. She lets Jason make the sale. They get caught, he's underage, and she don't know a thing. I gotta give her credit. You have interesting taste in women. Alex's gaze wanders to the game, but he can't get interested. Jesus, Henry... What the hell you doing?... How'd you know this was my boat?? I saw you cast off. Good little sport boat you got, too. Oh, whoa -- hear that? Where -- what?? Henry rubs his stomach. Right here, man. I ain't been eating my share since my fishing partner ran off. Without so much as goodbye/good luck. Jason blows out a breath. It's complicated. Always is. The boat is rockirg now. The WIND has picked up. They hear the CLANKING and RUBBING of the other boats. Jason starts checking all the hasps and latches while Henry eats the sandwich he made. So why are you on the Gulf? My baby finally sank on me. Right at the dock. I thought I'd work charter for awhile. (moving to help Jason with the latches) -- Need a crew? I don't know. Maybe. That's not why I came looking for you. Jason is checking the engine. Out of Henry's sight, he surreptitiously reaches inside a hidden compartment. wraps around the concealed pouch and withdraws, reassured. secures the engine hatch. A guy offered me fifty bucks to tell him where you were. Sick old motherfucker. Big as God. Tried to say he was your stepfather. Maybe it was. No, no, no, no -- this guy was not any kind of family man, if you know what I mean. So you're in some deep shit, because he wasn't a cop neither. -- What'd you tell him? Henry chuckles. Lots of ways to make fifty bucks. Misunderstanding, Jason shoves him up against the counter. You gonna lean on me, Henry?? Is that the plan? Henry is hurt and offended. No, man, I wouldn't stoop that low. And if I'd taken the fifty, I wouldn't have to be eating your shitbag sandwich neither. Jason steps back, ashamed of himself. He sits down to recover. Henry looks at him with a friend's concern. You -- um -- you moving contraband, Jason? Jason shakes his head no. This guy struck me as a serious problem. A few raindrops spatter the windows. Jason makes for the cabin door. Take care of the boat? (with a grateful smile) Not likely to sink two of 'em. -- Mom, come on. He catches her hand and tows her toward the back door. We"gotta go... She anxiously follows him out the door. leans back to see around the snack rack that blocked our view of him. It's Victor. A paper bag under his arm, he goes out the front door. There. -- I'm sorry. She glances in the rear view mirror. Headlights. A small bridge ahead is almost ready to pivot to let a boat pass. She stamps down on the gas pedal. The car rockets forward. What a thrill. Easy, easy -- he'll see us. It's raining too hard. Still with us. I just need to talk to her. Last time you talked, she almost crushed your skull. Not a_car in sight. The headlights turn onto the road. Mom! Face the road! You're drifting! She looks back as now bright headlights light them up. A truck HORN BLASTS. We don't have much time. Through the window they can see Suzanne and Jason, both unconscious, limbs entangled, covered in glass. Suzanne is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side. Her leg twitches in spasm. Car headlights pass by on the road. We need to get some help! Already on the way, I'm afraid. Open the trunk, please. -- Oh, Christ... He lifts her shirt to see how badly she's cut and presses the heel of his hand against the gash to try to stop the bleeding. Her blood spurts through his fingers. With his other hand he pats down her body. I think he's okay, Suzanne. Just' tell me where it is. She can't answer. He opens the glove compartment and feels inside. He goes through her purse. Goddammit! Leaning over the seat, he fumbles with her clothes. He's trying to make her comfortable. Sssh, I have to. Don't be scared. I'm not going to hurt you. Alex, c'mon, get out of there. She's dying, for chrissake! Hear the sirens? Help's coming. Just tell me where it is and let me get out of your lives. She whispers something. He leans in close. • She mumbles something indecipherable. He puts his ear close to her mouth. The SIRENS are bearing down. Victor grabs his ankles and pulls. Alex starts to reemerge. ... I didn't mean for this to happen. As soon as they see her license they'll call you in Miami. Alex nods. He can't look away from the scene. what are you... He swallows painfully. Alex smiles and gets up from the chair. He dreads what he has to tell him. Hey, there... how do you feel? Where's my mother? (dodging the question) I flew straight back from Napa when I heard. You hit your head pretty hard. Jason struggles to sit up, his equilibrium not fully restored. Where's Mom? -- How's Mom? Alex sits down on the bed with him to break the news. I'm sorry, Jason... I'm so sorry. Jason stares at him. He hasn't absorbed the fact. She didn't make it as far as the hospital. Horror and rage flood Jason's face. -- You killed her, you fuckl Alex tries to hold him, eventually in a forced bear-hug. -- Don't, don't -- I need someone in here! Let go of me! Alex holds him close. He collapses in Alex's arms. An ORDERLY hurries in, followed by a Nurse. We'll take care of him. It'd be nice to have some help. C) Victor unscrews the trap under the kitchen sink. D) Et cetera. Where's my son?? I released him this morning. You let an underage boy with a head injury walk out of here by himself?? It was only a concussion. He's fine. He said you were in the lobby. Wake up, Alex. I want to see your face. The sheets stir. Jason raises his knife to strike. But it isn't Alex in the bed, it's Gabriella. She lets out a strangled scream. He whips the sheet off her with his other hand. She's naked. Where is he? His car's here. I keep hearing about Napa. Did you ever call him there? She shakes her head. You don't know where he was. You didn't waste any time,. did you. You moved right in. I'm going to wait for him, and. I'm going to kill him. His hand drifts along her body. She doesn't resist. Yeah. Did you show it to him? You two have a laugh about it? Did you tell him how to find: us-? Gabriella knocks his hand away from her throat. Sure, he did. He had us followed. I'm not crazy. Gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed, to comfort him. Her loss, your gain. Furious, Gabriella forgets her caution. She slaps him hard enough to throw his head sideways. Jason rolls on top of her and pins her down. Her home, her bed -- her life. He lowers his mouth to Gabriella's neck. His kiss is surprisingly gentle. His knee works her legs apart. Let's finish what we started. Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances. His fingers scissor her nipple. Just don't tell me that you love me. He peels off his T-shirt. No! -- Would you do that? You don't -- you don't! What are you talking about? This is my home. I'm home. She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade him. Jason thinks of his next step, a plan. You're never going to marry him, Gabriella. I've been looking for you for two days! Jason relishes this. You should've called home. Alex advances. How'd you get here? Hitchhiked. Why didn't you wait for me? Jason eats without answering. And what about all your stuff, and your mother's? Jason swallows, wipes his mouth. She doesn't need it anymore, and I don't want it. Gabriella brings Alex a cup of coffee. I'm not hungry. Jesus. You haven't even said hello to her. (with great control), Hello, Gabby. 'Did you miss me, honey?, What are you doing. Jason gets up from the table. He's wearing workout clothes. Nothing. He walks out of the condo. Alex and Gabriella are left alone together. She jumps in before he can say anything. Did you try to make him feel better? Oh,. please. I don't need two children in the house. (noticing her mouth) -- What happened to your mouth? Gabriella's hand jumps to her lip. Where? Here?... Better? She tries to laugh and nods. He holds her close. where'd Jason go? You have something that belongs to .me, Jason -- and I want it back. It's not yours. Either way. Jason continues to lift. Finally: Did you know the thing's worth over a million dollars? What a fucking stupid way to spend money. I was holding it for someone. These are dangerous people. Don't screw around with me, Jason. He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face, his expression hidden. I don't know where it is anymore. You killed the only person who did. It was an accident! What did I have to do with it? Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex. There was a car following us! Did you see who was in it? Jason shakes his head no. I met one of these guys. Tall, weird-looking fucker with.a gray crew-cut. (letting out a breath) These people you don't steal from. Whoever was following Suzanne is going to come after you, too. Haven't you figured that out? For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead. Who are they? Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper. Doesn't matter. Give the necklace back to me, and we'll split the handling commission. His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust Alex. He shakes his head. She never told me where she kept it. Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away. Nice boy like that, the money means diddlyshit. And, personally, I suspect he'd rather die than tell you. So get a blowtorch, and use it on the girl until he cooperates. He's gonna make a move. Okay. He hangs up and rocks back in his chair. (muffled against her Wake up. She realizes he isn't going away. She rolls onto her back. Her arms go around him.- Alex kisses her, long and deep. I think he's probably figured out why we sleep in the same bed, Gabby. ... So do I. Gabriella props herself up on her elbow. We need to go somewhere, just us. I'm buying a vineyard in France. Have you ever been to Paris? We'll stay at the Ritz, we'll eat our way through every three-star restaurant in town -- a new dress every night -- would you like that? Gabriella laughs in wonder and turns onto her side to face him. They fit themselves together like an old married couple. (getting caught up in his own fantasy) -- We'll drive down through Burgundy -- follow the Rhone into Provence, wind up on the Riviera -- Monte Carlo -- They have tables at the casino where you play baccarat and the bets start at a hundred bucks. Ohl Remember Dina's necklace? Alex's eyes go cold and watchful, although she doesn't notice. Sure. James had an expense account. He rolls onto his back, she lays her cheek on his graying chest. He no longer wants to make love. What made you think of the necklace? She's drifting toward sleep. (into the phone) -- Come meet me, I gotta talk to you. I'm at the Haitian marketplace. You know where it is? An thing you want. Don't drive, take a cab -- (as she laughs at what sounds like silliness) -- I'll wait for you. Jason hangs up. He looks around. He doesn't see Victor watching from the trinket stand. Be walks to the counter where he has already ordered coffee and pie. He picks up his fork. He can't eat. There's a folded newspaper left behind by another customer. He pulls it over. Gabriella waves to him. I saw a guy following me... I thought you weren't safe. I was going to tell you to go stay at your Read it. Alex stole it. The reason I know is because I stole it from him. Her eyes widen. his face concealed among the candles is trying to figure out what drama is going on between Jason and Gabriella. He can read their faces, but not their lips. You weren't a maid. We're going to the Gulf. accelerates. Gabriella nuzzles his neck. looks back. A man with your breeding usually rings the doorbell. There was, is, no time. You heard the news. Victor pulls one of Alex's golf clubs out of the bag as though to admire it. I know you keep money here somewhere. Your stash. Give it to me. Alex spreads out his hands. Vic, Vic -- The golf club catches him in the midsection. Alex cries out. The blow folds him forward onto his knees. The. cops are about to drive up your street. He brings the club down on Alex's bare foot. (through teeth clenched There's nothing here to.give you. Where is it? He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away. The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club. Believe me -- I swear to God, I Victor raises the club over Alex's head, and brings it down on the coffee table instead. The glass-explodes. He has to push the words out through a•coughing spasm. I refuse to die in a fucking prison clinic! Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for breath. Alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses it on the floor. Come on, this is pitiful. Victor drops onto the sofa. He gags on the blood in his throat and desperately draws in air. What a mess. He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor. Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances. He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours a glass. At least you got to die in your own clothes, Vic. That's something. What took you so long. Just tell me how to find you. Henry emerges from the cabin. He eyes Gabriella. Oh, my. This is Gabriella. She's my contraband. She looks quickly at Jason, who smiles. Henry reaches out to shake her hand. Kid's a sucker for dark skin. Alex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him. Good morning! I brought donuts. Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the boat, his arms around his ribs. Oh, it's not as bad as all that. She fucking called you. She has some residual loyalty, yeah. Which I didn't expect either. Jason moves to the helm, switches on the engine. Alex quickly finishes his donut. He brushes off his fingers. Where are we going? I'm going fishing. Get off if you want. No, it's a beautiful day for a boat ride. Give us a chance to talk. He makes himself comfortable. Then make yourself useful and cast off the stern line. Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow line. This one? There's not a lot of choice. Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him. -- If we could manage to ignore the personal history here, I think we could work something out between us. Jason turns the boat toward the open sea. You want Gabriella? This is the way to have her. Life costs, Jason. Love costs. And you love her more than I do. (as Jason glances at -- Shut up! Just shut up! She sits on the bench, her face tight and angry. He's feeling like you let him down. .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for another donut. The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL hitting the waves substitute for conversation. -- Okay. I'm ready to listen. He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella, who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea. Alex wants to make me an offer. She gives no sign of having heard him. We're giving you a hard choice, Gabby. Two rich men. Gabriella swivels her head slowly. And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it. Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in a little, making the line taut, testing the weight. He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to the surface a big, dark green fish. _ Jesus! What the hell is that? Hammerhead. Young. Male. Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared. I'd just get in his way. His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared without either of them noticing. Is this your backup plan? No. You want it so bad, it's yours. He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex. You little prick. scrambles toward the necklace. Help me, help.mel! Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges. forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The shark slowly changes color to a dull brown. You knew it wasn't dead. Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries. Mom didn't take the necklace. did. Then you killed her yourself. Jason slowly nods. And you were in the car behind us. Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying slightly. Well, I didn't. Alex manages to laugh. Jesus. You set me up. You had her call me. Shit... I believed you. Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit. I'll get on the radio. Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace. They look at each other. has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course. Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses the radio. This is Hercules II, calling the Harbormaster... You cool? I will be. See ya. He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is left with Alex. (weakly; to Henry) What's your name? No way -- (still the salesman) -- No, listen, listen -- this is worth a fortune. (thrusting the necklace Play the possibilities. Yeah. Good advice. And he walks away fast. Wait, don't go! Come back here. Come on back! Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to give up hope in a hopeless situation.
