Lady... Jeremy... Hey, you can't...Take a look. There's some weird shit here. Peter... Shit. Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor... Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him. Immigration's gonna love you for that. Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want? Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex. We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren. The blintzes! "Try the blintzes..." Right. I think so. One right, two lefts... H-how do I get...? What? There's really people living down here? New York's finest.And a right. Go left. Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that? Way we came. Take the first tunnel to your right... Show that to the station manager. Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten. Track bunnies. Rats. They're usually around. Funny. Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now. Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street... You all watch your step. We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here. You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up. What do you-? The kid... You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires. Think you can handle it? Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator. Third rail is dead. Get me up. There must be a manual override in the booth. How you know that? Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart... "Mistake"? What's that supposed to...? Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh? Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out... Oh, Jesus!! Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to- I only got... All right, motherfucker, that's it. Those things bring juice to the new stations. You just can't rewire that shit... Oh, man, there you go again. Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks. Ain't gonna be much use, though. Lines are dead. Oh, that's gonna work. Did you see the size of that thing?! 20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore. You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude. No, you talkin' at me. Please do. He's a lonely guy. ...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf... Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks... What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore. You don't do that, we're on the wrong track. You... The lights come up, you pull the switch. You better tell me what the hell's going on here! What are you doing down here? My God, what the hell are you...? He can imitate anything, you just watch him. No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it! Across both tracks!! Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!! He didn't do it! It would take a minute or so. You won't last that long out there. Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables... What are you putting that crap on me for?Nino, please... I pull. Hey, hey!! Take it easy!! Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere... Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her. Hurry, the woman needs help! He's special. I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy... He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things... "...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..." But it look like a man. It... I saw it.Weird shit...? Yeah...? There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster... Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place? Tell them to send flowers to the usual address. Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it. No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure. You really love flashing that thing, don't you? Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!" Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates... Go!! Just go!! The kid's with them!! Depends. You got a memo? Can we get this car there? Is there a switch? It doesn't matter, all right? It's dead. A mistake. I'm sorry. But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology. Leonard, listen. I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. Look, I'm trying to help you here... You feel anything? Its muscles are locked. Wait a minute- Just do it! For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart? What? You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...? Any luck? You got a better way up? Look what you did! You stupid sonofa- 20 minutes. Susan? We'll be back at the platform in... For Chrissakes. You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me? Excuse me, I'm talking to you. Fine. You want me to call your supervisor? The Department of Public Health... Look, I showed you my badge... We can do it! Talk to me. C'mon... I can. We can do this... You go first. I'll be right below you. Jump in. I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are... Try not to sweat? That's why we should do it now. It worked before... We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us- we Goddam mimic them! What- Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them! It's no use! They know we're in here! How?! So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or... Toss the flare down! Listen to me: we're getting you out. Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing... I know. But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed. Susan, listen to me: you handled that insect almost as much as Siri... No. You said that thing was big as your hand. I don't think I'm going to miss... Susan, we're not b- Oh, no, you were- Fuck 'em. They don't know what they're missing. Great crowd. Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus! Oh, so I'm the bad guy now? You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us? Honey, just leave it. So? Maybe they lied to you. We? Okay. So you lost a great specimen- Thought it was my week for that. Okay, meet me out front. I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight. Don't get kinky here... You know where they get this fertility stuff? They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns. Who know? We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours. Is this a Catholic guilt thing...? Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo? You did! A shame. You looked great tonight.No way. I see one of those, I'd puke. Gross. What is it? That's it? You the bug lady, right?
