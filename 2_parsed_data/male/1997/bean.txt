Well, Ahm.... Oh yes. Ahm.... . oh dear. Ahm..... Yes. Ahm... think I'11 ... Excuse me.I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ... He's just parking the Governor's car. Everything okay, David? You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. . Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss. Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future. Not necessarily. That's where this ... comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough. Thanks, David. Always a pleasure. It's great when people who work together can become real friends. Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking. And howls Alison? Howls he getting on with the family? I was hoping DU. Bean might take a look at my computer project today. But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery. Thank you, sir. Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ... Okay, that'll do. The Governor's here in half an hour. We have to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period! Hey. Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms. And that's where you introduce me to the Governor. We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the Governor. Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room. Period. Great news.I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down. I have a tale to tell. And not a happy one. Here, let me do that. Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch. I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard. shhh... Everything's gonna be fine. Yes. Great. Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company. Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along. Ah, well .... CUT TO: I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake. Sort of half..... Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will kill you. Hi, I know you are. Very serious ... most of the time these days. Okay. It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ... It's okay. There's no one out here. Just open the door. Trust me. Ali? What's wrong? 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know. One. I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator. Jesus. I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it. Stupid thing. I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ... Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ... Tom Jones? That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea." Yes. Yes. Sometime. Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here. I said I'd check with you. Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff. And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while. Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England... Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it .... Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later. Uh ... yes ... Goodnight Annie. Thanks, Annie. Right first time. No, Annie, no. This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us. Annie, it's me. It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito. Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints .... What happened?!!! Oh Jesus. Oh God. Oh Jesus God. Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth. What? What? Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone? Better go. Grierson hates people being late. Ah, Mr Bean ... Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ... Great - keep him out of trouble. Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to. Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this. I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that. 'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right? Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy. Isn't it? Yes, isn't he. She's ... well, she's good. Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great. Yes. I'11 mention it to him. But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know? It's very good Bernie. So, why not haul your ... nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case. We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now. Say that again, son. And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up. Maybe two cars. And a car. VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ... I'm fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen? Certainly is. Quite right, sir. Ahm.... Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Congratulations. Marvellous thing. Bravo. ... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now. Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Bean? The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift. No! You're not going to .... Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited. Ah... He certainly has something, sir. Yes, this is Doctor Bean. No. Perfect. Looking forward to it. CUT TO: on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due? Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ... Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin. Jen? Sure. You're right. Jen - you don't wanna talk about it? Honey, calm down now... it's okay... Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside. No-one's asking you to go to bed with him. Sean Connery. Richard Burton was very good-looking. What makes you say that? They're pretty. Learn it in the army? You arrange those flowers yourself? You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David? As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section. Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right? Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh? I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you. How the hell should I know? She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse. Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps! Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable. Well, there is that ... He was incredible. This guy is fearless. He has no fear. Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly. Great, good.Okay, sir. Certainly. Good. I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time. I beg your pardon?Okay..... Damn. I was just going to Number 4 .... Yes?No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life. Sure did. Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15. Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset? Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius. He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century. Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself. This is Elmer, our longest serving... Right. Got it. What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. . Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team. David? So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel. Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less. A car sounds sensible. Mmmmm... Of course. I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that you do not. Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse. David, David, David ... Well, congratulations. Isn't that great, David? Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we? Don't want anything to go wrong. I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s. Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the news. I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you? No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother. Thank you David. However, flattery will get you nowhere. Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama. Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ... Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh? Er ... pray tell me why? Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning? Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you? Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player. Ah, David. Finally. And this must be our professor from across the sea. Tomorrow. You have a problem with that? I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ... I am sorry you feel that way. Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ... Why thank you sir. Not at all, Governor. Very striking. what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.... in the distant future. But is she gonna be okay? Is Jenny gonna be okay? Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver. I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers? That's one - way of looking at it. You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'. I vote for Bart. Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived. Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about .... oh, 20 minutes. Sting?! Sounds like something you put on a rash. Are you? You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad? I wish I could use that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know? So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe". Nope. NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad? Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass. That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair. I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys. off the peg? Interesting suit. Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint. Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
