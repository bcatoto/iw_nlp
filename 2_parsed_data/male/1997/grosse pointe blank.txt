Remember high school? I sell BMW's. What do you do? Computer guy. What? I want to be an actor. What am I gonna do? Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it... Never better. So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again? Really...? So what? What?Overflowing with love. To make a long story short... Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way. That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff. It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value. I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning. Correct. That's for you. Keep it. Yes. You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.Jesus... Insane. A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane. He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands? Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really. Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day. I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky. Bob. Bob Destephano.Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing. Okay. Repeat this after me. What else? Say more. Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel. What stuff? Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed. And how have you been feeling about your... work lately? Yes. I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens." So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families. You know where I live? You needn't be so frank with me about your work. Say more. How do you know? Tell me about your vision of the reunion. We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite. You went to school with these people. Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it? I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain. Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind. I am part of what I call a brain syndicate. I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you. It's only natural.... Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are. You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I? I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it. That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right? Do you like the people you work with? How was your day, today, sir?Excellent. Here they come. ...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece? Don't listen to him, he's a professional. Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole. Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job... But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship. I told them to kill you and they didn't. A little misunderstanding among my associates. Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday. I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee. I'm gonna get you, kid. It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in. We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor. Like a club. Work less, make more. I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same. Nope. Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients. Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury. I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer. Hello, Bob. Hello Martin. How have you been?Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble. Did you see Blank in there? If he does our job, he's our job. I love. I kill. You're wrong. Look at his face. He's falling for her. Look at him. Yup. -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy. Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer. We can't do our job unless he does his job. It was the PLO. --Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened. Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the -- Well? Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man? Lisbon? You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce. You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those-- I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland-- It's what I do. I sell biscuits to the Southland. Yeah... In the corporate offices. Yes I do. I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Whatever I can get away with. Wonderful. Don't say that. I'm Martin Blank. Then express yourself, Bob. What do you want to do? You could've been a contender, huh? Really? Fine, Bob. How are you? Okay. See you later. It's me. Martin Blank. Bob... And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven? So you eat-- read it everyday? Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony. I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that. You don't understand... What if I come back? Will you come with me? I was leaving. A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money. Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things. Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life. I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work. Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other... ...About five years now. It's something I do... No. Yes. Could be. The physical substance of love. Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper. Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood. Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller. Wow. I have to give this some thought. --She's not dead--- Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week? --Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna-- Shoulda brought my gun. Right. Do you want to get a drink first? I'll just help myself to a cocktail. You look beautiful. As long as I get the laugh. Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in. This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship. Yes. Seven it is. Yes. I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock. That'd be good. What's that? Bad television. Bad people. Bad experiences. Well, there's not much to tell. It's always the little things. That's part of it. Are you going to the reunion? You see someone? --and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really. I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11-- Where have I been? Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back. I'm a professional killer. Not much else. I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really. Here is now there. There is here. Ten years, I think. What I miss? How long has it been? It's nice to see you again. This is me breating. ...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure. Out Loud? Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion. If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals. Morality. If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway. Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys. Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me. Mmm. So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around? We're both professionals, Oatman. Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live. They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say? "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork." I just know. Shouldn't you be taking notes? Come on. It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone? Up on the right. Okay. Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural. No. You understand the psychology of the job. I work alone. Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work. There you go. I left it blank. Okay. I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving. It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry. Nice talk, Sugarmouth. Is that right? No deal. I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends! Hard to get good help these days. No harm no foul. Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette. Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild. And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me.... Thank you, no. Like a union? What do you want? I guess. Have you seen Debi Newberry? Well... I have to take this over to Debi. Those all seem kind of related... That sounds pretty interesting... Hey, Bob. Not bad. You? Hey, Ken. How have you been? Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great. Tell them my house exploded. Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all. I've looked at it. It's fine. I'll do it tomorrow. See you next week. I have scruples. Next. Never enough. Good. What else? Anything interesting? There's nothing to be done about it. Would you describe their position as inflexible? Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time. And they want me to make up for it. He didn't. I'm not happy. I'll pay. And not show it to me. Ever again. Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail. Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living. Throw that away. Patch him through.... ...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella. I have always thought about her and missed her. Yeah... I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her. I think I'll go see Debi today. Yeah. I guess we did. No, I don't have one. You have a headache? They told me you're taking lithium, mom. I imagine that'd be rather difficult. It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing. Jim? It's a place where religious people-- That's wonderful, Mom. When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry. I have to get my head back into my work. It didn't work out. I was catching up with Bob Destephano. Mein Dealer. How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully? He sells BMW's? I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer. No. No. You drove us here. Debi's house. You too. Fair enough. So what happened to you? Paul? Wow. How did you get this job? So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me. So when are you authorized to use deadly force? I'm a professional killer. Why not? I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you? How's that? How are you? How's business? Good evening, Mr. Newberry.No... I get it. Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us. One cannot love and kill. He using her. So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys. Wait a minute-- Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here. I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job. Whatever. That's strictly B�ader-Meinhof stuff. --Nooo-- I don't think so. In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn. In Portugal, yes. Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.That's good. So what are you doing with your life now, son? Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing? I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek. Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong. Good evening, Mr. Blank.See you in ten years. Work's good for the soul. That's too bad. As long as you had a good time. What the hell happened to you? He gave me a great deal. He sold me this bad boy. Thank you. Ten years. What happened!? Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it? Kind of crept up on you, didn't it? God it's great to see you. Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul. You're leaving me hanging here... Marty! It's me. Paul.Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course... To shoot you. Correct. Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
