Number Seven. Zing! Choo! Choo!... I'm a locomotive, baby! I'm the Wabash  cannonball! I'm a hunka-hunka  burninnnnn' love! I got fire in my  boiler and a fuh -- a fuh -- Excuse me, Miss, is this the train  to Ecsssstasy? I'm gonna nail your ass! I'm gonna nail your ass!! I'm gonna nail your ass! I nailed his ass. They never grow-up, lady. They just  get tubby. Me, I've always had ample  proportions. But it's all muscle --  I'm hard as a rock. I'm not on of  these cream puff sit-behind-a desk  private dicks; I'm an assnailer I'm gonna nail your ass. Probably you're the best he could  do. You're takin' it pretty well. I seen  'em weep like they'd hired me to  prove their husbands weren't fooling  around. And I seen 'em celebrate.  Like I just handed 'em a winning  lottery ticket. -- hello Marjory, any messages? Yeah?  Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have Wrigley look  up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its  relevance to the Chapman filing. She  took the kids where? Tahoe? Which  side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise  goes all the way around the lake,  she left the state and she's in  breach. She can't leave the state.  Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to  attach everything. Primary residence,  autos, stocks... Sure. Put him through. Hello Ross. What? She's sleeping  with the nanny? Well, you're  separated. She can sleep with -- is  this the one you slept with? Oh. A  guy? Interesting career choice. Hmmm?  Yes. I know you want her dead.  Everyone in your tax bracket wants  their ex wives dead. Honey! ...Honey?! Look, Marylin, can't we have a  civilized discussion about this? But Marylin, you know a divorce would  ruin me right now. Everything I have --  everything we have -- is tied up in  my business. The business is my entire  life. Marylin? Dogs? Mr. Massey will be right with you. The problem is that everyone is  willing to compromise. That's the  problem with the institution of  marriage -- it's based on compromise.  Even through its dissolution. One  attorney will try to score some  points, the opposition will try to  impeach. The process will find an  equilibrium point determined by the  skill of the opposing lawyers, and  then each party will walk away with  their portion of the "goodies." Some  say, "Life is compromise." But at  Massey Myerson we believe life is  struggle and the ultimate destruction  of your opponent. Your eleven o'clock is here. Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will  continue this at the Associates  Meeting next Friday. In the meantime,  I want you to consider this... Ivan  the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila  the Hun -- what did they have in  common? Mr. Rexroth. Rex, please. Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and  consider this office your office,  your haven, your war room -- for the  duration of the campaign. Thank you. Now Rex. -- Tell me your troubles. Jeez. Where do I start? ...Well, my wife has me between a  rock and a hard place. That's her job. You have to respect  that. When I first met Marylin -- Well, we  were crazy about each other. Not  emotionally, of course. We just  couldn't keep our hands off each  other. Mm. But then... But then... Time marches on. Ardor cools. No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly  cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And  very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of  it out there. Ah. You know what I mean when I say "it." Gotcha. No need to get anatomically  correct with me, Rex. Seems like there's more of it than  ever before -- Well, with the expanding global  population -- Let me ask you this --  your wife. Has she pursued the  opportunities which must present  themselves to the "knock-out, sexy  woman" you described? I don't know. I can assume... Not in court you can't. Has she  retained counsel? I'm not sure. And your wife is aware of or has  evidence of your activities? Video. Mmm... And to cut to the chase,  forensically speaking -- is there a  pre-nup? The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars, but in ourselves. Well,  let me ask you this: what kind of  settlement do you seek? What are,  for you, the parameters of the  possible? That's the problem. I can't afford  to give her anything. Nothing? I know that sounds rough but I'm  about to close on a deal to develop  some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged  up to my ass. If this deal goes south,  I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions. So, you propose that in spite of  demonstrable infidelity on your part,  your unoffending wife should be tossed  out on her ear? Well -- is that possible? Mrs. Guttman, you have testified  that you were your husband's sexual  slave for thirty-six years, ever  since you were married -- Except for two years when he was in  the Navy, in Korea. Prior to your marriage, what was  your profession? I was a hostess. For Trans-World  Airlines. What is your husband's profession? He manufactures staples and industrial  brad-tacks. He's very successful. Nothing. Video. Wrigley! Sometimes I have serious doubts about  you. Am I mentoring the wrong mentee? I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer  clerked for Scalia. Couldn't you simply walk away from  this abusive relationship? Anyway, I need a challenge. This -- -- is not a challenge. I need  something I can sink my teeth into,  professionally speaking. Mr. Massey! I ask again, if you have  any questions for the complainant. I'm sorry, your honor, I was just  conferring with my associate... Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know  a gentleman named Morris Rudnick? Accountant. We would like to offer these  photographs into evidence... Mr. Massey will see you now. ...Ruth! -- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth.  And you must be Mrs. Rexroth. Marylin. My whole metabolism is -- off. So, Ruth. How's Sam? A yert. Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a  time when most women are in Boca,  having early bird specials -- she's  working so her husband can be in  Montana. In a yert. What's a yert? What?! How nice. Yeah. At this point my client is still  prepared to consider reconciliation. My client is prepared to entertain  an amicable dissolution of the  marriage without prejudice. My client proposes a thirty day  cooling off period. My client asks that you not initiate  proceedings pending his setting  certain affairs in order. Heh heh. What's so goddamn funny? Please -- let me handle this. -- So much for the icebreakers.  What're you after, Ruth? Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why  not ask for a hundred percent? Why not a hundred and fifty percent? You have some? Not according to Mrs. Rabinow. Sometimes I forget. Are you familiar with Kirshner? What's Kirshner? Please -- let me handle this. Okay,  Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your  bottom line? Aren't we going in the wrong  direction? Shhh. Please. Let me do my job. Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten  about Kirshner? Fine. We'll eat all the pastry. I think that went as well as could  be expected. She always looked out for me. And she had private investigators  assisting her. She brought my digestive enzymes. In anticipation of making you sick. Maybe I should reconsider my... A superficial display of marital  solicitude, and you lose your resolve?  Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm  your attorney, and if you choose to  reward her for that mediocre charade  of spousal concern... You're right. Screw her. Marylin? Ready. That was excellent, Marylin. But you  forgot to yell "no." Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming. Something to start? Some wine,  perhaps? French? Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57. Isn't everything? Your husband told me you were  beautiful, but I was unprepared. Simon & Garfunkel? Do you have a hard heart, Marylin. Not yet. What does your lawyer think? But you don't agree? Why would you be here? I'll have the tournedos of beef. And  the lady will have the same? I assume you're a carnivore. "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at  first sight?" Not really. You're not my client.  Freedom of association. Big issue  with the First Amendment fans. Want  to go to Hawaii for the weekend? No. As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan. No. I haven't. Have you? He wants a reconciliation. Gotcha. Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking  for an ass to mount. Oyez. Oyez. Family court for the  fifth district of Los Angeles County  is now in session. -- The Honorable Marva Munson  presiding. All rise. Have you sat before her before? Okay. Has she sat before you before? Shut! Up! I'm gonna nail your ass. Mr. Massey, any questions? Mmmm -- "Dismiss your vows, your feigned  tears, your flattery, for where a  heart is hard, they make no  battery..." Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth? Grounds? Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how  high is that wall around your heart? Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you  ever been in love? And you've always loved him? And you hoped to spend the rest of  your life with him? That'll be all Mrs. Rexroth. Please  forgive me for causing you additional  anguish. Thank you, Your Honor. No further  questions. Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow. Mr. Massey? Yes, Your honor. I call Patricia  Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg. Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your  relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. And how would you define your  relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You  know -- you are her...? Her Mother? Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you  are frequently mistaken for sisters. Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth? You were never invited to meet your  son-in-law? Sustained. Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married? Who's "Patty." I see. And what were you going to  tell us about Patty slash Marylin? Divorce was her childhood aspiration? She got absolutely nothing. Zero.  Zip. So. I won't be seeing her? Your  clients usually visit me after the  settlement. Not this one. Not unless her HMO  covers plastic surgery, which,  incidentally, she does not need. Everyone needs plastic surgery. You  need it. I don't need it. You want Botox? What the hell is Botox? It's a form of botulism. I just inject  it into your forehead, and it  paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't  raise them... Why in God's name would I want...? No frown lines. New watch? It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can  flip the face, and set it for two  time zones. Why would you need two time zones?  You never leave Beverly Hills. It was a gift from a client. Set one side for Bel Air. Botox. Christ. We had aspirations  when we were in college. We did not. You were going to be a Cardiac  Surgeon. I was going to clerk for  the Supreme Court. I was going to play golf. You were  going to have Asian girlfriends. Denial is not a river in Egypt. You're in check. I should be in therapy. Yes. Your husband did show remarkable  foresight in taking those pictures.  And, yes, absent a swimming pool,  the presence of the pool man would  appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie,  who is the real victim here? Let me  suggest the following. Your husband,  who on a prior occasion slapped you --  beat you -- Your husband, who has beaten you --  repeatedly -- Please -- was at the time brandishing  your firearm, trying in his rage to  shoot an acquaintance -- friend of  long standing -- So he says now! But if not for your  cool headed intervention, his tantrum  might have ended this schmoe's life  and ruined his own... As for the  sexual indiscretion which he imagined  had taken place, wasn't it in fact  he who had been sleeping with the  pool man? Am I going to far here? Mr. Massey, Mr. Meyerson would like  to see you when you have a moment. Herb wants to see me? When you have a moment. Thoity-six objections sustained,  tree overruled; fawteen summary  judgements sought, toiteen ranite,  eighteen movments to voice fuh  respondent's prejudice, eighteen  ranite which is a hunnut pissent -- Twelve cawt days on the Rexrawt  case alone; tree hunut'n twenty  billable hours paralegal soivicies;  four hunnut'n two billable associate  counsel and consultative; six hunnut'n  eighty billable at full attorney  rate and eightyfive lunches charged. -- Counseluh, you are the engine  that drives this foim -- Thank you Herb. Mr. Massey -- Please! No calls! I'm feeling very  fragile. I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt  certain you'd want to know -- Marylin  Rexroth wants to see you. Marylin Rexroth? When does she -- She's here now. Marylin! How nice. Marylin! How lovely, uh -- -- Marylin! What a pleasure -- Marylin, what a pleas -- who the  fuck are you? I told you we know each other, baby.  Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser? Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat? After you, Doll. And how is Mrs. Reiser? Few suicide attempts, little inpatient  stint. Naturally, she misses her  kids. Six weekends a year and  alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh  to us but -- hey -- all's fair.  Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse,"  takes her meds and goes to  occupational therapy at a local  sheltered workshop. So she's uh, flourishing? She makes felt wallets. Got one right  here. Yeah. I know. Leather would be more  practical, but whatcha gonna do? Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh? Yep. My divorce just came through.  Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a  better deal! My wife still has health  insurance and gets to see the  children. But, I don't know. Guess  I'm just a softie. After all Amanda  and me were together for -- what --  you'd know better than me, Marylin.  She was your best friend. Here. Got pictures. I... uh guess congratulations are in  order. Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up  and... ...and one day, this sweet girl calls  me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder  to cry on deal. One thing leads to  another and before I know it -- No! I had no idea until after, but -- Baby. You are so HOT! What a touching story. You know, Miles, after my wife --  wife's mastectomy -- things were  never the same. This might sound  cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey,  but... I like my women with two boobs. You did good, Massey! And -- there's no talking her out of  it. Believe me, I've tried. She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh. Oh, for the love of... That is correct. Not to blow my own  horn, but they devote an entire  semester to it at Harvard Law. Harvard? Whoa, Daddy! I just want to make sure that you  both -- -- understand what you're asking for  here. The Massey pre-nup provides  that in the event of a dissolution  of the marriage for any reason, both  parties shall leave it with whatever  they brought in, and earned during.  No one can profit from the marriage.  The pre-nup protects the wealthier  party. Well -- at the moment, that'd be me. And without it, that party is exposed --  a sitting duck. No wriggle room. A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put  that in the Malibu house. Screw the  screening room! -- and we are sure... -- we are both sure that's what we  want? Course I can't do much "wriggling"  if you tie me up like that again.  Massey -- this is one bad bad little  girl. Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could  just borrow your charming fiancee  for a moment. What part? I'd just like to have a word with  her. Why not? I'm going to have her for a  lifetime. What are you doing? To him? He's a sick freak. Passionate! He's a pervert. He should  have to register when he moves. Marylin! Listen to me. But why him? The Massey pre-nup has never been  pene -- successfully challenged. No, that's not all. You fascinate me. Do you think I'm going to end up  like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy  bag instead of a family? Got any symptoms? Yes. The inability to experience  pleasure. Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen. What? The Center Counter Defense. The thing  is not to move your queen too early. She can't really love that idiot,  can she? What? Marylin Rexroth. She came into my  office and signed a pre-nup with  Howard Doyle. Doyle Oil? A Massey Pre-nup? She loves him. He's the wrong man. Miles! Don't waste time with someone  else's queen, either. What the hell is wrong with you? Is she going through with it? Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme.  Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients  for the banquet we call -- life.  Marriage is like a Great Feast.  Courtship is the Appetizer. A small  mixed green taste of things to come.  The Early Years -- The First Course --  a carefully poached fish dish  dependent on freshness and delicate  handling. Or perhaps a light pasta --  a tortellini stuffed with cheese and  hope. The main course -- Mature Love -- a  hearty stew, cooked slowly in the  oven of companionship until the meat  falls off the bone. And then --  dessert. The reward for years spent  together -- the sweetness of a Life  Well Lived. A sorbet of grandchildren,  followed by the decafe demitasse of  retirement. Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin  to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang  though the lean years as well as  those that are heavily marbled? I do. And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take  Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel?  The stock in your sauce? Argh. Then, by the power vested in me by  the state of California, and as the  maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star  Restaurant of Life, I now pronounce  you -- man and wife... What are they? Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm  surprised at you. What is this? Some  Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are  the most cockamamie things I've ever -- Why couldn't we be the club sandwich? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:  I have something to say to my bride. -- Darling, like the rabbi said...  life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe,  and Marylin, darling... I just want  you to know that I am IN the kitchen  and I CAN STAND THE HEAT! And I'm going to start this marriage  by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot  hors d'oerve of this love story is --  Pre-nup Primavera! Carmine! Bring on the Pesto! -- This is for you, darling. -- this is for you, Darling. Brilliant. Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating  the pre-nup. This is for you, Darling! THIS IS FOR YOU, DARLING! I'd like to offer my congratulations.  That was a beautiful gesture of  Howard's. Yes. He's a diamond in the rough.  And I have a feeling that someday  soon you'll be taking that diamond  and leaving the rough. I am thrilled for you, but tell me  this... How'd you get Howard to do  it? I've addressed enough juries to  appreciate the power of suggestion,  but it seemed like he thought it was  his own idea. Well, when this goes south -- promise  you'll have dinner with me? I figure a couple of months. That's  how long it should take for the ink  on the settlement to dry. Although knowing you as I do -- there  will be no settlement. This time it  will be complete and total  annihilation. Jesus -- What --? -- I've heard some -- I've heard  some sick things -- in my -- What?! Oh Casey Jones was the rounder's  name, T'was on the 6:02 that he rode  to fame! Who is that guy? Rex Rexroth, the mini-mall king.  Getting to be the richest man on the  West Coast, from what they say. Jesus. Hup! Come all you rounders if you  wanna hear... Why're they going to Muncie? He's thinking of buying Indiana. And of course we shall have to  litigate. Sentence. Paragraph. -- Naturally the first concern for  both parties is the welfare of little  Wendell junior. Nevertheless, we  question whether the continuing  expenses for his special ed classes  are truly justified given the great  strides -- Ah, but is she richer than Mrs.  Croesus? She deserves every penny. They pay  great athletes a fortune. Well,  Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the  peak of her power. Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle. She owes me a meal. I know you would, Wrigley. But would  Kramer? Mrs. Doyle for you. Le Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, 1982. Thank you. I'll take care of it. To victory. More pictures? My God, Marylin. You  can open an erotic art gallery. No. Just to comfort you, and  appreciate you -- Should we order? Not hungry, huh? Neither am I. Marylin -- ...and he asked you if...? ..if I reckon I could find someone  to keel him his wife. Who asked you this? Dean Leonard. Da defendant. That guy! Eighteen hunnut billable hours. Twelve  hunnut'n twenty-one motions tuh  void... ...five nunnut'n sixty faw summary  judgenents. A hunnut'n twenty-nine  thousand four hunnut'n seventeen  lunches charged... Counseluh? Counseluh? Hello? Yes? Marylin? Marylin? When did I say...? Marylin? Forgive me but are you --  drunk? You shouldn't be driving. Where are  you? I live right near there. The 800  Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin --  come here right now before -- just  come here. No. Don't stop. Thank you. Yes. I just got that, actually. It  was a gift. No. No. I don't have a... no. It was  from a client. Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans. Me. Yes. Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother. Hmmm... She never particularly cared for me. No. She loved me. She would never  not love her son. She just didn't...  I wasn't her "type." She said I was  a very, colicky baby. You know?  Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't  eat well? We got off to a bad start,  and she never seemed to recoup -- Apparently she was very disappointed. Your mother was. No, we're not! That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch  and yours is a psycho. I can't believe  you're saying this, Marylin! There's  nothing wrong with us. We're  attractive and charismatic and  successful and... I like us. No. Don't go. Stay with me for a while. I have to say -- I'm speechless. No.  I'm never speechless. And I'm not used to -- Marylin --  there's something I want to ask you. I want... I want to... I want to be your -- your wife. No... That wasn't right. I want YOU  to be MY wife. Yes. I am. What else could those  words mean? I believe we belong  together and we can make one another  happy. And we should be happy because  happiness is better than the  alternative which is -- just jump in  any old time, Marylin. You have more  experience at this than I do. Yes? Yes, you do have more experience? You do? No. No ma'am. I have been asleep all my  life up to this moment. Marylin,  will you marry me? I don't have a ring! I have a watch. I'm happy for you, pal. Thanks, buddy. Is she Asian? Asian? No. Well... I'm still... Wrigley? Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley.  Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck. Do you have it? I have it. You have the pre-nup? No. I have the ring. Was I supposed  to have a pre-nup? No. You have the ring. Wrigley has  the pre-nup. Oh. I thought maybe -- Gee! Sarah! How are you? You know each other? Of course you  do. Hi. Hello. Marylin. You know my young associate,  Wrigley. Well, Wrigley brought something else  for you today, darling. This -- is the Massey Pre-nup. Marylin, you're welcome to examine  it, but as you know -- it's iron  clad. We wanted Ruth here for your  protection as well -- Yes. Short notice you know, but I  think there's nice closure to it.  Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as  always. What's up with you two. We're getting married. What's the gag? A gag? No. You got it, Patty. Yes. It's for your protection, sweetheart.  You're the one with the -- the... Should I go out for a smoke? No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin,  if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit  from the marriage. What I mean is, your wealth is  completely protected. But? You're a sitting duck. Do you, Miles Herbert Massey of Massey  Meyerson take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth- Doyle? "Doyle", to be your lawful wedded  wife to -- I do, yah I do, uh huh -- Let me finish! -- Jesus! Haven't you ever been  married before? -- To have and hold, to love and to  cherish, till death do you part? -- I do. And do you, Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth  Doyle, take Miles Herbert Massey of  Massey Meyerson, to be your lawful  wedded husband, to have and to hold,  to love and to cherish, till death  do you part? I now pronounce you man and wife. Mom...? For the first time in my life, I  stand before you naked...  vulnerable... and in love. Love. A  word matrimonial lawyers shy away  from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have  been frightened of this emotion which  is, in a sense, the seed of my  livelihood. But today, I am here to  tell you: Love should cause us no  fear. Love should cause us no shame.  Love... is good. Let me ask you a question. When our  clients come to us confused, angry,  hurting because their flame of love  is fluttering and threatens to die --  should we seek to extinguish that  flame, so that we can sift through  the smoldering wreckage for our paltry  reward? Or should we seek to fan  this precious flame -- this most  precious flame -- back to loving,  roaring life? Should we counsel fear -- or trust?  Should we seek to destroy -- or to  build? Should we meet our clients'  problems with cynicism -- or with  love? Kramer? Build? The decision of course, is each of  ours. For my part, I have made the  leap of love, and there is no going  back -- No. Stay. I want you close to me.  This couch is wrong. It's not a  "married couch." In fact, this is not a married house --  it's a bachelor pad. I know. But I've converted most of  them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms --  a billiard room, a card room, a gym --  Honey, want you to go out, as soon  as you feel up to it -- and buy  married things. Woman things.  Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make  this your house. Here's my card. Spend as much as you  want. We get mileage. Good. Are those foods? Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not  right away -- There's a room right  off the bedroom -- It would be perfect  for a nursery. It's a walk in humidor right now --  but if I took out the refrigeration  unit -- I think a nursery should be right  off the master suite. My parents put  mine in the guest house. Apparently  they did have a Fisher Price intercom,  but my mother turned it off when I  was seven months old because I was  so -- You want children, don't you? That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's  Chen dynasty. And will this be check or --? Very good, Mrs. Massey. Yes? Excuse me? What are you... Is she yours? Yes, I know Howard Doyle. He divorced his wife -- he married  Marylin -- he divorced Marylin --  and he -- remarried his WIFE? What  kind of sick -- He never ate the pre-nup, did he! Did Marylin end up with money? I don't have a pre-nup Don't give me that crap. That's MY  crap. I'll have you suspended. I'll have  you disbarred. ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why? Hello Marylin. I bet. I love you. I want to have your baby. Can you Marylin? Can you return the  trust? Can you return the hopes? The  dreams? Can you just... I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's  chic and timeless and elegant and  eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It  is YOU. How far would this gun have to be in  order to inflict a wound without  leaving powder burns on the scalp. Approximately three feet. And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot  herself in the back of the head from  a distance of three feet? Really long arms? They won't get a conviction. The  husband called it in as a suicide.  The forensic guys weren't thinking  murder. I'm sure some of the evidence  was compromised. It's your move, Miles. I already made my move, Kenneth. Breathe through it. That's good, Marylin. Marylin Hamilton Rexroth Doyle Massey? We have a warrant for your arrest. You can go now, Mrs. Massey. Someone  made bail. Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail! I don't know. Maybe I should grab my  mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have  little experience with "the criminal  mind." I don't believe you have "things." What do you want? Are you threatening me, because I'm  sure that's a violation of the terms  of your bail. The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting  a refund. I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported  every dollar I've ever made. Try  again, girlfriend. What kind of "stuff?" Those are gifts. You can't prove anything. You're out of your league, Marylin.  Rexroth was a primate. I'm a  professional. Meaning my house. Did our marriage ever mean anything  to you? That's blackmail. Pity you can't be here. You'd enjoy  this. This woman has humbled, shamed and  disgrazed the entire foim. Yes Herb, Counseluh, this foim deals in powuh.  This foim deals in p'seption. This  foim cannot prospuh... nor long  endowwa. if it is p'seeved as dancin'  to the music.. -- of the hoidy-goidy. I understand Herb... I just... for  the first time in my career -- I  don't know what to do. I'm a patsy.  A sitting duck. I'm lost. Lost! I'll tell you what you can do,  you can -- -- leave us. -- You can act like a man. Let me  tell you sumpn, smart guy. You tawt  you had it all figgud out. Trust.  Marriage. All ya goddamn love love  love. Well now you lissean me. I'm  gonna talk to you about the goddamn -- We SOIVE THE LAW! We HONUH the  law! We make our goddamn bread and  BUTTUH by the law! And sometimes,  counseluh, we OBEY THE LAW -- -- but conseluh -- This is not one a  those times. Simpson started a trend. ...Are you Joe? ...Dumbarton? I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton,  on a... matter of some delicacy. Who's the pigeon? Excuse me? Who do you want me to kill? Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr.  Dumbarton -- would like you to uh,  neutralize a, uh, business associate  by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle  Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey. Is that... one person? Here's her picture... ...and the address where she's  staying. It's the residence of a Mr.  Massey. Uh, Dumbarton. Massey. Uh,  it's not Mr. Dumbarton's house. Though  he's not involved. And because of an  impending legal action this needs to  happen within a certain... time frame.  Uh... on an expedited basis. You're in a rush. Mr. Dumbarton is, yes. She won't suffer, will she? ...not unless you pay extra. I've been working on the railroad -- All the livelong day! I've been working on the railroad Just to pass the time away! Can'tcha hear the whistle... the  whistle... AWWWWWWW. Awwwwwww -- Hello. Yes, he's here. Just a minute -- Miles. It's for you. Hello. Yes -- what?! Yes -- I see -- My God. What? That was Marvin Untermeyer. Yes? He was Rex Rexroth's personal  attorney. What do you mean, was. Rex just had a massive coronary. In  the middle of a business meeting.  He's dead. I'm sorry to hear that. But you  weren't close, were you? Marvin says that Rex's will is four  years old. He never redrafted it. Yes. Everything goes to Marylin. She's rich. We're still married. We  have no pre-nup. So, that's good, right? This is Joe. Wuddya need? Joe. This is Mr. uh... friend of --  we met. This is to instruct you it's  No Go! Do you understand me?! NO GO  on Marylin Rexroth Doyle -- No Go. Who was that? That was -- oh, shit. What if he's  on his way over there? Huh? Marylin! What have I done? I don't know, but don't call me  Marylin. Get her out, buy some time; get her  out -- Marylin? You have to leave the house  immediately! No buts. Now. Out. Please! Leave the house. So did I. Now pack up a few basics  and -- Mr. Dumbarton. No... That's his lawyer. Who's the pigeon? Marylin? Joe! Thank God you're in time. You're  not in time. I'm in time. Thank God  I'm in time. It's a no go! Get it? No one any the  wiser. Okay! You can go home now! Goodbye! Thanks  so much! No no! No contract! It's all over. Marylin! Wait! He works for YOU? You were going to have this thug...? You're calling me a pestilence? That's  a hoot! Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband.  I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No  matter what happened to you. Lemme tell you something. You are  the pestilence. I'm the exterminator. It was fifty for you. That's cause you're a lawyer. I gave  her the lawyer discount. But I shouldn't of. Cause you're a  whore. A whore who worships the  dollar. Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like  you. And my clients? Whores just  like you. Were you with a firm? Kaplan. Kaplan? I know Kaplan. Wait. You're  Joe Gittelson? I knew you looked --  You were great -- we studied you. Twenty years in "matrimonial law"  and it made me sick. I broke up homes and families, never  givin' it a second thought. Till one  day. I had an epiphany. You know  what that is? Came with a damn stigmata if you can  believe that! I said to myself --  Joe -- everyone you see wants blood.  Everyone wants their ex's dead. So  why jerk around with rest. You wanna  best serve your clients? Kill em. Marylin. Run. I'll distract him. Joe! WE told him it was no go... Hello Marylin. Hard to believe this is the way it  will end up for us. But then -- I guess -- something  inside me died when I realized that  you'd hired a goon to kill me. Where does that leave us? You wounded me first, Marylin. You're forgetting Howard Doyle? Income tax evasion? Murder! You know... there's nothing in the  Massey pre-nup that says it can't be  executed after the parties wed. Let's go home. Wait. Just wait for one minute. Sweet  Jesus, are you crazy? Sorry, Mr. Massey. Thought you cleared  that shit out. You know, man... those things'll  kill ya. I know all you old boomer  potheads like em. They're illegal,  and you get to put em in fancy boxes --  but -- shit man! It's still tobacco. Pre-Castro. Here, buddy. These are for you. Great. Now I can die. Well. You'd say "they devoted a whole  semester at Harvard to your Dad. But  your Mom was the one that ever only  nailed his ass." I thought so.
