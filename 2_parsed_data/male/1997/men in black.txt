And if I say yes? Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president. I gotta be honest about something. And Goodwill Toward Man? I guess I lost: What the hell... So... this door. It's... not an exit... ? Yes. That's true. Actually, at this point, I just want A job. Wait. What do you mean... yet? of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and-- Wait. Uh-- sir. Please. Anyway. Hook-head-guy. I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think-- Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain. I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head... Well, I dunno. I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious. Uh... yes. Apparently I did, air. Hesitated, sir. It'll make sense later? So... wait. You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it. Sorta literally gets ahead of himself. Yes, air? -- OOOMPH. Yes, sir. What happens if I say no? No-- it makes sense. Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something. Sir. I thought those records were sealed. Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly... I... I don't know, air. This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know. It's just still find it a little... humorous. I'm sorry. Sir. They don't? ... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct-- Yes, air. But I'm usually wrong. Sir. All the time, sir. Actually, sir-- Then where did it-- ? Sir. Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad-- Bull... loney- Sir. I'm sorry. Sir, I'm sorry. Sir. I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you. I mean, everything here comes from you. Further... what are you talking about, air? That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--Oh no, I can't do this job by myself. Kay, you're scaring your partner. Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people. You coulda told me what you were doing. After I got the shit beat out of me! Getting eaten!? That was your plan!? Kay!? in case I need it? Wow... this one's cool. And it looks just like a shotgun. Do his job. Would you call this a code 100? All of it? Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they? For how long? Since how long? What are you doing? That's my point. For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things. He said our enemy in already here. Well maybe it is. Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here. I know you don't trust him. You don't trust anybody-- Kay. All I'm saying-- Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true. Yes. Well, in his own mind, yeah. What if, from his point of view, he is? Kay-- What if he's telling the truth? I dunno, man. Maybe we should. The Pentagon. Jesus Christ... Jesus... That's the Loch Ness Monster. And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes? You think that's what's-happening? The radio show? What's going on, Kay? Looks like a train ticket. And what's this ... ? I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?. Gee. You really think? There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia. I take it there's a reason we're going to this one. Then wouldn't we also know if he's here? Now what? A what? I guess it's simple, huh? They're either gone... or dead. what's this? I dunno. Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn. Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates? Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me. What? Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ? Um-- Kay? Why? Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun. I know I don't know you all that well, but-- Well, one thing's for sure. You could certainly lighten up. Ha ha. No, really. What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock? I think you're too used to it. If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long. I know, I know. I read the manual. No attachments. We work alone. Blah. blah. Hey, I was workin' her. I was workin' my thing. I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot. And what if I wanted to see her again? I'd have to completely re-introduce myself. I'm just saying it was cold. I think she kind of liked me. I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here.. I think she's the alien. In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room. I know, but we're on a college campus... I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing. I think it'd be a good look for you, too. I'll even help you choose a tattoo. Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa. I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh... So... lemme get this straight. We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets. We got information no one else in the world is privy to. And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect? But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect. It's a bug. I understand. Hey, it works for the Hasids, right? No one recognizes them. Oh. Right. I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way. Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it? Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space. Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity. Kay. Seriously. What if he actually means what he says? Sure. You know, there's something we never really thought of... Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet? I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it? Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of. They respond to fear, right? What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is? Okay. If you've got a bug problem-a big one. And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them? Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little... Actually... I don't know. What do we do? Lean into it. So... how did they get here? When? But it's definitely a nest, isn't it? What is it? Why not? I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort. Actually, you may have. Exactly. I very much enjoy that. Right, right-- I like that stuff. Oh, yeah, well, you know. I'm a big fan. I've read all your work. I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt. So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...You're not taking me in! Yes. Yes, that's eminently fair of you. I understand. I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser? I figured it didn't matter. It's my last day of business. I was wrong. I'm sorry. Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids. The kid looked desperate. I figured... No.Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe. It's easy. You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after. Oh, you'll still, be guarding him. No. just peace on Earth. We have one motto: Peace on Earth. You got smeared. Kids' game a couple galaxies over. ...touch that. It's not even a fucking door. It means I know you think you got a beat on things. But trust me, you don't. You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world. And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine. Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him. So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat. And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing. Now I'm sorry. But this has been one long, bad day. Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth? Cowan-- Cowan-- Obvious? Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside. The hell were you thinking? You shot an eight year old girl. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your choice of targets. The hell happened? Dee. God damn it. I told you to go home. Dee, you've been useful for 50 years. We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest. Yup. Sure is. Don't worry about it. Grab the coffee, will ya? I told Zed I'd give him a buzz. I wasn't scared... Don't worry about it. It's been a long night. Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember? Don't worry about it. Four-Eyes'll run a track on him. We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of. Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little. Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home. What? I thought you just-- Mikey. Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me. Mikey. I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey Gimme the 140. Three, huh? Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four? Huh? No? Which do you have your money on, Dee? You heard me. You two, especially. Underground gas vein. Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns. Actually that's a very good question. The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here. This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it. This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain. More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block. I said I need you to look right here. DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH. Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go. Vayanse. You others, go on. INS, Washington. Special services. We'll take it from here. I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement. Not her. Me. They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful. There wasn't time, sport! And I almost got digested. It goes with the job. You were saying? Do IT! SHOOT HIM! In case I need it. Actually, it is a shotgun. Hold onto it-- Right. Oh, and here. I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel. You guys get to the Memorial. Keep this stuff hidden. The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to... I'd double it and add 20. It's marble. We saw it in the office. It went from this big... to big... in a day. Maybe they didn't get here. Maybe they've been here. Since as long as we've been keeping records... Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing. That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury. Did it leave when everything else left? Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now-- I know what you're saying. And I'm telling you I don't trust him-- Great. Fine. Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers. I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs. How does that help me? He's here to help!? Hang on. There's gotta be something on this guy. Did you contact the Alliance? Do they have anything? You know something? I actually never think of that. I gotta get some coffee. Oh, yeah? Fill us in, why don't you. "Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..." Where's it coming? Where's he landing? We're rising. Get back in the car! Ernie Goose? Cynthia? I think that's what's happening... No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards. I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds. Where to? What? Why did Mikey leave Nazca? Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why? Something's wrong here. There's a god damn good reason. He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is. Hold it. A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left. History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid. They use it to make our food digestible for their systems. Or someone has a nitrogenizer. Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe? It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife. All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own. Let's check am out. If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage? Something seem unusual to you about that? Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD. Jay winces. You don't know me at all. Why? It was a long time ago.- I taught kindergarten. You don't know the half of it. If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone. Believe me, you get used to it. Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot? Or is it actually being an idiot? Besides-- Such a shame, too. Cause you made such a good impression the first time. She didn't even know you. . Keep her out of here while I check it out. This is a college? I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival. It's the way we do it. The way we've always done it. So what's the problem? Right. The point is to not call attention to ourselves. We wear black. Let's go, Jeebs. Downtown. And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me-- And I'm arranging deportation papers. Your licence is revoked. Permanently. You figured what? Maybe you need a closer look. What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack. Recognize this? Goodwill... Not bad. Briliiant, actually. You come unarmed, and alone. Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150? No-- a Person is smart. People are dumb. And the more people you put together, the dumber they get. And you know that. Why don't you ask the Mosebacke? Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork. Today, they don't exist. Pardon me. I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have. How is this going to help? What are you talking about, it's coming? What's coming? Try seven. From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident. You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh? Oh yeah? Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to? You know how many rules you've just broken? I don't believe you, Mikey. And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon. Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere. Cause I think we're looking at it. Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it? Did he say where? Did our friend announce when he's making his speech? I know what this is. Zed, you in? Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years? ... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia? Yeah, I'll talk to you. So... now what? Cattle call again? This guy. Where was he? Tell us the truth. You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood. I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make. Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now. In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute. They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon. Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals-- Wait-- listen-- Which way? We need to talk to you about the alien. But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before. We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau. We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere. May I have a look? This it? We're from Scientific American. We read about your discovery. We'd like to take a look. Just a guess. But I think found a nest. Don't tell me. Insects. Yeah? What's up? Oh shit! Did it leave? Where's he making his big speech? They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS? And they're buying it? I'm getting a trajectory... Dee? What are you doing here? Keep an eye on things there. We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels. Jesus, everyone's moving. Could be an assembly. Does it look aggressive? What about the other agents? Ella? Tee? What the hell is going on? Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why? Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons. Fine. Good.I just wanted to scare em. So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing... I promised I wouldn't tell. Found it. I wanna make a deal. Will it lower the curve? What if I don't? They're not my pals--It's... coming. I dunno. One? Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up. Er. well, nowhere special. Nowhere.And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet... If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering? Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.You do? Cowan. Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong? Look. I don't know why. I could guess, however. Maybe it's your attitude. Or that you're not even close to a team player. Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors. Well this didn't. Actually, it didn't come from me. Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.Most entirely. Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated. Give or take. It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last. We were waiting till your planet was warm enough. Come on now. People are smart. How could it not? That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN. Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup. We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it. A good question. And a simple answer. No more hunger. No more smog. No more overpopulation. No more war. Why, you might ask? Because you're ready. Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it. That's why you have doors, Mr. President. Keys, however, are to lock the doors. And locks, as you know, are to keep people out. Why? Fear. You humans are afraid. So you set up boundaries. Borders. Your car. Your home. Your country. All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you. Well I am here to let that enemy go. Because there's a border you didn't even know existed. It's the border to the Universe. And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you. It was set up by others, to keep you away from them. Until now. Because I have been sent here to open the door. To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe. Now, what are we looking at? Keys. Look at them all. Why do we have them? Mr. President?No. But You'll get used to it. Welcome to the Men in Black. His physics are a little different than ours. Don't worry Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too. Dave. Hell of an assistant, isn't he? Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him. Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware. Be safe. Have a good day. Oh, uh... Cowan? From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way. Understand? Only the damn guy won't know it. Mrs. Edelson? You think we're nuts. We're the government, Cowan. For instance... It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then... What's so funny, cadet Cowan? They don't. Now, son. If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways. Here's a little piece of advice: Don't use this so much. Your supervisors have no idea why you're here. I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across. Me, too. I feel a long day coming on. Yeah. His dream and our worst nightmare. Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It? How'd you know? And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates? Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from? I got a planet check on that bug. It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system. Actually, I don't know... Well, it wasn't in the jar... They haven't announced it yet. All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history. As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed. All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public. They went right to the President. What do we have? Are we showing anything? They're gone. Hard to tell. I hope not. Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off. Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game. Shots got a lot to mop up. Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning. He's gone, too. I need you in Philadelphia. I got a code 90, in a-high school. Kay? What's your 20? So whattya say, kid? You in or out? How's Dee?How'd you know that? Kay? Actually, yeah-- Noon exactly. Yeah, Kay? Nope. Nothing at all. Nothing. We've got about eight or nine prospects I want you look--
