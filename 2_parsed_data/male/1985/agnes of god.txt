Look into the convent records. ??? I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here. There was blood on her hand that night.If I find anything I'll call you. You're too involved Marty. Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else? What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case. You got to be crazy. What? You think that the girl is innocent? I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want? Marty, what are you doing here? Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me. But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes. Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case. Do you still go to church? And you had a sister who died in the convent. Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her. Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
