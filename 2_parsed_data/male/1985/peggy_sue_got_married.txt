Hi this is Charlie and... Come on, say your name. And we're here on the couch... We're here on the sofa bed... ...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something. Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed. But you love me don't you? And nothing will ever change that. Boy, have they changed. Who gets it? Oh, gotta go. Here's a little make�out music. Goddamnit, I just can't hit those high notes anymore. Did I hear 70 dollars? What do you  need 50 dollars for? How's your Mom? Coming through. Frank, watch the clock. Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it. I mailed it to you on Wednesday. Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office. You got a Tab? You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to... I'll think of a way to sell, them. One day. I'm not going. Come on Dad! Be right there. I'll go through the rest of this stuff next weekend. Bye Mom. I never thought it would go this far. Here Charlie, extra fortune cookies. Good luck. Thanks. Next week you'll be selling Sanyo remote control VCRs for three hundred and ninety�nine dollars? Oh no! Crazy Charlie... You'll give away Mitsubishi giant screen TVs for twelve hundred and ninety�five dollars! Oh no! I'll go broke! Crazy Charlie... You won't be undersold on stereos, videos, microwaves or blenders! Crazy Charlie, Crazy Charlie, I'm not breaking cookies, I'm smashing prices. Fabian) Crazy Charlie, he insane. You took this seriously. You're a real blast from the past. You always were a crazy little gal, Peg. You and your mother both seem to fall for musicians. Hey, there's Terry and Leon. Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher? You look exactly the same. Oh, I'm sorry.. Peggy Sue Kelcher, my wife Sharon. Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh. Gee. I'm sorry to hear that. Mr. Norvik. Or, uhh, Richard?  David Snell, Merrill Lynch.  I read about the Cordex deal in Business Week. Congratulations. Thank you, Doug. Hi Peggy. How are you? How's Char1ie? ...fifth generation core capacities are going to cause another shake�out in the smaller companies. Your damn computers put me out of business. You're a billionaire, and I'm a goddamn failure. I'm glad you asked, Dolores. Four years ago Maddy and I found Jesus... Just call me Walter the dancing dentist. Taps and caps. My specialty. Whoa! Cat fight! Purse war! Sure. I remember you. Turns out I love business. Every morning I wake up, thank God I'm alive, and say Who am I gonna screw today? Let's play "Rate the Moment". I give tonight an eighty�seven. Better than sex, not as good as racquetball. The best thing about being a dentist. Pure pharmaceutical grade. A couple of lines of this, I can drill my own teeth... moment) Hi. Joe would have enjoyed this. God, I still miss him. I can't remember. Did I make it with you in high school? Youth is like an amputated leg. Long after it's gone, you still feel it. My wife's a cow, my son has shit for brains, and my daughter's in India with Mother Teresa. For the fitness generation, we've sure got a lot of porkers. I don't know why I came back. I hated high school. Are we through Dolores? Good. You'll be okay? The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four�eyed worm. You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that. You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine. Dancing with you. I guess part of us never really leaves high school. Here comes the life of the party. You know, they could've at least asked us to sing. We'd refuse, of course, but they could've asked us. Hello. Can I have your attention, please. I know it's getting kind of late, and some of you have a long drive home, so the reunion committee decided it was time for the moment you've all been waiting for. You don't know what you've been waiting for because we didn't tell you, but the committee has selected a King and Queen. Now don't worry, I took care of it so the band's gonna keep playing for at least another hour, and my old pal Judge Crystal said that the bar can stay open as long as we want. And while you're at it, let's have a nice big hand for the Little Lady that did such a great job supervising all the decorations, Rosalie Testa. Now back to business. The members of the committee have given this a lot of thought and decided on the two people who best represent the spirit of Buchanan High's Class of '60. The king is someone who, in more ways than one, has come a long, long way since he left here. We're proud to welcome him back, Richard Norvik! Come on up here, King Richard! I demand a recount. Sharon and I thank you all for making us feel so welcome. It's good to be back. Every king deserves a queen. Now, we had a Lot at worthwhile candidates. And I don't want any of you ladies to feel left out, 'cause you're all beautiful. But when we sent out the invitations, we didn't mention anything about this being a costume party. Maybe we should have, 'cause just looking at her brings it all back for us. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our queen, Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell. Come on up here, Peggy Sue. I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie. No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway. Hey! I just made a deposit in your blood bank. Now I want to make a withdrawal. I'm changing banks! Girls? Evelyn? Who left this thing outside? What do you think? Peggy Sue, what do you think? Young lady, you're drunk! I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded. This is not giving blood. This is drunk. Evelyn, put her to bed. Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump. Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again. You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits. If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too? Well, at least you stopped calling me Daddy�O. How do you feel? Come on. Get in. I can take care of that. Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today. I call this the staccato. Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night. You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense. How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget? I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again. It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out. And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean? Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents? You're more shook up than you want to admit. You'll get used to it, we'll still see each other 2, 3 times a week. Want me to drive you home later? Would I?!! Why I oughta... Good morning, students. This is Mr. Mosey. Our girls diving team is competing today in the county finals at Commander Beck High School. We know they'll put forth a splendid effort � so let's wish them luck. Finally, congratulations go to Richard Norvik for placing first in the Statewide Math Contest. We're proud of you, Richard....That's all, students. Santiago comes back, with nothing � there's no meat on the bone. It's Hemingway's ego defending itself again; he's trying to prove he can still perform. Why does your father take inventory on Sunday night? That's poker night. You always got out of it before. I've got to string him along for a while. It's for his own good. But you're not going into his business. When're you going to tell him? Soon. I can't tall everybody everything all at once. Strange rumors are sweeping the school about you. Prom what I hear, you really gave it to old Smellgrove. Atta girl, Peg. Why I oughta... That's enough out of you, little lady. I'll throw the book at you! Why I oughta... She's not wasting any time. Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root? He's a nice guy. You know he's writing a book? Oh, a book... Excuse me for a second. It really wasn't that difficult. What're you doing, Peggy Sue? Fishing for four�eyed worms? I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy. All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four�thirty. I have a rocket club meeting. Come on, Peggy Sue.. Try it again. You haven't been practicing. Looking good out there. I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious. In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah... Yeah. Like that. I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about? Are you doing some kind of science project? Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed. And then, there's Richard's Burrito. That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland. Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other. You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants. Okay. I promise. You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me. Oh yeah? How, did you know about my grandfather? Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule! But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it? I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain. You look pretty good for a corpse. You're giving me the creeps. There's one way to find out. Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door. Step in front of the truck! If you're dead, it won't matter. The truck'll go right through you. Go ahead! You're dead! Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible. Einstein said "God doesn't play dice with the universe." I'm a scientist. I believe that there's an order to things. Why would God bring you back as a high school girl? You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack. All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy. What if you're not here tomorrow? Hello, Charlie. Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store? Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you. You may have noticed that Peggy Sue's been acting a little strange lately. Yes, sir. She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes. Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school. Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter. Yes, sir. Trust is a two�way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands. We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you. What would that be, sir? Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself. Of course. Great, isn't it? Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right? Is this slow enough for you? I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals? It's great. I cleaned the car, do you like it? Oh, I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday, you like him, right? He's cool. Eighteen is half of thirty six. It's "Gentlemen start your engines", vroom, like I'm gassed up ready for the race. I've got the girl, I've got the car, I've got the talent, but I don't know. Do I date, get married, join the army, cut a record, go to college? I got a million choices, but nobody teaches you how to choose. But it's different for a girl. You're Lucky. You just have to wait for me. Gol'darnit, dag nab it, dad burn it, dad blame it. Here comes the life of the party. Goes down, smooth. Hey, look what the cat dragged in. Have no fear. Charlie's here. Oh, it's you is it. Jumping Jehosophat! It's a miracle! Now that's a purty little heifer. Why Pete's the best darn cook on the Panhandle! Ready. Set. Go - Hi�Yo Silver! A cloud of dust, a galloping horse with the speed of light, a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful Masked Rider of the Plains came to Earth with powers- and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear - from out of the... You doorknob! You threw in Superman! Too bad. Close to a record. I hate it when the beer comes out my nose. The Yanks got the hitting but the Sox got the defense. I'l1 take Kubek and Richardson over Fox and Aparicio. Pitching wins pennants. The Tigers got four potential twenty game winners. Like who? Don Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Sunning and Paul Foytack. And now, direct from three weeks of rehearsal in Walter's garage, four guys who have dedicated their lives to becoming the greatest singing group in the world... (beat) Charlie, Walter, Leon and Terry. The Definitions. One, two, three-... Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff? Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry? Put on some make�out music, and kill the lights. There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you.. Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right.  You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals.  Like fertility rites. What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing? Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in. You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will. What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it? But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait. Who? You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late. What is this? What the hell is going on? One week you say, "If you love me you won't", now you say "If you love me you will". Excuse me. That's a guy's line! You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood. Save it. Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature. He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author � fat, violent, drunk... A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life! What're you doing here anyway? I thought chicks like you traveled in packs. Okay. What, why? That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie. This is great reefer. The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy. Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell�O for me, Mom.' The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club. Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You  blew some pot. What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life? You know, I had you pegged all wrong. A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire. No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one? Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms calms down) I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. I'll respect you for eternity. 'When you are old and gray, and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, Take down this book, and slowly read, And dream of the soft look your eyes had once." I didn't write that. That's Yeats. Your parents are waiting up. You know, I see a lot of this in the spring. Good luck. Damn that Charlie I Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you? Thank God for that. Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay. All right. But this better be good. Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government. That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into. I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room! Evelyn, take her to her room! The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world. But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents? I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help! No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you... I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them. Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner. Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty�fifty. That's not fair. You're taking advantage of a minor. A Ton on a Bun, with fries. Come on. You can't be serious. Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym? Let's see... icrowavemays, ocketpay alculatorcays... All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's. What are you talking about? High tech. I like the sound of that. Look at that freezer chest. What capacity. Hello Peggy Sue. Fine, just fine. Charlie's in the back. My future daughter�in�law. Very affectionate girl. I'll just take the Ravel. Take the Shostakovich home and listen to it. Let it grow on you. Everyone that's bought it has come back and said, "This is definitive Shostakovich. Thank you for encouraging me to investigate it." Well, I did enjoy the Dvorak you suggested. Young man, you talked me into it. You'll like it. I kid you not. Nothing.. Selling is selling. Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts. Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why? Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you. Don't be cruel to a heart that's true. Doing some shopping? For me? Sweetheart, they're beautiful. But they must've been expensive. Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank. It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up. This morning was good. I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business? That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up. Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win. Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats. I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -�how could you do that? I'm not shouting. Have we ever starved? Have we ever missed a mea1? I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of. We'll make it, we'll be fine. This is your great invention? Would you wear those things? That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them. You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea? I have to talk to you.. Let's go down to the basement. I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons... Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love �� Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted? You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this. Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man. I will be happy if I have you. I love you. What are you talking about? Who's Janet? What about everything I said to you this afternoon... But what has to be different? What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me? You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us. What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian! What are you doing? That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future? That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny. Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht. Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion? Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before? Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back. No offense, but you're pretty out of it now. You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. open) We'll start with something easy. What is your name? Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips? What will they be made of? Silicon is from sand. In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her? You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex? Will you take of f your blouse? Richard, are you in there? No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it. One... two... three. You are now awake. Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you. I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest. Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis. Moose?  I never thought I'd have moose for desert. Peggy Sue cooked the whole dinner. You know, you should open a restaurant. How does a young gal like you know so much about business? Really? Ah, Ed, why don't you and I adjourn to the den for a while? That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid. Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone. To freedom. Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and... Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us. Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah. Thank you. Now we're happy to introduce, a friend of ours. He's one damn fine singer, Mr. Charlie Dell! But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation. But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together. At least one more time. You think so? I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah. What a treat. Now I get it. Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause. Can we split now? I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something. My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook. It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now. Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn? Peggy Sue, watch your mouth. Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool! What're you doing here? Rusty's dead. That's Ajax Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while. How'd you know about that? Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with? Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other. That's real big of you. You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why? Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it. If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement? Does this mean you like me again? That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand. Hey Charlie, what do you think of this? Walter, maybe you should be a dentist. And finally, our heartiest congratulations to our girls diving team for placing second in the county finals last Friday. And a special accolade to Rosalie Testa who placed first in every one of her events. We're proud of you, Rosalie. What's the matter? Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip. Peggy, I believe you. I believe everything you told me. It's wonderful. You're the exception that proves the rule. Hey, Peggy. Wait a minute. I cut shop and did some work on your song. You know, it's not half bad for your first try. Of course, I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs". Listen to this. Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres. Everybody gettin' off at Dumont. Here we are. No trouble at all. Hello, Lilla! Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb. What's the matter, Lilla? Somebody jump on your grave? What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy�five? Eighty? I've been trying to drag it out of her for years. You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future. Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller. It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains. It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together. I'd take better care of my teeth. It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off. Let's go. Stag movies. Smokers. I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you. The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one. Welcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to have you with us. You know, you're a lucky girl. You could lay a bear trap in the aisle of the cathedral and never catch a better man than your grandfather. Let me take your jacket, Lilla. I've got, to get my robe. You know, this is very exciting for all of us. We've been waiting a long time for someone like you. It wouldn't be a lodge without hats. Don't you worry. I'll be watching after you. Hey, George. Get the lights. Are you ready, dear? Lord of the Universe, Vast and Mighty One. Ruler of Light, King of~ the sun. Creator of earth, air, fire and water. We adore thee and invoke thee! Grant thine aid. Look with favor upon us as we witness the regeneration of man. We behold the innocent endeavors of single�minded men and women. For we are the company of unbodied souls and immortal angels. We ask thy intervention, that this girl may return to thee on the wings of your Love. Fount of life, Chariot of the Spirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim thy child of light. The name of your love is sacrifice. We offer up this girl, that her soul may find its home. Nothing to worry about. Somebody get the lights. Well, the girl's gone. Let's play some poker. I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you. You're going to listen to me. Right here. Now sit down. Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore. Because I love you, damnit! I had a long talk with your father yesterday and we decided that the best thing for us to do is get married and settle down. Right away. What? You're crazy! You're really out of your mind! Oh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. I won't bother you anymore. I promise. Please stop crying. Please. Of course. It's almost your birthday. I wasn't sure when you were coming back, so I brought your present up here. It opens, too. Look inside. I love you. I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain. What the hell is that? Peggy! Where're you going? Come back! But I love you. I'll love you forever. Come back to me. Richard, do something! I can't! It's out of control! Peggy! (singing softly). Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue... I thought you were...for a while. But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue. I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you. That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger. Everyone.  Maddie and Arthur, Carol and Walter. Richard Norvick.  And here's a book, by that guy from high school, Michael Fitzsimmons.  He dedicated it to you. I'll just set it right here. Oh, God, Dion. I'll never give up. I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped. Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can... Well, I'll let you get some rest...so long. You know, Peggy, there's so many things to look forward to in the future. Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip. So are you. You've got a vision. Did you break up with Charlie? Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me. Wait! I'll go with you!
