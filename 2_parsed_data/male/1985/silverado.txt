What do you mean, the horses? No money, eh? You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die. Posse? What the hell you talking about?If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses. The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it. I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now. Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them... ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job. My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue. Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind. I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here. Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word. Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids. There's nobody coming? Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense? What friend is that? You're in here for winging a guy? ...And you had to kill him? That's why they got you in jail? Howdy, Jake. What's going on here? Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie. Sounds good. Did it seem short to you? McKendrick. Gotta go. Kate? Is he alive? Where's Jake? Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean. Have to. I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too. I'm sorry. That's it. I'd be worse if you hadn't come along. Where are we? ...Gotta go... Maybe we'll see you sometime. Where were you? That I do. I already did that. How's Mr. Parker doing? You must have known that before you came. Are you all right? Yeah... that must have been it. You don't make it easy on a fellow. That's why I'm here. Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon. I just came out to say goodbye. Paden sends his best. The Parkers seem like nice folks. Have you thought at all about your plans? Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters. Hobart, what are you people doing here? My name is Emmett. I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley. I'll be long gone. I haven't done anything. Right... I thought they always did it at dawn. So long, kid. I'm sorry. I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right. All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig. I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him. You might make a farmer yet. I'll see you around. Pleased to meet you, Sheriff. I'm going to California with my brother. Yeah? I'll be around. Where you been? Anybody got any ideas? You haven't got any money. No hard feelings. It never is. But he's my brother. We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this. I understand. Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there. He is that. Which way do you mean? I expect. I expect. It's a town... Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado. I gotta be going. I see what you like, she's mighty pretty. Yeah, maybe a bath. South of here, past Chimayo. I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy. Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going? Looks like that's not all they admired. I had to get up anyway. No, Leavenworth. Not for five years. Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.That's a lie. Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle. I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here. Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land. The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here. They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway. She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm... ...just like you. I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.And they were two of them. Look -- This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us. And you're not Baxter, either? You're not Baxter? I've got my people sitting down there... ...swatting flies and raring to go.It was my fault. Your next water ain't for three days. I think we lost 'em. Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me. The one with the shotgun. Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me. No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun. So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me. So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back. Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there. All I did was kiss a girl. You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here. Emmett! Am I glad to see you! New record. What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me? All I did was kiss the girl. Who is he? This a friend of yours? He'll be here. We wait. That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut. Blind Pete taught me a great trick. Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete? Right! Yeah, that's what happened with me too. Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn. You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?I want you out of town before the hanging. Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends. Ten A.M. In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me. I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move. You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction. Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now. There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them. Are these your friends? Don't press your luck, Carter. Is that a fact? I don't like that word much, Carter. What's all this then? Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. The jury saw it differently. But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging? We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts. Now let's talk about you chaps.Right. She was hurt... pretty bad. Emmett, they took the little boy with them. McKendrick's men got him. I almost didn't. So far that's all I seen in this life. I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here. You'll never make it. This was my father's. The men who killed him took it. I didn't just come along. I was looking for you. Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it. Someplace safe. How you feeling? Sure. Yeah... maybe. So long. Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses. After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time. Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone. What about the law? You own this land. Who? What happened? Where is Rae? Daddy? That ain't right. Is there a place in town that takes... my kind? I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place. Why him? Why would they stop you? They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through. Because you're my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him. Rae, I need help. Rae, all we got is each other. What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you. I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay. He was murdered. Daddy's dead. Hello, Rae. Yeah, it's working out real good. I got there just short of too late. You don't know? Because they enjoy it. This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.Forget it. All right then. Let's go. That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied. I didn't know you were out. Emmett. I heard that too. We'll handle that. He's careless. He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.I've got a job. Last one to the Midnight Star buys. Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine. This is Sheriff Cobb. All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up. Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living. I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking. I'll see you around. Oh, I was just checking the, ah... ...you know, lookin' in. You know, hanging around with you is no picnic. All right, you buy me a drink. C'mon, I'll buy you a drink. Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry. It's not going to be easy. You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more. I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck. Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort. Doesn't look quite fair. Women? They got a saloon there? What's Turley like? Going to Turley, was it? And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about. 'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it. I surely do miss that hat. Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath. Where's Turley? Where's the pinto going? Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck. Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay. I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue? Jefferson City? Offend anybody lately? You got no idea what they were after? What's that? Why? Believe it. And a pretty lady. Never will again. He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us. Let's get out of here. I don't want you getting anyone in my place. That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended. Get out of here, Jake. Oh, a guy who got run out of town... He is now. Where's your brother? What now? We didn't get that far. The other guy drew first. I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses. I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere. I was afraid of that. So this is the guy you're going to hang? You're kidding. We'd rather stay. Where's Emmett now? Lucky. I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett? Why are they doing this, Mal? Good luck, Mal. Yeah. Bad luck. Good-bye, Cobb. What's she got to do with it? Cobb, you've got nothing I need. I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight. We didn't talk about this. They took the little boy, Cobb. Yeah, maybe I will too. Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you. I'm a great believer in doing nothing. What is it you want from me? Well, thanks, but forget it. It is that. This is a lot of money. Maybe we ought to ask Stella. You didn't tell me you owned a saloon. Luck, I guess. I just got to town. Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine. You're right. You've got a legitimate job. I've given that up. Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it. It's been a while. Hello, Cobb. You better get in there with her until this thing is over. I don't want you to get hurt. I like your attitude. But it can be risky. Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time. You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am. What makes you say that? What do you mean? He left me. Give me some of the good stuff. Oh, yeah? How good? What's this? I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey. Is this a fair mix? Who's the owner? Why'd you go into business with him? So-called? You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling? It's the only place I'm happy. And I know what I'm talking about. My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon. Stella... Are you the midnight star herself? Paden. I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss -- Nifty. You work here?Really? I'm done talking. Get out. We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits. Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks. Kelly, get over here. You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you? Kelly, meet my friend Paden. Did you hear his son is still around? Things are getting messy around here. I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed. What about his brother? He must be pretty good. Good-bye, Paden. What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us. Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend. But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt. I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella. I never could count on you to be reasonable. Don't force me to make an adjustment around here. You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days. I thought we talked about that. I'm going to have to look into this. So we understand each other? Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us. You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us. Easy, boy. Just an idea. Maybe you could run it without Stella. I told you this was a sweet set-up. I took out thirteen dollars. Nothing like that will happen between us. Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job. What brings you into my saloon? Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we? You got a place to stay? This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world. Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it. So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you. Let's talk about that. I'm looking for some men. Where's the dog? I see you're prospering without me. Hello, Paden. How ya doing? He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be. I thought you two would get along. It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here. Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common. Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
