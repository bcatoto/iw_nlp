Internal pressure positive.  Assume nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep capsules, style circa late twenties... Lights are green.  She's alive.  Well, there goes out salvage, guys. Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke. I work for the company, but other than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to see you're feeling better.  I'm told the weakness and disorientation should pass soon.  Side effects of the unusually long hypersleep, or something like that. Well, maybe you shouldn't worry about that just yet. All right.  My instinct says you're strong enough to handle this...Fifty-seven years. You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right? Hold her...Get me an airway, stat! And fifteen cc's of...Jesus! Sorry...I've been running behind all morning. Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest... Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago. I'm sorry. Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children. Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys... Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional. Look at it from our perspective. You freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an M-Class star-freighter.  A rather expensive piece of hardware... Forty-two million in adjusted dollars. That's minus payload, of course. The shuttle's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account.  That the Nostromo set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed planet, at that time.  That repairs were made.  That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct.  By you.  For reasons unknown. It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up. The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe... Are there any species like this 'hostile organism' on LV-426? Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be... Thank you, that will be all. You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo. You are a head case.  Have a donut. It is the finding of this board of inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley, NOC-14672. has acted with questionable judgment and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a commercial flight officer. Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely.  No criminal charges will be filed at this time and you are released on own recognizance for a six month period of psychometric probation, to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric tech... Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now. Terraformers...planet engineers. It's what we call a shake 'n' bake colony.  They set up atmosphere processors to make the air breathable...big job.  Takes decades.  They've already been there over twenty years.  Peacefully. Sixty, maybe seventy families. Do you mind? Yeah.  What? Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.' Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his. Look at this fat, juicy magnetic profile.  And it's mine, mine, mine. And half mine! I got too many partners. Daddy, when are we going back to town? When we get rich, Newt. You always say that.  I wanna go back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.' You cheat too much. Do not.  I'm just the best. Do too!  You go in places we can't fit. So!  That's why I'm the best. Mom.  All the kids play it... Holy shiiit! Folks, we have scored big this time. Let's wait till we know what to call it in as. Cheater! Timmy...they've been gone a long time. It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows what he's doing. Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the family are heading off for the colonies! Best decision I ever made, Bill. We'll be starting a new life from scratch, in a clean world. No crime.  No unemployment... Hi, Ripley.  This is Lieutenant Gorman of the... Ripley we have to talk. They've lost contact with the colony on Acheron. Hear me out... Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all. You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety. These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant? We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations. Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.' I heard you were working in the cargo docks. Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing? What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract? If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse... Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over... Think about it. Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi... That's the plan.  My word on it. They ain't payin' us enough for this. Not enough to have to wake up to your face, Drake. Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look like I feel. This floor's freezing. Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson? Would you, Sir? Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man? No.  Have you? Hey, hand job, you take my towel? You just got three weeks. Yeah, 'Top'...what about it? You know it ain't up to me. Awright!  Let's knock off the grabass.  First assembly's in fifteen...let's shag it. Who's the fresh meat again? She's supposed to be some kinda consultant... (exaggerated) ...She was an alien once. Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed. Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through! Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op? Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity. Looks like that new Lieutenant's too good to eat with us grunts. I'm sorry you feel that way about Synthetics, Ripley. Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board. I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself.  Is there a problem? A synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip out.  Some deaths were involved. I'm shocked.  Was it an older model? Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2. Well, that explains it.  The A/2's were always a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed a human being. More cornbread? Tench-hut! At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but... Sir? Yes, Hicks? Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks. What's the question? Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt? All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved. It's a bug-hunt. So what are these things? Tease us a bit. Sounds like you, Hicks. I only need to know one thing. Where they are. Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass! Anytime.  Anywhere. Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up. Fuck you. Anytime.  Anywhere. I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you. Are there any questions?  Hudson? How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit? All right.  I want this to go smooth and by the numbers.  I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830. Ordnance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours... Attention.  This concluded final maneuvering operations.  Thank you for your cooperation.  You may resume work. Still nothing from the colony? Dead on all channels. Clear, please. Excuse me. I don't know.  Is there anything you can do? Let's move it, girls!  On the ready line.  Let's go, let's go. I am ready, man.  Ready to get it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the ultimate badass...state of the badass art.  You do not want to fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't worry.  Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you. Check-it-out... Independently targetting particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP! Fry half a city with this puppy. We got tactical smart-missles, phased-plasma pulse-rifles, RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic ballbreakers, we got nukes, we got knives...sharp sticks -- Save it. Sure, Hicks. Here we go. Initiate release sequencer on my mark.  Three.  Two.  One.  Mark! Switching to DCS ranging. Got it.  Rough air ahead. Stand by for some chop. Thirty-eight...simulated. How many combat drops? Well...two.  Three, including this one. Turning on final.  Coming around to a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal guidance locked in.  Where's the damn beacon? Let's see.  Everybody on line. Drake, check you camera.  There seems to be a... ...that's better.  Pan it around a bit. Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks. Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way. Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex. Okay, let's do it. Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time. You staying in here? Figures. Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station. Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp! First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear. Vasquez, take point.  Let's move. Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass. First squad, assemble on me at the main lock. Second team, move up. Flanking positions. Quarter and search by twos.  Second team move inside.  Hicks, take the upper level.  Use your motion trackers. Nothing.  No movement. Looks like my room in college. Hmm.  Acid for blood. Looks like somebody bagged them one of Ripley's bad guys here. Hey, if you like that, you're gonna love this... Second squad?  What's your status? Just finished our sweep. Nobody home. The place is dead, Sir.  Whatever happened, we missed it. All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us. First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower... ...We're coming in. He's coming in.  I feel safer already. Pendejo jerkoff. Sir, the CPU is on-line. Okay, stand by in operations. Let's go. Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony. It's insured. Sir, you should check this out... Right ahead here... No bodies? No, Sir.  Looks like it was a helluva fight. Are these the same...? It likes you. These are dead.  There's just the two alive. Poor bastard. Behind us. Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block? Negative.  We're all in Operations. It's moving. Which way? You fuck! Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites. What's her name again? Rebecca. Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.  Just start at the beginning... Where are your parents?  You have to try... Total brain-lock. Physically she's okay. Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think any permanent damage. Come on, we're wasting our time. What's he scanning for? PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted. If they're within twenty klicks we'll read it out here, but so far...zip. N-newt. Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
