Got those rubber  ones, you know? Yeah, what about the winter? We winter in Florida. Rubber neck  the beach bunnies. Aw, look at that.  Ruined my brand new fence climbers.  Hand made in Italy. Oh, fuck, Partida. I'm gonna tell  her you shot me. Does it look like it? OW! A goddamn Dr. Jekyll! Third floor rear. Catch you later, Hopalong. You know that, Efren. When your big  bad brother Luis gets the word, your  ass is freeze dried and fried. Talk you hemorrhoid! Your mother fucks dogs in the street. You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you  know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball?  Cause the harder you hit 'em, the  better their English gets. We're jerking off here. Let's cut the shit, Cusack. Option 1: you can send em downtown.  If Judge Collins didn't get laid  last night, you can probably get him  to arraign my clients for loitering  in their own hallway. He'll set bail.  I'll take care of it. Option 2:  release them here and now and we'll  call it a day. Up to you. I like to see you earn your money. I ain't got no time to nursmaid a  rookie. I don't need a partner. We got a bigger problem. These  Comachos aren't gonna take this lying  down. The animals are out of the  cages. Yeah. That's my job. I'm going to have to fix that. You know, it's kind of interesting.  That 16 year old in the hallway with  the gun? Partida told me he doesn't  have a record. The kid's never been  arrested. ...Lear 9 Lima Kilo number 2 for  landing -- wind south 20, altimeter  two-niner-niner-two... Real sweetheart. Molly! Pack me a bag! Quick! Ok?  C'mon I'm in a hurry!

Happy birthday. Bow to your master! Later, Odell. It's been a rough one. Y' tellin me! We all seen it on the Bow to your master. Hey, Odell. Here, make yourself crazy. You look like shit. Thanks, pal. They had a shot on the tube of you  guys comin' out in front of the  building. How's Donato? Pissed cause he lost a shoe. Luis Comacho is in town. He'll collect himself some scalps  before this one's over. Your answering  machine is on the fritz again. Some  woman with a fantastic voice was  callin' about comin' over this weekend  ta help you with somthin', and then  the tape went nuts. Want somthin' to drink? Does the Pope shit in the woods? Is  a bear Catholic? Me too. I hate smart ass kids. Gonna get down in the 30's tonight.  Your pilot light is out. I've been told that more than once. So, who you figure pulled out the  rug? Gypsies? Mob? Somebody knew what they were doin'.  They blew the top off an anthill. I'd figure the Mob but Scalese ain't  that stupid. Hah! Sombody put the valve in  backwards. Later, fellas. There. Heat. What was the Cubs final score? 8 to 1. Machines just don't like you. Maybe I don't like machines. Arretez! Halten Zie! Stop! Do not  move! No se mueve!... ...After the gyros are locked, any  movement of the hand controller is  duplicated by the 'Prowler.' This simple control system means  that even semi-skilled employees can  operate the unit with a minimum of  training. As they say, "Even a child  can operate it." Just what the world needs, another  gun without a brain. I got better things to do than play  with toys. If the Commander will pick someone  to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can  show how our various target  acquisition systems function. Bang. You're dead. Drop it. A war does no good for any of us. It  can only make what is bad worse. Get them out of here. Fix them up. I  want them to be beautiful for their  mother. I promise you, my brothers, there  will be blood for blood. This is the cop. How much did they pay you to set up  my brothers, Pig. Stay off my streets, asshole. Or  I'll bite your head off, and shit in  your neck. You're meat cop! Dead meat! Eenie Verona is the gentleman's name. You did a hell of a job on him. I was motivated. Know him? He's a punk. Punk thief. Booster. Looks like he graduated. He had a brother-in-law. They were  tight. Served time together.  Ganelli..., Gagleone... If I was you, I'd sit on him. Looks like you're gonna be busy,  Cusack. Uh, you gonna be using those  Cubs' tickets? He's just makin' up for the time he  spent in the joint. Relax kid. Just watch, kid. Learn. Hold here a second. Keep with Gamiani. Wanna play ball? Some people say I've got a pretty  good inside curve. I'm Eddie. You've had a lot of experience with  cops? You'll get slivers. I thought you knew all about cops.  You don't put anything up your nose  do you? Diana Luna? You're Tony Luna's daughter? For when you need a friend. But do you have all the friends you  need? This is Sergeant Cusack. I want a  team to cover a house on the southwest  side. L-U-N-A, Anthony. Yeah. Crazy Tony Luna. I don't think  he's around, but if he shows up bring  him in. Catch you later. Police! Open up! Awright awright hold it. For Christ's sake! You tryin to get  your partner killed, Jackson? Hey, Mahoney. I want you to help me  get some signatures on this letter  for Cragie. Let's try the mitts for awhile. Say, partner. How ya doing, Richie? Swinging. How's this? Two G's, we  get a sausage and beef stand stand  outside Wrigley Field. You pass the  beef, I take the cash. Free games. I  got a contact downtown. How you gonna watch the game if you're  hawking sandwiches? Never thought of that. TV? Hey, I  tell you about this nurse I met?  Talk about physical therapy. She's got this friend just dying to  meet you. Intensive care. Later, partner. Hey, Cusack. How about taking the  gloves off long enough to sign this  for Cragie. This about the hearing? You bet. I pass. What the fuck's the matter with you? He's burnt, Brennan, and you know  it. He was a good cop, but he ain't  now. Get off your high horse, Cusack. He  made a couple of mistakes, OK. The  guy was a hero. What the fuck does a  bunch of civilians know about comin'  up some shithouse stairway day after  day, scared outta your shorts. We're all scared, Brennan. Cragie  should have been off the street a  long time ago. He's gonna hurt  somebody else with his bullshit.  Maybe even you. The funeral director says they plan  on cruisin right past luna's house. He'll get the word. Stay by the radio. What the hell you doin' here? Off,  asshole. The modern age's answer to the crystal  ball. Marvelous. If you know how to  read it. Listen. If you have some extra cash,  buy oranges. The price is low, and I  can promise you the threatened  trucking strike will be avoided. We talking about a bribe, Scalese? It's a prediction. No. I wouldn't try to bribe Eddie  Cusack. You're incorruptible. Untarnished. I  hear they call you stainless steel  on the street. Me, I think you're a  fuckin' pain in the ass. Thanks. It's not a compliment. I'm looking for your nephew. Tony? Forget it. Tony Luna's none of  your business. Wrong. Tony just made himself my  business. No he didn't. We take care of our  own. Just like the cops. Just like  the Comachos. You understand. He shit on my turf, old man. And I'm  going to nail him and anybody else  tied to him. You understand, Felix? Nobody threatens Felix Scalese. It's not a threat. It's a prediction. There's a shitstorm coming. You better  get yourself a good umbrella. Tony Luna's bagman. They call that a Columbian necktie. They found the manager of Tony's  restaurant hanging from a hook in  his kitchen. Looked like someone  tried to carve a canoe out of him.  Tony's used car lot on Ashland is  burning as we speak. The head salesman  is a fried zuccini. Let's go. Was there a girl? Late teens. Reddish  hair. Two male caucasians, two female. One  mid-to-late forties. The other a  grandmother. Come on, Chika. We gonna have some  fun. You gonna take us to your father. Pompas, you're getting to be a fucking  pain in the ass. Let her go, pooch. Another step, and I take her head  off. You don't have the balls. Downtown first. Then I'm gonna place  you in protective custody. You'll be safe -- Keep your goddamn pants on! This your idea of a social call? Fred Pirelli, this is Diana. Diana  Luna. C'mon, kid. Let's get you off your  feet. Can you put her up till I find her  old man? Does a bear...? Am I putting you on the spot? I spent 30 years on the spot. What  ever you need. I'll be right across the hall. I'm  just gonna clean up. You oughta crash, man. You had a  helluva day. Love it, Flash. Gonna be a slide.  Easy in, easy out. Just a quick and dirty? Yeah, yeah, nothin to it. You know  the drill. He picks her up on Forty-third, and  he's takin' in. She says, "Say, baby.  Ain't no need for goin' downtown."  An' she pulls back her skirt. So the  dumb shit climbs in the back an'  takes a piece... ...an' leaves the keys in the front  and locks the two of 'em in the squad.  And he hasta kick out the window  see, an' she starts screamin', "Rape!  Rape!" An' they charge him with rape  an' every other fuckin' thing in the  book. Internal Affairs is gonna give  him a kayak and a lantern an' put  him out in the lake. Bartender. Gimme a black russian and  a Courvoisier. Yo! Get your hands up motherfuckers.  This is a ho -- You stupid motherfucker. My old lady tol' me you was fucked  up in the head. Do I listen? Piece o  cake, you say. Snap, you say. Nothin  to it, you say. Shut up over there. Eddie! Partner! Meet Ruthie. Dental  Hygienist. She's oral. And this is... Marlene. She works  for a proctologist. Siddown, partner. I got a proposition  for you. Not now, Donato. O.K. O.K. But just let me plant two  words in your brain. Alligator  farming. Tell the truth. And the chance to do it again. Next  time he might take away a cop. That  make any difference? Your partner's selling you out,  Kosalas. He kills an unarmed kid,  and now he's risking your ass to  save his own. It cost an innocent kid his life. Tell 'em like it is, Nick. I'll back  you up. Hello, Cragie. You know why. You were a good cop for a lot of  years. You've passed your limit now  Cragie. Right about here. She's havin' a bad night. Gave her a  shot of brandy. Maybe she'll sleep. Giving liquor to a minor, Pirelli? I'll be back right after the hearing  tomorrow, and you can get some sleep  then. You find someone. How far were you standing from where  your grandson was shot, Mrs. Murillio? In the next doorway. Four meters. How you doin', Sarge? What's the score? Kid's grandmother says Cragie threw  down the pistola. You think he'll get a pass? You heard it all. What do you think? If the hearing was over I'd have to  put my money on the old lady. But Kosalas's next. My bet's on  Cragie. The kid may surprise you. That good looking gorilla next to me  is Eddie's father. Better than good  cop. Killed in the line of duty. I can't comment on that. It was over  before I got there. Cragie's in my unit, yes. I did. No, I didn't. Yes. Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone  to look at the city's guts, Mr.  Partida. It was denied. I don't agree with what it says. That's what I'm saying. I just dialed 348-6610, and I get  this funny buzz. Check the line for  me? Thanks. Seems to me the man's got his tongue  stuck to his asshole, Cragie. Sorry, sir, that number seems to be  out of service. I've reported it. He was a friend of yours wasn't he? Yeah. Squad, this is 1462. I need a backup.  Have 64 and 63 from TAC 4 meet me at  the billiard parlor on 18th near  Halsted. Questioning suspects. Ten-four, Dispatch. Unit 1463  responding.

Talk to me, Degas, or I'll hit you  with so many lefts you're gonna beg  for a right. He's coming here. He's on his way. We need a verification on a back-up  for Unit 1462... 1462. That's Cusack, right? Good luck finding a backup for that  character. Take him apart. ...request verification for backup  for unit 1462. Patrol 47, are you in  the area. Squad. 47. We're having vehicular  problems. Not able to respond. ...need backup at 18th and Halstead... Fuck him. The sun comes up. You give me Luna,  or the girl dies -- slow. I would have been here, Sarge. They  kept it from me. You're Ok, Hopalong. Listen, I'm havin' a drink with this  friend of mine, name of Mickie. She  works on a computer over in the  Federal Building, FBI. I got here as  soon as I heard. They got Diana Luna. That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya.  Mickie told me she read on the wire  Tony Luna's comin' into Union Station  at ten tonight. Hello, Felix. Hello, Tony. You see, Tony. You make no sense.  You start a war... Waste people...  Money... You're like a kid, Tony.  You're a bad boy. This sonovabitch is crazy! You tell Luis I got Tony Luna for  him. Get me a time and place. Your cop friend is smart. Too smart  and he dies. Then I take care of you  personally. Cusack made off with a truckload of  armour. He's a fucking one man army now. Take off the gag. I want them to  hear her. Here we go partner. Now! Do it now! Kill her! ...Harbor Patrol reports gunfire and  explosions in the vicinity of Calumet  Harbor...
