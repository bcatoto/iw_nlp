Fire moat... why do that? We come watch... we come watch... You go? Not watch fun? Then we smash 'em? Fool's magic. Why so few?You go to lady now? More fun win battle? We watch... good fun... Birdies... pretty... We go out, smash 'em now? Dumb magic. Giant smash peewee. What?Purely a precaution... Nay. This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame. I have something far more pleasant awaiting me. Anything left for smashing you may happily smash. Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat. Precisely. Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant. Faith. To finish last evening's delightful work. This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress. Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves. I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch. No. Smashing is not required. I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch! Always. Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician. So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion. Precisely, my darling. Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire. Or looked so beautiful... And, now? Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture? Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you... From the parapets most likely. The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving. It's nothing. My men take great delight in routing the enemy. Don't trouble yourself, beauty. Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair! My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity. I suggest you spend some hours before the glass. Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul. Your soul...? Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle? I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect... When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest. Yes? A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning. We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal? At the moment, very little. Your company at my table... Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable. I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art. They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach. The pain remains constant. Why should I kill you? A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked. Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash? Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment... No. Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness. When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself! We're both of us damned, my beauty. To be my bride, of course. I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking. I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl. I am a creature of darkness. I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer. I know no more of shame than I do of fear. I wear this mask not for concealment but protection. I am afraid of nothing. We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it. Not from me, surely... You should glory in your animal nature. It is your triumph! None know that better than I! On the contrary! The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting. Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful. You're magnificent. I like well what I see. It pleases me. I speak of love, and you think only of the lash. Your love. My generosity is not so large as that.No more listening! Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp! You come stealee tleasoo? An' how you do it? How you rift cuss? Flozen foleva not good. Dlagon not like that. Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness. You got no idee. People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same. In my countlee I bling good luck. Makee lain and thunder. Country fa' fa' away. To the East, beyond the lising sun... Course not. I no flum here. I come flum Cathay. No need lie, boy. I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you? You come stealee tleasoo? What? Speakee loud! No hear velly good. What you do, boy? You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.We be honored, friend Ogg. Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk. We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green. Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night. Well, bygones're bygones, I always say. Friend Ogg. Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you. You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken. You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle... That's it then... the ring! And did you? Go on... go on... Where? Might not need a gesture quite so grand. What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world? Tis not the wound, that's sure. Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work. She lives... isn't that worth singing about? Where's your joy if you cannot sing? On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes -- Listen to him. Not in the mood... I've not heard a note out of you. You're on your own... like a true champion. Ride like wild fire, Jack. Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth? Never show mercy! Don't get too far! Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next! Ah, but you will. And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway. Patience, lad. Easier than that, Jack. Screwball! Fetch me down a couple of them plates. Sunlight. Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron. The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so. I admire your valor, Jack. By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen. Mean you to seek him out below? Sunlight, you say? In the dark, lad? Why should he do that? The alicorn, lad. Come to your senses! Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed. Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves? Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war. Nay. You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine. She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet. Nonsense! Course it matters. Jack! The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower. No sign of... Jack? Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad. It's what we'll find there worries me. Best get down close to the moat, lad. Fire away! Aye. Before the wee pesties attacked. That's it! Will you chance a miss? Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the -- Been telling you that all along, lad. And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats. It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic. There aren't enough arrows. Easily spoken... A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack? Why not mine the damned walls? Tells you something 'bout him what lives there... Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares. That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack. Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait. It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap. Don't like the feel of it, Jack. Never felt so cold in all me born days... No... but what choice have we? Aye. We be on a quest to set the world aright -- I know the rogue, Jack. Tis Jimmy Squarefoot. Hold, Jack! Don't strike! Wait, Jack. Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero. Long as we don't lose heart, Jack... Aye, lad... we've little else to go by. Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course. Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago. We're blind now. Oona was our eyes and ears. How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her? Is she... dead? Stay on your guard, Jack. The bug is enchanted surely. Willful creature, that one... What make ye of that, Jack? God's blessing. Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours... ... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress... Be gentle with them, Jack. They only march to please you. Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems. Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night. Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it. Rest easy, Jack. Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack. Sigurd's sword is no great thing. The Volsung killed Fafnir. You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck. Stoutly spoke, lad. These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling. I should hope not! Very secretive, they are. Keep their feet covered up. Best if you don't mention it. Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet. Shhh! Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye. Something the matter? Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time. Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned. A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited. Nay. That's but to distract the casual visitor. A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly. Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps. Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do. Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking. Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown. That would be Devil's Needle. Last landmark I know in these woods. Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two? Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow... Worse than the battlefield. Jack, don't! Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir. Blackheart? Good plan that. How do we follow a raven we can't even see? Sounds like the bird we want. All right lads, follow yon raven! Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say? Aye. Said to follow it to the edge of night. But is this the right bird? Whatever for? Track the demon to his lair. How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking? Fine-looking army. I'll drop a cow on the knave! Aye! That too. Tricks, is it? Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp! I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk. I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...! Want to see me do it? Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it! Careful, lad. Pregnant, is she? Something's coming. Screwball! You dolt! I've a mind to change you into a toad. Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed. No false modesty, lad. You're a proper champion. Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit. There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad. You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise. Dragons be deaf as tree stumps. There's the spirit, lad. If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up. Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack. Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm. Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that. But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep... No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm. A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now. There it be, lad. The Lindfarne Mound. Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep. I know where to find it. Taking possession be another matter. Bravely spoke. You've the heart of a champion, true enough. Time for a champion. Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack? Aye. Black Baron's mischief. Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now. Fie on what she thinks! You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona. Here now. Toss her this when you've the chance. Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass. She's terribly vain. Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle. Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb. Aye. That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells. Oona... lure her out. Play the part of a girl-child. Aye. On the morrow we go, but tonight... ... tonight is for making merry. Think there be truth only in beauty, lad? If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek. Someone worthy of respect, lad. She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side. Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them. True... But it won't come easy or free. If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth. Course we care. What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect? If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere. That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best. Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers. If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee... Aye. Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer. Big question that, lad. Why what? He is afraid of enchantment! Will you listen to the fool prattle on. Generally known! What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots? Are ye afraid of me wine? Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk? Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted? Elderberry wine. No finer drink under heaven. Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all. And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...? If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time. Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones. I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack. You have me word, lad. To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much. You be our guest, Jack. Well spoke. True to the mark. And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have. Damnation! Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters! You've bested me, Jack. What! Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming. Didn't you now? Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven. You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad. And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk? Is me music not to your liking? Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure. Dance, Jack! The night's but begun. To be sure. Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing? Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance. So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump. Dolt! They'll do nicely. Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow... Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here. Whatever you do, don't dare drop it. Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you. You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it! They've fired the moat! Very thrifty. Even got your arrow back. Well done, lad. We seek to undo the curse. Screwball! Be quiet...! We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night. These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth. Barely living, from the looks of it. Well done, lad. Stout heart. Hush up, Screwball. Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.No, wait... please... listen... Oh no... Don't you understand? I need your help. In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles. I -- It's terrible. Then you'll understand my quest. An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn. The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter. Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever. You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops? East of Mercia? Cathay? Well, er... no. I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of. Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind. I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb. I didn't know... I -- I'll try. Nay. It was lost. When I came up for air the pond was frozen over. She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it. Said she'd marry me if I did. By the pond. She was teasing me. I was with the Princess. I'll do anything... face any challenge! The quest's at an end and where's the good of it? A faerie festival over a pile of bones? She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted. Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps... Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst! I'm not denying it's a joyous day -- Not in the mood, I'm afraid. A good day for singing... He'll not escape me. Sapphire! I could have struck off his head just now! He's getting away! He was at my mercy! Hurry up! Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead... Can't we move any faster? Hey! Stop it! I can't see. Will you explain what's going on? Plan on carrying some away in a kettle? What weapon? Did you bring me here to sup? I'm not afraid of the dark. Aye. Hurry now, Gump, the key! Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key. The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock... I don't... understand. Can you save her? The wound is mortal. ... the Princess Lili... I've killed her. It doesn't matter. Aye. We're good as inside. He'll be atop the portculis ere long. Then it's Godspeed, Screwball. Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory? One more turn... There must be some way to get it up there. That's it! The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge. What magic have we on our side? There isn't much time! Water doesn't burn... Never mind. Just do it! Retrieve the arrows somehow. Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers. Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow. Shoot the damned things as they fly. Defend ourselves. We've bested far worse already. We do both. Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under... We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders. On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true. There's more than one way to spring a trap. Give in to despair and all is lost. It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we? For all the dark magic protecting it. The chill is worse this night. Can we trust him? But seem to have gotten lost on the way. Nay. I show no pity to imps and fiends. Nay. This time we strike first! We'll never find the Baron's castle. Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely. We'll trust in faith, Gump. Heading true north. We continue in that direction. We'll find it. No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite. Archers! Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature... Wait! It bodes evil. There's the way, mates. We'll surely be in our graves if we don't. Make haste! We've a hard day's march ahead. God protect you, Honeythorn Gump. We're not in a tournament, Gump. Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons... I pray always to be worthy of it. Gump, you're putting words in my mouth. Certainly understandable. Ogg's footprints! My God! Look! Nice piece of work. Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop. Better to kill than be disturbed. And this? Some of their handiwork? I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable. Twould appear other travelers precede us. Good. Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance. Stealing his arms? There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing. What know you of fields of war? The foulest. Mayhap I can cut them free. Aye. He's enchanted the lot of them. His reward for delivering the unicorn. This is ogre's magic. Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes. Beware. I'm sure. It spoke to me. Jenny Greenteeth said: "Follow the raven in her flight..." We must follow that bird. Aye. And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying. A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed. The Baron must have left a trail. We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour. Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops. You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart. Save your mischief for the Black Baron. We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump. The colt's still too small. Damn them! It would appear so. What is it? Shhhh! I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield. Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven. By the grace of God. Better we eat him than the other way round. What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles? You do the praying. I've work ahead. Knaves and robbers... So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it? And who might that be? Have we turned grave-robber, then? Twill take more than heart. Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start? I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake! If the horn be restored the curse is ended. Did you hear? Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it. The princess is dead. And if she thinks me a liar? What do I do? Are we here? Will you lead me to her? How is it this hag knows the truth? Jenny Greenteeth? Who's she? There must be an answer somewhere. Don't you care about what's happened? Then, what's gone wrong? Why did it happen? Don't you know? Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark? But... but, why? Please don't misunderstand. I am grateful for your hospitality and -- Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that -- It looks... er, delicious... Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic... What does she want from me? I fear she's lost. Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance? I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks. A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine. The flower. Bluebells. To hear them ringing means your life's at an end. It's bluebells! And if I cannot? I meant no disrespect. No... I... I need to rest. Enough! No! Tis not the time! I want no part of your frolic. Faerie ring? I'm in no mood for dancing. Gump, is it? Ow! Whatever it is, it hurts. Nor can I. Damn! It's buzzing all around me. Ouch! I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona! Everywhere! Ow! Pinching me! Ouch! Something's biting me. Lili... I love you! But... I am a Green Man. I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body. You're teasing still. Is what you said about the ring but another dream? I can't have been under much more than a minute. Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring. No! Don't let go... you mustn't! I love you! So, he's hiding in the dark... Sunlight? What? It's the Baron's damnable work! Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself. No! I won't let it happen... They told me you were dead. I thought you were dead... I -- What have I done? Lili! No! What if I answer yes? Will my wish come true? If wishes were horses even beggars would ride. I have no wife. Tis not fit for a princess. I'm afraid it may storm. My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you. My lady mocks me. There's no happier thought under heaven. Tis the truth. Not even the birds sing sweet as you. Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood? Its powers are strong. There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood. Good. They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn. He did run? How bad was the unicorn's wound? They tricked you. Damned hunters. It was a trap, and you were the bait! Who? What happened? To fetch your napkin. I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial. Not if you be chaste. Tis an awesome test of virginity. Tis a fair question. If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap. Are you honest? They rival the angels of paradise. In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet. True royalty approaches. Shhh! Your command is my wish, Princess Lili. I'm not its master. I'll go search for it. What's the matter? Be patient. That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now. Only were he a fool to boot. See yon viper? Stop complaining. All right. I'll show you something sacred. Unicorn? Blackheart. Aptly named. Sport, indeed. Or perchance... I may have said perhaps... Never. These for me? Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored. Sigurd's sword... His feet shall never cross my lips. We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir. He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter. Honored to make your acquaintance. As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom. Tis not the time to speak of cheer. This is sad news, be it true. I don't believe you. No! Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky. Exceeding fair. Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her. What became of the princess? Nay. Tempting as your invitation be. Tell me one thing more. Not very precise directions. Where do I find the Baron's castle? How do I get the horn back? He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot. Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it. A unicorn's been slain. The last stallion in all the country. Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death? It is a time of mourning. This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world. Aye. And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here. I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely. The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross. All the heavenly angels must envy your grace. The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you... Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete. They call me Green Jack, ma'am. I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty. Heading north still? Be fair, Oona. And as barren of love as stone. Threats won't make me love you. Tis not the way of the human heart. Please... Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't... I'm promised to another! Nay, Oona, tis not possible. Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind. You are fair as the first new flower of spring... How so? That was in jest. Wondrously so. In every way. I had no thought of offending you, Oona. And charmed, of course. I'd be honored. I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak. My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins. There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away. Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday. No fear of that now. Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over. This is not the time for squabbling. I pray God grants it me. Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends. It's done... we'll never catch him. Done like a champion. Can you reach me with the line? Haven't heard a bird sing in days... Bah! You faeries have the morals of ferrets. His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it. Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft. Where? Of course they're alive. All nature is living. Praise be to God. I'm in your debt, Screwball. I think she's about to foal. We wait. I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head. You're with us in battle. Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy. The Avatar. I like the sound of it. I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it. Oh, but I have. Don't speak to me of dreams! I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed. You've been inside? A castle's but stone and mortar -- Let that be our problem, just get us there. There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there. Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry. Can you show us the way? You do know where it is? Simple as that, eh? Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest... Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir. Is he a friend, then? I'm sending you back to Hell!In a dream. Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once. Nay. Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief... It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close... You follow. That very nice. To Castle Couer de Noir? Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate... Jimmy Squarefoot no lost. Lost? The Black Baron, you say? Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all... No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist. Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature. We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle. Some of our handiwork may be of assistance. Who might these friends be? Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged. Honeythorn Gump, is it? I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears. Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work. Step lively now! Thought the weather terrible of late. Grand champion, is it? And what great cause leads you to me?Sorry. How're these? Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself... Aye... my Lord... Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or -- Sweet slippers of Oisin! Look at that shot! Three at once! I can't miss! Three cheers for our champion. Gonna make ogre-stew! Ogg lives there...! And Thurgis! You see! You see! No, no, no... this is different! Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion! Nay. Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack. Keep me belly full, Jack. Kill us another worm. No speeches! What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres? Sorry, Jack. Hello, Jack. Or a kite...! We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work -- Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird... What care the bones when the soul is free? What can you steal from a man already lost his life? Up ahead! Master Jack! Master Jack! These woods are alive! They're alive! Small miracles better than no miracles... Watch behind or I'll never collect on it! What's she doing? What do we do now? The fastest in the world.
