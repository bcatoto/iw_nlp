... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light... Hell. This is just like fucking Star Wars, man! Oh, yeah. Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole? Really? How come he didn't take me? What just happened? What's that? You mean the snake? No. That's right, buddy. Huh? You're gonna love it. It's a Soviet MIL MI-24. Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus... Duck soup. Hold your pantyhose. Here, gimme a hand. Gawd, you look awful. What... whattaya do? Are they going to torture us? Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing? It's orders! You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it. John Wayne is dead, man. I suppose you have... What? Are you crazy? We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program. Nothing we can do, man. Bastards. Let's get some shots. Alright. Home run. Can't tell. Pretty tall. He's real scrunched up in that thing. It's a guy in a cage. Snoring. Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese. Somebody talking in his sleep. A toilet flushing. I need a vacation. Pirates? No kidding? These guys look like they'd sell their mothers. Yeah. Dinky-dau, that's me. Hey, Co. You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake? What's that? What's she saying? Yeah... How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle? Who cares? Let's just do it and get out. Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok. Know what I mean? What's this stuff on the rice? I had it cupped. You fucking crazy? I need it to burn these things off. Damn! Leeches. This place is a trip. I've seen worse places. I was in the brig. They gave me a deal. I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19. He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value. Seemed like a good idea at the time. You wanna know why I stood up for this show? And a beat-to-shit AK? Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those. That's it? Some C-4, a map and a knife? Where's your stuff? AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters. This is state-of-the-art firepower. Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system. Keep it down, man. I got problems. Read you. Yeah. Why not? We're leaving tonight, not in a week. That's what I'm here for. No radio source. Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on. Gettin' old, huh? ... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo! I swear to Christ. ... to target at Ban Kia Na. We probe the site... Co Phuong Bao. The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep. Shit! Insertion. Call in to base camp by TRANSAT. Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact. Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao. We've been over this three times. Ever do this from a jet? Clown? Now back up there, buddy...There's the Mekong. Star Wars? Maybe because you're shot in the leg. Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit. Wow! Put it in the guard's barracks. Man they got pissed. They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition. You oughta see 'em run around. Yeah. It's not hard once you get the hang of it. In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one... What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this? I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did. They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week. Got a smoke? Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there. But this is real, isn't it? You're taking me home now? You guys are real... aren't you?Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now. Sorry, Sir. Sorry, Sir. Can't do it. Let's get that tent down!De Fravio. Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force. I could a couple of days ago. Gonna be... stiff. Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker! Who're you?How much we got left in that minigun? Forget it. Brewer! You know what that thing's packing? Can you handle the door gun? You comin'? Yes. You better take off. You take pictures and split. I'm going in. You never been in one of those things. I'm getting him out. That guy's not going to make it. Torture cage. Can't stand... can't sit... for days. Sometimes weeks. Roundeye. Let me see. American? Guard barracks. Take some shots. How you doing, Brewer? Sometimes they do. They're river pirates. Opium runners. Powerful warrior. She likes you. Says you're dinky- dau. Brewer. Does a jet make noise? We'll check it out. Why would they send us to a deserted camp? Fermented fish sauce. No cigarettes. Buddhist monastery. Fifteenth century. There are no worse places. That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam. No. Exactly. There's a compass in the handle. Cocktail party. Uh huh, right. Let's saddle up. What's this? Batteries not included. What do you call that? You okay? Home on my strobe. You read me, Brewer? You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you. Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land. Show me how it operates. Yeah. Second set. Let's go. One hundred. Ninety. Start over. You stopped. Again. No. This clown almost blew mission security on the street. I'm not jumping with him. John. My name is John. Minigun. Come on. Let's move. He's coming in on our open side. Look, Co... How? I couldn't get you in. How you going to get there? You can't trust the spooks to pull you out. They'll use you up and throw you away. Yeah. Got some business there. What are you gonna do? Invulnerable. I do? And how'd you sneak up like that? Christ. How'd you get here? Let's go. Thanks. Why'd they want us? Are you okay? It's nice there. He's probably digging every minute. Got a surfboard. Breaking girls' hearts. Where's Nguyen now? What city? Where's his father? Intelligence work. How did you get started working for the spooks? I thought he was with you. Why's that? How do we get upriver? You really got a Masters Degree? I'm Rambo. This is Brewer. Her name is Co. All this is for us? I was crossed-trained in gunships. We just take pictures? We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them? What's the plan? I'm not jumping blind. Where? Why me? What's the job? I don't work with spooks. Not after that op in Cambodia. What's your name? Can you walk? American. Come to get you out. You got it, sir. Let's do it. I say we tape him to a chair. This just occurred to somebody, now? I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it. That's all. After all that. Five. I never wanted that stuff. Yeah. Big time. Those men are all dead. That's it. My life. There were treating me like a headcase. Am I out of here? I could take it or leave it. Colonel.He... took it. ... and then he, uh... took the other one. Um... actually, no. It looks like he shot down one of their gunships... Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay. Just came through. Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.You pathetic scum. That's an order. Stay on your heading, Captain. Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat. Don't be late. All our love." It's not over. You made one mistake. So there never was a Phase Two rescue team? "Terminate with extreme prejudice." Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs. This mission was a scam from the word go? Don't dance me, Kirkhill. You'll be walking funny. But you're right... some people do get sacrificed. Now tell me why you pulled the plug. Not my people. Take your time. I know... I know. Listen, Kirkhill. I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight. Unless you have an objection. Black. No sugar. You think they'll find any? How long before you're fully on line? Nice work. How long have you been setting up? Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed. Listen up. You two are married as of now. Get used to it. We left some people behind there, John... POWs. You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in. What did you want? Plus, what else? Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts. Congressional Medal of Honor. You're not. Hardcore outfit. The best I ever trained. This your stuff? Hard to believe. You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken. No sense of humor. What did you expect? An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce? That depends on you. Christ, look at you. I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand. Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it? I hear you're not enjoying it here. Mind if I sit down? Hello, John.
