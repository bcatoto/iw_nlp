But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away. We know that too. You've come to the right place. We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge. Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.Thank you very much, Deputy Minister. But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ... Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists? And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ... Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...? In fact, killing people - Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?Shut up! This is a professional relationship! How do you think I feel? You shit! How could you do this to me? You stupid bastard! Bastard!!! Shut up! Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over. Sam - we've always been close, haven't we? There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them. This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye. I do. Goodbye. Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye. I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked. Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. Do you know what you're doing. Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it. We don't make mistakes. There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested. But, I've already put her on the search and detain list. Right! Just between as and the Security Forces. You're the only person I can trust. Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend. What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury. Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest? Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list. Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry? {baffled) I don't follow you. Why? Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it? Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me. She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us. Yes. I'm impressed. Very smart. You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you? He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest. We suspect him of freelance subversion. What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking. There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for. Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already. I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done. Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake. Christ! You do know it all! OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215. Enough though, eh? How much do you know? Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense. You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail. Layton! Oh shit! OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting. My tailor,... well worth the investment. What? Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight? For my sins. Are you settling in alright? Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations! SAM! What a surprise! Mr Helpmann! Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back. Remember how they used to stick out? {winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really. You remember Alison? Triplets. Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed - You are late. What's the matter? Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us - Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded - Long time no see! Sam!It's what you wanted isn't it? I did it for you. Yes. NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ... All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified. What's the matter? Can I forget it? Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque? You are good to me Sam. Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am. Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque? Here. What do I do next? What? Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards! Ow! Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ... 27156789/074328/K. Next of kin! Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do? I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque! I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can! The refund for Tuttle! It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again. You've been promoted. Would you really, Sam? But if they did promote you What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted. Oh, good! Isn't it? Whose is it? Oh my God, a mistake! Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?Sorry, a bit busy at the moment. You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. Hey - that's my desk! Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished. Sod it, it's broken! You must be joking - When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet. This is your dream girl, is it? A woman eh? I see. I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. You want to take my console into your office? What? Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha! My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting. No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on! Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all. I won't be held responsible. She didn't say anything about it to me.Put the phone down and your hands up. Hello. Mr Lowry? Thank you for calling Cen - Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due - Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-Oh. Ah. If you say so. You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice? Information Adjustments. No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped. Is it stamped? Have you got an Arrest Receipt? You want Information Adjustments. Different department. I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir. I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels. No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval. the lift's arrived, sir. No need, sir No, sir. Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.What have you done to my flat? I fixed it myself. I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here. Thank you. Uh - what? - I ... What do I have to do. What? You mean you've got ... Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ... What? How do you know my name? Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you. Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago. Oh, right ... Oh ... Thank you very much, mother, but actually - Er ... Thanks ... He will be pleased when he comes home. Jill Layton ... You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here? What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who? Go away. No, no ... I did that... Please, I've got to find Jill. I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here! This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?! Help me! Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her. Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?! Well ... well, I ... Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late? Sorry ... Well, I ... That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help. Jack ... Help me, Jack! I'm frightened! What? This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off. Jack, I'm innocent! Help me. Jack?... Jack? Yes we have, Jack! Jack, she's innocent! It could all be coincidental. You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league? She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong. Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested. Trust me. Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch. Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while. Say it was a mistake. Take her off the list. They weren't at school with us. Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us. And you're mine. Trust me. You do trust me, don't you? Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her. You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department? So what are you going to do about her? Out of kindness. Why? Hell, not for any reason ... Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family. Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you? But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ... A terrorist? Tell me about Layton. Er ... but I would've found out anyway. Er ... no. What's she done? He's a freelance subversive? What has Tuttle done? So how ...? I'm sure you have You killed him? You got the wrong man. No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on. B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it? Not really, no. Not much. How do you mean? Am I? What is it? I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want. I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you. Ah ... Yes, thanks. Thanks. Are you officer 412/L? Are you officer 412/L? Jack!! Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false. What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real. Er, I knew you looked different. Hello, Jack! Really? - God, how time flies! Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins. Even later. Sorry. Nothing. See you - I'm going to be late. You sound worried. Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem? Jack! You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead. Thanks for the vote of confidence. I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope. Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long. C'mon. We've got to get out of here. Are you sure? No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ... What happened to you after ... Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright? I'm going to open it! ........... It's a bomb isn't it? I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special. You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet. There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat? Please, Jill ... I love you. This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie. "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt? "And your children all gone." It wasn't supposed to happen like this. Oh God! What have we done? Now you're the one that's out of your mind. I was right! Step on it! Turn! Will you please turn back. Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! No. Please. They're going to arrest you. Security. They'll be there waiting. Turn around! Every day? What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please. Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day. Well, terrorists of course. Well, all wars do - Well, no system is. Things would be worse without Information Retrieval. What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists? Suit me? Really. Looking for you. It's heavy. OK. What's in the parcel? What's going on here? Where are you taking me? Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me. What? Why not? Why? Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away? Yes, of course. Sorry. You know, smoking's bad for you. I don't know. Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say. Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you. ... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ... Oh, sorry. Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going. Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer - DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! Please! Bloody hell! Do as I say! What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving! Ow! That hurt! Don't look back! Act naturally! It's you ... it's you ... Yes ... No ... I don't, know. What! Shit! I never signed the form. I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I? I know that. You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you? Damn! Blast! Yes. I delivered it. Don't mention it. See you later. That's it. Here. Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque. Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport. Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop. You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option. Problem. She doesn't have a bank account. There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque? Try next of kin. He is dead. Hang on. Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque. I've never seen a Ministry cheque before. Tuttle? A cheque. What a BITCH! Really. I've told you before. I'd turn it down. Don't worry. Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer Information Retrieval. It's not our mistake! It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have �31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle. Lime, I need to use your computer Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001. That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much. You haven't switched it on. What? Look, let me use the console for a few minutes. I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton. Yes. I'll bring it back in ten minutes. Ah. Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console? Sam Lowry. How long will she he away? Well, she's my mother, not yours. My mother said it would be all right. Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ... Actually, I've decided ... I want to talk to him. Is Mr Helpmann here? Mother? Is that you? I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything. Mother! This isn't rare! What is it? You're not listening, mother. I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am. Uh ... Um ... Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms. Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human. It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake. Er, yes ... I think that'll hold it. Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you? Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off. I ... uh ... Actually, there's someone I want to meet ... Whatever happened to you? What? Now? It's my lunch hour. What? Who is this? Who's that? Hello ... hello ... Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer This is an emergency! Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning Thank you, Dawson. And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information? Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office? But I could be anybody. My I.D. cards. Er, don't you want to search me? My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren. what? ... Oh ... I don't know which numero. A steak, please. Rare. Mother, I need to ... Are we? What is it? For God's sake, what's happened? Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this! What? What is it? What the - ? How did you - ? I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures? Have you got one or haven't you? I mean it fixed itself. No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed. Yes? Thank you very much. How much will it...? What do they want you or? Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be - No. Wait here. Can you fix it? Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount The pace? Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services? Are you saying this is illegal? What? But ... I called Central Services. Tuttle! Are you from Central Services? What is this? Who the hell are you?Numero une, crevettes � la mayonaaise. A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so. Monsieur? {suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ... I'm sorry but ... Numero trois, steak. Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit. Numero deux, duck a l'orange. Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. Between you and me, Madam, today the number two. Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl. Numero, trois. Monsieur. Quel numero. Ah yes, the lady is waiting.Sign the form so we can get to it. I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer. This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts. Sign here, please. You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services - Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage! Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh out yer nostril? Tuttle! ... mumble! You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you? Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle What have you got there? I think we'd better have a look. He's tampered with it, Dowser. Machines don't fix themselves. Trouble with your air-conditioning. You telephone, sir. It's a 27B/6 of course. Thermostat's gone. And then some. Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you? Who fixed your ducts? It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was? Sign here please. Emergency procedures. We'll be back. It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right. But we can get one. Not ... as such ... Now look what you've done to him. Fixed itself. Fixed? Central Services.On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor. Time to go. My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting! Are you expecting anyone? No. But I can bypass it with one of these Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it! There's your problem. The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork. Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork. Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm - ... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful. ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir. Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these. A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle. They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call. Ha!! Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service. Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
