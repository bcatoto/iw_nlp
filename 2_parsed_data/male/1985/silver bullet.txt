All except my legs... I don't think I can walk. Jane- Please, Uncle Al. Will you marry me, Jane? Jane... you don't have to do that. Jane, I have to talk to you. Where's Mom? Yes. Go away. Stop it! Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she? It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up. A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough? Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said. Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him. Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay? Rats... What kind of noises? What? Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel. Well... it is his third. Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother. Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb. That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green. What if I say no? But Uncle Al! You said- Yeah? Really? Will you do it? I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe. No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it. I saw what I saw. I want you to turn this into a silver bullet. Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again! What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you? There! You see! I told you! I told you! I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was- I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller. No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face. What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick! Well... was it a prescription? It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor. Was it a prescription? It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch! Thanks a million, Uncle Al! What is it? Yeah... sure. Yeah, I know. It's great! Yeah! What is it? Sure. I don't get you. It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al. Do I need one? What? She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always. Don't call me dear boy. Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al. Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a... It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair. What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al? What if it's some kind of monster? Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy? No. Yeah. Mom-! Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot. When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two. Can I tell you kids something? Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with? Jesus. Lowe's car-? I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair. Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST! Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now. I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming. I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed. Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies. Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind. The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit. Marty, the moon wasn't even full! You're not going to let it go, are you? And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy? No. It could have been anything, Marty. No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove. After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all. Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed. Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed. When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you? Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead. Marty, do you see your suspect? Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something. You want to know what I think? I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town. Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself! What the hell does that matter? I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation. You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now. A tracer. You'll like it. Save this one for last. One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference? Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know. Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall. Good. I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you? It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir. You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man. We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful. You got a pilot's license, Marty? Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars. Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up. Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable. Your mom's not around, is she? But you are, you know- you are my dear boy. I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that. It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day. And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty. A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies? Huh? Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy. There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one? You all right, Marty? Let the boy finish the game, Nan. Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox. Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows! If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday. We won't! -and Babcock, I remember. Now go on! See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long. I come here because Marty needs a friend.
