Guess I'm not used to so much. Not one this big. I've seen pictures. Milking? Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do? Just do it! You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy. Put my car in the garage and close the door. They're Amish. Oh sure, Fred. You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs? Where's Timmy and Buck? Sorry. It's important. Pick up the hat. Yes, sir. Pretty much. It's been a while. Try the house. I thought I was the English. Sure have, Sam. Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars. I won't. Now run. Fast as you can! I'll be all right. You just do as I say. Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there! It's them, Sam. Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before. What's that, Sam? Hey, Sam... You don't say. Tell you what � I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand. You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel? Black... I understand. What else,Sam? Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor? Who'd you see? It's all over, Paul. You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer. I've already got something worked out. Be seeing you. You might want to pass it along to Mac. I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you. You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out. Just us. A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days. More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department. Just us. If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut... It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac. He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now. And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum. Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it. What's-her-name moved to Buffalo. The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing. If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months. Maybe. Maybe. Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight � street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed. Yeah. Oh, he's good. Where's my baggy pants? Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help! That's your way, not mine. Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do! Oh, come on, Rachel. No way. Aren't you? After today? No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life. I know. There was. I'm leaving tonight. I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun. Won him over just like that. Not long... A few days. I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea. Sure. Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job. I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking. I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school. A real fireball. Oh? What happened to Hochstetler? The... bullets? I know what he said. I'm going this morning. No. I'd want a public phone. Where's the nearest telephone? Quaint? Can't imagine why. Anything against zippers? Hochmut? Something wrong with buttons? Your husband's? Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure. What's that? Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun - Tell him his tea stinks. Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go. How long have I been here? How long? Does anybody know I'm here? Can I have something to drink? Who are they? Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me. No, no doctor... I can't. I was wrong. Home. You'll be safe. You don't have to worry. Because � somehow � they knew I was getting close. Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything. And they can get away with it because they're cops. Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops. I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved. Oh? Anything else? No. What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired. They kid a lot. Look, I'm genuinely sorry... People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail. Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify. Whacking? Now what's the problem? What was that? Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that. Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide. We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area. There'll be another train. The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there. I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name? Make that 1790. Where I'm at is maybe 1890. I hear you. I'll stay in touch. I'm coming. Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I? It's me. Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass. Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual... Listen to me � Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it. Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can. Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight. Let's just find Coalmine. Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens � Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like? Anybody know about this?Say again? That's more like it. Where are you at, anyway? You hear me? Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch � I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense. Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in. Johnny! Where the hell have you been? I hear you. Johnny, what the fuck? What the hell are you talking about? What's happening. It won't happen again. I got there late, John. I didn't even know about it. What I know, Paul, is... He's going to take you out... He's got my number. I admit I don't know where he is. Probably. Wrong.Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite. Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite? Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before? Good, you start tomorrow. Cows. You know, cows? Maybe milking. No, Rachel... No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me! You are acting like one! Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting! Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child! No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look... Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned! Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing? How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung? Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter. Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands. Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws � That has no place in this house. Looks dead... Is the English dead? Who was that man?You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you? We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different. Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them. Never seen anything like that in all my years.He's not in this building. Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into? Tight. But I'm working on him. She say where he is?Have you got your gun on now? Are you really ever coming back? Don't let them hurt you. What are you going to do? Are they going to kill you? Is it them? ...I want to say a thing. That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers. Okay, Mr. Book. No pistol. Ever. He was... like him. No... I saw the man who killed him. I saw him. I wish dawdie was with us. I don't want to stay here. Momma... are they angry with us. Is this where we're going?Move! Or you die right here! Don't try me, Johnny! Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in � Johnny � How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad. Who else knows? What's your first move? Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it. I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you. Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up Who else knows? I hope you don't have any doubts about that. Well, anyway, don't get crazy. I'll do something for Zenovich's wife. Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde � what's-her-name � come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that. When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department. That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy. You're still convinced there's a link to the department? You know who? So one of them got to him. What have you got? Amish. How reliable is this kid? Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton. Tell me what you know... You're the first one he'll contact. You admit you're lying? You'd lie to protect him. You know where he is. But... if you had to guess? Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him � Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name. Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position. Not yet. All right, where is he? They don't have any shit. Lean on him. What about Carter? I don't think she knows. Nobody's going to hurt your son... Get back in there. Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two. He'll live. Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal. He's got a gun, hasn't he?
