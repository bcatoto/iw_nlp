Ma'am? Nothing. Excuse me... ma'am? She looks up. Blank stare. What is this? Where am I? What's Newark? A city? Woah. I think I'm going to puke. Ticket? A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed. May I see your ticket? The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his pockets. I don't think I... Have to write you up then. He pulls out a citation pad. Is this...? From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The conductor snips his ticket and brushes past. Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it here. Where's this train headed? New York. Penn Station. New York? Why would he be going to New York? How can this be happening? Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination simply continues. Do you know where I got on? The conductor examines his ticket again. Princeton Junction. Where's that? "�Bout ten minutes back. But I've never been to Princeton Junction. See... I don't remember waking up or buying a ticket or getting on the train or anything else. It's just a blank. Lucky you. The jaded conductor moves on. Colter is alone with his confusion. Takes a deep breath. The nausea has eased slightly. Okay. You're gonna figure this out. Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... A COLLEGE STUDENT, slumped against a window, eyes shut, listens to an MP-3 player. An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane. A BACKPACKER, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examines a guidebook. A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a tabbed file box. An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper. None of them pays any attention to Colter. A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister. Like the exhalations of a creature. A SCRAPE. He looks to see A woman FILING HER NAILS. Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems heightened, near the point of overload. He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him. Sean Fentress? Who the hell's that? And why does he have this guy's wallet? He leans forward to speak with Christina again. Ma'am? She lowers her journal, annoyed. We see she hasn't been writing but DRAWING. A well-executed sketch of a face. I'm having a little problem here. I'm trying not to freak out, but I think something's happened to me. Like, total memory loss. Complete. I don't know how I got here. That's not it. See... I'm a pilot. I fly helicopters in Iraq. I'm in the army. She waits for more. As if he's telling a joke. I was on a mission. Right before I woke up here I was in the middle of a mission... I'm telling you the truth. These aren't my clothes. And this wallet here... He holds up the driver's license. One final attempt to convince her. You see this? This isn't me. What? This can't be happening. The train lurches to a stop. Staring back is SEAN FENTRESS'S FACE. Not his own. He's frozen there. Heart pounding. Seized by cosmic panic. He SLAPS himself in the face. Hard. Wake up! The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train, obliging him to hang on. This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from. The other guy's face stares back at him. Blinks when he blinks. Three months?! Jesus. Where am I? I'm dizzy. What is this? Who am I talking to? More confusion. No idea how to react. Just as on the train. When? I was on a train. And... There was a bomb. What the hell is going on?! Standby for thread one of alpha memory pattern. Who are you? You already have that information, Captain. Now think. Recall my name. A long moment. A name floats into his head. Goodwin? Correct. How do I know that? I have no idea how I know your name's Goodwin. Commencing memory pattern. Listen to me. Something's wrong. I was flying a mission. I was in a chopper. Then I woke up on a train. Now I'm here. Can you explain that? What unit is this? You're with Beleaguered Castle. Who? You're with friends. The exercises will assist you. Are you ready? Just like with the train, he seems to have no choice but to go along with it. Memory Thread One. Listen to the following passage: "When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself. She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver. In the cold slant of light reflected from the back wall of a neighboring building, she saw her evening dress and opera cloak lying on a tawdry heap on a chair."� End of thread one. Silence. Is it Colter's turn to speak? I don't get it. Is this a Red Flag exercise? Thread Two. Listen. I am holding the following hand of cards: Queen of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of hearts. I repeat: Queen of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of hearts. End of thread two. Beads of sweat on Colter's forehead. What the hell? Thread Three. The following is a recording of a Western Screech-Owl: A rather spooky BIRD CALL plays -- a short whistle, followed by a long trill. The call is repeated twice more. End of Thread Three. End of pattern. Acknowledge. Unexpectedly, in the back of his mind, a reply is there. A... Acknowledge. End of pattern. How did he know to say that? A conditioned response? Stand by to initiate pattern recall. Go for pattern recall. The response comes to him more quickly. Like lines from an old script. Even if it still baffles him. Queen, two nines, four and a three. That is correct. The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name. What was that name? Laurie. No. Lily. Her name was Lily. At each answer, Goodwin makes notations and adjusts gauges. That is correct. End of pattern. Goodwin leans forward to flip a switch and EVERYTHING GOES Please list the primary specifications of the aerial platform you've been trained to operate. Colter mulls his options. Should he talk? Keep silent? He tugs against the steel harness holding him in. A HATCH, like the kind used on submarines, seals the capsule. Goodwin's voice grows slightly louder over his headset. Please list the primary specifications of the aerial platform you've been trained to operate. Is someone going to tell me what's going on here? Please list the primary -- The UH-60 Blackhawk Helicopter weighs 20,250 pounds with a maximum exterior load capacity of 8,000 pounds. It has a range of 320 nautical miles and is armed with two 7.62 millimeter machine guns. That is correct. Who bombed the train? The train. Who bombed the train, Captain? I have no idea. Whom do you suspect bombed the train? I don't know! You didn't see? Will you tell me what the hell is going on here? The Screech-Owl song can be seen as a progression of musical notes. Did the notes go up, down or remain at the same pitch? I don't know. Just tell me -- How many times was the bird call repeated? What does this have to do with the train? How many times was the bird call repeated? Twice. Incorrect. Who bombed the train, Captain? I don't know who bombed the train! Colter is seething now. Had it with these games. You have seventeen minutes. Use them. Find the bomber. ON SCREEN -- Goodwin leans forward to press a button and -- It's a goddamn simulation. Christina's pen stops sketching. She glances up. A three dimensional, completely immersive scenario. Touch, taste, sound, sight and smell. A measure of relief. A way to think about all this. Complete with pretty girl. Every combat simulator has one. In the middle of a fire fight a pop-up window starts playing a porno. You're an unusual choice for a distraction. Find the bomber. Find the bomber. The conductor approaches him. Ticket? Expecting this now, Colter hands over his ticket to be punched. Everything okay today, chief? Say what? Anything out of the ordinary? The conductor frowns at him. Who is this guy? Please take a seat, sir. Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on. All seems normal. He finds himself focusing on a jumble of unfiltered details -- Suits. Ties. Shoes. Skirts. Watches. Newspapers. Coffee cups. Litter. Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory details slam into him. We go EXTREMELY CLOSE ON: The STITCHING on a leather purse. A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray. AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent. A CRUMPLING SOUND as the Overweight Man crushes an empty soda can. TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on the floor. Faster and faster. Derek, the Wall Street Type, talks on his phone: Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... Then... the CLICK of a LOCK UNLATCHING. How's it going? Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark glasses, Guzman ignores him, but he's visibly uncomfortable. What's your name? Guzman is stock still. Beads of sweat on his forehead. The conductor appears, accosting Colter. Didn't I tell you to take a seat? Goodwin? Where are you? It's over. I found him. Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence. But nothing happens. Who are you talking to? An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's about to retort, about to accuse Guzman, when he stops. It's too easy. Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just might be a mistake. He reconsiders. Sorry. This guy seemed a little... anxious. I was worried about him. I am minding my business. Tell him to mind his. You feeling all right, sir? With a pained smile, Guzman loosens his collar. Motion sickness, I'm afraid. I believe I will get off at the next stop. Very well. The conductor turns back to Colter. Okay. I'm sitting down. Turning away, he finds a seat. He studies Guzman out of the corner of his eye. Hey, you dropped this. (relieved, takes back the Excuse me... Please let me through... Jesus, he's running away. A guy just came through here. Did you see where he went? (not looking up) Lots of guys come through here. Windows look out over the station's parking lot. There's no sign of Guzman out there. He was just here. A Middle Eastern- looking guy. Through the platform doors comes Derek, followed by the College Kid. Derek heads for the parking lot, while the College Kid mills around the newspaper stand. A muffled COUGH. Colter spins. Sees a door marked "MEN'S ROOM."� All better now? Guzman's face hardens. He goes to the sink to wash his hands. Don't much care for trains myself. I resent this. This is harassment. You obviously work for someone. I expected this reception in your country. How are you going to pull this off? That bomb has a cell phone detonator. And I don't see a pay phone around here. So I'm betting you got a phone on you with the number already programmed in. I have no idea what you're talking about. I am an international business man. An executive. The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching. Open your briefcase. Prove to me there's no phone in there. I will prove nothing to you. Leave me alone. WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending Guzman sprawling to the ground. Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again. Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil. "Hasnan Guzman, Vice President, Shell Oil."� Must be a cover. Where the hell's your phone? Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS. Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back. Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and malice. I thought so. Now let's see you try to -- A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots, looks down the tracks. The first thing he sees is You didn't do it. Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned out by the ROAR of Holy fuck! Do you need to urinate? A fucking train just ran over me. Do you need to urinate? How are you doing this? Am I on some kind of drug? Did you find the bomber? I didn't find the bomber. You fooled me with the Middle Eastern guy. I went for the diversion. What kind of freaky simulation is this? Let me out of here! Which Middle Eastern guy? Be specific. Guzman. Shell Oil. Look, I don't have intel experience. Why do you have me doing this? You've already been told what you need to know. Discipline your memory. Limit your operational awareness to the tasks we assign you. Everything else is irrelevant. Irrelevant? Killing me each time is irrelevant? You do not die. As you can see, you simply return to us. How? How can you do that? Silence. Who's the man with the pipe? Say again? There was a man smoking a pipe. I saw him on the monitor. Who's he? How does he fit into this? The man with the pipe isn't here right now. Let me talk to him. This isn't right. I'm not your prisoner. Goodwin makes technical adjustments to dials and gauges. You feel unsatisfied with our relationship? What is this? Why are you talking like that? Is this some kind of script? If Guzman, the Middle Eastern man, is innocent, as you maintain, who might be the guilty party? Who cares? I'm tired of this. This isn't a game, Captain. Then what is it? Don't you already know who the bomber is? Don't you have all the answers? We have no answers. Only corpses. A weird beat. Corpses? Whose corpses? The passengers? Some were too badly burned to be identified. The heat from the explosion fused many of them completely into the wreckage. Is this the truth? Or another evasive answer? His mind pulled in all kinds of unpleasant directions. These were real people? Yes. This really happened? Yes. When? Today. Today?! The train blew up today? It was attacked this morning, at 7:57 a.m., Eastern Standard Time. Six miles outside of New York City. Colter's head is spinning. You're lying. I don't believe it. What do your senses tell you? His senses tell him it's true. But how can he accept it? Where am I, right now, as we speak? With Beleaguered Castle. My unit's still in Iraq. I'm flying missions in Iraq. I flew one yesterday! Your unit was rotated Stateside three weeks ago. The news comes like a slap in the face. Colter clearly has no memory of this. Then why do I still have Iraqi dirt underneath my fingernails? Goodwin simply makes another adjustment on the controls. Talk to me! Three weeks? I've been back three weeks? How'd I get in here? Have I seen my family? Does my father know I'm home? "�Cause I'd kinda like to tell him if that's the case. Listen up, soldier. Goodwin hunches forward, putting his elbows on his desk. As he does so, he inadvertently reveals a glimpse of his military unit SHOULDER PATCH. The insignia contains wings and a lightning bolt against a background of stars. Underneath it is written "CAOC-N."� The train is just the beginning. Our intel says there are more attacks are coming today. And they're linked with the train. Time is of the essence. Do you understand? Colter barely hears. He's fixated on that shoulder patch. Captain? I'm listening. D.N.I. Counterterrorism has come up with the five most likely follow-up targets in the New York area. They are, in no order of importance, the Holland Tunnel, Newark International Airport, the Brooklyn Bridge, Penn Station and the Empire State Building. It could be any of them, it could be none of them. Whatever it is, if you find the bomber and learn his plan, the next one we might be in a position to prevent. Those are your orders. It's too much information to process. Colter's head spins with questions. Wait. If I'm somehow on that train before it blows up, why don't I just dismantle the bomb? Those are not your orders. But all those people dying... Those are not your orders. You are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission. Military priorities. Defying comprehension. I didn't volunteer for this shit. Would you like to see the release form you signed? How do I know it's real? How do I know you didn't force me to sign it? And how the hell can I be put on a train over and over again -- a train I never was really on?! He might as well be talking to a wall. I don't believe in time travel, Goodwin. There's no such thing. Only one way forward, Captain. Seventeen minutes. Find the truth. Why seventeen? Why me? Why anything? The capsule begins to SHAKE. Let me out! Don't send me back there! SFX: UP ON a HUGE ROAR as -- Shit. This is not happening. He leans back in his seat, as if just another beaten down office worker on the train. You an artist? Can I see what you're working on? You don't look like you belong here. The way you're dressed. I'd really like to see what you're working on. Unless you're worried I won't like it. So you scribble away on that thing so as not to deal with people. She scowls. Tosses the sketch pad onto his lap. Surprised, Colter opens it. It's full of faces -- thumbnail portraits of other passengers riding the train. They're exquisitely observed, darkly stylized into expressions of loneliness. They're amazing. Seriously, they're really good, Miss...? My name's Colter. How many of these passengers have you drawn? You know all about them? Dangerous? You see anything unusual happen this morning? Anything out of the ordinary? Has anyone else come out of that bathroom that you remember? She takes a closer look at him. A puzzled smile. Don't you know? Haven't you seen me here every day for, what, three months? If I told you that there's a terrorist on this train, that I was sent here to catch him, would you believe me? Then tell me which one you'd arrest. Christina pages through her sketch pad again. Considering different faces. Never mind. He gets up. Foolish of him to confide in her. His watch now reads THIRTEEN MINUTES. Thanks for your help, ma'am. I don't know. Thirty two? Her icy glare tells him he's guessed too high. What happened, Fentress? Who are you? How can I be you? FLASHCUT -- Back in the isolation unit. On the monitor, the glimpse of Goodwin's SHOULDER PATCH INSIGNIA. The unit initials "CAOC-N."� Back to scene. Colter churning over the thought. "CAOC-N."� What unit is that? A KNOCK on the door. Leave me alone. Colter walks off. Irked at his change in tone, she follows him, carrying his messenger bag. Terrorist? Why did you say that? Stop joking. Who are you? Are you an operative? Why do you have sketches of everybody on board? Are you part of this? I can have you arrested. Maybe that's the only way you'll drop the bullshit and talk. Stay put. I'm getting help. She sees he's serious and drops her arch playfulness. Speaks in a flat, sober voice. Son of a bitch. "CAOC-N."� That's not army. That's Air Force. Combined Air and Space Operations Center. Nellis Air Force Base! They're running this whole thing out of Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Fucking Nevada! Tears in Christina's eyes. That Colter would persist in this delusion after what she's confessed about herself. (racking his brain) What's there? What's on that base? B-52s. KC tankers. Air Combat Command. Predator Drones. Remote operations. (something to this) This a remote operation. What if it is time travel? What did he say? A WARNING ALARM begins beeping. Passengers look around uneasily. Christina, however, focuses her anger on Colter. Christina! He grabs her -- she struggles against him -- Goodwin? What's happening? Come in. Can you read me? It's goddamn cold in here. He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which had been blowing in air FALL SILENT. Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen. The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES. Goodwin! It's now COMPLETELY DARK. He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump. A terrifying silence. The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing around. Then... The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule. Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS... But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed. He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is incredibly cramped. Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS. He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the hull. Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed. Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing. Come on! Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke. He's burned his fingers. But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT. Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint electric HUM. FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the craft. Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does, a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on: Hello? Anyone out there? It's me. He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up. Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of another world. It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as Can you hear me? Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset. I'm here! I'm okay! Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right. Yeah. It's me. Colter. Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling. The capsule lost power. It's still pretty cold in here. I think so. Who are you? They wouldn't let me talk to you before. You're the inventor of this thing. I don't want to deal with Goodwin anymore. Don't you understand? He's torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't you get me out of here? Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to deal with personnel issues. He's a remote operator. And remote operators are risk averse pussies who sit at control screens in the rear while actual pilots like me put their asses on the line in the field. And just what kind of mission is this? Talk to me, man. Why won't he let me save those people on the train? Why not? I know what's going to happen. I could take apart the bomb. Stop the train. What's the difference? Telling me what? Coaxing the scientist in him. Is Source Code time travel? Why can't I save those people on the train? So... What happens to the Source Code world after I leave it? What about the bicycle? I see it each time. Right after the bomb goes off. Like an after image. There's a bicycle and a stone wall and a girl. It's a girl from the train. I don't know where any of it is supposed to be, but -- Rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth. Yeah. Just for a split second. Rutledge is stunned. Like he's discovered some strange new property to his invention. No. It's there. What do you think it means? Rutledge, wait. Don't leave me. Rutledge steps away. A pointed look at Colter. Goodwin settles back into his seat, donning the headset. Welcome back. How are you feeling? I'm alive. No thanks to you. You find the bomber? You're a brick wall, Goodwin. A fucking brick wall. Lower your pulse. The situation has worsened. The fire on the tracks caused one of the freight cars to blow up and release some kind of gas. As a precaution they're having to evacuate all of lower Manhattan. Evacuate lower Manhattan? The enormity of this. Having to take it on faith. We may have lost the initiative. What do you mean? Let's keep going. We were expecting more from you. I can give you more. Let me think for a second. But Goodwin ignores him. Absorbed in paperwork. The freight car blows up from the fire. It spews gas, or what could be gas -- it might be chlorine, so they can't take any chances. Anxious now. Trying to make up lost ground. Whatever it takes to get sent back in. So they decide to play it safe and evacuate parts of New York City. And maybe that's part of the terrorists' plan, right? So... so who benefits from that? What's vulnerable? What's down there in lower Manhattan? Wall Street. Wall Street. That's what they're going to hit next. The financial markets. Goodwin considers this. For the first time, slightly impressed. I want to show you something. Did she die, too? Yes. This drivers license photo was found with her body. We're creating a database of recovered identifications as they come in from the site. A pang of sorrow. Moving among ghosts. You sure she's dead? Would you like to see her morgue photos? She was sitting across from me. I told you I didn't want to see her! The camera ZOOMS IN on a corpse. Its burned face, like a piece of rotted fruit, fills the screen. Nevertheless, we recognize it. And it's not Christina. It's someone else. That's... He died on the train. Would you like to see the other passenger photos? Perhaps that would help you. You still have Christina's body? The other things she was carrying? I want to know about her. Everything I can. She's not just another victim. She's connected to all this. Thirty six dollars and eleven cents. She looks up at him. In your wallet. Right now. Thirty six dollars and eleven cents. Yes. In five seconds, a guy's going to open a can of soda. We're about to pass a street with willow trees. Two girls will be jumping rope. A white dog's going to run out behind them. A Dalmatian mix. In a moment, they pass a scene exactly as Colter described. Christina's befuddled smile. Close observation. You could say I'm a collector of moments. Yes. You trained to be an artist. No response. You got A's in line drawing and oil painting. But your work didn't sell. You took a job answering phones in a law firm. Six months ago you moved back in with your parents. Two weeks ago you put your paints away for good. The sketch book is all you have left. You. But we have, Christina. You've drawn all these people here. You know their routines. At one point you thought you were different from all of them. But now you're not so sure. Christina has gone white. Utterly incredulous. I need your help. Listen to me. I can't use up any more time trying to convince you. I just need you to believe everything I'm about to tell you. Bear with me. (beat, where to begin?) Your sketch book. Is there a drawing of me in there? Please, Christina. The thing is, that's not me. No. You drew what you saw, but the person you're seeing now is someone else. I'm not Sean Fentress. I'm not really on this train. I'm taking someone's place. Borrowing it. My name is Colter. I'm a soldier. And I'm being held prisoner. And this is the only way -- the only time and place I have -- to figure out how to escape. She gives him a blank look. I'm serious. Elements in the American military are using me for an experiment. I'm not sure exactly how it all happened, but I'm at a facility on Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Right now. As we speak. It's a project called Source Code. It's a program. It shifts identities. It also performs small amounts of time travel. Or "time engineering."� I don't know the jargon. He's not getting through to her. It's too bizarre. I've been put on this train to look for someone. A criminal. And I need to find out just enough about him to keep them putting me back on this train. Because right here's only place I can figure out what's really happening. But I have very little time. And each time I come back, you won't remember me and I'll have to go through this all over again. Then how do I know all those things about you if we've never spoken before? She doesn't have an answer. Can't easily dismiss him. Because I think you have the answer to this whole thing. There's a vision. I keep having it. It's very powerful. And you're in it. And there's a bicycle. And this... old stone wall. And it's very peaceful. Does this sound familiar? Like where you live, maybe? The vision must mean something. It's the only time when I'm not on the train or in the capsule. Why else would Rutledge be so interested? Someone who was trying to help me understand something. Until they got to him. He lowers his head. A dead end. No answer. The train begins to slow down. I don't believe in that shit. Most of my friends are in the military. My dad runs a melon farm in Alabama. Me and my dad, we don't see eye to eye. We're just two different people. Are you always this sarcastic? What day is it? June? One more thing to puzzle him. The call connects. An OLDER MAN, DONALD STEVENS, answers. The gravelly voice of a Midwestern farmer. Dad? Donald doesn't respond. Dad, it's me. It's Colter. Again, silence. Been a while, huh? I'd been meaning to call you, but -- Click. The line goes dead. Colter looks at Christina. He wanted me to stay on and take over the farm but... I had other ideas. What? The hell I am. Challenged, he redials. Braced for conflict. The call connects. Dad, don't hang up. We're going to talk. I need your help. Now you listen to me. Whoever you are, never call here again. Donald hangs up. No... it was like he didn't even know who I was. Troubled, he hands back her phone. Outside, the EXPRESS TRAIN flashes by. Sorry to have bothered you. He gets up to go. Christina stays where she is. Forget it. Thank you, ma'am. Twenty five? She smiles, pleased. I just do. You said you wanted to know. Shut the door. As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink. It's up here. He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest of the way. What are you -- Just look. Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb. Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid explosive. There's fourteen cannisters of it. Simple detonator. Cell phone signal closes the circuit and boom. He lowers her. An incredulous beat. No. It was someone else. They don't know who. That's why I'm here. To find out. Watching her. Will she believe him? It won't matter. The train's already... I've been sent here. It sounds crazy, but it's true. I've been sent from the future -- from five hours in the future. This train's already been blown up. She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be. You wanted to know. Now you know. She turns and hurries for the exit doors. Sits in the semi-darkness, faintly illuminated by the bathroom's fluorescent light. As he grabs hold of the bomb, he hears -- Look. Now the fucking thing can't go off. Reads 20 SECONDS. Source Code's classified. It wouldn't be in a newspaper. She found me? What does that mean? She stops. Not wanting to go on. From outside comes the HORN from the approaching freight train. Jesus Christ, Christina, are you going to spit it out? In his hand, the CELL PHONE RINGS. Colter's eyes light up in amazement -- the DISPLAY SCREEN is showing the name and number of the bomber. But before he can read what's there, Christina's voice finds its way to the back of his brain: Are you comfortable? Are you warm? Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing entirely from existence. Do you need to urinate? Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak. Beleaguered Castle is waiting for your report. Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the 1970s, comes on: Captain, I know you can hear me. Did you find the bomber? Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting. As you're collecting your thoughts, I should tell you there's been another development. A terrorist group has taken responsibility for bombing the train. This began broadcasting over the Internet a half hour. We've traced it to central Asia. (on camera, in accented These attacks will show you that you will never be safe. You can secure your borders. But what can you do against one of your own citizens? One who looks like you, who is blameless, living already among you, who takes eighty million of our dollars, a trifle, and carries out our bidding? You cannot stop this. Time has run out. The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of Goodwin. Let me talk to Rutledge. So you've decided to speak. Rutledge. Get him. We appreciate your desire for further discussion. Perhaps at a later date. Will you let me out of here? Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations. Frankly, Captain, we're disappointed. Find Rutledge! Now! I have to say that we expected more from you. Stop! Stop reading from your goddamn script! Perhaps we overestimated your abilities. I swear to fucking Christ! Please accept the criticism in the spirit it was given. Perhaps a few memory exercises would help. I don't need your criticism and I don't need your memory exercises, you gutless freak. And by the way, that bomb is detonated by a cell phone. When activated, the phone's display screen displays caller ID information. Caller ID. I wonder if that information would be useful to Beleaguered Castle. For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of the cold clinician goes back up. Very well. We're ready for that information. You'll have to send me back. I didn't get a good look at it. But I will next time. Goodwin hesitates. Skeptical. What assurance do we have you'll be able to read the screen before the device detonates? Goodwin, there's no time left. Send... me... back. Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes are unblinking. Unfeeling. Nothing behind them. Who's walking off with the guy's cell phone. Behind him, the Computer Engineer gets up. Hey, do you have my phone? People turn to look. Among them is Christina. Colter just starts walking faster. Dude, give me back my phone! Sorry. Wrong turn. Reversing gears, Colter backs out of the compartment. Las Vegas, Nevada. Nellis Air Force Base. Is this... Nellis Air Force Base? I'm trying to reach... Captain Colter Stevens. Calling himself. Strange. No idea where this is going. Then give me the Combined Air and Space Ops Center. Who is this? I'm calling for Rutledge. It's urgent. This is Captain Colter Stevens. An eerie pause. Colter Stevens. Captain Colter Stevens. Let me talk to Rutledge. Where are you? How did you find us? I'm on the train. The train pulls to a stop. You don't know. It hasn't happened yet. The explosion. Don't you understand? I'm in it, Goodwin. I'm calling you from inside the mission. Inside the Source Code. A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving. Goodwin, I'm trapped in this and I can't get out. No! Wait! Don't hang up! Forget authorization. There's no time. Soon you're going to find out what happened on this train. And then your own day is going to start. But not until then. Right now it's just you and me talking. And you're a different Goodwin than the one I'm going to go back to in a few minutes. You're separate from him. Separate worlds. Do you understand? Good. Now there's a lot of secrecy in all of this, and you have your reasons for that. But here and now, just this once, I need to ask you something. And you need to tell me the truth. I'm going to ask it. Jesus, Goodwin, how can I get through to you? You're not just a soldier. Somewhere inside you're a human being, too. Somewhere inside you've got to know that this is wrong. Source Code is wrong. And if you can't grasp that, if you just follow orders, then you're just as much a prisoner as I am. The car SHUDDERS as the EXPRESS TRAIN FLASHES BY. Quiet returns as it recedes. Did I survive that helicopter crash in Iraq? Silence. Colter shuts his eyes. Answer me. Did I survive that crash? Another pause. This is crushing Colter. Goodwin. What? You did not physically survive the crash. A terrible chill comes over Colter. He swallows. Trying to stay brave. Not physically? Fuck. At least give me an answer I can understand. But... the capsule I'm in... You had no right. I was a soldier. Then. But now? After death? What is the status of your mission? Is it a success? You really want to know? That's what we do. Keep stuff from each other. Will this ever end? How can I get out of this? How? And then what? How many times have I done this? No one knows I'm here. No one can help me. You can't do this. I served my country. I already gave my life. What? Military court or civilian court? Does that make it any less wrong? No answer. Colter looks down at his watch. Time is running out. And there's absolutely nothing he can do. Goodwin?! Rutledge appears. Drops into the seat and puts on the headset. Fiddles with his pipe as a way to avoid looking at the camera. I finally get it, Rutledge. You're the good guy, Goodwin's the bad guy. Working together, you get what you want out of me. Why didn't I see it before? Drop it. I know about the helicopter crash. I know what they've done with me. What's in it for me? You can do better than that. They sent you here to offer me a deal. What's their offer? What can they possibly threaten me with after so colossally fucking me? Spit it out, you spineless turd. Rutledge's face goes red. Quite possibly no one has ever spoken to him like this before. After a sputtering pause, Rutledge's mouth hardens. Those after images I saw. You never knew about them. They weren't part of Source Code architecture, were they? You don't believe that. I've been to places you haven't. I've crossed and recrossed that line between living and dying. And when I do, that veil gets lifted for just a second. And what's there is real. Maybe it's a vision of the next world, but I can see it. Get there? What do you mean? You'd never do it. You wouldn't have to. You could just flip the switch and start me back up again unaware. For all I know, you've made this deal with me before. I'm going to find you, Rutledge. Someday. Somewhere. You hear me? Somehow, I'm going to find you. I think so. But there wasn't time to read the screen. As soon as it rang the bomb went off. I was unable examine the phone without separating it from the detonator -- which I was instructed not to do. His delivery is different now. Impersonal. Distant. Wait. What are you -- Please... I don't feel good... I don't know... I honestly... I can't keep... The HUMMING again. He's helpless. An insect on a pin. Colter tears at his restraints, ready to bash his brains out against the controls. He SCREAMS... Go ahead! Open your fucking soda! CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man complies. Some half-muttered reproaches, then most people go back to what they were doing. Colter is slumped in a corner. Christina appears. Taps him on the shoulder. Ma'am, please... return to your seat. Footsteps. The sound of jangling KEYS. Ticket. Ticket, please. He still needs a ticket. Colter makes no move to respond. No more concern for anything. Have it your way, pal. He takes out his book to write Colter up. I have no idea where he got on. Full fare's $22.50. Why did you just do that? Will you do me a favor? Get off the train. Please. Just get off the train. Her puzzled look. The train begins to SLOW DOWN. You shouldn't have been on this train, Christina. You should be living another life. Not spending it answering phones for lawyers. Hey, you dropped this. (relieved, takes it back) Wow. Thanks. The train stops. The doors OPEN. Everyone has a destiny. And this isn't yours. He steps out onto the platform. Holds out his hand for her to join him. A coaxing look. She's incredulous. This guy. His words. This whole moment. Just do it. Stop being afraid. Believe in yourself. He waits for her. Only two steps away. Instead of going directly to the station house, Derek continues walking down the platform alongside the train, as if intending to reboard further down. And then it happens. With a quick motion Derek TOSSES SOMETHING through an open door of another car, then heads quickly away towards the station house. With no time to think, Colter slips back on board just as the doors slide shut. There's nothing there. Whatever Derek tossed inside is gone. Did someone pick it up? Colter looks up the aisle and then the other way into the next car. No one there. Once more he examines the exit area. Gets down on his knees. Then he spots it -- an OPENING between the floor and one of the wall panels, only a few inches high. And there something lies. Colter slides it out. Derek's WALLET. Intentionally left here. The same wallet the College Kid gave back to Derek earlier. Opening it, Colter pulls out Derek's DRIVER'S LICENSE. Believe me, he's our guy. He tossed his own wallet back on the train. Only reason he'd do that... You saw that terrorist video -- they said it was one of us. One of our own. How? Torture him, you mean. Excuse me. Assalam'alaikoom. Squeezing past, Guzman does a double take to hear the standard Arabic reply. The New York Times. Huh? The metal door to THE SAFE has been OPENED. You forget something? Gosh. Is that my wallet? As he goes to take it, Colter GRABS HIM. What the hell, man? What the hell??? You see this? Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took off the bomb. Holds it inches from Derek's face. Now you can't blow it up. What is this? Get away from me! The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him. Believe me, I'm very accurate with one of these things. Jesus. Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a decent man, terrorized. It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy? A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him. Stay there, my man. Don't hurt me. Stop acting, for Chrissakes. Keep my wallet. Take my watch. Take anything you want. Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble. There. Now you have two wallets. Take them and go. Shut up! Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this. Please. I have a family. What about those other passengers? Don't you think they had families? Just what is this about? This man's a terrorist. He planted a bomb on the train. What? Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the barrel of the pistol into Derek's cheek. What's the next attack? Who else are you going to kill today, huh? Oh God... Oh God... Guzman takes a step towards Colter. One more step, asshole. Don't treat him like this. He's not an animal. Neither are you. Listen to him. For God's sake I'm not a terrorist...! A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down, ashamed. Colter keeps the gun on him. Piss all you want. You took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today. Eighty million dollars? I swear to you... Then what about the wallet, huh? Why the fuck did you twice try to leave your wallet on board? Time's up! What is it?! What is the next attack! So help me, I'll put this bullet through your brain. I don't know what you're talking about! I'm going to do it. Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk. I would never hurt anyone. I have a family. I guess you'll have to kill me. But Colter can't. He can't shoot him. He lowers the gun. Disgusted with himself. Why can't he do it? You see? You are a human being. Speaking gently. Trying to calm him. Even as Colter feels like he's failed. This can be worked out. We can listen to each other. The temperature cooling. Derek's nodding with him. Anything you want... Please... The detonator CELL PHONE RINGS, startling all of them. Confused, he answers the phone. Hello. Christina? How can you be calling this number? I was trying to warn you. I'm not sure that it matters now. I'm right here, okay? Don't be afraid. What did you say? On the train. Earlier. Derek in his seat, on his cell phone. Colter nearby, overhearing him: Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... "By one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed."� That's what you said. You knew. You knew there was going to be an evacuation. You knew before it happened. All those people walking across the... The realization hits. They're going to bomb the bridges. While they're full of people. A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a disturbance on a surface of deep water. Christina? Just hang in there. You'll be okay. A HAND closes over his gun. Before Colter can react, Derek The Army investigated Colter's helicopter crash in Iraq. Apparently he stayed behind to fly protective cover for a disabled convoy until he ran out of fuel. No. It's the Silver Star. Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's breezy good humor. I thought I might inform the captain of the citation. The memory wipe? I thought we were going to let him die. Oh. Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission. How are you feeling? Are you comfortable? Just do it. Come again? Just do it. I knew they wouldn't let me die. At least you can make me forget all of this. I hope. Goodwin stares at his hands. Unmoving. What are you waiting for? You're just doing your job. I'd do the same thing if I was you. At least you've got a shot at saving those people on the bridges. I doubt it. You don't think they'll save them? No. I meant, I doubt you'd be doing this, if you were me. An unusually personal statement, coming from Goodwin. Look, someone had to be where you're sitting, and someone had to be in here. Turned out it was you and me. Just do it. I'm tired. Would you like to see Christina again? One last time? Colter's not sure he heard him right. I don't understand. Seventeen minutes. That's all I could give you. No mission to fulfill. Just... the two of you. Why would you do that? As a favor. One prisoner to another. Prisoner? You were right. About me. And about Source Code. We've kept too much from each other. An odd sensation comes over Colter. I usually report in at 0600. Today I was there early. I was there when the call came in. Your call. His call? They share a long look. No... There's no way... There's no way you could have... Goodwin just smiles. How? The Source Code was a parallel world! You told me so! It's hermetically sealed. Nothing I did on that train would have any effect on this reality! You were on the train. I was not. But... We didn't know if any bleed- throughs could occur. The implications would be staggering. That's why you were told to avoid unduly influencing events. You're saying I could have saved those people?! No. Not in our world. The time currents are too strong. But minor alterations, here and there, a phone call, say, those might slip through. We didn't know for sure. But you proved it. Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it. I've been thinking about the things you said on that call. As the day passed, the more I understood them. And now, I guess we've caught up to each other. Man. Just when I think I understand this... There's not much time. They think I'm re-initializing the system. One last look at her. That's all I can give you. If that. They'll nail your ass for this. If I had any feelings, I'd worry about that. But, as you've maintained, I do not. The strange path of their relationship. Ending at last at simple, grudging respect. Roger that. This is Beleaguered Castle signing off. Acknowledge final transmission. Final transmission acknowledged. Thank you, Goodwin. Goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at Colter. The noise gets louder. The capsule begins to shake. Colter touches the monitor. His fingers imparting to the last image of his world a quiet benediction. We don't know, sir. But Source Code is up and running again. No idea, sir. A DIGITAL CLOCK ticks down from 17 minutes: 15:28... 15:27... Sir? I wouldn't do that. Rutledge gives a dismissive snort. And yet he pauses. We've never interrupted Source Code in mid run. We'd have to literally pull the plug. It could damage the processors. I don't think that's where he's headed. Rutledge considers. And then catches on. Hey, you dropped this. Wow. Thanks. Keeping his composure, Derek accepts the wallet. Colter steps aside, allowing them to pass. Allowing it all to happen. The station slides into view. No one on the platform. Derek Frost. Derek goes to get back on the train. The doors, however, SLIDE SHUT in his face. Through the closed doors, Derek looks in at Colter, still on the train. They stare at one another through the window. Mr. Frost. Please turn to face us. An entire PHALANX OF POLICE OFFICERS is on the platform. Of course. What's this about? Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE and is DIALING IT as he turns around. The police approach, cautiously. Place your hands in the air. My pleasure. Raising his hands, he pushes SEND on his phone. On board the train there's a RINGING. I'm already a private, sir. Sorry, I can't let you pass. Goodwin removes the patch on his uniform to reveal the insignia of a major. Step aside. That's an order. We all know your rank, Goodwin, but I have explicit orders from Rutledge not to -- BAM! Goodwin drops the Medic with a splintering HEADBUTT. I'm glad you know my rank. Were you also aware I'm in the Special Forces? So you have no idea how your cell phone was used to call in the tip? No! People mill about waiting for the buses, groaning and complaining. Christina accosts a passing transit employee. Ain't life grand? Looking over, she notices him. Maybe that's a good thing. She gives him a sharp look. Hello, Captain. As Goodwin edges forward, we reveal the bare foot of someone lying there. A DIGITAL TIMER reads 1 MINUTE. Give me twenty seconds. That train was taking you to a place you didn't want to be. But then you got off. And maybe that's a sign. Thank you for your service. Time to go home. Goodwin's hand goes to the switch to shut off life support. His eyes on the clock. It reads 30 SECONDS. Hey. She turns. Colter gets up. You can do anything you want with your life. Starting right now. She's taken aback. He starts walking off. Maybe some other time. Disappointment flickers on her face. She turns to go. Behind her is a STONE WALL. A BICYCLE is parked against it. Colter's breath catches in his throat. This is it! This is the mysterious scene he's been seeing! HIS WATCH - Hits ZERO. Back away, sir, now! The MP has leveled his rifle at Rutledge. Who steps back, aghast. His authority has vanished with Colter's life. Goodwin shuts off the monitors. Silence fills the room. Colter is dead. Rutledge stares sorrowfully at Colter's body. Then at Goodwin with burning hatred. Go ahead and arrest me. But the MP does nothing. I'll be around. Whenever you want me. They part as he walks out of the room. A look of grim satisfaction on his face. You're right. The least I can do is buy you coffee. This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it.
