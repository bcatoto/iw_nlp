Now, now little whore. Did I get you or your little one? A Cimmerian warrior is like any other man. A Cimmerian warrior feels hunger. He feels cold. Like other men he may lie and cheat. (stares the boys down) But when a Cimmerian warrior hungers, he hungers only for the blood of his enemy. When he feels cold, it is the cold steel of his sword. When he lies, he lies in wait for his enemy. And when he cheats, he cheats death itself! Conan! You are too young to be here. Withdraw. He said leave, motherless whelp. In the black crag in the high pass stands a wooden training sword. The one who claims it, with stone still in his mouth, will have earned the right to train with the warriors. Well? What are you waiting for?! Conan! Run! They killed one. I killed three. I am a warrior now. They would have done the same -- "Stoke your fire, chop your wood." I have slept where wolves dare not. I have balanced a thousand river stones. When will you teach me the sword? To slay ones enemies. Why did it break? See something? All this sneaking around for a lowly tribe of barbarians. That is only because they have never faced my legion. Then show us. But should you fail, remember the plan. Retreat! Death is in the air, invaders. Can you taste it? Indeed. I savor it. Father! Do we need more weapons? No! I will fight! Father, I am not afraid to die. No! (strange dialect - All you wish, once we are gone. I seek neither gold nor steel, but flesh and blood. The last of a royal line that goes back three thousand years. But I seek a woman. Then our stories began in the same place, Cimmerian. I too lost my wife to marauders. How many men, in how many lands have suffered so? The only answer is power, strength unfettered, the kind of which can unite all Hyboria under a single crown. That is the legacy I seek. Will you join me? I would cut out his eyes, father, so that he will not find them. So he will wander the afterlife forever. Show me your strength, Fariq. Without it, you will never rule. With it, you will never be forgotten. Burn this place. It no longer exists. He's back there. What's this one done? What's he done?! What hasn't he done? He's bedded six of my whores and finished off three casks of mead--and he hasn't paid so much as a silver piece for it. So have your men deal with him. I did. Sounds like a real problem. Too bad we have other places to be right now. Just get that behemoth out of here. Piss-water! You'll serve my friends and I your best, barman, or you'll taste steel! Time to leave, northerner. No, my small friends. It's time to die. Now-- Who's first -- By the gods, he's as heavy as a horse. Even a dead horse smells better than this. What's the charge? Public drunkenness. Another damn hill ape who can't handle his liquor. Is that so, boy? How do you plead? Where's the Captain of the Guard? In the cells, interrogating a prisoner. And you'll get the same if you don't answer. You're accused of public drunkenness. How do you plead? In truth, I've been guilty of much. Jewels stolen from the crowns of kings, men's heads split in battle for the price of a night's drink. But through that I've searched and waited and hunted my prey. But drink? Haven't had a drop all night. The key to the cells. I don't have it. There's a guard inside the door. Only he can open it. You can't kill me! He'll only open the door for me! What is it? Fine, fine. Men! You've made a huge mistake, ape. You'll never make it out of this place. I came for you, Lucius. You talk as though you know me, ape. I do. And I am no ape. I am Cimmerian. What do you want? Who are you? I'm the one who made you pretty. Impossible! You're dead! No. I am death. And I came a long way for you. Wait!! Wait!! I can tell you where the rest are. Where? The end of the earth. You kill me, and you'll never find them. Who are you offering? Who do you think? All of them. Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and Khalar Singh himself. But you have to swear you won't kill me. You have my word. You tell me where I will find Khalar Singh, and I will not kill you. He is in a city called on the edge of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of Hyboria. Khor Khalba. You gave your word! What are you doing?! Toasting, to our deal. Go. You are free. I won't get far like this. The key to your shackles sits in the Captain's gut. Happy hunting. Barbarian! I had your word! You said you would spare my life! No. I said I wouldn't kill you. He says the Queen is here. Take care, Ukafa. You hold a special place in my kingdom, but blood you are not. And I would gladly sacrifice every last man to get my hands on the Queen. And in that respect, Fariq has my confidence. He knows more of the legends of Acheron than anyone. Father, they are here! The hidden oasis, just as it was written. No swords. Khalar needs them alive. The north gate. Destroy it. Who was guarding that gate? It was I, Lord. Take four legions. Hunt her. Before I hunt you. The gods are good. (to the other slavers) Chain this one in my cage. She'll be the prize of the auction in Khor Kalba. All these years searching the ends of the earth. And here you are. Just a two day ride from Khor Kalba. I can scarcely believe it. Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't know who we are. Maybe he's not looking for the Queen. Yes. I come to resurrect the greatest empire Hyboria has ever known. Have you hidden from the world so long that you cannot to see? Blood, magic, death: it is everywhere. Acheron is no different than any other kingdom, but for its glory. 34. Yes. You will. The caves beneath Khor Khalba contain all manner of creature, many -- altered -- by centuries of blood magic. But one, in particular, has developed a special connection to the blood. A thirst. It is said that only the Queen of Acheron itself can resist its embrace. So what say you? Will you be the lucky one, or will you tell me who is? Wake up, slags! Smile! A new owner approaches! And I would sample that reward, fair one, but you wear white. 36. Good day, sir! A lone rider in a desolate land. The perfect customer for what I sell. Silence whore! Khor Kalba. Which way? This is the road to Khor Kalba. Ahead. Past the Great Wall. Use your whips on the horses' legs! You! The girl! Bring her to Khalar! Who are you? Many died to capture nobody. (motions to his horse) Get up. Perhaps the slavers took your orders. I don't. You speak of animals as if they were less than men. But animals don't stab their brothers in the back or steal their mother's only possession. And they never lie. Very well. Give me your name. I am Conan. What more names do I need? There is only one truth I need from you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why does Khalar Singh want you? Then let's hope it's for your cooking. Trying to poison me? What are you doing? Crom! What would you pray for? That a bone may not get stuck in your throat? No words nor gods will give you one more moment than fate allows you. I need no pity. Don't worry. His back is broken. He won't be slinking away this time. Now, let's eat. I enjoy a little music with my meal. Please! Mercy! You are more fit to inflict torture than to endure it. Your life is not nailed to your spine as my peoples are. Stop! Stop! I know how make you rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar Singh? You have what he want. The girl, yes? Khalar give you anything for her. More! Why would he? She could be the one. One what? The one. The Queen. A queen in hiding. Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring her. He wait for me now, at Great Wall. He pay you anything. More! So I should ransom her to your master? Not exactly loyal -- but still, a good idea. You'll help me deliver it. Please! Please! I help you! I do anything you wish! Good. Die. He brought a message? You let the girl escape once, Ukafa. What makes you think you can do better now? I found the monastery. It was my understanding that you were in charge of its capture -- Enough! We will take no chances. We will pay this thief what he wants, and more. Here. Eat. Fire draws attention. The only blood on these hands I claimed with my own sword. Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and Queens claim more lives than I will ever meet, and not a drop is spilled in their presence. You lie. You are the very reason my people are dead. But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed my people, looking for you. You know this. You hid from him. And while you did, others died in your place. And I do not care, for he will not live to see it bear fruit! Enough lies. You will keep quiet. You will be the lure that will draw me close. Then I will scale the wall and cut him down where he stands. They will not be a problem. Did I ask? I will not fail. Let me take care of this thief, father. He's beneath your notice. He killed Remo, likely his cavalry legion as well. Whatever he is, he is more than a mere thief. Be still! (yelling to Khalar) I have what you want! Where's my gold?! Triple your price. Come and claim it. Send the gold. You're fast. But are you fast enough? You should have run, while you could. Fariq! I was wondering what it would take for you to stop cowering. I wasn't cowering. I was studying. You're quite gifted with a sword, but it's not from schooling. Your speed and power makes up for a lack of -- finesse. I've seen such fighting before -- Cimmerian. Ukafa, you will take half our forces North, to the Sea. I will take the rest South. What of me, father? You will return to Khor Kalba. You will feed the women to the beast until you find our Queen. I will not. I will track the barbarian with you -- You think I care what you wish?! You want to play warrior? It is not in you. One day you will be king, but warlord, never. I can. Let me prove it to you! You will not risk your life again. You are my line, my successor. You will not throw away all that I have worked for. It's not enough. I've failed you father. I don't understand -- Where am I? You were -- adequate. Look what we have here. A hill ape in over his head. I was just wondering what that smell was. (sniffs near Artus) Now I know. We take no stowaways. Only paying passengers. You've best be laden with gold. If it's metal you seek, perhaps you'd settle for steel. Still fast Artus. Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly handsome. (to the pirates) All hail Conan! All hail Conan! Sorry, friend. Looks like you've had a rough road. It won't get easier. Khalar Singh lives. He'll be coming for me and the girl. Good. We're scrapping for a fight these days. This one may be more than you wish. I need you to get me close to Khor Kalba. Rest up. We'll get you there. I do. Just leave me to sleep. You would risk your life for royalty? Why? A tall tale. Meant to scare children. What care I for queens and empires? I heard. Only I would happily put all of your "civilization" to the torch myself. My only debt is to my people. And it still lies unpaid. It was a pirate ship. They left as soon as the girl and the large one boarded. Which way did they sail? North. Are you certain? Yes, please, I'm telling you the truth! Send word to Ukafa. They come to him by sea. Try not to taste it going down would be my advice. We sailed with him for a while. I would like to say I know the man. Aye, he's that too. Why would he? He's a stranger in every land he trods. A man with no home, no people, none but the company of ghosts. And he bears the weight of their deaths every moment of every day. He doesn't live. I've seen in him great mirth, only to watch it smothered by greater melancholy. He owes a blood debt, and he can entertain no other joy, no other cause, until it is fulfilled. Let me tell you something of Conan. He will never lie. He will never break a trust, once given. And he will never, ever give up. He is that, lass. He is that. Here we stand again. Will the queen reveal herself, or must another innocent suffer? My father, he tires of your charade. He grows impatient. But I have no such haste. I enjoy watching you squirm. Perhaps you'd like to see the end your sisters faced back at the monastery? No? Your fear is not enough yet? Let's try harder. I've read all there is to know of mighty Acheron. Why would true Acheronians protect a traitor to their own? You once held the entire world in your grasp, now you hide and cower like pitiful mice. And mice are meant to be swallowed whole. What was in the box could only drink from you one at a time. But the beast of Acheron, it will claim four of you this night. 64. Who will spare the rest and tell me which of you is the queen? At last. Some bravery. But of course, you wouldn't expect me to take your word, would you? Is there a better reason to drink? You've never tasted mead? I have no future. It died with my people, as I should have. Nothing. I believe in the cold of steel, the warmth of flesh. All else is fairy tales. Purpose. I die with purpose. To stations! To stations! What do you think? They have us outnumbered, but we might beat their speed. That is what they wish. They drive us to another force, approaching from the south. Then we fight? No. We give them what they think they want. (to the Pirates) About ship! Now! They're turning to run. And now? Let us show them why she is called the Wasp. Open astern! Load the stinger! They are doing -- something. Fire! Rip her apart! We're taking on water! Hard to port! We will sink. Fire! Bring her back! She's dead in the water! Good. I was growing weary with boredom. Hide her below. Time to go. I could get you closer. Another half day along the coast -- I need you head west, to draw off our pursuers. I'll find another path to Khor Kalba. So be it. Swift wind at your backs. I never said that. But I won't leave a virgin onboard a pirate ship, alone. We'll rest here until morning. I would do you a kindness. Khor Kalba will bring only death. We leave at dawn. I will not break stride for you. Not once. I will get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond that I have my purpose, and you yours. The pirate ship sailed to the west. Even under full sail it'll be no easy task to overtake her. Fariq has done well. (to the Captain) Head east, back to Khor Kalba. But our chase points the other way. The chase is over. They come to me now. They fought beside the men. She died in battle, even as I was born. I don't lie. Do you ever tire of talking? Let me rest, woman. We'll slip in, along with those traders. But you'll need a change of clothes, those monks' robes will draw attention. And what better disguise for a monk? Do not test me, beast. It's probably only way into Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times, day and night. And dodge arrows as we do so? During the day, we'd easily be spotted on the climb. And it would be useless to even attempt at night. No, we must find another way. Thieves. You'll regret finding me. What? Do you wish to join in? So that's it? What is it? Not from me. Around. Up. What? Crom! Stop wasting time. Crom indeed. Let's go. Nothing good. Which ever one of you slaves gets me the girl, lives. Stay behind me. Who dies first? Crom! Get her! You'll make a nice meal. No. She was just taken this morning. It's not yet midnight, and Khalar still must bring her to the cave of Acheron. You're going to fight Khalar's troops? Just you? You want my help again. Guard. Will be where your queen is. It's only begun. Because that one was not the heir to Acheron. Secretive, the traitors of Acheron. It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally wrung honesty from the girl. That poor innocent was forced to live a lie, even as the truth was kept from the queen herself. 90. And you did the rest, barbarian. My thanks for delivering the Queen to me. At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's been hours you've made me wait for my fun. You made me lose face in front of my father. That wasn't wise. But what should I expect from a Cimmerian? A swift end! Hardly. But that is a difference between you and me. A swift end would be a mercy I do not intend to grant. No, you must suffer for your transgressions. 91. You must beg for your suffering to end. Just as your people did. You lie. I was there. My father never uttered a sound. You were there? What were you doing, warrior? Watching your father die, without saying a sound? Taking your eyes will be justice indeed, coward. I saw my father die. Slain by one who can only kill men already on their knees. I've killed many in battle, cur. Really? Then why did your father not let you face me before, when I had sword in hand. He thought you unequal to the task. Coward! Prove your strength! Take my eyes, coward -- if you can. You see only with your eyes. The Acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance, don't you think? For one to ascend to royalty, another must fall. But I do. For thirty years I have dreamed of this day. The day our people rise from the ashes. Crom. It's good that you pray. Gods will be here soon. Who? I will say this for you, barbarian. You are hard to kill. Let her go. You've faced me before and lost. What do you think has changed now? My purpose. You are strong, Cimmerian, but we both know you are not my equal. Once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength. Now let me teach you. No. I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron. I command you to kneel! Show him the might of the army of Acheron! First, we feed. Fine. Take your fill. I will kill him myself. Your story ends here. Like a woman, Fariq cried and begged me to spare him. They take her to a place you can never follow. Who will you fail, Cimmerian? Your father or your woman? Tamara!! No. I cannot.
