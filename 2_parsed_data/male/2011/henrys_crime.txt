Smells good. Wow. Thanks. Good. How was yours? This is great. Your shift's at eight thirty? You not eating? You okay? Sure. What time? Right. What? Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime. You're talking about kids. Okay. I love kids. Of course I do. Henry Torne. Eddie Vibes. So how you doin', man? I'm okay. What's going on? Listen, I got a man down here. Mind if we come in for a second? (holding it in) I'm sorry. Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels. Yeah. So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's our first baseman. And he's not exactly game-ready as you can see... Yeah. So, what do you say? What do I say what? You feel like playing a little ball? Filling in for Joe? It's November. Yeah. They keep the field in perfect shape. Oh. So what do you say? Henry? Appreciate you driving, man. So where's this game? Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes. Pull up right over here. We gotta grab some beer money at that ATM. Just hang tight. We'll be right back. Freeze! Henry, we know this wasn't your deal. All you have to do is give me those names. And you can go home. It's that simple. Come on. Why are you sticking up for these people? They're not your friends. You've got a wife. You've got a job... don't you care? All you have to do is say something. ...the court sentences Henry Torne to four years in prison for the crime of Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery. Huh. I said what are you in for? Bank robbery. Good. Clean. Simple. I like it. But I didn't do it. Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial favorite. Identities are just constructs, anyway. They're mistaken all the time. I'm Max. Henry. Go on. Make yourself at home. So...what are you in for? Life. Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Hurry up. We gotta go. Breakfast. `Monday is whole wheat bun-day.' What are you thinking about? Nothing. You're thinking something. Let me guess. You're thinking, `How did I get here?' How do you think any of us got here? I'm not sure. I'll tell you how. Because we committed crimes. But we committed to the wrong thing. You see that was our mistake. We didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people. See him? Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He could've been, but he chose not to fulfil his potential, he chose not to commit to his dream. And now look at him. Bad choices, see. By the way, I recommend the potatoes. That's the real crime, Henry. Not committing to your dream. So what's yours? My what? Your dream. Not sure I ever had one. Never had a dream? What kind of a life is that? I don't know. A pretty good one? Henry, you're in jail. But here's the good news. We got all this time to do. And time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it.MAX Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And in your case, you can figure out what your dream is. Your dream is your truth is your destiny. I told you. I'm here by mistake. There are no mistakes. What? But you're going to have to fight for that dream, Henry. I am. You're at a crossroads now. There are going to be tests! What tests? This is your moment. Whatever you do now defines you. Go get em! You did good, Henry. I don't feel good. You're doing better than you feel. Go to sleep, Henry. Sleep is for the blessed. Hi. You look beautiful. I'm okay. How about you? Okay. Oh. Okay. Wow... It's alright. No. I want you to be happy. I ever tell you I was married? I mean nearly. I had a lovely correspondence going with Jocelyn Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she finally came on visitor's day she said I was too short. Books and covers. Right. Books and covers. Clean as a whistle. (checking himself out) Max, I think you missed your calling. Thank you. Who do we got next, Henry? Hector. You're up. Hey, Max. When are you up for parole? October. Show us what you did for the board last time. I'm working. Show us! Leave me alone. All right, so I'm sitting there, and the head of the board asks me what I'm going to do if they let me out this time. And, so... I get this twitch! and then I give him my answer: "I'm gonna break in your house, set your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on a naked rampage through your garden, dance in the streets of your l'il hometown like a crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming through the ethereal sky like God's blackest angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly fireball! Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't want THIS. Not out THERE. Believe me, I'm not going anywhere. Hey, White Shadow. When's your review coming up? Next month. You gonna do the twitch like your cellie? Nope. What, you don't like it around here? Everyone knows Henry's innocent. The board don't like it when you deny the crime. I didn't do the crime. Hey, but you got the time...so you may as well have done it. I like it! `You got the time, so you may as well have done the crime!' Now that's funny, Henry. Yeah, you're right. You know you never did tell me what your dream was, Max. I'm living it. Really? Sure! It's easier to live in here. You don't have to do anything. You just show up. In fact they even do that for you. I'm living the life. This place is horrible, Max. So why didn't you just say something? When? Back then. When you had the chance. When you were still innocent. I thought maybe this was my way out. And was it? Yeah. See. There are no mistakes. You got everything, kid? Yeah. Maybe you should think about getting out of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of coffee on the outside. The only thing I've ever missed in twenty three years is a hot bath. And that ain't worth walking out of here for. Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is your truth. I thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny. Just testing. I'm going to miss you. Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again. I'm still gonna miss you. Get out of here, Henry. Henry. How you doing? Hey. Debbie! Henry's here. Come on in. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up for my meeting. You want a beer? Sure. Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer? Hi. Thanks. Are you happy? I'm glad. I don't know yet. Honey, they're starting to arrive. Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry. You could become a distributor for Jin Chi. It's Korean kitchenware. The future of food storage. Plus, if you recruit distributors, you get paid even more. You mean like a pyramid scheme? No! God, no. It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm. Anyway, why don't you give it some thought? Henry. Yeah? Listen, I just wanted to thank you. For not giving up my name. I don't know your name. Sure you do. It's Joe. Right. You're welcome Joe. I'll see you Deb. Henry! How are you? I'm good. How are you? Great. How was Greece? Greece? Debbie told us all about your trip. I was in prison. In Greece? Good. Thank you. About what? Sure. Sounds good. Thanks. It does? How does it feel? Good. I think I'm okay. Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance. No, don't. (Starts to stand) I think I'm okay. You! Yeah. Me. Are you alright? Yeah. Fine. I saw the whole thing. You were on the phone. You weren't even paying attention. Park your car. I'm going to take him into that cafe. They let you out, huh. Yeah. Let's get you a seat in here. Pierre! Une Verre d'eau. Thanks. It's okay. I really am fine. Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got run over. (sucks his teeth) Lucky I guess. No. You look familiar. What? Oh, that's why. Yeah. I'm okay. Yeah. Sure. Thanks. A bathroom? I thought I told you I didn't want to see your face again. Nice to see you too. No contact. I figured it out. What? My destiny. Good. What is it? The bank. The bank is your destiny? Yeah. What bank? The one I didn't rob. But you went to jail for it. Exactly. What are you talking about Henry? I did the time, I may as well have done the crime. Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right. I still don't get it. I need your help. What for? To rob the bank. So what do you say? I'm in Jail. That's what I say. You've got your review coming up -- -- So? So you can get of here. If you want to. No. It's not as simple as that. Yes, it is. No, it's not. Yes. It is. No, it's not. I'm happy here. This is my home. This is not a home. This is a prison. Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy here. Max. You can't die in this place. I can die wherever I want. You really want to die here? What do you want, Henry? I'm asking for your help. To rob that bank?! I've thought about it. It's the right thing. For both of us. Henry. I got cards. Great to see you, kid. Max! Stop! Stop! Too small, too safe! Stop showing me your `safe face' -- -- But I was -- Not you. You're doing the best you can. You. What are you doing? Listening? You look like you're hearing. To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be strong. To listen is an action. What is that? No, Djula. I want you to be more. I want you to be better than that. Now go drink coffee. And don't think about what I want, think about what you want! I'll go drink coffee too! Let's all `go drink coffee'. Ten minutes everyone! (to his Eastern European No. I saw your picture outside. The door was open. I came in. Is it always like that? (gesturing back to the Yeah. Looks complicated. I thought you were listening. I'm Henry by the way. Madame Julie! Sure. Doesn't look like you. Oh. It's funny. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. I guess. Why? You're leaving? Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right? Right. Give `em hell! I always do, Felipe! Morning, Max. Here we are again. How's your grandson? Just started first grade. That's great. The socialization begins! How many more of these you think you got in you, Max? As many as it takes. Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the board why you believe we should grant you parole? Come on, Mr. Saltzman, what have you got for us this time? (o.s.) Mr. Saltzman? Well... I knew you could do it. Where's the car? I don't have a car. You don't have a car? What's wrong with you? You came to pick me up without a car. That's not picking a person up. Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up. I don't know about this. Maybe this is a mistake. Dave! Carl! Max, it's okay. You're free. Open up! DAVE! Come on, Max. I don't like this. Take it easy. There's nothing to be frightened of. I promise. You're okay. The bus station's just a short walk. I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe... You're going to be alright. (nearly on his knees) I'm going to die right here. I told you! Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus. You hungry? It's pastrami. On rye. Here we are. That one's yours. Thanks. Anything else you need? Yeah. (reads the label) Ah. The land of milk and honey. What is this obsession with coffee, Henry? When did that happen? I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give people a lot of purpose. Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my God. That tunnel's probably not even there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry? It's a start. A start? This was your plan? An old cartoon in a pissoir? It's an article. Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in with guns and do it the old-fashioned way? No. No guns. What? Someone could get hurt. That's sweet, kid. (the tunnel photo) Maybe it's still there, Max. Uh-huh. Maybe it is. Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why don't we go take a look at this bank of yours? At least we know that's still there. Money is a mistress with a hard heart. I'd like to speak to your manager please. I'm interested in opening an account. What kind do you have? You know my uncle put all his money in that vault when I was a kid, after we came from Europe, before the war...the Brownshirts. He said that vault will be there for three hundred years! He was never wrong. How long's it been there already Mr. Tuttle? And in the very same spot, correct? See, my boy!. History. It's all about history. You'll have to give us some time to think about which one. Thank you. You've been very helpful. No. Thank you. Have a nice day, gentlemen. The vault is here. The tunnel runs under here... And ends up somewhere in there. It's virtually robbing itself! (rubbing his head) Hi. Julie, Max. Max, Julie. Hiya. Oh, we were, you know -- I was just showing Henry the place I used to perform. That's lunch, Julie. Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel stomach. Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my favorite Russian. Would you mind if we took a look around? It's been over thirty years since I've been inside. Thank you. How you doing? Home again. Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the greats. And the not-so-greats! Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek says to stay hungry. Got it. Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time's sake? I don't see why not. We're on a break. That okay, Henry? Sure. Go ahead. No. He's a friend. It's peaceful out here. Is it fun? Pretending to be other people. So, in a way, you're still playing `you'. So what part of `you' are you playing now? Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before the magic! I remember it like it was yesterday. People often make the mistake in Chekhov of going down...but you must always always go up... Simon, did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days? Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank! I know. And there was a tunnel too! I know! I forget. Where was it? My story? I'm figuring that out. I just got out of jail. Sounds worse than it is. No. Do I look like one? What do I look like? I do? We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like people in his dressing room. It was right here. Booze, broads and lucre. The good old days. I like it. They filled it in, in 1931 when they built the theatre. Times have changed. All good things must come to... (he hits a hollow spot) ...an end. Do you need volunteers? The Cherry Orchard. (leafing through it) So what happens? What's it about? Is it funny? I guess it's not funny. Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon. I'll see you tomorrow. Max has very kindly offered to volunteer at the theatre! Henry, let's get out of these people's way! What are you doing after rehearsal? Do you like Chinese? Golden Dragon? Eight o'clock? Work. Work! It's time to work Americans! Even you Djula... Let's go. See you, Julie. You were right, Henry. You got a nose like a bloodhound! You found it? Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing room. Who? Lophakin. We find a way to get into his dressing room and we're right as rain! I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The pieces of the puzzle are on the table. All we got to do is put them in the right order! The only thing is the dirt...where does the dirt from the tunnel go? What about the vault? First things first. I'm on the dirt. Okay. How do I look? Like Henry. We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be back in the soup.MAX (he starts to take off his Julie. Hi. How was rehearsal? Where then? I guess that's where people go. Sounds like a plan. We going anywhere in particular? I get it. I worked at a toll booth. Rainbow bridge. Yes. Yeah. What's so funny? That's funny? I worked nights. It gave me time to think. About where I wasn't going. I'm working on it. For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank. I thought I was on my way to a softball game. It was a mistake. But now I'm going to rob it for real. Yeah. There's a tunnel. Runs from the bank to the theatre. Yeah. Thank you. What? What for? Neither can I. `I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you. You're as wonderful as ever....' `Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.' `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money-grubber.' (the text again) `I don't care a bit. I just want you to believe in me like the old days!' `I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.' `I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.' Me too. Good morning. Good morning. Henry! (pulling up his boxers) I figured it out! Once we're in that dressing room the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof! (rushing out into the front Ah. Company. It's alright. She knows. She does? We brought breakfast. How do you like your eggs? Hold on. You told her? About what we're doing? Yeah. I did. It's a crime. You're supposed to keep crimes a secret. It's okay, Max. No. It's not kosher. How do you like your bacon? Crispy. Okay. I'll get dressed. I'm a confidence man. I never liked that word. It's only half of what it is. The word confidence comes from the latin. Fides. With Faith. Belief. That's what I'm about. Yes. But I was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part. Hence, the prison. Not really. For me it's a win-win situation. I like jail. Three hots and a cot. No. I like it out here. (washing the plates) `Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart, a money grubber... ...but I don't care a bit'. `I just want you to believe in me like the old days.' What is that? Chekhov?! We read it last night. I thought you were on a date. We were. Reading Chekhov's a date? Yeah. Can you give me a ride there? I'm a volunteer! No. But can you give me a ride? This is driving me crazy. What? We could be digging right now! We could? If we were in that dressing room. It's rehearsal. There are people everywhere. This is pissing me off. What? I got an idea. What? You have to be Lophakin! What? If you did we'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want. I'm not an actor. You're not a bank robber either! And you're doing that. Max. Come on. She said you were a natural. That means you can do it. No, it doesn't. Yes, it does Henry. You ARE Lophakin! A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life. A man who's in love with her! Your dream is your truth is your destiny! I can't be Lophakin. They have a Lophakin. What if they didn't? There has to be another way. Kid, You forced me out of jail to help you. And I'm going to goddamn help you. But you got to help me help you. Now I need to know... (a fierce stare) ...do you want this bank or not? Yes. I want it. Then you're gonna be Lophakin! Good morning, everyone! You knew this day would come. You deserve this, lubya. Unprofessional shit! Mr. Millodragovich -- Shit! What's happening? Oh. Gosh. But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman we're talking about! (brandishing the letter) A Ken Waterstone production! OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production. The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy.DAREK Run, run, to that pandering, populist, piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his spineless productions! You're perfect for it. Good-bye, Darek. I'm sorry. Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now. I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes NOW! And COFFEE! We'll hold auditions this afternoon, Darek! I'll get the list -- I've seen that shit-list! It's a disaster. What do we do? I must think. Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled before she has a chance to grow. It is Ken Waterstone. You said he was a natural. Henry. Henry would be perfect for it. For Lophakin. Yes. Exactly. He'd be playing himself. (off her shocked look) Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.MAX A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life and put his past behind him. A man who's in love with you...Madame Ranevsky. Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin needs a dressing room. Can you get him in to see Darek? Nothing. Sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good. Fair enough. He just needs a shot. One audition. Let the chips fall where they may. They'll get someone else. Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm asking, Julie. ...you've never had any training...you've never been in a production...you don't even know the play... I read it. I think I know the scene. Think. Start. `Your brother , Leonid Andrevich...' How can you perform Chekhov and not be able to say AND-REY-E-VICH! Now say it! Your brother, Leonid ANDREYEVICH says I'm an upstart, a money grubber -- A what? A money-grubber! Are you? Convince her. Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says I'm an upstart, a money grubber. He can say whatever he likes. I don't care a bit -- (into his ear) I just want you to believe in me like in the old days. Good God in Heaven. My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that. But you, you did so much for me in the old days that I've forgotten all that... I love you...like a sister...more than a sister. You piece of shit! Yes! Good. Good? Yes. Tomorrow. Be more good. I think so. You mean since you ran me over... No. I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went. Just joining someone else's life. Yeah, I was. It was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth. That I was going along with everything. I didn't know I could change it. So now I'm changing it. It already has. Nice. Are you sure you're okay with this? I know it's a lot. This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be taking over the role of Lophakin. If you please. Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward. Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga, cigarettes! Tracks! Trolley tracks! There's still twenty feet to go. We're going to need another pair of hands. That's him. That's him? Thanks for meeting us. Sure. How's your pyramid scheme? It wasn't a pyramid scheme. Okay. It all fell apart. We were banking on that money, Henry. And now all I've got is a garage full of dumb Korean plastic. What's he talking about? Kitchenware. Oh. See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'? It's killing me. So how's Debbie? She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a couple months. She's pregnant? Yeah, she's pregnant. Congratulations. Thanks, Henry. It's okay if you want to punch me out. Tonight would be a good night. In fact I could use it. Come on. This is great news. (off Joe's hopeless look) It's going to be okay. Really? It is? You know how much diapers cost? You know how much it costs to send a kid to college? You want to send your baby to college? Of course not. I'm just saying. The kid needs stuff. Stuff that's expensive. Stuff it deserves. These things are hot! I'm on fire. Listen, Joe, maybe we can help. How? We might have a job for you. No foolin'? There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault. That's a lot of dirt, Henry. So what do you think? I think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door! No guns. People could get hurt. What about fake ones? They're still guns. Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers and tears and chump change. We're doing an old fashioned heist. We're going right into the belly of the beast. Are you in or are you in? I hope we don't get caught. I like it. For what? I hope not. Not really, no. I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out west... Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there. Just now. So what about it? Meeting me -- You're not? I thought that was your plan. Do the play Is there a reason you didn't leave before? Yeah. Well. Maybe... But you could still meet me. It was just an idea. Why not -- I didn't. Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your head! Why couldn't I have met her after? Who? Julie. I asked her to meet me. After we're done. Oh yeah? What'd she say? She said no. Of course she said no. Why of course? Because life ain't like that. There's always a cost. That's why they call it life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper must be paid to pipe. I paid already, Max. I don't want to leave her. Who's that? I'll check. Who is it? Sorry, Henry. The same bank. Shit, Henry. Now that's poetry! I like it. Who is this guy? Your new partner. What do you mean? I'm in. Or you're out. I screwed up. Sorry, Max. (amused by the whole thing) Joe tells me you guys might need a little help with that vault. I know the whole story. And I don't dig. Dig? Got any cold ones? Joe doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out of that chair. Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back. We've known each other since high school, isn't that right? Yeah. I know you. Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the quality of loyalty. What do you want, Eddie? Nothing. Just the American dream. I'm gonna kill him. With a knife. You can't kill him. (slurred, on the floor) Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault -- Shut up, Joe. Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it. Go home. Please. Before it's too late. I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's sake, the man has robbed you. He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user... Who cares? Where are you, Djula? Where?! Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene. Carlotta and the girls.DAREK Let's run the magic scene! What happened last night? We should talk about it. (tugging the pulley) Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it. What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not? Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness. What do you say, Henry? Now I see you coming out of the theatre behind the bank. I know what you're up to Gentlemen. And I want in. In on what? We can't talk here. Let's drive. What's on your mind, Frank? The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency Retrieval and Exchange. Once a month a truck goes to all our partner banks across the border in Canada, picks up all the currency and brings it back home. I'd say on average eight to twelve million, held in our vault at First Buffalo for just a few hours before it's picked up for redistribution. Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank any other time. I can give you that date. I can help with alarms. I can be your guy on the inside. Hypothetically say you were right about what we're up to...which you're not. But just say...why would you help us rob your bank? I got my reasons. This sounds like a set-up, man -- I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I got my reasons. Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going to need to hear them. The wife got sick a few years ago. Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs. So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help cover the difference. We were going to retire to the Loire valley. We had to use all our savings to cover the bills. The man gave it to you, huh. I spent everything we had -- then she died...thirty years I've been at that bank. What was her name? Annie. Her name was Annie. I'm Sorry. November 23rd. The money's delivered at eight and picked up at midnight. I retire in two weeks. This is it. You set up the table. I make sure dinner arrives hot. Shit. Opening night. And? That's soon. We're going to have pull some nights. Maybe we should wait. Do it closing night. We can't. He's retiring. This is a one time deal. I told you there were going to be tests, Henry. You're going to have to leave her. No looking back. There he is! You okay, Henry? No. I'm not leaving her. Who? The girl -- Now listen, Henry. You're digging this tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank. You're gonna take the money and you're gonna put it in the car and we're gonna drive away. This is one thing. Julie is another thing. This is not that. That is not this. Understand? Hey! I think I got something... We have arrived! Look at that. Not a cloud in the sky. So clear you can see tomorrow. You're a good man, Henry. Thank you. You too, Max. Let's go. In this `American dream' of ours, everyone is happy and smiling, they have achieved their objectives...and yet in life there is only change, upheaval, the birth of the new...and that birth is painful. Our play is about misery, disconnection, a future that we don't see hitting us like a train...but tonight, my players, we show them...that this not a future to fear! Ten minutes people! I want you to meet me in California. We're doing it tonight. It's the only time we can get in the Nothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a month from now, what's the difference? I still want you to meet me. Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it already. I want us to be together. You know that's not true -- Enjoy the show, folks! Curtain! How you doin', Frank? Doin' good, Bernie. Real good. Shit. Yes. You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank? I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and put them in first place. You'd need a lot more money than that. But I guarantee you I'd have them back in the Super Bowl within two seasons. Perfect. Another chance to lose. Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little pischer? We're good. Well this is it, Frank. We got you something. A little retirement gift. Go ahead. Open it. Thanks guys. We wanted to get you something from France. You like French Roast, right? Thanks. You know this isn't from France. What are you talking about? It's French roast. Right. But over there they call it coffee. (slightly baffled, at Bernie) But this is French roast... Where is he? Where's that old man? Julie -- Break a leg! Good-bye, Julie. Go! Go! Go! About time, old man. Do your job. Jesus! Not again! What is it with you? Sorry. You're a pussy, Joe, you know that? That was good, kid. Good acting. (a little giddy) There she is. Get out of there! This shit comes straight from hell. Welcome to my world, bitches. Fuck, yeah. You're on, Henry! Deb's gonna freak. That's everything. Yes, it is. What's that, Eddie? It's a gun, Max. (with the gun) Joe! Take the money out back to my car. Joe! Stay right where you are, Joe. Don't be stupid, Max. You're not going to do this, Eddie. You can shoot me dead if you want, but you're going to have to shoot me dead. I'm not playing with you, old man. What are you doing, Eddie? Welcome to the party, Brando. What are you doing, Eddie? It's money, Henry. Money. This was your chance you idiot. You could've been a better man but you did it again. You messed up. And now you're back with the maggots. Just one big missed opportunity. Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're done. He's right. Come on, man. Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in the car. Shut up. Now move, Torne. No happy ending for you. You animal! Famach deh mohl! Gey lig mitt'n vahntzin son of a bitch! Get the extension chord. You couldn't have done this without me. Our new partner. Huh. You ok? I got shot. I gotta get on stage. The peasants have come to say good-bye. They're good fellows, Yermolai Aleksayovich but in my opinion a little stupid... Old man, huh. Where is he? Any minute now. Hello to the new life! How's the leg? It's fine. Go. Stop the car! Henry! Joe, stop the car. He can't stop the car, it's the getaway! Yeah, you can't -- What the hell are you doing? Henry! What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?! It's never been about money. You know that. Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow. That's not true. Meet me in Moscow. I can't. Meet me in Moscow. Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow. Go with him! He loves her. I know. (whisper to Simon) Lights down ten. Down ten more. Slowly... Hello miou-miou. Time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it. Education. Self-respect. You can even figure out your dream. You're done. Next! So tell me, Javier. What's your dream? `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money grubber...but I don't care a bit.' I told you before. Dopey. Sleepy. Happy and Doc -- I may be all those things but one thing I'm not...is a rat.
