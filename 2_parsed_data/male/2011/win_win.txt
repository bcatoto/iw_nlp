OK. OK. Hi there. That's my team? That's great, honey. Are they winning? Uh huh. Bye sweetie. Yeah. Yeah. I'm good. Why? OK. Bye guy's. No. I will today. Yeah. You're right. I will. Yeah? I love you too, sweetie. Bye. Shit. Vig? Down here. What's up, Vig? Donna's out sick and can't find anything without her. It sucks. Who was that guy? Oh, that sucks more. He's the plumber. I called him to look at that piece of crap of boiler. Why? That clanking is driving me nuts. Can't you hear it down in your office? Yeah. I just figured it's old. Well it is but he took one look at it and said we should replace it before it blows. What?! We just had it fixed three months ago. Yeah, he said that job was crap. The guy did crap work. Can you believe that? That little scumbag! getting paid. Makes me sick. No one wants to do the work anymore. How much to fix it, Vig? Did he say? Six grand to replace everything. Holy shit. Tell me about it. I gotta be honest, Mike, it's not a good time for me. My business is off and my step son wants to get Lasik. Really? Isn't he too young? I don't really care at this point. If it makes him happy, he can have it. I get nothing from that kid. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 7 Nothing. He has an unnatural attachment to his father. Right. So what do you want to do? Well I was thinking we could leave it for now and just cover the file cabinets in plastic to be safe. How about you? Yeah. I guess I'm good with that. Let's get out of here before it blows. I'll pick some up plastic before practice. Hey Shelly, How you doing? Oh. Sorry to hear that. We lost. OK. Anything else? No. I'll take a look at it. Who do I have at ten-thirty? Great. And you think your son stole it? Yeah. I know he did. Why would he steal your cat, Frank? He's jealous of her. Very jealous. I understand but that's my fee for that particular service. Uh huh. Right. Well maybe I can adjust that a little bit. Well Leo, remember you got lost and the police had to help you a few times. That's why we brought Jolie into help you, right? So now what happens? Well if that Judge deems you incapacitated then you will need a guardian. And if we can't find your daughter then the state... She can't find herself. OK but if we can't find her then the State will have to become your guardian. Who's the state? You know...the state...of New Jersey. That's crazy. I don't need New Jersey's help. I got Jolie now. And there's no funny business between us so you know. Right. I'm sure there's not. Let's just first see if we can find your daughter and then we'll go from there. You're probably still hung over. What's that? Yes, he is. You find his daughter? Crap. They could but they never will. It's too much work. They'll probably move him into Oak Knoll. Hand me one of their brochures? No, she can't. His guardian still has to make every single decision. It's the difference between a baby sitter and a parent. $1,500. Is that what it is? Whose singlet is this? What did I say about leaving them around? How's the team doing? Not good. What the hell happened? We used to be good. Yeah, well we're not anymore. Can we walk for a bit? Yeah. That sucked. You're running good, buddy. Kicking my ass. Yeah. I've been getting out here a bit more often. You gotta be kidding me. What? Lori's texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if I want an antique sewing table that we bought together. Do you? No. I want my fucking house back! Is she still with that guy? You mean my contractor? The guy I hired? Yeah, she is. I can just picture that little scumbag walking around my house wearing his tool belt. Here. Take a picture for me. Hurry! It's cold. Don't send it. Too late. I hate her. Maybe you should move back into the city? Get a new job. Shake it up a bit. Nah. Finley called me. He's starting up a new fund out here in May so I'm gonna wait for that. That guy's starting another fund? Yeah. He's an animal. He prints money. Come on, let's finish strong. Hold up! What? Just...hold up. You alright? Holy fuck! Mike? Hang on pal. Fuck! Fuck! You gotta be kidding me. Shit. Is it your heart, buddy? Are you having a heart attack? No! I'm not having a heart attack! I just...can't breathe... That could be a heart attack, Mike. You should lie down. No! It's wet. I don't want to lie down. Who cares? You might be dying. Are you cold? Do you feel cold? Yeah. I'm lying on the ground. Look into my eyes, Mike. Look into my eyes. OK dude, how long has that been happening? Couple of months. The doctor says it's stress. Seriously? Did he prescribe anything for you? Yeah. Jogging. Why the hell you think I'm doing this? Jesus. That scared the shit out of me. What are you so stressed about, Mike? I don't know. Work. Money. Everything. Is it that bad? Yeah. It is. I don't know how much longer I can keep my practice going. Really? Holy shit, Mike! What're you gonna do? I have no frickin' idea. I've been trying everything. Have you told Jackie? Not yet. I don't want to freak her out. Good call. So we just need a new strategy, that's all. What about that Judge that's always throwing work your way? Can't she help you out? Judge Lee, yeah. If it wasn't for her I'd probably be out of business already. I just need more. Is there anything else you can do for money? What the hell am I gonna do? Bartend? I'm a lawyer, Ter. I practice law. Yeah. But that's why he makes it. No shit, Ter. Thanks for the update. Hi, honey. I'm still at the office. Yeah. I came back after practice, I'll be home in a bit. (Checking his blackberry) Oh, hey, let me go, Jack. I've been waiting for this call. Bye. Hey Tom. Thanks for getting back to me. I'm good. I'm good. Yeah, I was just following up to see if you had any overflow. It's been a slow month on this end and I was... Oh. OK. No, yeah of course. I appreciate that. Thanks, Tom. Bye. Hey, Leo. Leo hold on! (to the Guard) Can you stop him, please? Any word from his daughter? Mr. Flaherty? Oh..no, Your Honor. I have the two certified letters returned unclaimed. And there is no phone number for her. We can't find her. And she is the only living family, is that correct? Yes, your Honor, she is. But Mr. Poplar hasn't seen her for over twenty years. Who? Your daughter. She's late? She's probably at the store buying some crap or something. OK. OK, then as, Mr. Poplar has been deemed incapacitated by this court, I'm appointing the Office of Public Guardian to serve as the guardian for his person and property. Do you have the order for me to sign, Mr. Thatcher? Then please approach. Your Honor, if it pleases the Court. Yes, Mr. Flaherty? I would be willing to serve as Mr. Poplar's guardian. Yeah. More like five. May I approach, your honor? Council approach. Well Judge, I think I'd be a better candidate then the state in this case. Yeah, and stop saying really, it's annoying. And, as his lawyer, I feel like I'm in a better position to execute what my client wants. I know, Stu, I appointed him. Mike? Your Honor, Leo told me he wants to live at home. He has the money to do that and I want to make sure that happens. If the State can do that then fine. Mr. Poplar wants to live at home. You can do that, Mike? Yes, I can. Really. Did we win? Yeah. I think so. Good. Are we going to the park? No. We're not, Leo. I'm gonna help you get settled into a new place to live right here in town. I don't need a new place. I have a house. I'm not fancy that way. I know. But I need you to stay in this new place for a while. It's nice. You'll like it. Is that what the judge said? Yeah, that's what he said. Ah shit. OK. OK. I just have to make one stop first. I have to swing by a client's house and shut off the water. Because it's freezing and I don't want his pipes to burst. What? Oh, because I'm his guardian. Jack, he's in Oak Knoll. They do everything. I just have to check in on him from time to time. He does. It comes out of his estate and he can afford it. Trust me. No I haven't. It's just...the right thing to do, alright. We couldn't find his daughter and I'm just trying to help the guy. It's really not a big deal. Yeah. No idea. How you doing? Can I help you? No. Are you looking for Mr. Poplar? Yeah. Well, he doesn't live here anymore. Where does he live? You mind telling me why you're looking for him first? He's my Grandfather. I came to live with him. No. Ohio. It's just my mother and me. She's back in Columbus. She couldn't come. Bus. Yeah. Hey, Leo, you have a visitor. Who? Him? Yeah. Hi. Come on in. I'll turn off the TV. This is Kyle Timmons, Leo. He's your grandson. He came from Ohio to see you. I don't have a Grandson. Yeah, you do. We just never met. Are you bringing me home? Kyle's just here for a visit, Leo. Oh. You want to watch TV? OK. OK. So I'll come back to pick you up in an hour. You OK? Yeah. You alright, Leo? (Leo doesn't respond) OK, see you in a bit. We're going to send him back is what we're going to do. I told you. I don't have to worry about him. He's at Oak Knoll. Me. How did the visit go? OK. He fell asleep watching TV. So he lives there now? Yeah. Your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia, Kyle. So sometimes he does things and says things that don't make sense. Are you a friend of his or something? I'm his guardian. What's that mean? It means I make sure he's well taken care of. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. I told her I was coming home. No. Yeah. If I want to smoke should I go outside? I know. But if I do. OK. Good night, Jackie. What are you doing? There's not even a bathroom down there. Hey Mike, could you talk to them about getting Coco Puffs? I like that kind. Sure thing, Leo. Mike's a stand up guy. You need cereal then talk to him. We should go, Kyle. OK. Bye Leo. Are you going to work? No. I'm going home. Well, don't take any shit from any of those guys. I won't. Here's fifty bucks in case you need it. I have money. Actually it's only forty-three but take it. You never know. I have enough money. But thanks. Well, good luck, Kyle. Yeah. You too, Mike. Hello? Yes, it is. Yes. OK. OK. Thanks. I'll be right down. It was the police. They have Kyle. Breaking and entering. So what happened? I decided not to go home. And then you decided you'd break into your Grandfather's house? You mind if I have a quick smoke? Yeah, I do. Get in the car. So you want to tell me what happened? Not really. Yeah. Well good luck with that, pal. You'll see. I can't live there anymore. No. She's not even there. She's in a clinic or hospital or whatever. I'm living with Craig. Her boyfriend, I guess, but he's an asshole. My mom? She doesn't care about me. She could've called, right? So what are we gonna do? Adopt him? Honey, I know it's tough but we're not in a position to take care of another kid right now. Then we don't have to do this. I know. I know. You're right. Come on. OK. I know. I'm just not sure that beating the crap out of everybody is the best solution. Now? Have you talked to his mother? No. Not yet. Jack's left her about thirty messages. Mother fucker. He's wearing his tool belt. No. Sorry dude, I was distracted. It's my fucking house and no. I'm just driving. Where's the kid now? He's sitting in my waiting room. Jackie made me take him with me. No. What does that mean? It means you shouldn't be taking care of another kid. Especially a convict. Yeah, well... Let me call you back. Jesus. Can I talk to her? Who knows? Yeah. Can I go visit Leo? Uh...yeah...OK. You know where it is? Yeah. Just down the street. OK, yeah. Just stay there and I'll pick you up at about three. OK. Hey, Rew, what are you doing? Coach, can you get on Pill. Get up, Rew. Everyone watch because none of you are doing it right. You want to put your chest into his side. Just slide back a bit, Vig. A bit more. Yeah. Right there. Then you give him your full weight. Go ahead Vig. Then you ride the crotch and break him down with a cross-face. Oh man, how'd that feel, Pill? We'll just call you "pancake"! Shut up, Chewbaka. Yeah, right. More like the "Secret Apprentice". What are you, ten years old, Stemler? Hey! We're trying to teach you guys something and you're all just goofing off. Shut up! Quiet! Last time I checked we haven't won a match! Right coach?! It's embarrassing, guys. It's embarrassing. But you're all acting like you don't care! Well, I'm not getting paid enough to just jerk around here. (gestures to Vig) I don't know about you? I'm not getting paid enough. I care about what I do and so should you! I care! So does coach Vig, and so should you! Run em, Coach. I can't look at them anymore! Let's go ladies! Uh...yeah I did but Terry said he'd help and I think we can... Now? Yeah, maybe. Uh...yeah but just for a half hour. Hey Mike, you think I could practice with you guys tomorrow? Yeah, if you want. Sure. And by the way, what I did in there today, yelling like that. I don't usually do that. You were right, they deserved it. I don't have wrestling shoes. Don't worry about it. You ever wrestle before? Yeah. Get that ankle. Get that ankle! Time! Hey Vig. Alright, guys, listen up! Kyle's going to be working out with us for a little while. What's up Kyle! Carlos, you and Jimmy rotate him in. OK. Let's go. Ten seconds to get an ankle. Then we switch it up. Ready? Wrestle! Time. Switch. And...wrestle! You have fun? Yeah. When's the last time you wrestled? A couple years ago. Why'd you stop? Just felt like it. So let me ask you something, Kyle. How good are you? I'm pretty good. Holy shit. Holy shit! I know, right? Can you believe that?! Holy shit! He was thirty-five and one as a freshman! I know. He finished second at the states. In Ohio! This kid had seventeen pins. He's a killer. I know. It's nuts. And he quit after his freshman year. Why? I don't know. He doesn't talk much. He's kind of a weird kid. Why can't I have one kid like that on my team? Just one. What're you talking about? You do. You have him. You can take this kid to the states, Mike. He's not on the team, Ter. He's not even a student. He's been here for three days. So what? Enroll him! I'm not enrolling him. He's just here until we reach his mother and figure this out. So he's gotta do something, right? Let him wrestle. Look at this way, you're helping out the old man and this kid's a little bonus for doing the right thing. I'm not just helping out the old man, Ter. It's not like it's charity work. I'm getting paid for it. No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but think about it, Mike. What are the chances that this kid ends up on your door step and he can wrestle like that? It's a sign, pal. Check this out. There's a video link of him wrestling in some tournament. Look at that kid. Wow. He's gonna throw him. Look, he's setting him up. He's setting him up! I have money. OK. Let's go, pal. Why not? Whether he's here for two more days or two weeks it gives him something to do all day. Unless you want him hanging out here? Right. I'll take that. No. It's not a legal fee. It's a personal fee. Oh, I ended up taking on Leo's guardianship. Yeah, I thought I mentioned that to you. Yeah, well, it just played out that way. I have to get going. Uh..not this time. Next month. Promise. I know. Bye Shelly. Hey honey. I'm good. Could you do me a favor and drop that health insurance check in the mail? I just forgot to mail it. Yeah, it's on my desk. Thanks. I'll call you later. What's up Fella's? Hitting the showers, huh? That sounded weird. Oh yeah! Hey. What's up? Hey Vig. Hi Terry. What are you doing here? What do you think? I have to see this kid. He's incredible. Just incredible. And he's good to wrestle. Great. So what's next? We're trying to figure out where he can wrestle? Where ever the hell he wants, right? No. Not right. Hey Kyle. Come on in. How was school? OK. This is my friend Terry. Hey man! Nice to meet you! Really nice to meet you. Welcome. Thanks. How the shoe's fit? Good. So let me ask you something, Kyle. You think you might want to wrestle in a match? OK. Great. We have a match on Saturday. What do you wrestle? One-nineteen. Excellent. Done. Is anyone there now? Yeah. Jimmy Reed. But I think he might be better off at 125. Don't you think we should wrestle off? Alright, let's go guys. Wrestle off. Vig, you keep time? Yeah. I'll do it. You don't mind, do you? No. Go ahead. Ready? And...wrestle. Wow! Good match. Didn't feel good. I don't think we can teach him anything. I don't know why we didn't quit. Just the smell of that room brought back the memories. I hated it, it was like a form of self-abuse. Were you guys that bad? Mike was average. I sucked. Sorry Abby. I gotta stop by the office and deal with the computer. Should I...? We both should have quit. Then we could have joined the ski club and gotten busy with Allison Shepard on the overnights. Sorry Abby. Getting busy is bad. Hey, how do you think we'd do against Kyle? Now? Yeah, you're right. The kid has man strength, dude. Man strength? Yeah. You know. Not kid strength. Man strength. Yeah...I wouldn't say that around the locker room. What the hell are you doing anyway? Trying to figure out what's wrong with my fricking back-up system. Just call your IT guy? I don't have an IT guy. IT guys cost money. OK. I'm just gonna say what's on my mind. I want to be an assistant coach too. Seriously? Yeah. Why not? I'm value added. Especially compared to Vig. How are you value added? Well first of all I'm fun. No denying that. And secondly, unlike Vig, I actually used to wrestle. Yeah, but Ter, you sucked. That doesn't matter, your team sucks. Plus I even look more like a coach then Vig. Yeah, that's not really value added. Look, Mike, I'm serious here. I need some distraction in my life right now. All I do is sit in my condo and think about Lori and that guy having sex in the jacuzzi I paid for. It's fucking unhealthy. I've been really kind of going crazy. Really. We start at 3:30pm. Don't be late. My brother! I will not let you down. To the team. Hey, what should I wear to practice? Just a singlet. Really? Yeah, so we can see your man strength. Good one, Coach! See, it's already fun. You answered it? What'd she say? No. Can you not answer my phone anymore? I quit now that I'm wrestling If it is, she just ran away. Were you outside? Yeah. I went for a run. It's pretty early. You do this every morning? In season, yeah. I like to get my run in early and then drill some moves for an hour before school. Oh. Wow. Yeah...so I'm gonna do it. See you. It was Kyle. Working out. In season. Yeah. I know. Jesus! Look at those tats. This kid is just fricking cool. Timmons. One nineteen. Good. This song sucks. Rew picked it. He's an odd one. Hey Vig, which kid is yours anyway? None of them. He quit. Really? You're son quit? My step son and yes. Don't get me started, I thought becoming a coach might be a nice way for us to bond. He said it wasn't fierce and he quit. Harsh. So why you still doing it? Vig is leading by example. Winners never quit. That's right, even if it sucks. This team is just depressing sometimes. That's where I sit, Ter. Sorry buddy. I got to be near, Mike. It's good luck. Say's who? Guys. I don't think we should fight about our seats in front of the kids. OK. You ready? Yeah. This kid is good. So just...you know...be ready out there. Can you give me a slap? What? Give me a slap. Across the face. Like your waking me up. Uh, OK. Can you do it harder? Come on, Kyle. Take this punk out. (Under his breath) Ter! Cut the shit! You're a coach. You're not sitting in the stands. Sorry. I'm just excited. You know me. What's he doing? Losing. It's his first match. Give him a break. Hey! You OK? Yeah. Did he smile? Yeah. I think he did. Good. That's good, right? See. I'm good luck. That's got nothing to do with luck. How'd that feel? Pretty good? Yeah, pretty good. You ready? Yeah. Can you slap me too, Coach? Can I go with you? No, honey. It's almost bed time. It's for Leo. He's doing OK. He can say some pretty funny things. Yesterday he told me I was fired. I don't know. He just fired me. Yeah. He's a pretty funny dude. A little but I already did it. Yeah but just to wrestle. My old coach thought I could get a scholarship. Yeah. Let's go! Circle up! Alright. I want to spend this week working on bottom position. Did you all see Kyle the other day? He exploded up. Kyle, show the guys what you did. It's kind of my own thing. So can you share it with us? Well, it's not a move or anything, I just tell myself that the guy on top is going to take my head and shove it under water and kill me. And if I don't want to die on the bottom, I just gotta do what ever the fuck it takes to get out. OK. So the move is called "whatever the fuck it takes." Let's go. Let's work on it. Come on. "Whatever the fuck it takes." You're mother didn't want to come? No. She's a tough kid that one. She tell you bad things about me? Yeah. But I never believe her anyway. You should, she's your mother. Respect that. (Pointng to the TV) Can you turn that down? I hate that judge. I wouldn't be in this place if it wasn't for her. But this place is pretty nice. It's not my damn house! I paid for that house. Damn Judge. Turn it off! You want to take a walk outside, Leo? Yeah. Let's go to my park. Your park, huh? Yeah. My park. You bring the tape? Yeah. It's in my bag. Hey, Mike, can I ask you something? Yeah. Of course. What? Leo told me that some Judge made him move into that place. Is that true or is he just making that up? No. That's true, pal. Why? Well because they can take good care of him there, Kyle. But he wants to live at home. I know, pal. Hang on a minute. (Into cell phone) Hello? Yes. This is him. Oh. Can you hang for a moment? Hey, I have to take this. I'll be right in, OK? We can talk in a minute. Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting. Yeah. How are you doing? Yeah, well I think she heard that I'm a lawyer and I have a family and that was good enough. Another month, I guess, until she gets out of rehab. She said that Craig guy took off. She sounded pretty shaky. Yeah. I know. Where is he anyway? Yes, it is. So what do we do? I guess we don't. You nervous? No. I am. You're not wrestling. I know. I'm just nervous a lot. You ever think about wrestling in a match? Yeah. I'm just waiting for the green light from Coach. But I'm glad I'm not wrestling today. These guys are ranked fourth in the state. And you're wrestling Kenny Randall. He's undefeated. He is tough! Really tough. Thanks for letting me know. Hey! Cut the chatter! You should all be playing the "what if" game. What if he shoots a single leg? What if he controls my wrists? What if we all get pinned like last year? Shut up, Stemler! Or I'll throw you off the bus myself! Did they really pin all of you? Just about. It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath. OK. This is Kenny Randall. He's very good. Yeah, I heard. But you have an advantage here, he has no idea who you are, right? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 70 So he's gonna be overconfident. You take advantage of that and when you get your shot, put him away. See how he runs out there? I want that kind of intensity from all of you. He just pinned Kenny Randall. Are you kidding me?! He know's who I am now. Hi, can I watch TV in here? That's cool. Not really. What's it say? No I do not. Yeah. Me too. Can I tell you something? I didn't quit my old team. I got thrown off. I stole a car. Yeah. That was part of the problem. A teacher's. It was really stupid. Yeah. Everything just got messed up after that. I guess. Mike? They don't have anyone at heavyweight. Really? Korsic will be happy. Tell him now so he doesn't puke. Why does he puke? He's a heavyweight. He doesn't have to lose weight. Nerves. Sweet Lord. This is a team for the ages. What's up, guys? Stemler wants to wrestle today. You do? Yeah, Coach. I'm pretty sure I'm ready. Right? Right. Where you gonna wrestle? He could wrestle 119. I could bump up and get a pin at 125 and Jimmy goes 130. Then we're only giving up one weight class and we got a shot. Huh. Vig? Yeah. He's right. It's possible. Have you ever wrestled in a match before Stemler? No, I have not. You're just waiting for the green light, right? Right. I think now is my time. I can feel the force. One twenty-five. We start at 125 pounds. Depasquale and Timmons. We'll finish at 119 pounds. Tomlinson and Stemler. Show time. Thanks for the update Stemler. We're dead. No. It's gonna be fine. Hook the arm! Carlos, hook the arm! How we doing? With that win, we're up by five. If Stemler doesn't get pinned, we win. That's a huge fucking "if". Good job, Ter. Sorry, Stemler. You're a champ. Come here, Stemler. You've been practicing for a long time. You're ready for this. You hear me? If you get in trouble out there, you just listen to me. I'm right here, OK? OK. You are not going to get pinned! You hear me! No way! No way. No way. Good. Now I'm going to slap you. Ready? Yeah but not so hard. Holy shit! It's Darth Vader! Are you kidding me? No way! Hey, Stemler. Come here. If he's Darth Vader then you're the Secret Apprentice. You got this. Yeah. You're right. I can't watch. Keep moving, Stemler. Keep working! (Reading score card) Oh shit. Oh shit! What? He's one point away from a tech fall and we'd lose on criteria. Shit. Really? What the hell does that mean? If he falls behind by fifteen points it's a technical fall. They get five team points. If that happens the score would be tied but we'd lose the match on criteria. Seriously? Fuck this! Stemler! Stemler!! You need to get up! He's trying to drown you! He wants you dead. But you are not going to die on the bottom! Do you hear me? Do you?! Good! Now just do the move we worked on in practice. "Whatever the fuck it takes!" Hey, I'm proud of what you did today. That win meant a lot to the guys. Cool. It was good coaching with Stemler. Let me ask you something. What's it like? Being as good as you are? What's it feel like? I don't know. I guess it just feels like I'm in control. Of everything. You know what I mean? Yeah, I do. Must be nice. It is. That's it. Yeah. District champ, baby. Pure fucking poetry. Hey, Leo. Guess who won the Districts? Who? Me. And Mike said he got a call from a college scout about me. Oh. What are you doing here? Where's he going? How is he? Honey. Can you stop, please? Yeah. I am. If you don't punch her first. It's a cab. It's her. Yeah, it is. That will be your fault. Hi. I'm Mike Flaherty. Come in, please. And this is my wife, Jackie and my daughter, Stella. Can I get you a drink or something? Water or soda or anything? Right. OK. So I'll go get Kyle. Oh, he's doing really well. He's going to the high school here and he's wrestling on the team actually. Hi, honey. This is Abby. Abby, can you go get Kyle for us? He left? What do you mean? I'm really sorry about this. You know Kyle's doing really well with wrestling here, Cindy. The regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states. Yeah. It is and it could be really good for him. It might even mean a scholarship. Anyway, I was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until that's all over. Uhh...yeah. We could probably make that work. OK. Good. That's great. Hey. Really? We found him. Yeah. We're playing Wii Golf. I'm destroying him. Dude, this kid really hates his mother. Yeah, OK. Great, Ter. Thanks. Bye. (Mike hangs up) He went to my friend's house. We can go get him. You sure? OK. I'll drop you off. So when wrestling's over I have to go? I'm afraid so, pal. She's staying so you can finish the season. That's pretty nice of her. I told her you'd go see her today, Kyle. Where? Where ever you want. She could come here or we could go see her at Leo's house. She moving in this morning. I'll go see her at Leo's before practice. But I want to go alone. Yeah, that's OK but Kyle but you have to promise me... Don't worry, Mike. I'll go. Hi Mike. Hi Betty. How's the foot? Really? Did she say why? Hi Cindy. Hi, I'm Mike Flaherty. Please come in. I wasn't aware that Cindy was represented by council. Last week? I thought she just arrived two days ago. How long have you been here? So how can I help? What kind of a role is that? Really? So you want to move here? Well I'm not sure that's what Leo wants. I understand that, Cindy. But you haven't seen Leo in a long time and he's battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here. I understand that. So do I and I'm sure we can. Now, I'm sorry, but I actually have to go see a client so we'll have to set up another time to discuss this. Yeah. Of course. After school. Yeah, it's that bad. Just take her to court, you'll kill her. I can't. Why not? She's a freaking mess. You're a pillar of the community, Mike. I just can't go back in front of Judge Lee, it won't look good, trust me. So maybe you'll get a different judge. She's the only Judge who handles these cases and if I look bad in front of her right now, I'm screwed. I'll have to close my fricking doors. Then dump it. Give her Poplar. It sucks but you've got your practice to worry about, right? Yeah, I do. Incoming, dude. Hey, pal. Do you know she wants to take Leo back to Ohio? Yeah. She just told me today. You're not gonna let her do that are you? I don't know Kyle. It's complicated. What's complicated about it? She doesn't give a shit about Leo. They hate each other. You can't let her take him. OK. OK. Look, just go get ready for practice and I'll deal with it. Fine but I told her I'm staying with you guys until we leave. Wow. What's your play? I have no idea. I have no freaking idea! She's looking for a payout, dude. Just buy her stake and give her an exit. What the hell does that mean? Just give her some of Leo's money and send her home. He's not gonna miss it. He's in happy land. No, I can't do that. She's not even in his... That's right. She's not and she doesn't and that's my play. What's your play? Don't worry about it. I just need to make a call. Can you get practice started? Really? You want me to slap your face? Get you psyched up for the call? No. I really don't. Good, well, I thought I'd start by laying all the cards on the table, so maybe you can understand why I'm hesitating in turning Leo over to Cindy. Cindy, your father disinherited you from his will. Completely. And I'm afraid that can't change now that he's been declared incapacitated. Yeah. I actually brought you a copy. No. No. He left everything to the municipal parks system. He wanted the town park dedicated in his name. OK. Brass balls, buddy. Brass balls. Yeah. And she's gone back to the motel. That's good. Yes, it is. Yeah, I think it worked. It totally worked. They opened their kimono and you made them eat the trade. I don't what know what your talking about half the time. Really? Yeah. Really. It's time, Coach. You ready? He's ready. Yeah, he is. Wow. This is big time. I bet there are scouts here. Definitely. And wait till we get to the states! Atlantic City here we come, baby. Atlantic City. Fierce. Listen to me. One more win and we are going to the states. That's what counts. That's all that matters. You hear me? Hey! Kyle. Stay in this, OK. This is your place. You are in control, remember! You control it. Now go get him. Finish this! Warning. Red. One point. Kyle! Hey! Control! Control! How you doing? I'm sorry. Hey, it's alright. I don't want to go with her. I don't. OK, pal. OK. Why are you here? Yeah, well your son had a pretty good chance to do something special in there. Maybe even change his life and that's gone now. I hope you're happy. It isn't? Why do you think he lost his shit in there, huh?! What do you want, lady? It didn't sound like that the other day. It sounded like you hated the guy. So now you want to return the favor? Is that it?! And that's why you're doing all this? For fifteen hundred dollars a month? Alright, I'll tell you what. You want the commission? You can have it. And you don't even have to take Leo. I'll take care of him for free and I'll send you the check every month. On one condition. You leave Kyle here. With us. Until he finishes high school. Are you sure he feels that way? Then you can't have that commission. Yeah, we will. Then call him! You have his number! We were right there, Mike. Right fucking there. And now we have nothing. Nothing! You OK? No. He's not in the basement? I'll track him down. Thanks, Terry. What a day, huh? There's nothing to do. I can't stop her. She's gonna leave and she's gonna take Kyle and Leo with her. No. I don't. I just can't win this one, Jackie. Trust me. No. What do you want? Is that why you called me. Just to tell me that? Then leave him here. Where he is. What do you mean? What is it? This isn't real. The Judge told Leo he had to live there. Why? Why does he belong with us? Shut up! Shut up! Listen to me! I don't care about this. It's all bullshit. Leave Leo alone. He belongs here. Do you hear me? Do you? OK. Thanks, Karen. I appreciate it. Bye. He's not at Stemler's. I don't know, he's upset, maybe he went for a walk. Hello. Yes, this is him. What? Sir, stay calm, we'll find him. Stay calm? You've lost my ward! silly. He's a laywer! Look, he's definitely not on the premises. A lot of the time they just try to go home. We're about to go there. Hey folks, listen up! Watch out for each other. There's a light on. No. I didn't bring it with me. Shit. There he is! Watching TV. What's he watching? Leo? Hey Leo? He's not responding. Ring the bell. Nothing. Fuck. This is freaking spooky. Should we break in? I have a key back at the office. I could go get it. He seems it. He's just sitting there. Hi. Come on in. OK. That is very creepy. You OK, Leo? How did you get here, pal? Did you walk here, Leo? Yeah. Have you lost your mind?! We've been worried sick about him! You don't have to worry about us. OK. That's super spooky. Just saying. Kyle, What the hell are you doing? Making spaghetti. Have you lost your mind? No. This is where he belongs. Kyle, we talked about this. Yeah. We did! Listen to this. Mike Flaherty: Mr. Poplar wants to live at home. Judge Lee: You can do that Mike? Mike Flaherty: Yes, I can. Really. It's from the court. From my mother. It's true isn't, Mike? You're just like her. Hey. Hey, Kyle. Hey can you hold on a second? Leave me alone! Kyle please. Don't touch me! Oh shit. Would you let me explain?! Explain what? How you lied to me? How you lied to Leo? Kyle I don't want to wrestle you. I'm just trying to help. I'm trying to stop it! Sit out Mike! Sit out! I'm the ref. I'm just the ref! Yeah, it is. Because it would have been too much work to leave him here. I couldn't have done it. I had to, alright? Because I needed the money! We needed the money. No! I just didn't think it would get this complicated. Jack! Jack, where are you going? Hello. Hello. Mom? She's not there. He hangs up. Kyle starts to put on his shoes. Did your mom just crank call you? No. So you and Coach Mike get in a fight because you lost? No. We got in a fight because he's an asshole. Really? Yeah, really, Stem. Well I'm sure he'll make it up to you, bro. You're the best wrestler he's ever had. I mean he's always been cool to me and I suck. Hey Leo. Hi. I fell asleep. I'm sorry. Sorry for what? You want to go home? Yeah. Hi. Is he here? Oak Knoll. You're right, that's not who I am. I have to go court. I know. I can't, Jack. Because it's not true. Yeah. All the time. I'm sorry, Jack. I really am. The window. No. I'm leaving. I just came to get my shit. Kyle, listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry... I know, Mike, you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry. I moved Leo back home, Kyle. And I'm gonna fight to keep him there. It's too late. You'll lose. My mother's gonna take him. Maybe but I'm still gonna try. So what?! You want me to forgive you now? Is that it, Mike?! No. I just want you to give me another chance. That's all I'm asking. This is bullshit! Hey, Kyle, listen - I want to be alone. What? (Without looking at them) OK. All right. Yeah. Hi guys. What are you doing here? Dude, I'm your assistant coach. And just notice who isn't here. Stephen Vigman. Yeah, I got it. Hi Eleanor. Sure. Yeah, well, we'll see what happens. Is that it? Hi Cindy. What about Kyle? Then yes. It is. Every month. We will. I know. Don't rush me. This mallet is crap! You see that? Hi guys! That's great, honey. Kyle, can you drag those garbage cans to the side of the house for me? OK. Thanks, pal. Hi Honey. Good. I got stuck at the office with a client. Thanks for doing that. I'll be right back down. I'll eat there. Can I get a banana daiquiri, please? Sure. You want an umbrella with that? Nah. I'm good. But keep these coming. So how you doing, pal? Me? I'm pretty good.
