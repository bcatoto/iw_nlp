I don't like my room. What are you looking at? What photos? No. It doesn't look like you. No, you weren't. I don't wanna grow old. He smells like smoke. Show me a picture of dad when he was a little kid. Show me a picture of me when I was a little kid. What was I like when I was a little kid? I need a bowl, mom. It's too small. (Michael Corleone voice) Every time I think I've pulled you out...you grow back in. Ouch! Don't eat on the floor, buddy. How come you were up so early? Was Cali crying? What do you mean? No I wasn't. I don't snore. My father snored. I do not snore. Yes! I made it to the last level! Invisiworld! Good one, champ. I don't snore, do I? What the heck is this? Wax?! Let me get this straight - we have no actual fruit but we have wax fruit? That is dangerous. It could kill one of our kids. Probably where you left them, Renai. See. Mom, I need my lunch. Sushi? Aw, that's weirdo food. Check it first, Dalton. It's probably made out of Styrofoam. I didn't touch your books. I gotta go. No time. Not today. Can I have another cup, mom? Alanso, please sit down. No entiendo. Siï¿½ntate, por favor. Come on guys, quieten down. Thank you, Teri. Today we are going to talk about Darwin. It's a city in Australia, but it's also the last name of which famous naturalist? Charles Darwin. Correct. Does anybody know what he is famous for? He said that people descended from monkeys. Half right. He wrote a seminal book that explained his theories on natural selection, and how the different species on this planet - including humans - evolved. I know I didn't evolve from no monkey. Shit. Humans actually have a lot in common with monkeys, or more specifically, chimpanzees. Maybe you do, but I was created in the image of my Dios. I respect your right to believe that, Alanso. But I want to give you all possible theories. I want this class to go out into the world with an informed opinion. The theory is incorrect, Mr. Lambert. How can it be incorrect? It's a theory. A scientific theory. Yeah, well, science is bullshit. We didn't get here cos of no test-tubes. Alanso, if you keep talking like that I'm going to ask you to visit the principal. Fine. Look at this. Nice job. Whoa, buddy. Slow down. I don't know. They should be here. We packed them up. I remember the movers bringing them in and putting them right there. What happened? I fell. Where do you hurt the most? My knee and my head. I can't stand up. You scared us, champ. You're lucky you don't need stitches. That doesn't make sense. You might be a superhero but you're not invincible. Be more careful, bud. We've gotta lock that door. Why bother with a child leash? I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow. I didn't even notice. It's normal to want your own time. You're a great mother. That's not true. Now you're being crazy. They love you. At least you get to connect with them. I work so much. Is this so bad? We'll get by. I want you to do it. I love all your songs. Time to get up, my man. Come on. You're making me look bad here. Outta bed before your mother comes in and kills both of us. Dalton, get up. You've gotta get ready for school. Dalton...? Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!! 22. So...there's no brain damage or...? That fall he took...I mean, it looked like he hit his head pretty hard. So what do we do now? Does he stay here? They see us...all of us...we have to be quick...this life begs us to come back. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! She said dad... An award. I'm scared, mom. Dalton. Why do I have to sleep so close to him? Can't I change rooms? I don't know. What? Could it have been interference? Who the hell is that? Stay here. Hello? Who's there? What did you say? Grab Cali and Foster! There's no one in there, it's all clear. If someone was there, they're gone now. Maybe it was a shadow...? Well, like I said...he's gone now. Okay, face the front ladies and gentlemen...come on...hold still... (muttering to himself) I'm trying to record the peak of your pathetic lives here. Mr. Lambert, would you like to step in please? Uh...what? Could you step in so that we can take the photo? Quickly please. Just take it without me. We need you in the photo, sir. No, you don't. Just take the damn photo without me, okay? I can't believe this is my life. (beat; to class) Ready kids? Say asshole teacher! What? I spend so much time in the office, I hear things. I heard about your son. I'm sorry. Thank you, Alanso. Times like these...people realize that science doesn't have all the answers. There is a higher force at work. I wish I had your belief. Things would be a lot simpler. Things are simple. You just can't see it. Put your faith in Him. Hey...I just found out I have to stay back tonight and finish off mid-term grades. It could be a while, there's a lot to go through. Don't wait up. Bye. The men all walked down to the waters edge...and they stood there and asked the beast to come forth. And the beast roared back "No!". And so they dived in after it... What are you doing up? When did you start smoking? I don't like it either, but I'm grading tests. What choice do I have? We've gotta pay Dalton's bills. Jesus, I can't win with you. That's my son in there too, not just yours! I've always felt like less than good enough for you. I feel it every time you mention our bills. That subtle voice that says `can't you get a job that pays more than a teacher'? And now I can't even look at you without feeling it. I don't need to ask. I know you. I told you, I'm grading tests. Christ, I should have stayed at the school. DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE! What is it? What is it?! Renai, what is wrong?! There's no one here. There's no one here. I believe you, okay? I just don't know what you want me to do. I don't want the man to get me. You're okay, buddy. I've got you. To move now would be...we would have to rent somewhere. It's not-- So...if you're the top of the food chain with this stuff, where does that leave us? Josh...didn't see you there. Sorry to scare you. What are you up to this late? Where did all the bartenders who listen to your troubles go, Ned? Never drink alone. If you take the dirty jokes out of drunkenness, all you're left with is the self loathing. I don't need whisky for that. Bah. You people think too much. Used to be, if life threw a shitstorm at you, you'd grab the nearest umbrella. Your generation would spend a day googling what brand to buy. I probably would too. (beat; takes a drink) It's funny, I've always known I was the type of person that things didn't happen to. I made peace with it. I thought to myself, it's okay - I'll never win the lottery or climb Mount Everest...but I'll never get a rare tropical blood disease either. It works out. Now I'm the guy whose son is in a mysterious coma. Things happen to everybody. Even to good people like you. And they're gonna keep happening the older you get, believe me. No use sittin' in the dark drinkin' over it. Go home. Be with your wife. Tell her your what's on your mind. There sure as hell isn't any umbrellas `round here. This is the first line of a joke. Guy comes home to find his wife with a priest... Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Can't say I've heard the same, Liam. At least I know you're not sleeping with her. What is going on here? I should be going. Thank you so much for the tea. Okay, would anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on here? So...what? You called in a priest to get rid of it? Are you kidding me? Was this your idea? You've never been to a church in your life. Now you're inviting a priest into our home? I feel like I don't even know you right now. This is a fantasy, and you need a therapist, not a member of the clergy. What is it? I don't know how. So you must be Josh? Yeah. That wasn't psychic. Lorraine told me your name. Oh. I'm Specs. (beat; spooky voice) I'm here to solve your problem. I'm just kidding with the voice. We take this very seriously. She won't be joining us yet. Usually we handle all the background stuff, then she gets involved when we have the facts. Helps weed out the nutjobs. This is a little uncomfortable. Speaking for myself. I'm not used to this kind of stuff. We understand completely. Ninety six per cent of the people we deal with have had no experience with this type of phenomena before. I would like to start by interviewing you both. Can we record your answers? My assistant will check different areas of the house for electrical anomalies. I'll get him started. Tucker, would you follow me? Assistant? Could you not eat that in front of the clients? Assistant? Finish it in here. This industry gets laughed at enough as it is. Do you or any of your children suffer from epilepsy or autism? Right. I heard about this from Lorraine. He is in a coma, the cause of which is unknown? Do either of you habitually use drugs or alcohol? No drugs at all? Do you have a history of clinical depression? Tucker, could you check the camera? Whenever you're ready then. (to Renai and Josh) He handles administration, I handle technical. It's an even split. He couldn't change a light bulb and I'm no good with paperwork. It bores me senseless. Do you have any history of sexual abuse in the family? No. I'm sorry, I have to ask how this relates to our problem? Nine times out of ten, when someone comes to us with a problem like this, it's because of an inward cause within the family unit...not a physical force outside of it. What is that? Tri-field meter. It measures DC fields and the natural electro magnetic environment. Sometimes old wiring can leak into the atmosphere. It can cause hallucinations, changes in energy. Yeah. It's a little more complicated than that, but, you know, you get the general idea. It's basically that. Not really, but whatever. The tech stuff's not relevant to you anyway. It's very relevant, but it's all good. Epilepsy in one of the children mostly. It's very common. If we approach things academically, it lets us find the genuinely interesting cases. I think we can call Elise now... Mrs. Rainier? Last saw me? We took Tri-field and EMF readings of the whole house. All the wiring, alarm clocks, radios, toasters, TV, record player, fuse box. Nothing went off the charts. Tucker hadn't monitored that yet. I could jump on that this afternoon if you like? Make up for lost time. Yeah, but who would work the equipment? I'll need to be there. You know what, don't even sweat it. I'll make myself available. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, yes. I do. She tells me what she sees and I draw it. It's the most important part of her process. His drawings and my photos comprise her visual records. Especially the drawings. That's debatable. It's not debatable. It is, but whatever. Onwards and upwards. Find me a ghost. This is where I saw it. Go ahead. No. No. This has gone too far. I have given her a chance, and I did that because I wanted to help you. But I cannot have somebody telling us that the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul is floating off somewhere in another dimension. No, it's not fair is what it is. You're preying on people's grief and vulnerability, which is really easy to do in a situation like this. Because I wanted to help you. To put your mind at ease, and if this helped, then great. But to drag Dalton into this? No. Fair? How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here? Don't you see? You want to believe. Of course you do, honey, anybody would. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do. I really do. But I think it's dangerous to start throwing out false hope like this. I have to put my foot down. My wife is not...mentally well at the moment, and I have to keep at least one of her feet here in the real world. Honey, I'm on your side. But I genuinely think this is dangerous and frankly, a little exploitative. You come into a home with a seriously ill child, you make a tenuous connection between him and these experiences Renai is having and viola - the client starts crying because they're desperate to believe, the tears validate your power, thank you, that'll be six hundred dollars please. We reject more cases than we take. We're not out for money, sir. I know, I know...look, I appreciate your interest and your time. I do. Thank you. Thank you very much. Look at me for a second, honey. Look at me. Did you really believe what she said? In your heart of hearts, did you actually take what she was saying literally? Do you think I don't want to believe in that stuff? Of course I do. It would make life a lot easier if I did. If I believed that some supernatural force was responsible for what's happened to our son... Where are you? Where did you go? Can you hear me? I'm begging you to show me that you can hear me...I don't know how to help you. Please tell me what to do. Please God, please help me...give me my son back. I will do anything just to have him back. I need him back. I need him to show me that he can hear me. Please... Okay. These still cameras are rigged to pick up changes in the atmosphere, electrical or temperature-wise. Don't be alarmed if they go off. We are calling out to you Dalton. tell us that you are safe tell us where you are Tell us that you are safe. Tell us where you are. who's there? Who's there? it is your mother and father we have been It is your mother and father. We have been looking for you. I need help...I can't see in here. Follow my voice Dalton. Come back to us. Why aren't you talking anymore Dalton? If they hear me, they'll hurt me. who will hurt you? Who will hurt you? The man with fire on his face. can you find your way back to us? Can you find your way back to us? There is no way out. follow my voice dalton Follow my voice Dalton. be quiet they'll hear you Be quiet, they'll hear you. They won't hear you, just follow my voice. they are coming they heard you help me dalton are you there? dalton? I feel like a mountain climber who's been waiting his whole life to climb Everest, and now that I'm standing on the summit, I don't know what to do with myself... I'll tell you what we do with ourselves. We make a short list of our preferred media outlets, that's what. Watch this. Oh my God... After all the years we've been dining out on morsels like a faucet that turns itself on and off...we finally have some empirical evidence of the real thing. Proof. That is so not the point. This is not about religion. Here we have irrefutable evidence of a paranormal experience. Our job is to share it. Yeah, until they get their book deal...then you'll wish you'd listened. So what do we do now? What do you mean? Mom...what are you doing here? Why? Tell me what? What are you talking about? No...I've never...done that before. I don't...I don't remember any of this... Who is she? How long do we have before...that thing...takes him over completely? I love you too. I have since the first time you looked at me. I don't exist without you. This is useless...I have no idea what I'm doing and you just suddenly expect me to... Dalton? Dalton? Where are you? Dalton? Dalton? Where is Dalton? Do you know where Dalton is? Why do I have to put up with you? What a tramp. You call this a home? I work all day for this? Dalton? Where are you? I'm looking for my son, Dalton. DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!! DALTON! DALTON!! Get...off..me! Get away from me! Leave now! Dalton!! I'm here... Dalton! Dalton...? I'm taking you back. What is it? Help me, dad...take this off me... You're not really here. You're asleep in your bed in our home. Just stand up. He's going to hurt me again... This isn't real. You can do this. He's coming! Just stand up! This...issssss....real! You're here now! With ussss! ....ome....onnnnn... I want to get out! ....eeeeet out! Listen! Josh, follow my voice... Put me down, I can run! Come on, dad! Come on! Go! I'm right behind you! You...what do you want from me? Get the fuck away from me! I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me! He's awake! Mom... Dalton...? Now this is worth dying for. I guess you did some pretty awesome stuff in there. You deserve some credit. You did good too in an assistant- type way. Thanks, boss. Dude, I got some amazing shots. We are gonna write a book and my shots are gonna be the main selling point. Yeah. Not the main selling point, but definitely important, for sure. I'm tired. You introduced me to a new world. Maybe I can forget again. I'll start by giving these back. What's wrong? What's the matter, Elise? Why the fuck would you do that? Why would you do that? Why?! You of all people! You know! Why would you do that to me when you know what you know? You bitch! You introduced me to a new world. Maybe I can forget again. I'll start by giving these back. What's wrong? What's the matter, Elise? Put me down, I can run! Come on, dad! Come on! Go! I'm right behind you! You...what do you want from me? Get away the fuck away from me. I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me!
