Tommy? What're you doing here? I was just passing through. Figured why not have a belt with the old man. She looks good. (patting car hood) Yeah, she's hanging in there. Well, you always did take good care of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of priorities. Got a little something for ya. Mom always said never go anywhere empty handed. She did. But that's not for me anymore, Tommy. What? You change brands? C'mon, let's go inside. I like what you've done with the place. There's not much of a woman's touch around here. Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays. Here you go. Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and you're not gonna have a drink with him? I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming up on a thousand days. C'mon, just one drink. No. He's a school teacher down in Philly. Remember Tess? They've got two beautiful little girls. So you found God, huh? That's awesome. Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. Who knew? So, you gonna ask about her, or you just gonna sit there all sober? I know. Oh, you know? What do you know? Do you know it wasn't enough just to drive west to get away from you? When we hit the water we drove north, too. When I got sober I hired a man to find you. (taking a swig) Is that one of the 12 steps? Or does a guy like you get 24? Just the 12. Did your guy tell you what you needed to know? Just that your mother died in Tacoma. And you were in the Marines. That was all. That was enough. That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details. You could've heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat. Having me rub her down with holy water, because she didn't have no insurance. All the while waiting for your pal Jesus to save her. Did your man tell you that? I'm sorry, Tommy. It's good to know you're sorry, Pop. Goes a long way. I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess. It's her birthday. I'm on it. Where's the rest of that skirt? Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay? I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some action. Promises, promises. Fitzy still own this? How's it work here? Sure. Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in this too, OK? Listen up. So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs-- Acceleration. Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead. There we go. Alright Tito, well done. Remind not to mess with you. Sit down everybody. Dial it down. So, have we got it? Force equals mass times acceleration. We got it. Alright. The third law-- How many laws this dude got? The dude? The dude has three. Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. For example, if KC does not stop the action of sending texts in class... ...and tell her posse outside to beat it... ...then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office. Thus setting our world back in proper balance. Mr. C, I put it away. Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week. Where do you find these girls? We got a tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh? Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that fights outa the Bottoms. If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks. Yo, I'll fight him. Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag. We don't need anybody else getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk. Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today? Then go through the list. Get me Joe Bones. All I'm saying is if you need somebody to help you, I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you. You ever fought before? Yeah. This guy sign a waiver? What's your name? Tommy. You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tommy. Sure, no problem. Come on in. Gonna be a hero? Alright. You owe me two hundred bucks. This is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly. As you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage. That's the problem. It's the country that did the assessment, not the bank. So, the numbers are what they are, Mr. Conlon. Brendan. The numbers are what they are, Brendan. I mean, you're a Math teacher, you can appreciate that. I teach Physics. Physics. OK. But the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures. According to these figures, you're upside down on your mortgage-- You said that three times already. I get that. But I'm asking you if there's something else you can do. Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure-- Well, you've already refinanced twice. Because you advised us to do that. I presented you with that option. It was your choice. I'm also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi. We had that conversation. I was paying medical bills. Is that in your file? Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's...kidney? Heart. Heart, right. (off stack of files on desk) Lot of stories. So my option is I've got no options? You're not even gonna try to help me? I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can get you 90 days to get even-- 90 days is not enough. My wife and I have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. So, what do you suggest? Let me ask you a question: have you considered bankruptcy? It's a viable option. There's no shame in it these days. That's not how I do things. Well, then you're looking at foreclosure. How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for Tommy Riordan. Who? Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd. What business you got with Tommy? None yet. That's why I'm here. I manage fighters. Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself. I'm just looking for some general information here. Like I said, anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself. Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night. He put this address down when he signed up at the gym. He doesn't live here. Hey. I'm just pulling in. Huh? Oh, they've got this open mic night thing. Should be a quiet one. Sleep well. You too. Bye. Fighters to the center! I want you to obey my commands at all times. If you have no questions, touch gloves, back up, and wait for my signal. Come out fighting! Fighters, are you ready? Let's go! Nice fight. Two more wins and you take home the bacon. I'm not bouncing at a club. I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing. They're putting us out of the house in three months, we're running out We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going You wanted to talk? Yeah. I'm gonna start fighting. That right? Don't play babe in the woods with me. I know that guy from the gym came to see you. Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him anything, Tommy. We wouldn't be sitting here now if you did. Alright. Look. There's this tournament. A big tournament. Top sixteen middleweights in the world. Single elimination. Winner take all for a lot of money. I'm gonna do that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm gonna need a trainer. Now that much you were good at. (off Paddy grinning) No, no, no. This doesn't mean anything. I'm serious. We train. That's it. I don't wanna hear a word about anything but training, you understand? You wanna tell your war stories, you can take `em down to the VFW. You can take `em to a meeting, or church, or wherever the hell it is you go nowadays. What about Colt Boyd? What about him? I told him I don't train with people I don't know. Ah, the devil you know. Excuse me? The devil you know is better than the devil you don't. Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda like old times. I just told you, this doesn't mean anything. You get that through your skull right now or I'm walking. Alright. Alright. But you get something through your skull, too. You called me. So don't go threatening to walk every five minutes. And since this is about training, you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned. I don't want to see `em. In fact, hand `em over right now. I know they're on you, Tommy. You sounded like a goddamn maraca coming through the door. That's not gonna do. When you came through that door it was chhh-chhh-chhh. (holding up 3 fingers) Three. (off French fries) And another thing, you don't eat crap like this. This is for losers and old men. And we're gonna have to bunk up. If we're gonna do this right, you gotta stay at the house. 25. I watch your diet, we follow the old regimen. You copy? Copy. My brother said he was at the strip club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA--- What's MMA? Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different styles of fighting. Your brother's a liar. Take your seats. Now, please. Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the titty bar last night and said you was choking brothers out. What's up? Is it true? Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really work on some fools or something? You have to tell us. C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks. Are you being literal or figurative? Because literally it looks bad. And figuratively it looks even worse. The superintendent's coming by in a few minutes. So gimme a little help here, Brendan. Can you explain to me what the hell you were doing? I need the money, Joe. Yeah, but we can't have this. This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's for Christ's sake. 27. Actually, I used to be one of those animals. I fought for a living. Guess I forgot to put that down on my application. Yeah, I guess you did. Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just-- Listen, the school district's not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs. It was the parking lot of a strip club. Wherever it was, you can't be doing it, alright? I mean this is a serious--shit, he's here. Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9-11. What are we gonna do? You say yes, sir. And you say no, sir. And you say it'll never happen again, sir. And then we just pray to God he's in a good mood. The girls have an important piano recital in the morning. Got an equipment malfunction. How'd it go? How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney? That was nice. Next semester? Look, Tess. They have these smoker fights all over. There's one in Lancaster next week. There's two in Dover the week after. Wilmington. Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us afloat. Some of them pay a little more than that. I would have had to bounce for a month to make what I made in two hours last night. And these guys, they're not real fighters. They're just guys who have seen too much UFC on TV. If you have a better solution, I'm all ears. It'll be fine. I'll just leave the house as usual, except now I'll be going to the gym. Oh the duck says quack and the cow says moo, and the old red rooster says cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a- doodle-doo. Look what I found in that disaster of a basement. Whattya say we sit down and update this sometime? You can fill me in on how close you got to that record. Did you continue wrestling after you left with your mother? C'mon, Tommy. Tell me something. Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You can take that thing back to where you found it. And you can leave the coffee in the pot. I can pour that myself. I can wake myself up, too. OK. Hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway. 31. Coffee pot's on til 0-500, then I dump it. What's that? Who's "Mad Dog" Grimes? Wait, rewind that. AV, I need to see the tape! What tape? The tape. Freeze. That's him. That's him. Let the music sink in to you. This is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe. Do I know you? I think I know you. Long time, brother. Liking the place, Frank. Thank you, brother. (off Brazilian fighter) You see this beast? Marco Santos? I'm training him for Sparta. Amazing, man. Come on back. You look good, brother. How're the girls? Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie. I know. Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. I was gonna call, but then time went by. I don't know. I'm a piece of shit. I should have called. It's alright. No, Brendan. I'm sorry. It's all good. She's good now. It's great to see you, man. So everything's going good? Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually. I've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need? I didn't come here for a loan, Frank. I was hoping you'd train me. Train you for what? I want to get back in the cage. You're serious? I just won an event the other night. Ah, you won an event. (off bruised face) That's what this is. Let me guess, it was in a parking lot. DJ from the local radio station. Couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare. Am I right? Ish. Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But why would I train you? When you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me. You never listened to anyone. These guys are animals. I mean, you're a teacher, right? What're you gonna do? You're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention? You're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early? I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue. The parking lot thing kinda got me suspended. I need to keep working the smokers. Tess know about this? (off Brendan's nod) Yeah? `Cause the last time you fought, I got read the riot act sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that? No. I was unconscious. She's not gonna come down here with the two puppies, screaming at Frank? It's not gonna happen. Come on. Whattya say, Frank? What do I say? What am I gonna say to you? No? I mean, all my time is wrapped up with Marco. You come down, I'll throw you in the rotation, you spar with these guys, no problem. But I can't promise you much more than that, Brendan. That's all I need. I appreciate it. Let me know when you're coming down. Well, I'm just gonna go get my stuff from the car. Now? Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop. What're you doing here? I have some news for you. Something wrong with your hands? If there's nothing wrong with your hands then there's no reason for you not to phone. That's the deal. Yeah, I forgot-- Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable. Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady? Have you? I'm going inside. I've got a thousand days. A thousand days sober today. Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything. What do you mean it doesn't change anything? Have a heart, Brendan. You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I do. C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we could break bread. Open some lines of communication. You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is. I know you got a wife and kids in there. I got a grand-daughter I haven't seen in three years and another I haven't even ever met. Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that? That shit you pulled. Never again. And all the shit I saw growing up? That doesn't happen here. Take care of yourself. Tommy's back. He's in the `Burgh. Tommy's in Pittsburgh? He came to see me. He came to see you? He's over at the house. We're doing a little training at Fitzy's. Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's anymore. You and Tommy are training together? Tommy Conlon. Riordan. He's using your mother's maiden name now. I know what her name is. I thought you'd want to know he's back. That's why I drove all the way over here. I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days? That too. Did he say if he wants to see me? He doesn't say much. He's just not that happy kid he was. Wow, look at you. Mister inside man. You and Tommy training together like nothing ever happened. This is unbelievable. Now I know what you're really doing here. What's that? You came to gloat. I did not come to gloat. I came to get my son back. Well, there you go. You got your son back. I'm talking about you, Bren-- You got your son back. You know, part of the reason I stuck around was `cause I thought I'd finally get you all to myself. But you didn't have any interest in training me. Tommy was the one. Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean, you know. I'm sorry. Forget it. You were always a front runner. You never had any interest in underdogs. But I was your son. You are my son. Am I? Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me. Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I do not trust you. Tell Tommy this is where I am if he wants to see me. Alright. But they're not different things. You've gotta trust to Goodnight, Pop. My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie? Just some nice old man. Huge news breaking here at ESPN. Koba is coming to America and will fight at Sparta. Universally considered to be the greatest pound for pound fighter that ever lived, the mighty, mythical Russian has never fought on U.S. soil in his legendary career... Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got you into Sparta. Took some doing, but I made it happen.. (off no reaction from Tommy) Thank you and 10 percent is customary. Pilar. It's Tommy. Good good. How you doin'? How're things? Kids are good? How's little man? You know, Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute what I promised you. What I promised Manny. I've got an opportunity coming up to help you guys out. To take care of you guys. No he did not tap you! Physics teacher! That's the best in the world there, son. You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite? Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta call the boys and break the news. I'll call you tomorrow. Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me? You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow. It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do. They'll have to kill me to get me out of that cage. That's what I'm afraid of. Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you. You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us? That's not gonna happen. Not gonna happen. Wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that. It's not gonna happen. I'll make a call. I love my coach! That's unbelievable. I can't thank you enough. I don't know what to say. Alright, listen, I've gotta call you back. Alright, bye. I'm in. I'm going. It's a lot of money, Tess. You don't think I can do it. I'm not gonna get killed. Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise? So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd really love it if you'd be with me on this. J.J., you've made a fortune with your hedge funds, yet you turned your back on Wall Street and dedicated your life to making Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this tournament so important to you? Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me. 54. Tommy! I'm takin' a walk. Brendan. Been looking all over for you. How's it going? It's going. I was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee. I don't drink coffee. Whattya want? You don't want to go sit down somewhere? I'm good right here. Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to know I was never gonna see you guys again? You were briefed. You had the information. You chose the old man and the girl. She wasn't some girl. I married her. She's my wife. (handing Tommy the picture) That's Tess. And that's Emily and Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy. Don't know `em. I know you don't know them. Of course you don't know them. Why am I looking at pictures of people I don't know? Because that's my family. And who are you exactly? I'm your brother, man. You were in the Corps? What? I said I didn't know you were in the Corps. I wasn't in the Corps. Then you ain't no brother to me. My brother was in the Corps. Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old kid. What the hell did I know? I don't know what you know. Why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it? She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it? I stay with Tess and I never get to see you guys again? Not a single phone call? Nothing? God, man, I don't understand this. You won't forgive me, but you'll forgive Pop? Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness. That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them. But I forgave Pop. Just like I forgave you and Mom. You forgave us? Yeah. I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some stones. I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do? You were supposed to stick to the plan. You were supposed to come with us. Mom needed you. I needed you. You were my big brother and you bailed on me. Hey, I'm glad you stayed and everything worked out for you, Brendan. See, you leave, you get the opposite. You leave, you get to bury people. You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make! You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of shit. Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished? You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel when school's actually in session, right? We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta. What do you say? Let me get this straight. You want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for? Am I hearing this correctly? I gotta talk to your parents. You guys might need to be in summer school after all. But everyone wants to see it. The gym's the only place that's big enough. It's never gonna happen. What if we get a petition? Yeah. We'll get the whole school to sign it. The power of democracy! Look, I appreciate that you guys love your teacher. I really do. But there is nothing I can do for you. Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan. Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta he wanted to create, quite simply, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in history. It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan, the war hero who has become an overnight sensation... Five minutes, Paddy. Sam. He ripped the door off a tank! 64. Gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. Show time. You can do this. I want to hear you say it. I can do this. Then let's go do this. Go get `em, son. Classical music is about as fitting to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament. In fact, let me show you something. This is Brendan Conlon. He's a feeder fish, and he's about to get dropped into a shark tank. I remember him, too. I remember him being very unmemorable. You asked for it. Alright, gentleman, you've been given your instructions, I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. Have some fun, baby. Move! You gotta move! C'mon, Brendan, get outta there! Get out of there! Get out of there! Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't know what hit him! He tapped him out! He tapped him out! He did it! He did it! He did it! Very technical finish, but come on, that's a fluke. You can do it, Brendan. 75. Take him down! That's it, Brendan! Way to go, Brendan! I'd doing this! OK, son. I'm doing it! Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war! Can't sleep, huh? I know that other thing's bothering the hell out of you, but I'm proud of you. What you did for that kid in the tank? That was really something. How about deserting my unit? Is that really something, too? Yeah. I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys. What was I supposed to do, let `em drown? No. What'd you do? What'd I do? I took off. That's why you go by Riordan. That's why the press can't find your service records. What the hell happened over there, Tommy? That is none of your business. Come on, kiddo. I've been there. I've done it. I've seen it. You can trust me. I'll understand. Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. The suit don't fit. I'm really trying here, Tommy. You're trying? Now? Where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened. You and Brendan don't seem to understand that. Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you. Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. At least you had some balls then. Not like now. Tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out. Take it somewhere else, old man. In fact, you know what? Here's a cup. Why don't you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes? 80. Go back to the room and listen to some more fish stories no one gives a shit about. Go on, get outta here. Get the fuck outta here! God pity `em! All shall perish except me! You bastards! Stop the ship, you bastards! Ishmael! God pity `em! Stop the ship! Please stop the ship! Somebody help `em! Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch! You stop the ship, you Godless sonofabitch! Captain. Oh captain. Stop the ship. For the love of God. We're lost. Please stop the ship. We're lost. We're all lost, Tommy. We'll never make it back. I always loved you. You know that, don't you Tommy? I always loved you. You and your brother. My two boys. Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. It's not gonna happen again. Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war! Stop it! Stop the fight! You've got a visitor. Second row, 10 o'clock. You alright with that? I want you to look right at him when he comes in here. Don't take your eyes off him. I'm proud of you brother. This is your cage. Alright, gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. 87. Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war! Let's go to war! Sit down. Breathe. (grabbing Brendan's face) Look at me! Look at me! Why are we here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are we here to win this fight? You tell me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw in the towel right now. We'll get Tess and we will go home. You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home. Let's go to war! Crank it! Crank it! You know, my Manny used to say Tommy was the brother he never had. I'm gonna fight him. One more time. Gentlemen, this is the final. Five rounds. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. Where's Pop? Gentlemen, are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go to war! C'mon, Josh! Sit down. Look at me. Look at me, Brendan! Let it go! Breathe. 97. Beethoven. He's coming hard, just like we planned. I want you to angle out, hit, and move. Angle out, hit, and move. Good. Breathe. Relax. He's not your brother, right? He's just a guy who's in the way. I'm taking a little more time for the cheap shot! Do your job, Josh! Switch! Switch! Tap, Tommy! Tap! I popped his shoulder. Relax, breathe. I heard it tear. You popped his shoulder? Good. I want you to pop his other shoulder. Josh! Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You got two rounds left! You need both rounds! Go in there, kick him in the head, take him down, and finish him! Tommy! What are you doing? Shut up! C'mon. What are you that crazy? Let's go to war! What are you doing? It's over! It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't have to do this. Finish him! You finish him! Break! Break! I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry! Tap, Tommy! Tap! I love you, Tommy! I love you!
