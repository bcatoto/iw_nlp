Can I help you? I have an appointment. Name? Adam Schwartz. Um, am I supposed to go somewhere? Oh, should I go sit? Adam Schwartz. Adam Schwartz. Yeah, that's me. Follow me. Put this on. Do I need to take off all my clothes? I'll figure it out. You don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend? You want me to fill this entire cup. It's gonna take me at least a week to fill this. Can I take it home? Just another minute. Now make sure you lie completely still. Otherwise we'll have to do it all over again. Which we're not going to have to do, right? Hello? Is anybody out there? I have to pee. It won't turn off. Sorry. What? Really? No! Don't touch it. Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it? Hey Adam. Hey Andrew. Sorry about the noise last night. Yo. Yo. ...What's that smell? Are you wearing perfume? No. Well, you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias. I ran out of shampoo. I had to use Rachel's. For a second there I thought maybe you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis. Can you unlock my window? There's a lot of pollen in the air. Seriously, my allergies are flaring up. It feels like my nasal cavities are on fire. Sorry music's too loud, it's making it hard for me to hear your whining. I don't get it, that guy is clearly a total douchebag...He's wearing Capris! Rachel and I used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat... I guess it is only natural though, as we get older, more mature, things begin to slow down. Sex every three weeks is normal? Right? You haven't had sex in three weeks? You think maybe she's mad cause I haven't asked her to move in? What the fuck are you talking about? I don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything. You're using her shampoo. Next thing you'll be using her tampons. But seriously, let me get this straight - she has her own place, yet she spends every night with you, in your bed, but she won't sleep with you? It's not that big a deal. So when does it become a big deal? Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My cut off...4 days. That's when I begin to worry. Do you realize how lucky I am to be with Rachel? Look around, there are like a million Rachel's in this city alone...well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million. But they're not Rachel. I don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right. And I'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull. My parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. You've only been dating her four months. At our age sex is all we have. Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. She's killing us Adam...You're a semi- smart, semi-successful, semi- average looking dude. Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population. Morning gentlemen. Would you sleep with my friend. Like, right now? No just in general. Yeah, I'd fuck him. Hey Demetri, Fuckable? I'd let you blow me. See this is what I'm saying. I love you. Salutations gentlemen. Are you wearing perfume? It's Rachel's shampoo. Fructis by L'oreal. My wife uses that. What are you wearing? What is that? Ah, mothballs? Looks like my group is here. See you guys later. How's the Origins exhibit coming along? We're almost done with Upper Paleolithic. I'm counting on you not to screw up. (looks into Adam's eyes) You're the only one I can trust. 13. The Board is talking about bringing in sponsors...We're a dying art Adam. Phil? Yeah? I should probably get to work. That's probably a good idea. I think I'm gonna go to lunch. Greg. What are you doing? It's a velociraptor. Where did it come from? The dinosaur exhibit. (off Adam's look) Why can't we just say it was the first domesticated pet?...People love dinosaurs. Greg you can't just...that's a 75 million year old fossil...just please, put it away before someone sees it. Coming up here on our left is the "Origins of Man" exhibit on loan from the Smithsonian Institute. It won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it. Adam! Everyone this is Adam, he's the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum. Hey kids. Why don't you tell us what we're looking at. This here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in Europe about 25,000 year's ago... ...these Cro Magnon's as they're often called, are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans... ...What made Cro Magnon so advanced was their sense of community...they were the first to settle on a single plot of land, devote to one partner, raise a family, and take care of the sick. This is lame! I thought you said we were gonna see dinosaurs. See, I told you. Who wants to hear about the caveman? Caveman. RRRRRR! This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the Neanderthal Man. For over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of Europe. But then about 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals began to disappear, until one day, their entire civilization was gone. What happened? Greg you know what happened. I do? Come on! Tell us what happened to the caveman. Well no one knows for sure. But it's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others. So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe, they took over the land. One by one, Neanderthal was pushed out...and never seen, or heard from again. (game show voice) That's quite a story. Thank you Adam. (Quietly to Adam) You really know how to win a crowd. (to the kids) But you never know, just cause they vanished doesn't mean they're gone. For all we know, there could be a Neanderthal walking among us right now. And by the looks of this guy (points at Neanderthal) I'd say he probably plays defense for the Raiders. This sucks ass. I see dinosaurs. neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion. I have no idea what you just said. Is there something wrong with me? I still have no idea what you're talking about. What?!...A tumor? No. How is that possible?...I don't smoke. I don't drink. I eat healthy...I even recycle. (still in denial) But, look at me. I don't look sick. 19. I'm going to put you on a 4 month regimen of chemotherapy. It's an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work. Can't you just cut it out of me? Well what are my chances of beating this? DR. Ross Listen, you're in good hands. The best thing for you to do right now is to not worry...Let me do the worrying. Alright? Hey bro, time's up. Can I have just a few more minutes? Sorry bro. Twenty minute limit. Rules. Nothing. We need to talk. I had a doctor's appointment today. Have you ever seen the movie "Beaches"? Yeah that one. Remember the end of "Beaches"? I don't know. Well I do know, but I can't pronounce it. Neuroscharnoma or something. It's not good. I just think it's an interesting time to take up smoking again. Sshhhh. Everything's going to be alright Yammy. I'm going to start chemo in a few days. We're going to get through this. Ugh...and my parents are coming over for dinner. No. 3...2...1... Hey. Where's dad? I found your cat playing in the neighbors yard. Dad, I don't have a cat. It's made of wheat gluten. (whispers to Rachel) What is she talking about? Mom. We're not getting married. Have you ever seen "Terms of Endearment"? Alright fine. But, before I tell you, you have to promise me you're going to stay calm. Mom, just promise me. Okay? I have cancer. I have cancer. (takes a deep breath) I have cancer. I - HAVE - CANCER. Mom, I have a giant tumor in my spine. Mom? Mom, what are you doing? Please, will you come sit down. Mom, I already have cancer. Mom, please, stop. I don't need these. Mom. It's genetic. That's a disorder of the bowels, son. How are your bowels? The problem is not with my bowels. You're a lucky man. Thanks dad. What? No. Absolutely not. That's a terrible idea. Mom, I'm fine. It's nothing. Really. I know. What's taking him so long? How hard is it to buy a cup of coffee? (quietly to Adam) Look at how tight that shirt is. She's totally aware of how large her breasts look too. This morning when she got dressed, she said to herself - "I have these things and I want the world to see them." What about that frozen drink, what's that like? The Bavarian Blender. It's absolute heaven. I don't know. Does it have a lot of sugar? We've been here 20 minutes. What's he shopping for a car? Why are you in such a rush? Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life? Wasting away in this place? I don't believe it. Why can't he just get a latte like he does every morning. Relax. We have plenty of time. No we don't have plenty of time! Life is finite. What the fuck is wrong with you? I have cancer. Yeah right. I'm serious. Get the fuck out of here. You have cancer? Maybe a little louder, you can make a special announcement. When did this happen? Yesterday. They found a tumor in my spine. Who? What do you mean who? Who found the tumor? Lewis and Clark...The doctors found it. When were you going to tell me? I'm telling you now. If I had cancer I'd tell you right away. What do you want the Better Friend award? It's not an easy topic to bring up. Holy shit! Okay, let's relax here. I think the best thing to do is to look on the bright side. The bright side of what? This is your chance to do all the things you've always wanted. This is it. This is your time to live it up. Plus, do you know how much pussy we're going to get? I have an appointment with Dr. McRae. You're Dr. McRae? Aren't you supposed to be like sixty-five and wear earth toned sweaters? No, no, no. I was just expecting someone older. No believe me, you're fine. Better than fine, you're Dr. McRae...you're a doctor? How old are you? Twenty-six? What are you like Doogie Howser? Doogie Howser... ...The teenage doctor. No. Nevermind...but aren't you young to be a doctor? So have you had many patients? Oh. Honestly. I feel fine. Yeah, but I tend to internalize everything so, who knows. Huh? Lay here? Shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood? Or my days as a call girl? Oh come on. Nothing? That was funny. I can't believe you got me a present. Is it that Prada handbag I've been eyeing? What is it? You know how I feel about surprises. Last surprise I got my parents told me I was adopted. Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was. What is it? It's so small. What do you do with it? Why, did it go to medical school? It looks like a gremlin. What happens if you get it wet after midnight? They're a lot of work. 40. I can barely take care of myself, I don't think I can handle another living, breathing, needy, thing in my life. I know what you're doing. Alright. Fine, we can keep the dog. Really. There he is, the man of the hour. Here I am. Martini? No thanks. So cancer? Yup. The Big C. Man! Are you wearing a wig? Nope, this is my real hair. I'm gonna miss you so much buddy. I'm going to miss you too. Excuse me for a moment, I think I see someone over there from a previous life. Have you started chemo yet? No, not yet. Don't do it man. It'll fuck you up. That's like some Nagasaki shit. Ah, okay. Like a specific kind of green food? So what kind of cancer do you have? Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas. Never heard of it. It's pretty rare. Yeah well, you don't look sick. Cancer often has no specific symptoms. People can go years with out knowing they're sick. Huh. I think you already said zucchini. (caught off guard) Uh huh. There's this guy on the beach who injects oxygen into your blood. Is that legal? No, but it's totally safe. I know, it's crazy. Well I'm his best friend, so talking to me in a way is kind of like talking to him. Wait. It's not too late. Hey Adam. (less than excited) Hey Greg. My uncle had what you have. Really? Man that was the worst. Your uncle had Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas. Yeah, I think so. It's the thing with the toe and the screaming, and everything tastes like olives? Right? Well that was a nightmare. Half those people don't even know me. What? What? I love you. You are so unbelievably sexy. What? Ignore him. I'll do it after. (to the dog) Come on. Today...If I don't get laid tonight because of you, I'm going to take your little bow and make a noose... Please! I need this. Evening. Nice dog. Will you please just finish. Mother fucker. Do you...want to move in? I was thinking it might be nice, now that I'm not going to work anymore. And with my chemo starting... You're here all the time anyway. You wanna have sex? I'm coming. Please take your seats. The service has begun. Please, follow me. Hi. Nice to see you. Ladies and gentleman, Adam Schwartz! Rabbi Jacobs. How are you son? Oh you know, just trying to live by the Covenant. Don't bullshit me. You were the worst student I ever had. I bet you haven't even spoken a word of Hebrew since your Bar Mitzvah. I don't like to brag, but I couldn't speak it then. Your mother told me about your situation. I'm sure she did. It's not easy for a mother to see her son go through something like this, Nothing is easy for my mother. Have you thought about trying to reconnect with the Torah? Honestly, I'm just here to make my mother happy. It was either this or I had to go see my cousin perform in his high school theatre's adaptation of "You've Got Mail". Well think about it. I'm always here. Hi there, I'm Alan Alda... Adam Schwartz. Come with me my baby. This way my baby. That's Henry. Is he okay? He's always like that. Is that going to happen to me? Best not worry about these things. Want a hit? It makes it all a little easier to handle. What if someone sees us? Don't be such an old man. Look at this place, it's like Death Row in here, they don't give a shit what we do. How old are you? Twenty-five. You're lucky. Life only gets worse anyway. Alan, stop it. Don't listen to him, he's just messing with you. No I'm not. It's all downhill from here. Trust me. First your hair's going to fall out, then your balls will shrink. You'll marry a woman, or man, who'll suck every penny out of your savings and then leave you for a fitness instructor in a teal Miata. Then, to top it all off, your kids will one day stop talking to you because their therapist, who you pay for, tells them you're the reason they're so fucked up. You'll have to excuse Alan here, he's going through a rough time. I'm just being realistic. You want some advice? Not really. Don't end up a victim like the rest of `em. Life sucks, the earlier you accept it, the better off you'll be. I got to tell you, I was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then I met you guys, and boy do I feel better. I like this kid. I'm Alan Liebowitz: stage 4 lymphoma. Pleased to meet you. Mitch Horowitz, metastatic prostate cancer. Adam Schwartz, schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas. What the fuck is that?...Sounds like the greek dish I had for lunch. ... man this pot is really strong. Medicinal. Good shit eh. I want to ride. I don't have cancer. I feel like I was just gang raped by the Buena Vista Social Club. I'm serious. Have you heard their horn section? I was just injected with three pints of kryptonite. Can we please hold off on the new agey stuff. What I need is for people to stop telling me what I need. They teach you that in medical school? An outlet for what? I have cancer. Well excuse me. You'll have to forgive me for not having a firm handle on my emotions at this particular juncture of my life. I'm sorry, I know you're only trying to help. 60. This is all too much for me. I don't know what to do. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it. "Franz Schlegel is an American `medical intuitive' and `mystic psychiatrist'. Schlegel's teachings are widely recognized as a global spiritual awakening that is transcending individual and collective human consciousness"... You're actually going to read this shit? This guy is a fucking tool. Let's go to Mardi Gras! Why would we go to Mardi Gras? Because it's Mardi Gras man. It's like a giant orgy of the sexiest women you can imagine all throwing themselves at you, screaming to be fucked. It's a fuck fest. I'm getting chlamydia just listening to you talk about it. We need to go see the world. This isn't my bachelor party we're planning here. Adam you can not let your cancer go to waste. I'm not going anywhere. Well if you're not going to take advantage of your cancer, then I will. Excuse me. I'm looking to buy a few books - No that's okay. They're for my best friend, Adam. He's pretty sick. Yeah. Cancer, not cool. I know it's been really hard. Honestly? Sometimes I just wish it was me instead of him...to relieve some of the burden, you know? I just...I just want to help. What just happened? I'll tell you what happened. Cancer happened, and you need to get on the train. Are you going to the park again? This is the third time today. He can barely make it to the door without shitting himself. Yeah. It's medicinal. No, I did. Night blindness. Rods and cones are off. The store. (off Rachel's furious (trying to reason) Why can't we put up both? Yes? (calls out to Rachel) Love you. I don't get it, they spend all day at the dog park. Great. Maybe she'll move there. Can you not talk about her like that? Are you joking? Do you see the way she treats you? She's got some kind of creative block...It's her process. You have cancer for fuck's sake! If I was your girlfriend, I'd be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes. Instead, she's yelling at you over some fucking painting. Her art sucks. You don't want to put that on your wall. It looks like someone threw up a shrimp cocktail and then used it to spackle the Berlin Wall. We're going through a rough patch. That's what happens in relationships. Bullshit. She's fucking you in the ass Adam. This is the one time in your life you can do whatever you want. If you want to smoke weed, then smoke. You want a 50 inch flat screen TV, then get the fucking TV! And if you want to go to Mardi Gras, then LET'S GO TO MARDI GRAS! We're not going to Mardi Gras. (as he exhales) You're totally missing my point. I've been reading your books, and you know it actually makes sense...Some of it. 66. I'm not gonna lie, I don't really get the "Dark Night of the Soul" stuff. But I get it, years of anxiety have taken over my body. I'm blocked...emotionally. Sure, if you think it'll help. Good morning class. Before we begin I'd like to introduce Adam and Seth, our two newest giggle gurus. (quietly to Adam) What are they laughing at? (quietly to Seth) Just go with it. (to Adam and Seth) Now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter. 67. I, ah, have cancer. Ah cancer yes. Yes. Laugh. Everyone. Beverly, share - Paul, share, My wife told me she's a lesbian. And then left me for my sister. I owe two men eight grand by Friday. My best friend is a giant pussy. My best friend's favorite band is Abba. When I was 12. Abba! Wonderful. I love it. Seth laugh. Real. Fake. Fake. You're both wrong. I think I know real when I see it. God damn it. How come we've never met Rachel? Yeah. What the fuck? She's been really stressed lately, If I brought her here, she'd probably freak out. Smart man. Save yourself the headache. Don't listen to him Adam. It's important to be with your loved ones in times like these. Bullshit. Women are nothing but trouble. 70. They're selfish animals who only add to the misery in your life. You want to talk about a cancer. Listen to me Adam, I've been married 40 years and it's my Margaret who keeps me going. She's my reason to live. That's precious Mitch, I almost want to wrap it up and tie a little bow around it. Honestly, I don't give a shit. You can do whatever you want. It's your life. All I know is that I'm not going to spend my last days on this miserable planet pining over a woman. The day my wife left me was the best day of my life. Hey it's me, just checking to see if you're on your way. It's me again. Just checking to see where you are. In case you're looking for me I'm now on the other side of the parking lot. Call me. Oh hey. Just waiting for Rachel to pick me up. Uh, four. She must be stuck in traffic. I think you should ask for a refund. Yeah, I can see. Nope. Nope. I actually failed my test. It's true. Eh. Let's just say, that the state of California felt it was best I didn't. I kind of backed my mom's car down an embankment...Into the Balboa cactus garden. They didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane. Stop the car. Just stop the car. I can't handle all this mess. You can drive. Thanks for the ride... Do you want to come in. For a beverage? Or something? Come on, I'll let you analyze my Id. I've never played before. Doesn't mean I play it. Games these days today are so complicated. 75. There's too many buttons. I can't keep track of what does what. She has a sense of humor. Duck Hunt, now that was a game. You know why? One button. You think I'm kidding. My dad and I used to have Duck Hunt tournaments. He was actually really good. Until he had his stroke. Well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a better player, he just lost interest. Well whose fault is that? Doctor? You ever had this stuff. Well it smells like my grandmother. You haven't met my mother. It's a miracle I do anything but complain. The world would be a boring place if we didn't complain. Come on. There's got to be something. One thing, just one thing, that drives you nuts. It's infuriating right? To complaining. Is it all gone? Finally. Where have you been? Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my therapist. She drove me home. Ring a bell? Where have you been? You were supposed to pick me up. 8 hours ago. You're right. Let me go back and talk to the doctor - see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs. And my house isn't a summer camp. You can't just come and go as you please and not take some responsibility. This. Us. You know what I thought the other day? That I might actually die without ever having sex again. I know. You're my Yam. I can't. I don't know what's wrong. It won't work. Where's Alan? Excuse me. How can I help you? Where am I? The After Life. This is Heaven? Pretty great huh? They've even got a frozen yogurt machine. There are lines in Heaven? It's worth it. So you want to know what's going to happen when you die? I think it's a fair question. Fair yes, but impossible for me to answer. Our deaths, like our lives, have meaning and are all part of God's plan. How should I know what God has planned for you. Maybe if you came to service once in a while... Well am I going to go to Heaven? Probably. What if I want to just die? That's it. No Heaven. That's like buying a ticket for a cruise and then not going. The Afterlife is where the fun begins. How can being stuck in some nonexistent void with my grandparents be fun. I spent my entire life trying to get away from my family, now I'm going to have to spend an eternity with them. Adam, you can not look at death as a curse. Even in death we are all still part of God. Life on Earth is just the beginning. But that's not what I want. Oy. Then find another religion. I don't make the rules. I'm going to die aren't I? It's true. I'm not getting any better. Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away? 7 billion light years! It's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think I'm going to live? Cancer is an epidemic! It killed Alan, it's going to kill me, and it's going to kill millions more after me. There's nothing anybody can do. Will you stop! I can't do this anymore. It doesn't matter. None of it. I'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life. 100 years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer. That's it. I know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me anymore. I'm sorry. I need a new lint brush. And I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday...The big one. Are you listening to me? So you'll take me? You look great. Really? Yeah, look at you. I want to come back to work. You want to come back? Here? What's so crazy about that? You could be anywhere right now, and this is that place? Yeah. Are you sure that's a good idea? ...Given...your current health? You said I look great. Yeah for a guy with cancer. Alright, what the hell? I'd love to have you back. Let's be honest this place is falling apart without you. Thank you Phil. So you're really okay? I mean, the cancer, is- Oh it's really good. We've come to an understanding. It takes whatever it wants and depletes me of my every will to live, and I let it. Welcome back. And if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit "The Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD by the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site. Here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of this ancient city. This here is Adam, one of our curators. Adam do you want to tell us what you're working on? Gladly. This here is a depiction of what Pompeii's final 19 hours probably looked like. According to Pliny the Younger - "You could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting. There were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death. Many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer, and that this was one unending night for the world." Ok. Moving along we see the beautiful watercolor paintings of John James Audobon. I'll be in Pompeii if anyone needs me. You feeling okay? You don't look so good. Could be worse. Right? Jesus! Listen Adam...I don't know how to say this... Don't worry...I get it. You're a good guy. Come back when you're better. You know you'll always have a home here. Hey, it's Adam. Where are you? Maybe you forgot, but my appointment is today. So call me back. Fuck! Hey man, I need you to do me - Hello, Hi mom. (smiles to the Nurse) Don't worry about it. (Scowls at Edith) I'm fine. No, really, I'm okay. But thank you. (to the Cute Nurse) We're fine. I'm fine. You're like some kind of deranged pusher. What? What? You're unbelievable. Well who needs a doctor when they've got you and your fanny pack? Well stop! You're driving me crazy. With the comments and the pills every five minutes. Just stop. I'm not dad. I can take care of myself. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Mom. Mom! No. It's not. So what do we do? But you said surgery was too risky. Does that mean...I can get handicap parking? Smells good. Who's that? (even more suspicious) That's what she just texted? 97. She wants to know what time you're going over to her house? Alright, well I'm gonna go lie down. What the fuck? Who's James? (re: text message) He wants to know if you're still coming over tonight. Should I tell him you're having a girls night? Oh wait, you already told him to bring the wine. That's funny. It seems as though you've double booked yourself. Oh, you just got another text from him. He says "Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted... "Hope you're not too sore from this afternoon." He seems sweet. Well now how do you know what I'm thinking? You've been cheating on me. Am I? What's this? And this? And this? And this? There are over a dozen naked photos of you in here. Hey guys. Bad time? Whoa! Nice! Now that I would put on the wall. (off Adam's look) I can see you're in the middle of something. I'll just be in the other room. Have you lost your mind? I had the most important appointment of my life today and you missed it because you were off with your "art partner"...And what the fuck do you know about Africa? Did you cheat on me? DID-YOU-CHEAT-ON-ME!? No. I'm going to pretend you never existed. You know, you have a pretty fucked up way of showing your commitment. I want you out my house. Shame on you. Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted? I know. Is "dreams" a metaphor, for- You remember the last time we came out here? Prom night. How could I forget? Jen Zabrowski went down on me right where you're sitting. That memory is so far from me, Jen giving me a blow job? No, prom night. It feels like a lifetime ago... I know it happened, but that's it. It's like someone else's memory. You okay? I can't believe this is all actually happening. The girl or the cancer? Both. It's some pretty fucked up shit. You know, I used to think that I was actually going to spend the rest of my life with Rachel...granted that might not be so far off. (shakes his head) What a waste. We need to get you laid. Don't you ever give up? No. Seriously, who's going to have sex with me? Some girls are into it? I look like Powder. Plus I have erectile dysfunction...temporary. I hope. Then let's go get me laid. I think I should drive. You don't have a license. You're drunk. Do you even know how to drive? How hard can it be? Hard enough that you don't have a license. This might be my last chance. Driving! You care about driving! We could be on Everest getting high on Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you want to drive!...Forget it, I give up. Drive. Hey Miss Daisy, will you please watch where your going? What? I didn't see it. That's what the mirrors are for. Turn right. I know what I'm doing. Apparently not. YOU'RE GOING THE Adam! Turn the car around. No. I'm driving and I want to go this way. What the fuck is wrong with you? For once can you just shut up and let me do this? So I'm driving the wrong way? Big fucking deal. You're an idiot. Get out. This is my car. GET! OUT! You're being a real douche. Adam, open the door. Don't you dare call her. Not after everything she's done to you. You're a pussy. Well you're a selfish piece of shit who cares more about getting his dick wet than actually being a friend. I don't want to die. I'm 25 years old and I've never even been to Canada. I haven't lived my life! I'm really, really scared. I'm sorry for the way I acted. I should have never stormed out like that. You mean like a complete asshole? If I don't die, I think we should go on a date. Why not? It makes for a nice incentive. Yes you can. Yes, you can. A wise person once told me - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails. That's what you think. Good night. Night. What are you doing? Watching you sleep. It's a little creepy. I know. I can't help it. Sir can I help you with anything today? (holds up suit) You think this is a good suit to wear to your own funeral? No, what you want is on level 3. Here at Linden we're more than just a stopping ground for the deceased. We understand that life is different for everyone, and helping families to see their loved ones off to the hereafter means approaching every funeral and burial with it's own dignity and care...A funeral is a representation of the individuals time spent on earth, so I ask you to reflect on your inevitable interment and think carefully in choosing the service and tomb that best befits you. What about a Viking funeral? I'm not familiar. (talking out of his ass) You know, we put him on a boat... cover it with...dirt and...branches...whatever you can find. We push it out...into the sea...or the ocean...and then shoot flaming arrows, boom! It catches on fire...And that's it. It's awesome. (points to grave plot) Here you are, the Schwartz family plot. What is all this? Oh, great. 111. Glad to hear there's nothing unusual about removing organs. Mom, this is Nuprin. What the hell. I gotta new coat. That's great dad. Brooks Brothers. Silk pockets. Feel. Feel. I am feeling. I love you son. I love you too dad. Egh em. Mom. Mom. They're great, thank you. I'm a little freaked out. Will you be here when I wake up? About how long? Well what if it doesn't work. How do you know I won't wake in the middle of the surgery? What if I- That is the most beautiful dresses. Where did you get it? I'm here. I feel wonderful. Magic! Mommy! Daddy! Remember the time you walked in on me masturbating?...That was so awkward...What hotel is this? We need to go on more vacations. You're here too! You're soooooo awesome... Katie McRae, Katie McRae, Katie McRae. Mic-Rae, Dr. Awesome Mic- Rae...I'd love to make you pancakes sometime. PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! You must be Margaret. That's me. I'm so glad you could make it. I'm really sorry about Mitch. Please come inside. You're just in time. Sorry about the mess. I just moved in...The ocean air is supposed to be good for my recovery. We're having a Duck Hunt tournament. You play? It's really easy. One button does everything. I got it. You mind? Please. I think there's a red tide or something. My eyes are all itchy. It feels like someone is rubbing sandpaper on my corneas. (as he serves Adam) Nope. You don't have cancer anymore. No more special treatment. I am still in remission. I like complaining.
