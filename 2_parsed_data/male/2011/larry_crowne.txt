Don't you, Li'l Pickle Bug... Buddy. Park there and you'll get a ticket. Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in sixty seconds. (a dozen pizza boxes) You guys having a party? Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two- K a year are history. Who else would do us that favor? Wish they'd all sail off like her. Save us some grief. The "R" Bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place. "R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring? Separating the chaff from the wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff, right? Chaff is the waste matter, correct. When are we restructuring? Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders. What say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd? How? Firing someone. Someone they'd never expect to be let go. To look fair. I like it. Like a Team Leader. Team Leader? Suggestions on who it should be? I say Crowne. Larry Crowne? Who else? Avery won't retire. We fire him, it's a law suit. Alvarez is about to drop a kid. She'll go part time in a week. Crowne's pink slip will save 'da "U" big green backwash. What Salary Tier is Crowne at? Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L. bump at the first of the year. Sweet. We'll need Actionable Cause, of course. How's his review record? He's a candidate for Employee of the Month. His 22nd time. Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a reason... We could use the Limited Horizons strategy. Larry will always be passed over for Management. He never went to college. You're that familiar with his record? She was his squeeze for a few weeks, weren't you, Vick? That was before the New Employee Covenants. That you even remember... The memory haunts me. He'll sock us for severance. Big brick in the pond, though. Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu. LC Why still here? Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy. I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2. Probably to clean up after the party. Isn't it Employee of the Month Day? Speck-tack-alar. You're the only one around here who deserves it. How many will this be? Ah, who's counting? Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. Cubby. Make tracks. I think I know what this is about. I don't think you do. Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us. Sounds like you're firing me. I take it back. Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas. It is touchas, right? Where you get kicked? Yeah. A yiddish word. Like the buttocks. Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous. Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak. UniMart is firing me... Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job. Why me? Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so. Why not Strang? Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons. Here's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder. Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded. I won't make the Front Office? Never. (shows his college ring) S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs! I went in the Navy. Right outta high school. Five years, and by then... Thank you for your service to our country, Larry. And, in total seriousness to UniMart too I thought I was Employee of the Month. In a way, you are. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose my house... The timing on this is always a bitch. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. We can fix this. Can't we fix this? Really wish we could. Vick? The generous severance package? Sign here. Here. Here. Initial that. Sign here. One more. Done. 12 jerks I'd fire before you. May walk away from UniMart myself. Stick it out. You go to college? Couple years. Then I blew out my Thanks for seeing me off. I need your apron, man. Your apron. Says UniMart on it, so it ain't yours. Thanks. Goofy car, man. at RiverBank..." I was holding for Barry Raphael in Home and Real Estate? Barry is gone? I need to talk to someone in Home and Real Estate. (reading his ATM card) I wish! I'm Customer number 566 7878 2031 339 and I can be there in three minutes! Three minutes! What happened to Barry Raphael? This is some kick in the head. Not sure what to tell you, Mr. Crowne. I m hoping not to lose my house. In a few weeks your financial base will tell us what we can do. Find new employment. Liquidate everything low on the Value Index. Stick to a budget. Clip coupons, buy in bulk, you know the drill. Then come back and we'll work with you. That's RiverBank's plan for me? Larry's home a little late tonight. We'd see that on the news. How do I offer this up to Personnel? There should be a box to put it in. This? No. There should be another box. There isn't. That's the one, then. Just following up with an in-person visit. You have a great location here. I used to work for UniMart! I could spill you some 411. I know their trade secrets. And I'm ready to learn new strategies. I'll stop by again so you can keep me in mind. I'll work every day. Oh, I remember you. Larry Crowne. I never forget anyone who quits on me. As I recall, I gave my notice and worked all my shifts and that was 12 years ago. As I recall, I had to hire and train a line cook to take your place. Walking out doesn't happen in a vacuum, you know. Doesn't mean I wouldn't give you a job again. But you've been out of the business a long time, and look around. I don't need you. You come in two weeks ago I would have kissed you on the mouth, but Carlos and Nick, they walked in. Best I can do? Put you at the top of the list. Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I could help you but Raul runs the back. Not sure I could work here anyway. The atmosphere is too pleasant and the clientï¿½le too A Number 1. Breakfast on the house. Chorizo Scramble, right? No charity today. I got things to do. Like what? Nothing. I was just saying that. There's been a yard sale at 1402 Derby Court since Monica Lewinsky! That gives me a monopoly on the location! You go yard on me, Larry Crowne and I will destroy you. Bloody Friday. Security sees you off, by the time Monday comes around the fired man is the forgotten man. Diabolical. They said it's because I didn't go to college. Smoke screen. The Man just wanted you gone. (his yard sale) You liquidating assets to raise cash? Buying out Denise's half of the house was the worst advice, ever. I told you to avoid divorce lawyers. Get married. Stay married. Come with me. I'll tell you straight up - I'm not lending you money. He can't afford 'em Lost his job I love you too. Hard to do. He's going to get something better than a job. An education. Get some knowledge and you'll be fire proof. Aren't there unemployed engineers and geophysicists? You won the Lottery. Lost half to taxes. I'll see if there's a class in here for PowerBall 250. That's half a buck for the book. They give these away free. They do. I don't. Back to college, huh? First time. I was in the Navy. Coast Guard. Adventure of a Lifetime. Galley Mate. We teach a whole track in Hotel and Restaurant Food Preparation. No. No, no. I need an all-new career and a place to go everyday. Those two things are my specialty. First thing. Bravo for choosing East City College. Never too late for an education. Second, you need a jolt to the confidence machinery. I am going to change your life. (a page in the catalog) Speech 217: The Art of Informal Remarks, cause it's not enough to just be smart anymore, you have to project ease even when it ain't easy. Is this Public Speaking? It's training. Job interviews will be a breeze with the confidence you'll get from Speech Two One Seven. (even better...) And you'll spend three hours a week with the most attractive package in all of Academia. The Golden Girl of East City. Mercedes Tainot. Please Enter your destination. Sorry! Parking's impossible today! New to the Student Body. I'm going to be late for my first day of school. Please tell me this is Speech 217. Look at us, in two classes in a row. Yes. Hi. That Ms. Tainot is something else isn't she? I'm new to this coll ge life and, I confess, she sca es e This whole place scares me. Yes. I woke up this morning so nervous about the first day of school. I changed my clothes three times. I am Lala. I like this guy... Yes... Shakespeare as I know him... is cancelled. What's cookin' Joe College? Money woes. Paying for gas, getting to school. You ever come across a moped or a scooter for sale or trade? Come with me. Passing through, woman... "College Graduate." This what you're talking about? That's a hunk of junk. This is classic. It doesn't work. It will for eight hundred dollars. Two hundred. Seven hundred. Two hundred. Six fifty. Two hundred. Six thirty. Forget it. Larry! The secret of any negotiation is for both of us to win Talk to me How much do you Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet. Gas. Brake. Light's busted. Tires are low. You'll need a special license. All I need is the open road. You break it, you bought it. It still works. Talking about the hedge. Well, hey! Who's home early! First day of term calls for a celebration! What's your burden this go round? I built a Flamethrower of a posting for WarriorWeb which, if I do say, will feed nicely as an outline for "Carrier: Second Angel." And, I was a guest blogger on CyberShare. I was composing, Mercy. That's what I do all day. It's barely porn. I'm not hiding it. Don't chug. Sip. Everyone hides something. You walked in the door pissed off because -- I'm sorry -- I've established a beach head in New Media while you still have to teach at Vassar of the Valley. You hide that. It may look like I don't work hard around here, Mercy. But I do. I'm just a guy who's a guy being a guy when you're not around... I'm a guy. Who's a guy. Being a guy... How you doing... Speck-tack-alar. Nice machine. Where you headed? Work. School. College. I'm a student. What do you do? I'm a gynecologist. Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day' but that would be stating the Got me here for a nickel's worth of gas. I am? It's only been one day New to the sport. Larry Crowne. With an 'e'. Not much fashion sense. Gotta go! You mean me? My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. "How to make French Toast", but I'll speak English... Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle. That went fast... Simple. Direct. Informative. Dell Gordo. You want to ride with us? Why not. Okay. You're in for a trial run. Not many of these '66 Wasps left around. They had low torque. How's the torque? I just bought it and ride around. Let's go, Sweets! Other than school, I have nothing to do. Let's troll Buena Vista for junk stores. We hit those last week. I know where a yard sale is, like everyday. Take point! Follow me, boys and girl! We're being invaded! Larry, what kind of thugs you get in with? College buddies. If they're college buddies why aren't they in college? Speak to my bride inside. Oh man! These TV trays are too much! Bargains at $100 apiece. For these? Are you nuts? I'm joking, kid. Let's get to haggling. A buck apiece. Ninety-nine dollars apiece. see how this is working? Two bucks apiece! Ninety-eight and, kid, I do this every day. Entrez vous, sea food plate. Good choice. I did most of the cooking, actually. You know about Denise? The usual stuff between three people. Dark. Stay outta my way. Corn pone! You're like Uncle Ben or something. Stan's working on your bike. He is? Said the thing was a time bomb. He's saving your life. 'We'll be right back after these messages.' You're in the Street Patrol. A full-time mission for beauty and justice. Lance. All men fall in love with Talia. You will too, if you haven't already. But I love her the most. Know that right now. Capice. Seriously. Don't make me keep my eyes on you. What's your real name? L rry. Mine's Don. Shake hands. Look each other in the eyes. Firm grips. No contest, but firm. Hold. Stack it. One word, Lance. Peace. Peace indeed. Speck-tack-alar. That was a great presentation. I learned a lot from it. Smart stuff. Super smart. Breaking even is not making profit, it's a theoretical assumption. Economics abhors an assumption. The Break Even Paradox creates a new metric... Palm out again. DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D) I am growing tired of this game, Mr. Crowne. Aren't you? So what happens here? I have no idea what that means, but you betcha. Holy smokes! This is just sitting here? Talia! This is unproductive capital! Sell it on eBay. What is all this worth? Where? Monkey! Thought you might be here. Please enter your destination. No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful and brilliant. And I will be a good boy from now on. Why? Because you're right and I've learned my lesson. Just don't be mad at me forever. I have a pliable soul and I pray you do too Been thinking. If you ever want to take a whack at writing something -- say a blog a couple of times a week -- I could help you out. I'd read your stuff. Make comments to make it web-savvy. Pieces need to pop, you know. Takes a little See? You can't stay mad at me. No reason to be mad at me... Denise. Larry. This a good time? I'll call you later. Well. Okay. Uh. Here's the deal. I'm going to miss a few months on the checks for the house. I hoped not to, but I there it is. I'm sorry. Let's start with six. I don't have it. I tried. I'm too much of a risk. Can I smell trouble or what? Can you speak English? Those two over in booth 6... Homeland Security. I piped thei badges and everything. What is Homeland Security doing here... This is Larry Crowne? Raul? Yes. Get your ass down here. You got a job. I do? We're swamped, Kimosabe. Get back there! You're late on your first day! Where you learn to turn eggs like The USS Coral Sea. Boss, I don't want to quit school. So don't. I gotta get to class before I miss the whole day. And I can't work mornings Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays. Soon as the rush is finished, go. I'll get my idiot brother-in-law three days a week. You take evenings. Deal? Deal. When will we talk salary? Never. This is take it or leave it. Don t worry. I may be tough but I'll be fair. These are not toys. Nobody 'plays' with these. These are kept behind glass, so no way am I passing them around today. Guess Larry's out today. He didn't call me. I do too. (off their looks) He's a nice man. Should I continue? I'm sure everyone recognizes Boba Fett... I'm sorry I'm late, Dr. Matsutani. May I still sit in the class? I'm going to ask a question in a moment. I want someone other than you to answer it - I don't care if the silence is positively Arctic. Anyone? Lala... To upload market differences without... Without mooting the quarterlies. I know. Then say it. Just give the answer. You know it. Say it. Can I? To up... met... es without ...ing ...terly predicts....? To upload market differences without mooting quarterly predictions. No. Only the profit markdown. I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not miss another class, this I vow. Inappropriate subject in mixed company. She's marred. Complimentary coffee is usually lousy. I got a job. Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all day. And I'm going to school. I was afraid of that. It's been a few weeks. I can't make the payments on the house. I'm going to lose it, aren't I? You guys are forced to say that, aren't you? I think it's letting up. We can't stay here all day. Find a raincoat and let's get a little wet. How you going to get to school then, College Co-Ed Belle? Should I begin? Oh shut up you sleaze. Jerk. Look at the new pants. They actually fit. And that jacket is 'smart'. Did Busik put Larry Crowne into Fashion for Creeps? An old goat dressed like lamb. Of course! It's that doe-eyed young thing he's been wearing on his sleeve. Dressing like he's half his age. Give me a shotgun! I'll pepper Larry Crowne right now! Am I being unfair? I mean, if I were single and some young buck took to me, wouldn't I be inclined to diddly-dally? Unless you're looking at a chart, you don't even know the Equator when you cross it... That Larry believed there were signs on posts marking the Equator. Larry worked on an Aircraft Carrier! Night Carrier Landings are the trickiest flying in world. Larry was stationed in Panama! My father is from Panama! Oh crap. You can't come in here. No Lance works for me. This is my kitchen and I am the boss. Raul's my boss, yeah. Sure I'm cool. Tough but fair, too. N . But I do the purchasing. It makes me crazy, you kidding? But it's gotta be done every day or guess what? No food. I'll show you how much I gotta do... Breakfast all day, see. From Corn Flakes to popovers. We make the best Chicken Fried Steak outside of a truck stop. Who? Lance. Square footage at this price is a bargain. This is your Matsutani Delta Number. You net this every month, you cover overhead, and the rest is profit. Chapter four. Well, back to work! Work my ass off all night trying to get f i in' smile out of you! Like The Joker after three Apple Martinis. We can't even have a Date Night now? You can't even chillax for one meal? Please Enter your destination. You looking for a whole new man, Mercy? I'm the jerk who has to transform into Ultraman to make you happy? No. I like myself, Mercy. I put up with you and complain about nothing. I had three postings today alone. FogCaster, SkyScan, and ParsecTwelve.com Hey, Booze-illa, who are you to judge me? I know what's really pissing you off. I like big titties. And you don't have any. What did you say when I asked you out? I saw you and I thought "I would be a lucky guy if she'd go out with me." Honestly, this is about as good a first date goes, isn't it? Hold that thought. I take it back. I take it back. I've been drinking, too. You win! I'm letting you win! Everything you say is right and Screw you, you washboard! Please enter your destination. Ms. Tainot? Larry Crowne. Do you need a ride? Hop on. I was heading home. Right? We're done scooting? Seriously. I offer you a ride. I've yet to give anyone a lift on this but I think I can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case. An attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea. In those shoes? Put this on. Strap your legs round my engine and Ain't you a ball of fun? I do want to survive this night. Where am I taking you? I may use this as a presentation in class. I like your class. You're making us all do things we never thought we could. Someone's getting pinched... Bad night for that guy. Unit 114. You don't want to give me your pass code. This it? I'll get the door for you What? What? What are you talking about? When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony. Goodnight, Ms. Tainot. I assumed you preferred Ms That's a long story and it's late. My helmet? You smell good. Thanks. We all have crushes on you. Even the gals. Wow... Yes, you do.. In you go. (Mercedes goes in) Close the door. Lock it! Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow... Mercy!!! Epilog. School today. If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. Seeing them -- the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis -- should have been beyond me, but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me. That is something I will remember forever. The teacher says nothing. DIBIASI That was a knockout speech, Lala. Made the news. Caused riots downtown. School's out til 2019. This is bordering on harassment now. Why doesn't this ever happen to me? You want I should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed?? How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can. I wouldn't want that. Sure. Nothing happened. At all. None. I'd better scurry along to Dr. Matsutani's class. I hope I don't have this same conversation with him. Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax. See? Works. I have to sell my car. If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it. What's the job paying you? Half my UniMart salary. You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as dirt. I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days. Hang in there, neighbor. Everyone keeps saying that. I was in the same spot. Look what happened. The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery. I read how the universe is expanding, Larry, taking us along with it. That is a wild concept to grasp, but what it means is, we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we're going to be. This thing must be making me dizzy. What? Keep your grip. You'll be okay. It's like the wife always says... A woman with a measuring tape? That's money in my pocket. ' ind bargains today?' Vick? How you doing? Larry Crowne. Larry. Hi. Why are you on the Register? Management Execs are now required to put in 8-hour shifts on the floor. Every day. No overtime. No bonus. Just more hours. Cash or UniMart Bargain Card? Like you have one of them. Cash. No receipt. You got out of here just in time... 'Thank you for choosing UniMart, where united we blah blah.' Hi. No notice. No preamble. Just an email and a google map. Point made. So. What up. We could. Why should we? I'd like that too. You're not a pleasant woman after a few glasses. Mornings with you are to be survived. I see. I'm what this is all about. You're talking about you but you really mean me. I am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything. So you don't get to either. We've both been here before. Why prolong the process? White flag! I give up. This ain't working. I'll sign papers and checks, see if there's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually I will be fine and you will too. But I am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults. I just now came up with that, and it is going to be my next posting. 'Consumerism'. The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'. You missed Matsutani's class. Review for the final. What? Why? Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in school. Don't throw away your education. Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce. It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce. Quitting school is for dopes. Might not make it. I have finals! Ladies. Bring an appetite? Cream pies I got. Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady, you're killing me here. Ma'am? You're slipping, Larry. Lady says it's not French Toast as she knows it. She's insane. Take it up with her. No shouting, okay? This is a family friendly establishment. Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order? Mrs. Tainot. There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast. You'll be the judge of that. Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job? Shall I prepare you another batch? Then I will return to my station.. Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last? Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we vote? I say... Lala! This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records. Priceless at a buck apiece. Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing. What's the minimum you'll take for this stuff? You'll get me top price. You did learn. Here's lunch as promised! Son of a cock. Larry Crowne. Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony. Two extra large. One Salad Bucket. Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs. Sixteen- fifty. Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough. Tell me about it. Ah. Forget it. Keep the change. I appreciate it. That could have been My next wife just walked in. I love this business sometimes. Something told me you'd be back. Is Larry Crowne working today? Larry, your Speech 217 teacher has a question about the menu. Go ahead. I'll take the window even though I'm the boss of the whole kitchen. I add chicory and a bit of vanilla. Trick I picked up in the Navy. Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs. Tainot. This has turned into a full time gig. Out of necessity. I'll have to see. My first class in college ever. And I get an A. Gotta be the teacher. Cars not much. Devices some. Please enter your destination. In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. All better now. Should be able to find your way. Thanks for the good news... Kimosabe, holding off til after school to woo the teacher is the move of a class act. Carrying a torch for Larry til it burns her hands... All the excitement of first day of term, I don't want to go back to my empty apartment. Do you? I need a drink and some talk and some wind- down time. Don't you? Oh yeah! I put that guy in your class. So technically, I changed his life. If you're going out, I'm not doing anything. For the spicy wings, yes! Right Turn. Your destination is ahead on the right. Yes. I met you.
