(takes a seat) No, no, no...Don't feed the dog darlin'. Thanks babe. Yeah. I need to go. What you got going today? With the kids? Tell Nat to take it easy on her. I love you. Just write the check, babe. Okay. Yeah, let's keep going with that bit! It'll go another 10 feet! Why not?! Happy hour starts at five Dewart! Oh, yeah. Yeah. All right...All right! I'm callin' it! Shut it down! I gotta get home. What's big? Shit man. I don't see me and Sam gettin' into somethin' like that. Well. It ain't always so easy. Good night. Hey baby. She do all right today? I'll get to it this weekend. I still take off my boots so I won't wake her up. What? Nothing. I just want her to eat her breakfast and stop playin' with the damn dog. Hannah. Come here. Hannah. What? I'm late. It's okay. I didn't say you had control over the weather Russell, what I did say was that the top shelf has to be cleared by the 15th. That's non- negotiable. Umm, Curtis. Where we at on that east 82nd site? Yesterday slowed us down. We couldn't get the second pilot hole drilled. It rained for two hours yesterday. Two hours and our entire schedule went in the toilet. We lose the permit if you're not out of there by end of day. Yes sir. End of day Curtis. All right. Valerie tells me that the father son pancake cook off... Hey, I gotta make a stop before we head out there. Yeah. There's time. Sonofabitch. Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta re-set it. Shit. You ever see birds fly like that?! Shit. Ah, Jesus. I could really use a shower. Between the ages of four and seven the focus is more on the sign and then later we'll begin adding the alphabet as more of a support syster. Now in ASL... ...the male sign is signed at the forehead area. For example, father is signed up here like this...Father, very good. I am sorry. I think I smell good. Do I smell good? See. Maybe I should marry her instead. (signing and speaking) You okay? Are you okay? You're okay. Hannah! Hannah! I've felt better. Where you goin'? Oh. Yeah. I'm all right. It's just a cold or somethin'. No. Don't worry about it. Ya'll just go. I'll be fine. Yeah. (holds up the mug) Better already. I'll be all right. Honey, please. How much you asking for this pillow? That's more than I want to spend. I'll give you seven for it. Well that's my offer. I'll give you eight, but it's in change. Red! Come on. Get in. Good boy. I'm sorry about this buddy. We just gotta work it like this for awhile okay? While rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family, Walter Jacobs wife... I just wanted him to be outside for awhile. He's my dog, and that's why he's outside. Right now with Hannah and everything I just think it'd be better. Hold on. ...the gas cloud spread across their six acre property. (from a hospital bed) I tried using some wet rags and towels to breathe through but that just seemed to make it worse. While rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family, Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in- law died in the home. Jacobs survived despite enduring eleven hours of exposure to the gas cloud before finally being flown out by helicopter. You hearin' this? Eleven hours. No way out. Hannah. Hey! Babe? You got the number for Dr. Shannan? Yeah, but you got the number? Right. Yeah. I'll call tomorrow. No. Stop! Shit... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I got a sore throat. I'm sorry I'm taking it out on you. It's fine. I'll be fine. I've got it. Come on. Just go. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just go. We're going out. (with open palms) We're going out. Okay? It's okay. You stay put okay? Let's all join hands for the blessing. I know. I'm sorry. I had to run an errand. I know. Missed you at church this mornin' Curtis. He knows what to do if he wants me to stop askin'. Was it a good service? It was. It was good work. I'm thinking about cleaning up that storm shelter out back. Curtis, how you doin' bud? Hey Doc. How's my girl? She's good. That's good to hear. Tilt your head back for me. I don't have a cold. Oh. Did she get that down wrong? No, I just told her that. Oh. So what's the problem? I've been havin'...I've been having some trouble sleepin'. I was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it. How long's this been goin' on? `Bout four nights now. You're not sleepin' at all? Well some, but real restless. Well, I think four nights is a little too soon to tell. My advice would be to not eat or drink anything after 8 o'clock at night. Cut back on any alcoholic drinks, tobacco, caffeine...get some daily exercise. Well, I think... I think I may need to try some medication. Why do you say that? The reason I've been having trouble sleeping is because of some dreams I've been havin'. I didn't think it was anything at first, but then the other day I woke up and the bed was wet. You urinated in your bed? Yeah. Couple days before that I had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away. You been to see your mother lately? It's been about a month. Okay. This is a prescription for a pretty mild sedative. It's non- habit forming, but I'm only giving you enough for a few days anyway. Take it and see if it helps. In the meantime, (holds up the other slip) This is the number of a good friend of mine in Columbus. He's a psychiatrist. It's a drive, but he's the best I know. Okay. I'll give him a call and let him know you'll be down to see him. All right. Hey Dewart! Not much. Yeah, we'll get it done. Weekend all right? (into the phone) No. Look it. I've told you this twice. Please. Just get me the name and or the approval code. Okay. It's fine. It's fine. You know your husband's company actually has very good insurance when it kicks in. Not a lot of jobs offer policies half as good. You're very lucky. That's okay. We have your insurance on file. That'll be What's the co-pay? That is your co-pay. Hey. I love you too. It's great. It's great. Hey, Hannah. You excited? Huh? We're gonna get you some help. How do you say...sign excited? Excited. Yeah? Now I got to do you. What's the rent? That sounds real nice. Yeah. I did. You want me to come there and do it for you? Jesus. Hey, how much food do you think you'd need to live on for a week? I mean to stay alive. What do you think you'd need? You think? I've never heard of that. It's on there. It's on. Come on. Dammit. It sounds like thunder. Hey Mom. Sure. I'm going to get some water. You want some? Mom? I need to ask you somethin'. Do you remember what year we brought you up here? To the first place. It was `86. I was 10. Can you remember what happened before you got diagnosed? I mean...I just want to know how it all started. Before you had to leave. Did you ever have any dreams? Like bad dreams. It's all right. It's all right. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. (into the phone) May I have the number for Doctor George Shannan? Thanks. (into the phone) Hi, is Doctor Shannan there? May I speak with him? This is Curtis LaForche. Hey Doc. Yeah, sorry...Sorry to call you at home, I just don't think I can make it to Columbus to see that psychiatrist. Yeah, it's just too far. Is there somewhere local you can send me? Oh, hey. Sorry I woke you up. I went to see mom. Mmm hmm. I just wanted to check up on her. That's okay. I will in a bit. Well you've kept up with the payments on the house. We've been good about that. I gotta tell you Curtis, banks aren't loaning money the way they used to. We've got you a loan today, but the interest rates are variable and we have to tie it to your house. That's fine. Curtis, I've known you a long time. We financed your house for you, two vehicles. I'm telling you this is a risky loan you're taking. I need the money John. Okay. Hey. Sorry I left you yesterday. Thanks. Sure. You need another burner? You think you could help me with somethin'? I'm gonna build out the tornado shelter in my backyard. I could use some help. Just needs to be done. I figure I'll do it on Saturday, borrow some equipment from work. I just need a backhoe, a hauler. I'll rent the rest. Thanks. What do you mean? I'm not. Hello. Curtis. Okay. I already answered all the questions on the forms. Right. Well... Out of the five possible symptoms needed to be diagnosed with (reads off the pad) delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and the negative symptoms, I've had two. Delusions and hallucinations. But they say it has to continue for six months to be diagnosed schizophrenia and mine hasn't been goin' on anywhere near that long. So, I took this quiz in the back of the book and I scored a five out of a possible twenty. Schizophrenia starts at twelve. So, they say it might be a... (reads off the pad) brief psychotic disorder. Whatever it is, I need to know what to do or what to get on to get this thing under control. Yeah, I don't know my mother's symptoms. I was just 10. My brother was 17. And, uh...I don't know. She just left me in the car in the parking lot at the grocery store one day. And she didn't come back. And then they found her a week later eatin' trash out of a dumpster in northern Kentucky. My dad had to put her in the state hospital in Columbus. And she's been in assisted living ever since. Yep. My dad raised me. He died last April. That's all right. But I really do think you should continue with the sign language. And any additional therapies that kids need for the cochlear implant. Okay. Good night. Is anyone seeing this? Hey. It's all right. Calm down. Samantha. I didn't want you worryin' about it. I got a home improvement loan from the bank. I'm doin' it...I'm doin' it for us. I know you don't understand. There's nothin' to explain. I'm gonna go put Hannah to bed. (into the phone) No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't send an ambulance. It's fine. I'm sorry you fellows had to come all the way out. It's what we do. Now we can still take you in if you want a doctor to look at those cuts in your mouth. Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see somebody on Monday. All right. Thanks. I haven't been honest with you. I'm sorry. I've been havin' these dreams. I guess they're more like nightmares. It's why I've been actin' like this. They always start with a kind of storm. Like a real powerful storm. And there's always this dark, thick rain. Like fresh motor oil. And then the things, people, it just makes `em crazy. They attack me. Sometimes they go after Hannah. First one I had Red nearly chewed through my arm. Yeah. It was Dewart. We were at the job site. The storm started and somethin' happened. His face. His eyes were different. He came after me with a pick ax. And we fought. And he ran it through my leg. It's hard to explain, because it's not just a dream. It's a feeling. I'm afraid something might be comin'. Something that's...not right. I can not describe it. I just need you to believe me. I've been to a counselor. I've seen her a few times. You know what I come from. And I promised myself...I promised myself I would never leave. And I am doin' everything that I can to make that true. Six weeks? ...this point just to the west. I don't think we'll have any problem. We should be able to get twenty, maybe thirty in this next week. But we're looking to see how that's gonna shape up, so... Curtis? Yeah. What do you think? Yeah. That sounds good. We'll get it done. Come in. What you need Curtis? I need a favor Jim. What's that? Can you take Dewart off my crew? Just reassign him someplace else. What's the trouble? He not pullin' his weight? No, nothin' like that. He's a good worker. He's a good man. He's my friend. I think it'd be easier not being in charge of someone I'm so close to. You know, I understand. This is part of what it means to manage people Curtis. You're gonna have to learn that. Yes sir. I appreciate that but... well it would just be very helpful in this case. Okay. Well, I can put him with Russell. Anybody else you prefer? No. Whoever you think's right. Okay. Thank you. You been missin' a lotta work Curtis. I know. My daughter's had a lot of doctor's visits. I haven't let anything get behind. No. But don't. Okay. Yessir. Can I help you? Yeah. Can I look at one of these gas masks? Sure. Which one you want to look at? The newest one. How much? One seventy eight. Anything cheaper? No. That's the cheapest one I got in the store. They go all the way up to two ninety. I don't know what you want to spend but a gas mask ain't something you want to go cheap on. You got any kids sizes? No. Kids can't wear those. They got a have a special thing, its like a hood. I don't fool with those. Yeah. Ring me up a couple of `em. What you got goin' on here? Just addin' on to the storm shelter. Why? Just `cause. You runnin' water to it? Oh, yeah. From our well. Runnin' sewer out to the city line. How much you spendin' on this thing? It's not bad. Doesn't look it. You take your eye off the ball one minute in this economy and you're screwed. You got the cash for this? Yeah. Don't put nothin' on credit cards. That shit'll eat you up. I'm not. Samantha called me. I figured. Called you to come tell me to quit? She called `cause she's worried. Says you've been stressed out. So? So what? You stressed out? No. No more than anybody else. Work all right? Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come by and have dinner sometime, Kyle. That's fine. We'll have a beer and talk about the old days, but you got somethin' to say just say it. You can stop that shit right now. I'll come over there and remind you what it feels like to get your ass whipped. I'm just coming here to check on you. Well I appreciate it Kyle. You been to see Mom? Yeah. A few days ago. She all right. You should see her. Take your girls. Yeah. I'll get around to it. You need a hand? No. I've got it. Okay. Call me if you need me okay? I will. Hey Kyle? Actually you could do me a favor. What's that? You still looking for a dog? Sure. They got a good spot for you, okay bud. You sure? Yeah. I know it'll make my girls happy. All right. Hey Kyle? Yeah? Take care of yourself. All right. All right. I will little brother. You take care of your family. Handle your business. Okay? All right. All right. Bedtime. Ah shit. Hey Jim. Curtis. Dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house. Said that's why you wanted him off your crew. I came out here to see it myself. Yeah. It was just a hauler and a backhoe. It was Saturday. I had `em back in less than 8 hours. You know that doesn't matter. I can't even tell you how many rules you broke. What if you had an accident? Huh? What if you ran somebody over on your way out here? Lawsuit like that could bankrupt me. Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't thought of that. Thank God nothin' like that happened. You know? I'll do whatever I can to make it right. You can pick up your last check on Friday. You've got two weeks benefits. Did you fire Dewart? He's on two weeks leave unpaid... I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to yourself. I've been fired. We get two more weeks. I'm sorry... Oh, `scuse me. Are you Curtis? Yeah. Come in. Kendra transferred out. I'll be meeting with you today. Please, sit down. What happened to Kendra? She got into a program at OSU so she'll be transferring near there. I've split her case load with another counselor. It's been kind of crazy around here lately. Huh. So I've looked over your file. It says your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her early thirties. Let's start there. That's the alternator from the truck. I was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there. Ah, what the hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your old exercycle. You gonna leave me? I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Doctor Shannan gave me the number of somebody. But, uh, I just don't think we can afford it. I don't want to see any of those people. All right. How many pieces does Hannah get? Not here man. I know. I know. I'm sorry. Come on. God dammit. You think I'm crazy?! Huh! Is that what he told you! Well, listen up! There is a storm comin' like nothing you have ever seen. And not a one of you is prepared for it. You think I'm crazy? I'M TALKIN' LEWIS! You think I'm a thief? Sleep well in your beds. Cause if this thing comes true, there ain't gonna be any more. Hannah? Hannah! Come on. It's okay. It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit down. It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put this on. Please just do it. Okay? There we go. All right. Keep it out of your eyes. Okay? Hey. I love you. It's okay. Where's your mask? No. What if it's...What if it's not over? What if it's not over? It's still storming. I can hear it. Put your hand on the door. You can feel it. (signing and speaking) Thunder? Do you feel it? (signing and speaking) You feel it? You feel it? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't. Could you move Hannah back? It's fine. I don't have a job right now. You mean I have to leave my family. (signing and speaking) Hey. Good, huh? Good. We put a top on it. What is it honey? What? Sam.
