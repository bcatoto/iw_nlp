Hey, Hilly! Roses look like weeds next to you. Oh, who cares, honey. We got all we need right here. Doctor's orders. Hey, we've never done it in the yard. Maybe that's the trick. Hello, Miss Eugenia. What the hell do you know about cleaning a house, Skeeter? I thought you wanted to write books. Leave your sister alone, Son. I'm proud of you, Sweetheart. Ah...well, Constantine went to live with her family. People move on, Skeeter. But I do wish she'd stayed down here with us. Have fun at the dance, Skeeter Legs. Gone be just you and me all weekend. Some things we should just keep to ourselves. I'm five-thirteen, so quit feeling sorry for yourself. "Miss" what? Shoot, Child! You gone be "Miss Something Better." Now you listen. Your momma didn't pick her life. It pick her, and she done even know it. You gone do something big with yours. Bigger than your momma or your brother. Oh, Child! We don't get to pick. This pick us, and that just how it is. I put up with the new clothes and all the damn trips to New Orleans, but this takes the goddamn cake! Great! Mae Mobley can just go to college in that bathroom, too. We don't take orders from the Holbrooks! Skeeter? How you doing? Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen. With your daddy's endorsement, I can win that Senate seat. I'll talk to him. You want a drink? Double Old Kentucky straight...with a water back...Make that two backs. The money's good. If that's what you really want to know. Isn't that your old boyfriend, Hilly? Johnny Foote? Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter than Delta asphalt. So, what do you do with your time? You mean housekeeping? Jesus, I can't think of anything worse than reading a cleaning column. Except maybe writing one. Hilly, you look lovely tonight. William, have you ever met Celia? Nice to meet you. Sounds like a ploy to find a husband...becoming an expert on keeping house. Isn't that what you women from Ole Miss major in? Professional husband hunting? Or you a `princess,' Sweetheart! Well, I'm late. Gotta go. No, Ma'am. Little too early. Whitworth. Natchez. Yes, Ma'am. That's my daddy. Senator Whitworth. That's my father. Look. I know it was a few weeks back, but I came here to say I'm sorry for the way I acted. Neither. I was rude, and I've been thinking about it a lot. Now, look. I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on any date. I wasn't even close to ready. I was engaged last year. She ended it. We'd been dating since we were fifteen. You know how it is. Well! That must be it then. I've never met a woman that said exactly what she was thinking. Would you like to...come downtown with me and have dinner? We could talk... We could listen to each other this time. Then, I'm sorry. That's what I came to say and...I said it. What do you want, Skeeter? No, I mean in life. What do you want? I like that...I've been thinking about you. You're smart, you're pretty, you're...tall! Yes. And I read your column. Very informative. I never knew Crisco got rid of diaper rash. I hope you get to write something really good, Skeeter. Something you believe in. Y'all stay put. Let me find out what's going on. Colored people off. White people lemme know where y'all are going. I'll get you as close as I can. What's going on? I don't know. Some nigger got shot. Where you headed? Give her another pill if she gets too agitated. There'll be more bleeding, but don't call me unless it's heavy. I second. I third. All in favor of Hilly, say "Aye." Aye! (under the covers.) Chirp. Chirp. So is mine. I love you. Honey, I'm sorry, but I have to get down to the coast. I'll be back in time for the benefit. Love you. (a little too loudly) Look at the jugs on that one! You look gorgeous. Honey, maybe you've had enough to drink. Try to eat your dinner. Celia wouldn't have missed this for anything. Hilly. Oh, God. Celia, what's wrong, Honey? Oh, shit! Hey, Honey. What if I told you I have twenty- four hours in New Orleans? That I'm in the Presidential Suite of the Roosevelt Hotel...That we have dinner reservations in the Blue Room tonight and lunch tomorrow at Galatoires. Did you hear me? I spoke to your dad, and he's gonna have Jameso drive you down right now. What? Work in the car. Jesus, Skeeter, it's a cleaning column. I'm trying to be romantic... Five, four, three, two, one. Welcome back to "People Will Talk." And do we have something to talk about. Jolene has quite a book to review. It's called "The Help." A new book by an anonymous author. Takes place in the fictional town of "Niceville." The book is dedicated to C and T. If you're out there C and T, we'd love to have you on the show because Niceville sounds like Jackson, if you ask me. But did you read that ending? Bertha, if you're listening, I have a new found respect for what you do. And, believe me, I'll be passin' on dessert at your table! That month felt like a year. I missed you so much. Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going back on the rig. How about "yes?!" I had this with me down in New Orleans, you know. Hang on. Did you say `yes'? Sure. You have my word. This is what you've been writing for the last twelve months?! What happened to the cleaning column? So, the talk in town? I said they were dead wrong. Told them you were too smart to get mixed up in anything like that. That joke you played on Hilly with the toilets. Hell, that's funny. But this? I don't understand why you did this...why you even care. Things are fine around here. Why stir up trouble? I guess it is. I guess I don't really know you, Skeeter. And I can't marry somebody I don't know. That was my grandmother's. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. Johnny Foote. Minny Jackson, I want to talk to you. Open up. Finally, I meet Minny Jackson... What the hell are you doin'?! Calm down, girl. I'm not here to get you. When I finally confronted Celia about you, she told me about the baby. All of them. You saved her life. Well, I know the day you came to our house, she started getting better. And I'm not just talking about the cookin' either. Fried chicken and okra on the first night? Y'all should have at least put corn pone on the table. Next morning, I snuck back up to the house, peeked in the window, and there you were. Given ol' Oscar a wipe down. You have a job with us for the rest of your life, if you want it. Aibileen, this is an important time for you and our church. We know you couldn't put your name in here, so we all signed our own. This is for the white lady. Tell her we love her like family. Born December 24th 1883 Died March 15th, 1963
