What are you doin'? We were worried about you. Patrick's worried about you. I could've brought you. Through the woods? No. You not gonna eat that? You ready to go? Come on! No? I'll get this. Well? What did she say? Where's she been? What? Not really Lucy. Well, how long's she staying? I told you she was fine. You spend all that time worrying. Martha! Welcome! Great to finally meet you. You sleep alright? It's just a rental. Do you think she's excited to have you back? Yep, just a little while longer. Well, you've got to eat. Is this Martha? How're you doing? It's as much yours as it is mine. I thought you quit? It's disgusting. Don't apologize to me, it's your body. Look after this girl properly Zoe, she deserves some real care for once in her life. Good. You look like a Marcy May. Well, there you go. Brilliant choice of swim wear. She's not coming? She seems a bit off, no? Has she always been like this? Hey Marcy. I don't know, I never get invited. You want to have a drink with me? They won't be back for a few hours. Alright. It's cool, I'm good at hiding it. How's everything going so far Marcy May? You like it here? I want you to feel at home. People have abandoned you your whole life. I don't blame you for not trusting anyone. If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down. It's not your fault, but it's there. If you feel safe here, and I think you do, let us in. We just want to help you. If you're going to live here then really be apart of things. Cocktail anyone? Martha? You lived with Dora? Where were you? It's good, it's just, a bit dry. She seems better today. Let me take you. I'm always nice. This one's called Marcy's song. Well she, she's just a picture. Who lives on my wall Well she, she's just a picture And the reason, reason, reason it is so small. With a smile so inviting and a body so tall, She, she's just a picture Just a picture Well you stand there, stand there with the nightshade, Her dripping ripping down your hands And you ask me, ask me about the And the lady, lady, lady she understands It's a dream for the future and the water for the sands And the strangeness is wandering Through many callin' lands What are you doing? Alright. I'm going to take the boat out, do you want to come? She had to run to the city. I'll teach you how to drive the boat, come on. Come on. You want one? Beautiful day. How have things been with you and Lucy? Is it strange to spend time together? It's been a long time. At the doctor. She's getting a check up. We're trying to have a baby. What? Why? I want what Lucy wants. If she's happy, I'm happy. No. She's good. She's relieved to have you back. You had her worried. You disappeared. You haven't called in two years! It's good to let people know where you are Martha. People worry. Well, she did. You don't need to ask. You jump yet? Go on. You ready? Sure you can. She hits the water, everything goes dark. The frame fills with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. She continues to swim, the camera follows her under water. The darkness of the water makes the screen go black. All you do is sleep. This is just brilliant. I don't have much choice do I? I get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before I have to go back to work! I am under so much pressure right now- I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it. My point is, I don't need the extra stress. As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane. It's okay. It's labor day, we always have it. I've already invited clients. They wouldn't. For who, Martha? It's not an option! We're having the  party. Yes! Hey. Sally, yeah. So what are your plans Martha? Life. Are you thinking about what you can do for work? You're at an age where you need to start thinking about a career. It's a part of adult life. Really? Like what? I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way. It's not that simple. And what do you think the right way to live is? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain. You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth. You're rude. Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how  to defend yourselves but I think you're  hopeless. Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday. God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes  my willy hard. I'm teaching her how to shoot.  Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze. Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about  someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel  how they made you feel in your stomach.  Take a deep breath, feel it all moving  out into your hands. Let it build. It's  transferring to the gun, building in the  gun. Now release. Feels good right? Now try that. Shoot it. So, shoot Max then. Go on! Fuck this. Don't walk away from me Max. The cat has terminal cancer, it's in  excruciating pain. Max has no substance, he's just here to  free load and be around the girls but  you're a teacher and leader, you just  don't see it because no one let you  believe it before me. You're a leader a  Marcy, now prove it. The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing  you think you used to love. You're  holding on to some false emotion that  stops you from doing what's right. I could spend my life being selfish,  living alone, using this gift for me but  I've sacrificed myself to be what you all  need me to be. You need to trust me. Then you shouldn't need me to explain  everything. What did you do? You said it was sick. One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one  it was! I'm fine. I'll probably leave this place soon  anyways. I got places. My cousin lives in  Bennington, he said I could go up there  and make like, $500 a week selling weed. I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all  these rules. It feels like rules. They won't let me do  anything. I can't even go on the house  runs. I'd be great at taking shit. Sounds like it's about taking shit to me. I'm not drinking. I'll try. I'm strong, they'll see. Jesus Christ you scared me. Did I wake you? Me neither. I was going to watch a movie. You want to watch? It always helps me. It's better than lying in bed awake. I'm sorry about before, Martha. You want me to make some breakfast? Hey! What's wrong? What? Lucy! No one was curling up with anybody. Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a movie, she came out and sat down and started watching with me. What am I supposed to do, tell her to leave? You're being ridiculous. Are you accusing me of something? Because if you are, I'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds. You ask me to make more of an effort. I try to do that and you get upset. I can't win. I'm sorry? Mike. Can I get you something? Straight? I'm not drinking. Calm down. What the fuck. Hey, we can go. What do you want? Nothing. No need for that, we are leaving. Calm down, if you calm down no one will get hurt. What do you want? We're not stealing, we don't want anything. Just get out. We're just looking at the house. It's nice. We didn't realize you were home. We wouldn't have come in otherwise. Just Leave. I would but I can't be sure you won't call the police. I won't. You didn't take anything so just go, I just want my family to be safe. Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless you call the police, everything will be fine. Okay, I won't. You have my word, please just go. Get the fuck out of my house. Look at me. You okay? You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love. He's fine. Right Max? Yeah, I'm cool. There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine. Right? Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop. I'm fine. No. Do you? I don't know. It doesn't matter. No. It's cool now, I don't really have  anywhere to go. Why, would you? Hi, is Watts there? Jane. Is Watts there? Who's this? Heller, sorry, do I have the right number? Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do it, I'll be around there on Friday. No, that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad you called. Hey. What's going on? She needs to see someone. I'll start looking into places tomorrow. We can arrange for her to be somewhere by Wednesday. I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this. Haven't you learned anything? I felt like we had a connection. That's not what you're showing me. Maybe I asked too much from you too soon. You have potential but you're just not there yet. I'll expect less of you fro now on. Shhh. It's okay. You're my favorite, I won't lose you. She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy. Jesus Christ. Yeah.
