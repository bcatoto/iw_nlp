... I love violence! Two fifty, three hundred... You did well out there. You've got something, Liang. Potential, yeah? Don't spend it all in once place. He still in there? ... No. You told him I was coming... Wouldn't listen... Well maybe you didn't try hard enough. When was the last time you slept? Just cause I ain't slept for three days, don't mean I don't know right from wrong... and your brother has become a real problem... No. Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and then he broke my face... Like I always said. One day he's going to meet the devil. You know where he is now? Bangkok has millions of people my friend. You and your brother, you're lost to my world... You go. I'm gonna look around. See if I can find him. Sure--? Go on. Which way'd he go? His brother didn't pay. So? That's his problem. Now it's your problem. I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked-- You don't pay his debt - you don't enter. How much...? You seen Billy? Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking for him, yeah? Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him I'm looking for him... Who is that guy? Is he a cop? Is this your daughter? Yes. How could you? ... What? How could you let this happen? I didn't do anything. Well now's your chance. Do what thou will. You missed my turning. I live that way. What are you sorry for? I thought... You were there. He killed my daughter. I thought you were letting me... Answer the question. What are you sorry for? I killed the Westerner? And why did you do that? He killed my daughter. And why did he do that? How old was she? Fifteen... You knew what she was doing and you did nothing. How else can we make money? Four daughters. No sons. What else could I do? What did you expect me to do? You have to have pity on me. My daughter's just been murdered. This isn't about her. This is about your other three daughters and making sure you don't forget them. I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me. I'll change. I'll be a better man. I know. I set off running to wake from the dream My brother's rifle went into the sheen I kept on running Into the south lands That's where they found me My head in my hands The sheriff he asked me Why I had run And then it came to me Just what I had done And all for no reason Just one piece of lead I hung my head I hung my head. So now that they've caught him... What are they going to do? Come on. They haven't got a jail big enough. Look at the size of him. But he blew down all their houses. Would you want to keep a pet that could do that? How could they be sure he wouldn't do it again? "And so the king and the fairies that lived in the village said to the creature: this is your mark which will stay with you forever. If you ever try and blow down our village again, it will heat up until it boils your brains, for it has magical properties. Go in peace. Julian's not here mate. Fuck off... What is it? I can't deal with my brother right now... What? What happened? They found his body in a hotel room... Look, get dressed and I'll see you downstairs. Someone killed Billy... What do we do? For now... We wait. Hello Mum. It's me... Julian... Something's happened. I'm afraid the room won't be ready until four o'clock. ... It's policy Yes of course... Good afternoon madam, what seems to be the problem? I'm sorry madam... ... it simply isn't possible. Well I might be able to arrange something... There's really no need-- Room 300. Madam. I have to return to my station. Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't popular. You know Billy... He was eccentric. I'll make sure it gets done. Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Love is a burning thing And it makes a firey ring Bound by wild desire I fell into a ring of fire I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire You can't kill me. I'm a cripple. Who are you? What do you think you're doing? Get out or we'll call the police. Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee. Is your name Choi Yan Lee? Ask him why he killed my brother. You killed his brother. Big mistake fat man. Why'd you do it? He murdered my daughter. He says he killed his daughter. Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please. I'll give you anything. Anything you want. My daughters. My shop. Please. I've paid for what I did. Look at me. I've paid for what I did. Don't you see? What's he saying? He says... He says he's paid for what he's done. That he's been punished already. He told me to do it. Then he took my hand. Look. Who did that to him? The Angel of Vengeance... It's a lie - he doesn't exist... I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel of Vengeance. What's he saying? He's lying... Tell me. It's a story old women tell their grand children... 'The Angel of Vengeance' is supposed to come down from the heavens and judge the living... restore karma to the world.. How does he do that? Leads people to their destiny... That's the myth anyway. Ask him who cut his hand off. Do it. Who turned you into a cripple - and no bullshit this time. He says it was The Angel of Vengeance... The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He finds you. What's he saying? Pull yourself together fat man. If you don't talk sense I'll cut off your cock and shove it down your throat. I'm telling you the truth. He'll find you. What did he say? He said you don't find The Angel of Vengeance. He finds you... Are we going to kill him or what? What are you doing? Nothing... We're not going to do anything... Just leave him. Leave them all. It's a little bit more complicated than that Mum. Mum, calm down... I know, you always say that - but this is different... Maybe... Maybe Billy had it coming... ...because of what he did. Why? What if... What if it was The Angel of Vengeance? ...it - or he - restores karma and order in the world. He loves all humans... I'm not, I'm just... ... I've got to go. It's alright, yeah. Well, what with Billy not being around, it's tricky to be honest... Well, we're supposed to be moving five keys out the end of this week. But Billy's not here, is he? I don't know. Earlier today - we had the guy... The guy that killed Billy. Had a gun against his face. But then - nothing... Julian let him go. Now there's all this stuff about angels... I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him. I know how to do what needs to be done. That's all. There's this other guy... Might have been involved... We don't know who the other guy is yet... It's alright... Nothing. Nothing... I want you to meet my Mum. To show her... To show that I've got something here... Never come back - you understand me? Good... You're a fighter, kid. No doubt about it. Good luck with that. When did you last see him? Did he have any enemies? Who? This his phone? What is it? What do they want? No, I'll talk to them. Good morning officers. How can I help you? Never heard of him. I run a boxing club. Not much call for one armed men. What's this got to do with me? Then I guess you boys have got a lot of work to do - so have I, so if you'll excuse me... Sure, sorry. What do you want to know? With my mum... You want to speak to her? Am I suspect? This is not the man. I want you to find out who that guy is. Okay? Sure. No problem. Now. Why are you here? You're him... Aren't you? Who? The one who killed my brother. I love all living things. I restore karma. Is that why you came? I came here to kill you. What's stopping you? I don't know... Would you like me to tell you? You want the Angel of Vengeance. Yes. Why? Cause, all my life... I don't know. Yes you do. My mother wants me to kill you. And what do you want? ... I love violence. You want to fight me? Thai style. Then why's he going to fight the Westerner? And if he loses? View. Table. Yes. I like the table. I need to speak to you in Thai. I love you. You can't wear that. My mother's... Very particular about colours. She hates red. Come on, we'll get you something else. Come on. Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this way. Trust me. It's Mai, Mum. A year and a half isn't it? Mum, please... I saw her walking down the street. And I thought - this is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I just walked up to her and started talking. Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake. Leave her alone Mum. You've got her wrong. She's a good girl. Mum! The cops came by my club today. They're investigating a murder. The guy that killed Billy turned up dead this morning. I know it was you, Mum. He was there. He was with them. The Angel of Vengeance. No. I'm not going to kill him... This isn't about Billy. This is about me. All my life I've been running... - his name is Chang- Mum, don't talk to her like that. Me. Billy was a fuck up... He deserved everything he got. You know it and I know it. Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close... And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me-- -- So you sent him to me and what could I do? I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did. And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me. I'm only here 'cause of you. If you didn't exist, I wouldn't be here. I could've been someone, Mum. I was on my way... Don't you think I know that? And look at me now. I'm a front for a drugs smuggling. It's true... The whole thing's a front. Every day I see kids coming in with great potential. And every day I see kilos of heroin going out. And it's all because of you, Ma. You and the money and the drugs. That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you... ...that's right Mum. Think about it. With me gone you were safe. And it turned out to be good for business as well. All very convenient. Is that what happened with Billy? Did Billy become a problem like I did? Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here... Still, at least you didn't have him killed. I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum. Doesn't matter what you say. And do you want to know why? 'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the ring. Me versus him. I don't expect you to understand. Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you. I don't know... But maybe this time I'll win. Like you say, only God forgives. Maybe this time he'll forgive me... You never did, Mum. I'm fine. I'll be fine. In a minute. Sorry about that. Nice evening? Well, I don't know about that. Just been out here a while... Know how to get things done. But things are going to shit. Since Billy died, Julian's all over the place... Who? He's just a retired cop... It's not that simple... Is there somewhere we can go that's a little more private? You can't just going round killing cops here anymore. It's not that easy. I looked into it. Chang's a hard man to get to. None of the Thais'll go near him... There might be a way... But Julian can't find out... Seeing when it hurts. Didn't you like what I got you? What do you mean? Don't to be so hard on her. Her life hasn't been easy. Don't say that, okay? You don't know what you're talking about. She'd do anything for me. Don't go there. You don't get to judge her. You think she's bad? You should've met my dad. But he's not around anymore, and do you know why? Cause she loved me too much. How much do I owe you? ... so why do you want to kill a policeman? Policemen are good. They mind their own business and keep the streets safe. Stop people stealing my cars... Yes. It may effect the price. Revenge. Pricey... You're right. Most things are cheap in Bangkok. Especially life... We'll take care of this business for you. But it won't be easy and it won't be cheap. Do you want to die? Do you want me to kill you? For what you've done? No. Please. Don't kill me. Tell me why not. Tell me why I shouldn't shoot you as soon as you come out of that door. I'm sorry? Not good enough. It's my first time. I've never done anything like this before. I know that. You're wearing sandals. Hitmen don't wear sandals. Give me a reason. I'm begging you. Please-- You showed no mercy in there. Why should mercy be shown to you? I don't know... Yes you do. I don't know his name. But you know where he is. You know why we're here. He set it up. He knows who ordered the hit. He'll tell you. Don't talk unless I ask you to. Understood? Yes. Completely understood. Do you have anything to say for yourself? Good... You see? He knows. He's got the details. I told you he would. And I told you not to talk unless I asked you. Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd let me live. I never said that. This him? Where do I find him? I'm taking your phone. I forgive you... You better have a fucking good reason for doing this. Don't you know who you're fucking with. You live in my country. Can't speak my language... Too bad the one guy on my team that could speak English got murdered today. Can someone tell me what the fuck this guy's trying to say... Can you turn the music off. It won't be long, I promise. That's better. Thank you very much... You're under arrest... I need information. And you're going to help me. Whether you like it or not. It was an English woman - she wanted you dead... Why? Said you... murdered her son.... Who was she? I don't know... How did she know me? She asked for you by name... And what's my name? I see the way you look at my people. The way you abuse them with your eyes. For this, I take your sight. You live in my country, but you fail to learn our language. You don't even try. For this I take your tongue... You had opportunities. You could have chosen other paths... But you wouldn't listen... For this I give you silence... But above all this, I wish you love. And I will always love you. Fight. Come on. Break. It wasn't you, was it? You're innocent. What are you talking about? It's not your fault. Give it a break mum. Just... give it as rest. Yeah, well I lost. ... No... it didn't make a difference... No difference at all. Nothing. I don't feel anything at all. What do you want, Mum? What's wrong Mum? What's wrong? Who does? Chang? What did you do, Mum? What did you do? We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take him out... What happened to the princess' head? I thought the King banished them all from his kingdom? Nothing's wrong. Go to sleep. They're going to come after me... Okay. Good. Hello... She is in her room... You sure it's her? Yes... Good... see you very soon. What's your name? Listen Li Hom. You see anyone you don't like... You call me, okay? We're outside. I need you here. Right now. Okay. Let's make a move. What floor? What's it say? "Boxing Cop Hero Back From Grave". One of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah, came out of a coma that lasted for an entire year, waking up as if nothing had happened... Wife was really happy, blah blah blah... "It's hard to describe" Chang said, "but I do feel different." The Angel Of Vengeance. I'm the new guard. Please, go on in. Get out of the apartment... Wait... No way. Who said? My mother? What kind of a mother says that? If you've got a problem, talk to her. No. We're not doing it. You don't have to. I will. Only God forgives. And now mother - you will die... Easy... Where's is she? She's gone... Picked up Billy's body... She's gone home. Didn't she tell you? You alright mate? D'you want something? I'm so fucked... We're good mates aren't we? ... Yeah. I'm sorry about this Julian. I wish there was another way... What did she say? What did she promise you? Don't make this harder-- You've become a liability. You can see that, can't you? And now she wants me to take over. She wants me to be the favoured son. What am I supposed to say? I didn't want it to end like this. First I fuck your mother. Then I-- I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't want to leave... ... without saying goodbye. My mother... She made me what I am. And now I've got nothing. And they're after me. I got about twelve grand at the club... Should be enough to get us there. Set ourselves up. Disappear... Right now. Stay here. If I'm not out in five minutes... Go. Let's go. Get up. Get up. Now. I'm sorry... Do you have anything to say? Don't hurt her. Do you have anything to say? I'm sorry... What do you expect me to do? I don't know... I'm sorry. Come on. When you were born - what's the first thing you remember seeing? What do you remember? Dark... Darkness. And do you ever see light? No... Never. I am the Angel of Vengeance... I restore order and karma. I love all living things... ...I want you to walk away from here now... Do you understand? Good. Go with God.
