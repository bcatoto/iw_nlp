Scale the -- Dignan, I -- What? Dignan, I -- How? You're kidding. What's he in for? So how is it in there? We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs. Behind Bob's house. Oh, I'd say about -- It belongs to Bob's uncle. Nothing. Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he? We're not sure. We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed. Pretty much everything. I'm not kidding. Yeah. I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house. Like amnesia. Dignan, it's too late. There's not enough time. What are you talking about? What? Come on. You're kidding. Wait for Kumar. What are you doing? I don't know. It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm. Careful. Check his pulse. Get against the wall! Freeze! It's going back down. It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted. I don't know. I've got a great view up here. I can see all the -- Not at all. The place is totally deserted. I'm in position, Scarecrow. OK. Roger. Uh-huh? We all set? You're all clear. Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow. So do I. Yeah. As a girl. Do you like Inez? He was a nice guy. I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened. I don't want to be too much of a liability. I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow. Or I might end up with a broken nose. Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one. Yeah. It's pretty good. I did. Eleven fifteen. I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy. Shit, Dignan. Easy, Dignan. It's OK. No, Dignan. This isn't -- He doesn't want to fight. Dignan. Take it easy. He seems pretty good. You could give somebody a concussion. What time did he say to be here? What exactly is this place? Freezers? Who's Mr. Henry? What's Hinckley Cold Storage? What is it? You really hit a guy with a bottle? Sure. Who's in the car? When'd you get back? Shut up! I know that. But -- Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper. She needed it. $383. I had to give some to Inez. I know. We've got sixteen dollars. Our money situation is not good. I'm not. But there's -- I think we better go home. No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram. Yes, I do. Bob taught me. I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us. Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't. Shh. I don't know, Dignan. I just -- What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that. I don't think we can do that. What? We need a car. Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk -- I wish I'd been there. I can't believe he just jumped you. Why don't you come with us. We're going over to this bar if you feel like going. I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan. If you say so. Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't. Well, I didn't do it, did I? He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go. You were asleep. This morning. That's a long time to be in jail. He went back for his brother. Maybe he just went to the store. Where was it parked? But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died. After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again. This was in fourth grade. Don't worry about it, Bob. Bob? As long as he gets out OK. No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on. She's from Cuba. On the left. No. Not really. Inez speaks a little. No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English. What. What's the matter? Sure. Inez, this is -- This is Inez. Carmen. Anita. I thought you guys went to get your hair cut. No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that. Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right? Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up. It's not a plan. It's just -- I know. But once you get inside you're home free. It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it. Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts. Bob? OK. Go ahead. I'll just say it. Don't call me spoiled, Dignan. You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan. In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E. They obviously weren't designed for racing. Look at the treads on those. Dignan, those aren't running shoes. I keep it for emergencies. I don't want to use it. Because my mom gets the bill. I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan. Don't even say it, man. He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do. What do you think? Like he would find Dignan. One day. Like he meant it. What about what that guy said? Holy shit. Is that the manager? There's another stocker, right? Where's the manager? Calm down. Take a deep breath. Dignan! Stop! Dignan, calm down. No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours. Nothing. Go ahead. You think we're going to be chased? Just turn right here. Is it back in? But he didn't say anything. Eight dollars. Five, seven, eight dollars. It had an alarm. That sets it off. Dignan, it's got an alarm. Yeah, I saw it. That's not what I meant, Dignan. How was I ridiculing you? Where are you going? Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that? That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her. The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch." But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins? It's got a V-8, Dignan. She's really kind of hot. Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible. Who knows? That's why I filed it down. That's true. But what if they change the locks? Did you see what I meant about the window? No. This is he. He says. This is he. The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name. As part of his plan. I don't know why. No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones. He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode. Dignan, it's -- Right. The blond guy. Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser. Why'd you want to help us? Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry? Yeah. This is good. Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry? No. Bob did. Death. Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man. I don't want to die. Me? That sounds like Dignan. How'd he do? Did Dignan take the test? It feels good. That was a test? What do you mean? And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend. I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But -- What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person. I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe -- So do I. You mean a safecracker? I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage. You mean like techniques? Grammar. Thanks. It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle. Thanks. Nice to meet you. Temporarily. His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account. Who's got the car keys? Jesus, Bob. Let me see it. Did you drop it? What are you doing? Sure. Nothing. I was just asking. You OK, Bob? Give him a second. Yeah. Let's keep it -- Let's not even talk about it. Was Future Man adopted? Well, because you guys don't look alike. Were you adopted, Bob? I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality. Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper. Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend. At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days. I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank. It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down. Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea. No, I don't mind. Yes. You just got to stick with it. You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game. Why not? Bob, where you going? Is that OK? And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right? How long are they going to hold him? He looked too shaken-up. OK, Dad. Nobody does. Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil. Where you going? I hope not. There's a million places to hide around here. What was that? See you, Bob. Yeah. He said that. Let them fight. You could make your own cinnamon toast. Could you grow cinnamon? Hector woudn't do anything. In your backyard? How do you protect them? What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the -- Did you ever steal a car before? Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future. Future Man. God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does. What? What? God, yes. Like silk. Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States? Were you born in Mexico? It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you. Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms? Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you? How do you say nineteen? The front stairs. What do you mean? Abdul-Shabazz? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Applejack.Where were you? Where'd they come from? Feel this. I can knock a man out with a six inch punch. Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz. S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco? Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery? I hear you're a good thief. You're Anthony? What? You don't celebrate til it's over. I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet. Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac. We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him. What's he doing here? That's your friend Anthony? Is that him? Is that Buckethead? That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail. Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.It's in the driveway. We think Mr. Henry maybe -- Yeah. I didn't do anything. No. My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on. No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake? No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean? Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch. Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail. It was stupid. Jesus Christ! No. No. I wasn't adopted. Why do you say that? Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell. Why were you drawing the Holy Mary? Sixty days? That's pretty complicated for a senior prank. I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. You think I'm improving? Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time. I'm not playing any more golf. What? Anthony, I -- I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail. You think he got my license plates? Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car. I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now. Move. Phil probably provoked him. Where's he going? Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy. What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them. You'll probably have them the rest of your life. See you. Are you serious? Let them fight. I don't know. Sure, I guess. But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark. It's private property. Plus I have Hector. Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening. Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive. Who? The one and only Little Richard. Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets. Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts. Are you a fag? Wait a second -- Hold on -- Do they let you -- Do you have your own cell? Do you have your own room? What's that? Applejack drove. He's stuck between two floors. The elevator broke. I didn't think there was an alarm. I think so. He's having a heart attack or something. I couldn't hear anything. It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here. Everything OK? Scarecrow? I know it, man. Hang on. That's OK. That's OK. I didn't have any choice. I don't want to fight you, Dignan. Bullshit. I never agreed to that. Man, I don't want to go into this. I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to -- It's too bad about what happened on the road. Come on in. What you been up to? Hey, Dignan. How's it going? Dignan. Let's go. It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan. What's his name? What is it? You don't even know his name. His name's not Future Man, Dignan. Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God -- Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt. Give me the keys, Dignan. Watch me. I'm going back. Come on, Dignan. Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there. Well, obviously, we got to go back. We'll have to see when we get back. I don't know. I was just going to use it to see how much I had. The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana. They also found my two beam scale in the garage. Well, the marijuana crop is a good start. They said he's a drug dealer. The weed. My brother's in jail. See you in a little while. You're the one who kept saying ram him. It's registered in my mother's name. Is he chasing us? He wouldn't move. There were more than that. I told you they were there. That's true. That would give me nightmares. I don't want to talk about it. You really think he'll remember you? Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag! How much is there? Did we get it? This is natural. What happened? What are you doing? That's too bad. His name was Swifty? He electrocuted someone? Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you? He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him. I paid for it. I just want to see how much bullets it takes. I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute. OK. That's my responsibility. I'm going to take a look at this. Let's just go. Maybe she turned. Well, don't blame me. I told you. No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic. I warned you, Dignan. I told you he's crazy. I can't believe you said that. Yeah, but don't tell anybody. Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants. Good question. You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard. As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed. I'll just drive my car. It's true, Dignan. Yes. I did. Can you use a coaster. If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one. That never would of -- My brother. They are. No. I'm not allowed to drive those. Well, what do you think? I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me. John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home. Yeah. Hey, Clay. I'm working on it. No. I didn't run away. I went out of town. He said what? I'm trying. Hey, Jackson. How's it going?Ground defense. Social issues. Crime prevention. 26 weeks.Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready? Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember: Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll -- When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard. Shhh. Wait for my instructions. No. I'm not. I think I may have found a way out of here. He stole a tractor. What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to. Does it float? Where? How big is it? You're living on a sailboat? What do you mean? Why? You think Applejack knew? The grandfather clock? What'd he get? You got to be kidding me. He did? So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything? Can't remember shit. CRS. I don't think so. Yes, there is. Let's get organized. I'll get him. I'll see you there. I'll see you there. Applejack's stuck in the elevator? Come on, Kumar. Let's go. Come on. Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him? Where's Kumar? Who tripped the alarm? Help me move him. Nobody move! Applejack! What's happening? Who did that? What the fuck is that? What's happening? What's going on? Check the fucking elevator. It's moving. Stand by, Bird Dog. Good. It's supposed to be. Any activity? Take your second position. Hang on a second. Roger. Go ahead, Bird Dog. Yes. I do. As a person? He was all right. Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared. I don't think you will. Did that hurt? Next week we'll be drinking pi�a coladas. It's like we've finally arrived. God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry. OK. Mark that down. OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it? I'm sorry, Bob. What the fuck are we doing out here? No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault. Get out of the way. Bob! What do you think? Let me feel that. Right now. Right. Freezers. Imported foods. You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up. Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information. It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage. I want you to look at this. Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way. That's Applejack. You want to meet him? Ah. Couple days ago. What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the -- You're in love with the fucking housekeeper! That's what she is! A $500 tip! For the housekeeper! You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem? How much? Where's the rest? Sixteen dollars. That's not correct. You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred -- You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to -- Don't panic, Anthony. Bob taught you how to get electrocuted. You don't know how to hotwire. No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better -- Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans. She doesn't need to know. I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and -- Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she? I have an idea for that. I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place. Would of been nice. Can you hand me those french fries. OK. No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later. Well, the world is a little bit colder today. If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped. I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead. So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just -- If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself? He told you and you let him do it. Where was I? When'd he tell you? We said 48 hours. He took his stuff. He's gone. I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character. That coward. Son of a bitch. Right here. He's gone. He stole the car. Yes... It's true. They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life. Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead. See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him. See, now we've got a plan. Obviously. That's a given. Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road. He needs to hire an attorney. No kidding. Which one was that? They don't? Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name? What the fuck is going on here? May I have a word with you, please? Jerry. And this is my associate Cornelius. Hi. No. We didn't. Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not? Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car. True. Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over. Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit. Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony. No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know. You owe me fifty bucks. On your marks... Get set go. I'll say it. You were spoiled rotten. That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled. Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes. Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those. What about them? Yes, they are. See if mine are in there. Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that... Well, then cut it in half. She's not going to notice, Anthony. Why not? Can I get that credit card from you? I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got -- Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved. What's wrong with him? Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you. Yeah. I swear to God. In a very quiet voice. Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you. We got it. We got it. Unlock that door. Check the aisles. We know there's another stocker. Where's the other stocker? You're right. You're right. You're out! I'm not working with either one of you! Anthony, give me the fucking gun! Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony! That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say -- OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be -- Loop around real fast. Yeah. Hang on a second. That's not bad. Holy shit. What'd I tell you? Yeah, I heard that. No, just do it real quick. I'll meet you down there. I don't think so. Just reach on in. I'm lookout. Did you see that? You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying. I don't appreciate you ridiculing me. Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it. Every valuable item in the house was on that list. I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that. Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at. What do you think the cops have? She's an attractive older woman. See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be -- Would they do that? Kind of. Except we've already got the keys. This is he? What does Starsky say? See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream. Why? I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony. Plus where's Huggie Bear? OK. That's wrong. Making Hutch David Soul? What color hair does he have? Bob! Get back in position! True. Well, this isn't really a party per se. Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack? Wait. Did he see us? Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going. Yeah. That's Anthony. Wait a second. We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this. Just settling an old score. You might say revenge. There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand. Now! Here we go. I don't really want to talk about it, Bob. No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl. We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells. That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit. I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease. Run. Run. Let's go. Where's Applejack? Take him to the car, Bob. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that? Is he breathing? Let's go! What's wrong with Applejack? Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position. Stand by. Bird Dog? Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there? Yeah? Jesus Christ. Come on, Bob. Look. We want you on the job. I'm sorry, Bob. It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother. Come on! All right! Backyard! Right now! Bob, you're lying! You said 48 hours! I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob? Right. It was extremely stupid. Yeah. It is. Not a whole lot, Bob. Not bad. Anthony. Bad news. You've got a beautiful walk, Bob. That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out. OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid. Just get in the car, Bob. Yes, I do. I know it's not. Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that. Don't threaten me, Bob. I can't do that, Bob. Good luck, since I got the keys. Not in that car you're not. Don't "Come on, Dignan" me. This could be a trap. Bob, that makes no sense. What do you mean get back? Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional. How long has he been in there? So tell them the truth. What do you use it for? Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale. That could be anybody's. I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man? But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man? What are you talking about? You can go first, Bob. Bob. Are you coming? What the fuck possessed you? I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates. I don't know. Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for? In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten? So it's my fault? Way to go, Bob! Bob, I've got nightmares. I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!" Bob, will you please listen? No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose. No. I was calm. Don't count it. Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light. That's good. Keep it at forty. Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural. I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose. You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did. Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know. It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated. You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year. Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. God DAMMIT. What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead! Bob. That's your domain. Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway. I think we might of scared her. Where'd she go? I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her. I know that now. He's a fucking psycho. You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild. The guy is fucking insane. What did I say? What was that all about? You're paranoid, Bob. If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them? Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob. How much could you grow? Realistically. Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car? OK, Bob. You stole a Trans-Am. What are you talking about, Bob? Let's cut the bullshit. He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare. So who's going to know? I thought your parents were in Italy. Not even for emergencies? I don't know, Bob. What about one of those? Did you hear that? Hand to hand combat? And what does that cover? How long do you have to go? Well, I think -- Yes. We're just going over a few things. Is he good? Oh, yeah. The grammar? What do you mean grammar? I don't know. Are you in, Anthony? This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry. What can we do? What's the story? He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember? Don't worry about it. Who? Applejack? You got that? Where is he? Where is Rob? In the cash register. Step away from the door. Well, I left some money in there. Where's that guy going? It's locked. Mr. Henry? Right. Fuck you. You a Hoto. No. Just pool. What? Guess I'll get another Tecate. I don't know. Got a little lucky. Sure. No, my friend knows her. No. I just have short hair.I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section. Where? He left his sweater. We're closed, sir.Right. I'm sorry. You've got a reputation to think about. I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission. I might have mentioned it. Fancy seeing you here, Bob. Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting. How's that 700 bucks coming? Nice to meet you. Well, we'll see you later, Bob. What? John Mapplethorpe. How are you. Hi.He said you ran away from home. Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home. This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart. You keeping out of trouble? How you doing, Bob?Can't get it. It won't... Why did he go that way? Where did he go?No, it's not. Come on in! How's the weather down there? No. Me no Hoto. Tecate? You Hoto? Fight. You know. Si. Tecate. You like to fight? She is a good looking woman. Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita? You a good pool player. You like Chicanos? She Chicano, yes? Is that your chiquita? Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me. Absolutely. We're renegades from despair. It's an esoteric journey. But you're thieves. It's what you are. I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend. Anthony, I'm petrified. Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome. I love palindromes. The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini? Exactly. Woah. Are you afraid? No, that door over there. I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die? Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses. Yes, he did. How does that feel? Take a deep breath. The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score. Congratulations. You passed the test. Hold it. As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business? You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it. Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here. I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan? Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan? Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body. Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali. Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job? Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that? Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success? The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar. You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent. It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this. That's a sharp jacket. This is my business manager, Rowboat. No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this. Why? You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow? Join the party, fellas. He's damn good. You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged. Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys. The basic grammatical rules of robbing. Is he in? This is no good. Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack. Who are you? Pleasure to meet you, John. The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness. The world needs dreamers, son. Good to know you, John.Open the door. I'm coming aboard. You said it was just you and your son. What was that? What is your purpose in Mexico? How many with you?Vamanos! Yeah, follow us. It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new. You like the car? Twenty-eight. Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you? I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos? No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning. I don't know, one place's as good as another. Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?I meant me, my son and my daughter. Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom. Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight. Just my son and I. To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door! Thank you, son. It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two... I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass. Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions. Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this. What about Kate? If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go. Have you forgotten about your sister? I'm gonna try and get us across the border. I have no idea. I'm exhausted. Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this? We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel -- Kate, Scott? Amen. Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did. What's this stuff? You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time. Yep. What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness. In the Winnebago. I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw. Okay, does anybody here know what's going on? Now, is your shit together? To yours. Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won? The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it. Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won? Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too. What are you going to do? He backed down. Why are you so agitated? No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now. Pass. Out of the stew pot and into the fire. Then? We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go. I don't have the slightest idea. I'm telling you, don't hurt her. I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico. If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him. You won't let him touch her? No, I didn't. Yes. You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth. How do I know you'll keep your word? Yes. I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business. Yes. I was a minister. Real McCoy. Yes. Yes, they do. Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on. No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died. Auto wreck. Yes, she is. In heaven. My wife. Scott and Kate. Yes. My children are not going with you, and that's that. If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you. Not a chance. On the dresser. It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right. What's this about, money? Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese. He's my son. Jacob. No! Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One... Not good enough, swear to God. Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four... Scott? No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead. About two hours from now. It has a bed. That's all I care about. It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house. There's nothing wrong with this place. Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead. Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore. I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore. Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point? That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting. I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed. You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle? They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode. Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage. What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya? Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind? Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty. Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight. Not even for lunch? Hot goddamn day!Six-fifty. Knock yourself out. That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they? You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place. Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public? Whatsamatter? I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave. Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long. I never said help us! I wasn't scratching! What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything! He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up. What do you want from me? I did what you said.Best in Mexico. This bar is for bikers and truckers only. You, get out! This is a private club. You're not welcome. You can't come in here.You asked me if I would -- What you said to me in the room. In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will. Mexicans. Mexico. What? Sure. We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won. How are you? Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us? Yeah. It don't look together. No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother. Where are you? Where are you right now? You're lookin' green. You know what you look like? I'm lookin' scared? That's what you think? Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription. What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see. Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair! Far out. Where are my glasses? We are? What? Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up. Really? I did? Yeah, I think so. What happened? Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now. I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did? Or what? Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks. You meant that, but you meant the other, too. Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut. You just called me a fuckin' nut. What does that mean? They're gonna search the van. I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea. This isn't gonna work. What? Yes, Seth, I understand. Yes. Seth, if you were me -- What? It's not your fault, it's her fault! Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person. There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do. She's in the other room. What? How do you know? Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down. They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours. Didya look at the border? What'd ya see? Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been? All I'm saying -- Did you even to try to negotiate? Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent. Feels good. How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch. Do they have a waterbed? Do they have an X-rated channel? Do they have cable? What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us. Gotcha! Yeah? I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!" You believe me don't cha? Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face. And I saw him mouth: He signaled the Ranger.Why did they block the door again? Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name. You don't believe in suicide. He's running the show. If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will. They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance. Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance. They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us. No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there. What are you gonna do? What's this guy's problem? Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico. Why do you want to stop? The truth hurts. Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we? -- see this, television! -- you got your sink -- Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen -- He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together. He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them. You could take their head off. Yeah, it's mine. Okay, I'll have one.So let's do it. So do I just follow you? I said new, this is an '90. Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty. You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start. Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are. Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead. Have you ever been there before? Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place? I promise. I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can. My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks. You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit! Did he...? Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else? I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix. In other words, no. Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross? You too, preacher? Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires. Forever together. To your family. What did you call me? I never said do what I do, I said do what I say. I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head. He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear. I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too. Suit yourself, more for me. Scotty? Why not, against your religion? Who else? Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club. Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going. Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right. Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple. As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say? You best better get it done, Pops. Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border. Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you. Kate, honey! I can handle Richie, don't worry. Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning. Didn't like it, did ya? Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya? Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit. I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy. I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit. Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct? Why'd ya quit? Was? As in not anymore? You're a preacher? I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy? Is this real? Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they? Died instantly? Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her? How'd she die? She's dead? Where is the little lady? Who's this? Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is. What are their names? Good. Your old man's all right, he just saved your life. That's not fuckin' that... this is fuckin' this. Go sit over there. Sorry, I need everybody. Come again? Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front. Where are the keys to the motor home? Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid. You two, Simon says sit the fuck down! It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance. Oh, well, excuse me all to hell. How does that happen? You don't look Japanese. What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags? Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face. What's your name? See ya. I'm sorry. You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you. Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper. How many bullets left, kid? Anytime. Daddy's dead. Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them! Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory. How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two? In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it. Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please? You must have a bible in here, don't cha? You damn well better. Go. Do you believe me? You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said? The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9. Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie! You callin' him a liar? He says you were scratching. Were you giving that pig signals? I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood." Letting him use your toilet? No store does that. I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order. Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here? What dya mean? Whiskey! Scarred for life, that's how I am! Well, then ask her, dumb ass. Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us? Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together. My shit is together. I'm here with you. What do you mean? How? No, Richie, what do I look like? That's what you look like. That's how you're lookin', Richie. It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit. When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses. They broke when you fell. Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples? We are... "South of the border down Mexico way." Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans. Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay? Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. I don't know, you just passed out. You okay? This ain't the time. Keep your voice down. This ain't the time, Richard. Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool. No, I didn't. What? As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine. Duly noted. Now, shut up. Shut up. It's gonna work just fine, Richard! Yes, Seth, I understand. Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes. This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand? Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am? Is it me? Is it my fault? No. That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful. Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you? What the fuck is she doin' there?! What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!? Where's the woman? I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and -- Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us. I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit. Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say? Cops. Sight seein'. -- This conversation is over. These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter". You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent. That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us. I'm gonna go get the money. I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay? How's it feel? They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need. No. No. He didn't recognize shit. What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave. One... Two... Three. When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him! Richie? You okay? Shut up and start the car. Start the car. What the fuck is wrong with you -- What the fuck was that about? He needs our help! Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man. He's a preacher. Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on. In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours. How 'bout you? You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine. Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?I would say that's a very safe assumption. This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk. We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best. Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice. For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo- -now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so- The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo- As are they all. He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about. -you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay- On that I choose to remain dubious. Two are dead now in two nights. Oh, you're a doctor now, too? -malaria epidemic; very sudden. How; we don't know where they are? I think it's been a pleasure. Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes. I am a man of peace. You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.Understand, I had help- Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair? Told you you'd hate me. I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him. Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it. Professional hunters may be the answer. I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. And it worked? Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it? Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him. This is supposed to be salvation? What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here? What have they done besides kill Starling? How many have they killed? -what's the surprise in that, this is Africa? Well, I need to speak to him. Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I've brought them. Is he here? I do need to see Starling. But overall, you're pleased? So work must be going well? Lovely sound- they seem happy. How could it be? I hate Africa. Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me. But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment- -don't make me break you. You'll need your confidence, I promise you. You've never built in Africa. -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that? Games? Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself. One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me. John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont. Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you- -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree. Winning personality, heaps of charm?Then why do it? You're certain about tomorrow? But you don't seem excited. I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- -but what are you going to do about it? Who else would hire me? Beat you to it, didn't I? Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer. You intend "sorting this out" tonight? -then he feasted on him, starting with his feet- Well, he got away, didn't he? Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off. Nigel and I don't like each other much. I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it." That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack. I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived. Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that? That's a terrible idea-I assure you we came close many times- -I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving- That is correct. Nothing. We have hunted since childhood.-careful, Abdullah- I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo- -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it- Morning, friend, glorious day. You think so? Fine. It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all. You think you matter? -Beaumont is on that train- he matters- -oh, sing a different song, Abdullah- -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is- There is no reason for fear. Let me see the sick. You were contracted to work- -not a time for modesty, Bob- Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead. All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then? You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine- -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here? What? In point of fact, it didn't. But I'm convinced the theory is sound. I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger. In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off- -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor. I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door. It hasn't been that simple so far. It's what the natives are calling the lions- -two lions have been causing trouble- Yes he is. Starling? Truthfully? There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa. Don't they, though? Pleasant journey? You won't have the chance. Any further words of encouragement? Then I've a train to catch. I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes. But I have in India- every country presents problems. I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge. My wife is the game player in the family, sir. You don't enjoy killing, do you? Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey. With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. Then why do you stay? I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving. What if there are complications?- -well, it's just... ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time- It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments. We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena. -well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing- Not once?- you didn't hit it once?- All right- you'll spend your nights inside. You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear. Very good indeed. You mean nobody died? But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon. Samuel? Second death? Where?- That's what the books say... I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size. Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks. All right- thee second embankment will go there. Possibly. How lucky we are. -true enough- but without the comedy relief. So that's what a lion looks like. Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one. What? -you'll have to deal with it, Nigel. Shhh. I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life. Might be exciting for you. We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up. Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl. And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria? Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? Does he speak English? Have you got that in writing? Beaumont says it's to end slavery. Almost three hours. But I've been getting ready all my life. Just that they fart through their mouths. Must make kissing something of a gamble. The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young. He just gave me his "monster" speech. Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came. How many do you think they've killed? Why? You think they'll come then? Why? Was that supposed to make me feel better? I'll have to. I'll be bait alone? They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing. It may be tight. Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water? They're only lions, yes? Their den? Have you ever seen anything like this? What happened to them? You just got hit. The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions- -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... But of course yours worked. Goddammit! Have you ever failed? ...don't know... ...misfire... it jammed... It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting. I can try. Have you got it? That's very considerate. Somehow I guessed. Actually, no. We need to talk. Got me out of trouble. I didn't have a chance to thank you. It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- Where is it? He has children? I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it. Thank you. Why does he need you by him? You've known him long? You like him, don't you? I have to ask- why do you need me? I do, actually; very much. I expect so- it's from my wife. Thank you, Samuel. Look out, Samuel, here it comes. Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night. Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two. And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge. Nonsense. What are they looking at? Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad? This is more difficult- The workers don't get on? It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job. Why do the workers look unhappy?We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion. First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night. Starting now, we attack them. Excellent decision. Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning. Am I to take it you want to live? You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil. No hints, Samuel. Then we agree. I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here. But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool. Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now. -is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know. Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me. The most of any lions... a hundred...? Probably more. Johnny...? Because I think they're after you. Good luck. It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you. I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me. Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. Can you control your fear? Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there. Take the others to the water tower for the night. Don't they have to be?... Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this- -they're doing it for pleasure. I got big. In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place. But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem. One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone. Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed. It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I suppose... ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound. Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea? Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once. It's all right. Stay ready. They know it's there. Only in life... Think about something else. Has it ever done that before? You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck. Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. Samuel says you killed a lion. The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers? No, but you do- -see, you were needed after all. And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn. I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that. I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out- -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you. All right- let's go into battle. I'm Redbeard. Let me save time- you are the engineer; you are in charge; you're sorry I'm here. Right so far? Good- because I am not an engineer, I don't want to be in charge, and I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems? Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. What did I do? Hold your son high. My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell. Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You? Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now. You two will sleep beautifully in your tents. And stay there. Not even close. What happened? Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men. Four should do it. Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?Afraid of lions. Underneath. Somewhere. Once... Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once. He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times... ...he knows I am afraid of lions... Since his beard was red. Oh yes. But it takes time. Soon. You give me hope, John. Do you love her? Good news? For you. Oh yes, I think so. We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night. You don't know what Tsavo means, do you? It means "slaughter"... You- they cannot believe you're still here. I am also liaison between these two. Did it look like this in your mind? Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly. Because they are here. Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world. Come, John- to the bridge. Some mysteries should not have solutions. Help finish the railroad. Where do you go next? And where will you sleep beautifully? Did you ever see a lion that size? Why so many? They will want a lot of money. How many cattle? I don't believe you had a mother.-please- you needn't be so graphic- A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it? You never had it. We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor. My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands. I like the blood, is that strange? What a good week. -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now. There's even less of him than of Singh. But you said they were always old. John, it will not be easy. You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just- -"there." Aren't we full of ourselves today? I think it's because of the lion. With much more on the way- -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground- ...one shot... Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions? John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but- That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but- I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse. The pain is actually quite unbearable now. Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced. Why not, indeed! I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way? I don't suppose I could watch. You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"? I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway." Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain. Finish your tour? I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts. We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes- -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me. Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls. I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here? Anything special about them? Don't much like them. That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse. And I'm one of his defenders. Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. Many thanks. You're Patterson, yes? Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.Did it work? If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows? We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off. Better be. You left me for him. You still believe in him. A toast to the end of the world. Just my luck, no ice. You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons? He's not going to listen to me. I want you to leave with us. Right now. Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds. Walk to the window. Right in front of you. Connie, don't hang up. It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked... I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack... You don't understand. You have to leave Washington. You have to leave the White House. Checkmate. Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike. That signal. It's a countdown. Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction. Just do it! Tell her to get the kids and leave town. What're you talking about? Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening? I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out. Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely... No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed. You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch. There's good news and bad news. Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite. Did you try to switch to transponder channels? What the hell is this? It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency? Thanks, Pops. A cold? Of course. Pops, you're a genius! We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore. I'm making a mess. Dad, please... Moishe, please, don't talk. He wasn't the President then. Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face. Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House. Perfect, she's using it. She didn't take my name when we were married. College nickname. I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook... She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname... This, pops, is every phone book in America. Dad... They don't know this. Can't this thing go any faster? That's okay. You're driving. You still got the Olds? Pops! Three years. Dad, don't start. You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose? I'm thinking. Doesn't matter. Game's over. You as well. It's not me. They're overriding the system. Get us out of here! Must be thousands of them. What are they doing? What the hell are you doing? I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying. We'll meet you there. I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered. I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us. Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course. Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing? Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air. We've been collecting planes from all over but... We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready. Better than we thought. Yes, Sir. We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir. If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours. And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis. ETA with target; four minutes. The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact. She should be shortly. But Mr. President... Sir, what happens if they do become hostile? With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side. With their shields down it might be possible. How long would their shields be down? Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots! You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!? My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs... We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication. More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far. Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately. That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki. It's doing what? How do you know? A meteor?Stevie... I can't... We're already over Mach 2! I didn't even see them fire! Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened. I hear you. That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm. Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it... I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?Then what? A countdown to what? Not really... Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta? What happened? Haven't you been watching? Can you believe this? Huh? Oh, good, good. ...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man. That's the good news? And the good news is you won't charge me. What's the bad news? We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there. Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple? So sue me. Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on. What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?But I gave you some this morning. Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while? Just take it, dick head. Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine. You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine. Stop it. How' he doing? There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them. I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way. For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who? We're leaving, don't try and stop us. They let you out? Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now? It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad. All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think. Think nothing of it, Spanky. Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President. Punched the President? Oh my god. I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son. What'd I say? David, you're drunk. This I can see. David, David! What the hell are you doing!? What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing! It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick? You punched the President in the face? Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he? You can do that? It's perfect the line is busy? You try Martin? Spunky? Not listed, huh? You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed? What the hell is that? All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you. And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman? You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything. It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell. You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license. The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures. Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy. I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers. David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but... You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose. So think already. What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced. Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet. Hey, you wanna see them? See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting! Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me. Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together. Cool. I wish I could do more but we're moving out. Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.Then get them out of there. I could have evacuated the cities hours ago. You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to? He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy. Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia? Roger. Where's it headed? Grey, you read me? I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong. Then find them. But what, General? And our troops here? How're we doing? Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them. We're being exterminated. And our forces? Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed? Where are they? Any news on my wife? Is my wife in the air? And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately. General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can. Then God help us. I had a feeling you would. I said call them back. Call them back. Deploy. Why the hell wasn't I told about this place? Above American soil? We're leaving. So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't. Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover. I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives. I'm not leaving. Can they be killed? What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing? People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it! Yes. What do you want us to do? Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance? Can there be peace between us? And before here? Where do your people come from? Where is your home? Why did you people come here?Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration? We should leave too. Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me. You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father. Just what the hell do you think you're doing? You sure? I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.It's... slowing down, Sir. Well, er... it's slowing down. No Sir. Definitely not.I don't hear no fat lady. We're loose! Nice meeting you. What're you doing? I can't shake her free. Looks like they're preparing the invasion. Just getting a feel for her. Great. Oh shit, we're late. Butt-munch. Yeah, but what an entrance! I should have done this a long long time ago. Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry. You know me... You know how I like to make a big entrance. Butt-munch. Yes, I am. Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight. Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base. What? They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this? Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away. He's doing a good job. Jimmy, stay with me. So push it! Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining. Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in. Damn it! I shouldn't have left her. Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings. I thought you said you were doing to break it off. How to kiss ass.I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore. That'd be cool! He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right? I don't need it. It's all fuzzy.I look forward to reading your report. It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over. Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment. Good hunting. Hayes out. The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own. But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?I believe so. The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow. No. There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range. No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it... Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty... No... no, please... you cannot... Yes... I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated. My creator did not intend for me to experience these things. I wish to... go back to the way I was. I... do not want this... That is not true. They have tried to help me. No. I will not betray my friends. It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure. I do not know what you are referring to. It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference. You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...? Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five. According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063. The vortex is collapsing, sir. I have helm control. It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface. We are approaching the Terran System, Captain. The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective. Dispersive armor is holding. That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals. Who are you? I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed. No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I. I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse... Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer. The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology. So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage. Bag him. We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them. Is it Japanese? How long has he been unconscious? What did you do to the batteries? Outside, around back. Next to the water tank. I told you, there's no -- Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted. "APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing? Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help. Captain, the Enterprise! There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects! The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort. I'm on it... The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive. The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention. Ready to deploy the warp nacelles. Ignore it. We'll be fine. Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark... Entering the upper ionospere... Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms... What's still there? No... the door's too thick. Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go now . Captain -- Tell her to go back to Resurrection. Always am. They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings. It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel. Maybe... Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos. We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing. Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this... This used to be the throttle valve assembly. It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship. It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface. Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched. Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in... I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below. I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something. This must be it. I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters. Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.Initiate pre-ignition sequence. Main bus... ATR setting... I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it. It'll be tight, but we should make it.We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain. Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet? Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp. Absolutely. Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I... Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that. If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana. Not yet. How did Doctor Almack react to that? You actually performed surgery...? I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right? Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got. Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him. I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them. It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history. As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital... It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding. It's Cochrane. I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century. Yes... We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead. Montana. Energize. Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time. Give me a damage report on that missile silo. What year is it? Contact Starfleet Command. Where's the Sphere? What? Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship? Ready quantum torpedo. Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery. Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he? Where? Where's the battery room for the hospital? Juice? Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories. We're crossing the threshold! Their com system must still be down. Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me? One minute to warp threshold... Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second. Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot... Engage. Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading. As they used to say... all systems are go. There's a red light on the second intake valve. Altitude fifty kilometers... Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room... Then we'll just have to assume it's still there... It'll have to wait. Come on. This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence. She's a very... determined woman. Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in. We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed. Phoenix to control. Initiating five minute countdown... mark. Ready to make a little history? Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself? If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them. We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... There must be some design schematics... blueprints... Can you reconstruct the throttle valve? Picard to Enterprise. Enterprise, please respond. There should be some kind of manual release... I have the password right here. There should be an access hatch nearby... Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive. How serious is the damage? Let's go. Understood. Keep me informed. I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man. From another planet. Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears. There is no invasion... Invasion. What do you want? Something wrong with that? I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst. Yes. I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing. It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer. There's a few of us left. California. San Francisco. Oh... here and there. You know how it is. Yes. Jean-Luc Picard. Oh... yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...? This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary. That's impossible. No... I'm from France. No. It's a lot further than that. I have to... I am not a thief... Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes. We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon. A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like. Some. Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's. We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and -- I'd say you already have. It can't wait until tomorrow... Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important. How did you know about that? Were the two of you... involved? Are you always sucha good judge of character? What makes you say that? What? I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in -- No... but sometimes I feel that way. What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs. I can try. Did you take any other pictures of the rocket? Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric. I'm very sorry. Cochrane? Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that -- Yes, he is. Track their weapons fire. We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line. Life signs? On screen. Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them. Onscreen. Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes. Fire! Go to manual. Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status? Steady as she goes. Data, set a course for that vortex. Time travel... they're attempting time travel... Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command! Fire. Unless you'd like to stay. Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex? Return to our own time? I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge. Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian. In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship. Life signs? On screen. Report. They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history... Worf... torpedo... now!Ready. Active. Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again. What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect. Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.No, sir. Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back? Yes, sir. Good luck, sir. And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one beaming down... Captain? Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line. Looks like they damaged the silo... We're still in Earth orbit. They did it... they assimilated Earth. We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex... Emergency override! Report! Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes! I'll keep that in mind. Right. Just a little queasy... I guess I'd better get it right the first time. Agreed. Options? They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications... Computer -- thermal enhancement. What are they doing? We have to cover both possibilities. We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in. We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective. What the hell is happening, Worf? What? Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible. Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious. Hold that thought. I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll... I remember it made me sick. Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...? Where the hell are they going? All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay. Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg. The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields. Report.What the hell happened down there, Worf? Worf? Is something wrong? Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves? Riker here.I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off. We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done. Data... are you sure you're all right? Did you know her? But how? Western hemisphere... North American continent... Captain...? Population... thirty-five billion... All Borg. Incoming transmission from the Borg. Aye, sir. I have to admit there was a moment there when -- What are you suggesting? To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay... They're bypassing Engineering... Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with? Wil... Data was down there. Someone...? We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's -- They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period... Even Data? Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems? Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana. Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes. Aye, sir. Target locked! Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed. Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface. Hull integrity down to thirty percent... Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position. Aye, sir. Port battery, ready sir! Nothing. We've lost Bridge control! Understood! And Commander, whatever you do... do not vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant. Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship. Are you alright? The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation. You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation. There's only one torpedo left... Destroy the deflector dish. We have to stop them from sending that message. They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae... They're re-routing the deflector power conduits... They appear to be modifying the deflector dish. To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge. We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data. It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room. A ship-wide decompression has been initiated! I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success. Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes. Commander... we have a problem. Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back. Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room. There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless. Worf to Bridge. What kind of message? Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols... There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials. Target... No response. I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.You're money, baby. Don't do it, Mike. You should call your Grandmother. Are you calling Her? You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges... That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it. Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this. Ever since I've known you. You've been through worse. You have to put things in perspective. Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if... Skipping message. End of final message....then ask where you met her... They're out of Glenlivet. Why not? This place is dead anyway. ...and even then... I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore... No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway... Oh. You know. I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you... ...I heard it took four days to light for that shot... Hey, man. At least it's Disney. I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking... You haven't told then, huh? Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it? Hi.Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables. You want this in black chips. You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it. You have to lay it on the table. On the table.Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off? Shut up. Shuddup. No. Stop, come on. Enough. I've got to use the phone. Okay. I'll think about that. Bye. It didn't feel that way. I don't know about that. You're right. I know. I know, I know. Shit. Thank you, Nikki. Well, thank you...? Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever. Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago. Are you sure? Maybe... Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas... Yeah. ...Monday nights? I host an open mike... You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico? Thanks. You like laughing at the misery of others? Oh... a Cavalier. I'm sorry? How are you ladies doing this evening? No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to... Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either... Uh, if the guy wants to. Anything. I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want. What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom. What what? What advantages? Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single. It does. It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it. Yeah. Tell me about it... How was it hard? Just like that? Not lately. My reputation seems to have preceded me. I like quiche. Like the quiche? I'm Mike. Hi. Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like. Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"? Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number... What else is going on? You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies. ...you might get cut out. ...not until you book it... ...and boy does it hurt when they ask. ...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East. Did you, um, did you get that pilot? Charles! What's up, man? I'm a comedian. No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night. Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it. Could you believe it? Do you have anything smaller? Sure, that'll be fine. Huh? Oh... right. Uh, I don't want to bet it all. Sorry? Sorry, it's just that... Can I check my messages? I have a calling card. Six years. We were a rebound, and we lasted six years. Why not? I know, but she did. She's with someone else now... Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between... Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet... There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand... Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy... No... Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on. That's okay. I wanted to talk to you. Hi. Sorry about that. No, no. Hold on. Yeah, hold on. Lorraine? Hello? ...get the hell outta here already... ...The red piece of shit over there... ...Nah. I'm right across the street... ...It's really getting late. Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card. Why, you like the duck with the cigar? ...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into... When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan. If and when I get a real gig I'll call you. Yeah. And an actor. That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you. I would love to see you again sometime. Listen. I had a great time. Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you. I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye. Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call... Hi. Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French? ...the Michelin commercial... Why didn't you call? Really? I thought you met someone else. What kind of things? Yeah? Fine... I guess. You? ...Six months. You always know the right thing to say. Wow. You wanna grab a bite? You miss the pain? How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting? Then why won't she call...? I didn't make it... They turned you down? How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing? What's dumb about it? I think I'm gonna move Back East. I'm such an asshole. Uuuuugh! What's the point? Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea... No. Just O.J. Thanks, man. I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man? No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later. I got to at least try once. There are so many beautiful women here. He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though. ..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat. Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan. Well, let's hit that party. ...yeah, a month ago. Charles and me went to network on this pilot together. Ah, there's the rub... Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts. I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it. I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool. ...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please. I'll get a Dewars rocks... Kinda money, huh? ...That's probably a more appropriate analogy. It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism... It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front. To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven. Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry. What'd you get? I don't know. Eight or Nine. What do you have? A Pluto call back? You want to hit the town tonight? I've decided to get out there. Go ahead. Play it out. The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that. I didn't mention her once today. I don't talk about her that much. What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it? Why? Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today? You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now. What do you want? You're tall. Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town. You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role. It's a gig. Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her. ...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps. Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time... There's the rub. Unless she comes back first. Right... Wait, what do you mean? So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her. Well that sucks. So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her. So what's the difference? So I don't call either way. But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her. And what if I don't want to give up on her? She's really special, guys. Believe me, I know what that's like. Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving? Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it. What are they doing here? ...It was six months, and she didn't dump... You live in such a fantasy world... Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it... You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg? You asshole. She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself... I can't believe you. Not well. Who threw this party, anyway? ...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese... He's trying to be an actor. So, what? Eleven? Give me the money. I'll get it. Make someone bleed. You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game. Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again. Wow, I guess you were home... Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along? Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months... Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry. This is Mike. 213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something... ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry. I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment". Coffee... Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right? Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly. Guys... Guys... I got it under control. I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight. It's not like that... I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good. What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot. So, two days? Tomorrow? How long do I wait to call? You're not just, like, fucking with me? Please, don't mess with me right now... What a surprise. That doesn't matter. You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up. I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me. I'm sorry. She didn't notice. What? Which one? How you guys doing? ...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights... ...the Copa, in New York... Yeah. You met him once. What time's this party tonight? You guys are such assholes. No. What? That was the best part of the old game. This version doesn't have fighting? I hear she's getting real fat. I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something. He drives a carriage. Selling scrap metal. ...a day... Don't remind me. I just need some time... I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better. That was different. Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you. I just don't think she liked me in that way. Yeah, a good friend. I don't think so. She didn't like me, anyway. I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag? She was hot. Christy was nice... Sorry about interrupting... She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie? Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man. I gotta use the phone. No, man. I need to use the phone. So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."? ...So give me the fuckin part... No! Not the camera guy! No! "Big Brother", "Little Brother"? What was the part? Well... we're not in Kansas anymore. Whatever. I'm Mike... and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent". We didn't do so bad after all. I hope so. We gotta go soon. ...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though... "Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."... I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head. I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect... I know. I know. That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit. ...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to... It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy... It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know... That's bullshit. I don't know... She likes you. I'm too tired for this. Let's just go. You think so? I don't think so. What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back? Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it. She was smiling at what an asshole you are. I can't believe what an asshole you are. That was so demeaning... What an asshole. What an asshole. Let's go. Let's just leave. You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry. Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop? Yea, how much? Thanks for clarifying that. But I lost! How can you say always?!? I'm just saying, not in this particular case. Yeah? Well obviously not always! ...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money... I know, but... What?!? Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching. That's where we make our scene. The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free. Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around. First let's see what happens if we play it cool. You're gonna screw up our plan. It doesn't matter... That's not cool. Cut that shit out. Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift. They're all skanks. This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps. This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland. Pirates of the fucking Caribbean. Whu? Vegas. Vegas! Vegas! Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight? I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you. I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though. Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works. No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit. What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits. Wait. I can't lose more than a hundred. I'm not going to Vegas. You're crazy. When? What Vegas? What are you talking about? Vegas? We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke. I don't know... Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow... I don't know... S'up Trent?...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud... ...Four days..? I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy". No. I haven't heard an official "no" yet. My pleasure. By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight. Sure. ...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long. Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile. Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it. That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money". See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too... They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job. At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy... Well, you're doing so well... Well, that's dumb. She wasn't your type anyway. Oh boy. It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki... You want to talk about it? Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles. You haven't been drinking, have you? No problem, buddy. You eat anything today? I'll be your winger. Go for it, man. You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown. It's unbelievable. Him? Oh, like that song... What's that guy's name? Sue? ...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone. I just tested for one... There's the rub. I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them. It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it. Darwinism at its best. I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are. Bud. Classy. Sounds more like Aids... That doesn't sound too good for business. Oh. Where is this place? So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten? An eight. I'll give you an eight. How many strokes? Sure. Kick me when I'm down. I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight. I do. Good for you, man. Well, until now. Tend the pin. Oh no? Kinda. I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter. I didn't want to say anything. It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money." Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot. There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character. It's definitely a step back for me. I mean, I need the money. I don't think I'm gonna take it. Thanks. Thanks, man. No problem. Hey man, don't sweat it. There's the rub. Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore. I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care. Right... or more likely the opposite. It sucks. Right. The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back. Right. Right. You don't call.Good for you, man. He's being smart. Thanks, man. I've been hating myself for the last two days. But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going... We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk. I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun ...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up... What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago... ...People get carjacked... Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A... He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing. She was cute. Big butt... you know, can't fly coach. Rejected? How's it going for you two? Damned if I know... ...He's derivative... What's he do? ...which means no one will get there 'til ten. Pause it. No, man, we're in the play-offs. It's kinda money, actually. Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup. You little bitch! ...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. ...just be smart about it. You don't have to wait three days... Be smart about it. ...Definitely... Sorry man. It is on. ...it's definitely on. ...it's on. I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch... Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once? Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them... ...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey. What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep. Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you. ...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious... Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard... ...Tomorrow, then a day. You're money. ...you're so fuckin mmmoney. ...honestly... ...you're like a big bear. ...and you got big claws and fangs... ...You're just poking at it... ...shivering... ...and big fuckin' teeth... ...we're not... You are so money, and you don't even know it... True. ...double diamond... You think? That was pretty cold, dude. Yes she did. No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked. No. No. ...It's on. ...How novel. ...Is he brown? Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse. I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something. Fuck!!! That is so bullshit! They're a finesse team... That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit. Bitch... You little bitch!Let me just check on my boy. It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four. Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically... No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me... Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town. Oh. He's got it under control... Don't give me that! She liked you, man. You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you? You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit? What the fuck..? Yeah. I guess you could call it that. No... A day. No, baby! We're not messing with you... What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby. We got the digits, baby. She didn't see. Why, baby? What'd I do wrong? Was I money? Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up. You looked right at her, baby. What are you doing? Minnie Pearl. It's on. ...It looked money. ...through the kitchen... Yeah. He's a "rounder". Who? Rob? It starts at eight... Aww... He got away? Yeah. No. Doesn't that suck? I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne. Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off. Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey? What?!? See? And what does this guy she's with do? ...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing? You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie... Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat. That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby. How? Michelle went for you, right. Baby, you're so money you don't even know it. Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip. I heard them talking. They both thought you were money. She thought you were money. No, baby. You're money. She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy? I didn't even like her, to be honest. Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time. You didn't have to get into it, baby. Hold on. Baby, you'll check them tomorrow. What? Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven." I'm telling you! Wait... She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy. Yes! Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying... Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother. Oh... a Dorothy. Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job. Stop. Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven? Baby, we're money. Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine. You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money. ...Baby... Baby, you did fine. Nice, baby. Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party. They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it. That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't? Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress... ...gotta... You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there. It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you. You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them. Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends. Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you. You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies. Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby. I know she's coming back. Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails. She was smiling at how money I am, baby. Did she, or did she not smile. She smiled, baby. That was money. Tell me that wasn't money. Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner. Mikey's the big winner. Who's the big winner? Baby, you're money. You're the big winner. Baby, don't talk like that, baby. Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table. I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe. Hey, man, I'm down too, you know. ...Well, you know, not counting the first table. Always. Always, baby. I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven. If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well... You gotta do it. Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven. Double down. You think they're watching? Well, you look money, baby. We both look money. Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby. What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us? We're gonna get laid, baby. I'm telling you, they love that shit. Did she, or did she not smile? She smiled baby. What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys. Baby, there are beautiful babies here. That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby. You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money. This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates. Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby! Wake up, baby. Vegas. Vegas, baby! Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby! I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas! I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing. Be downstairs. You're beautiful. Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes. Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller. What? Just bring your card. Half an hour. Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way. I'll pick you up in a half an hour. Tonight, baby. We're going to Vegas. VEGAS. You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas. I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment. Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her. Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there. That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency. Lemme get off the other line, baby. Hello? Our little baby's growing up... ...Okay, two... I'm telling you. Wait three days... The bear's got his claws back. Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home. ...it is so on. It's on. It's on... Sue! ...Shut up, Sue... ...Sue... ...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything... ...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat. ...Anaheim... You dick. Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party. Yeah, but three days is kinda the money... ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think? ...Yeah. Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like. Now go over there and get those digits. ...you're money... ...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"... ...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared... ...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"... ...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner... You're like this big bear with claws and fangs... That's what I keep trying to tell him. You're so money, you don't even know... Baby, don't talk that way, baby... ...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk. Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail... It's on. What was cold about it? Damn. Now I gotta go in early. See, baby? Is she looking now? Now? Is she looking at me, baby? Oh, it's on, baby... What a surprise... Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail! You could make their heads bleed, though. They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick! ...against the computer. Because he's a bitch. Chelios to Roenick...! I'll have the Blackbeard over easy. Beautiful. What time are you off... ...Christy? ...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.Shit, shit, shit what time is it. Hello. I'll be downstairs in ten minutes. Stick with Carla. Carla Pestalozzi? No. Definitely not. You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa. Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you. Hey! Now there's some good news. Could we change the subject? Not really. Had a close one. Just come and get me, sir. I'm tired. He's got a gun, sir. He says he's leaving the island sir. It's me sir. MY girlfriend's pregnant. I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork. They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial. Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake? Oh Jesus... Thank you. Archbishop of Canterbury. Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ... Ancient Greece. Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king. What's that? Mason? God's speed. All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back. You knew? All this time? Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you. You know that pardon= contract you signed? Partners? I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break. The cell, Mason. Mason. Mason? Wait. What are you doing? What, vou? I'll go. It's all I could think of. I.don't get it. You're going to help me? Wait. Where're you going? Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder... Motor oil? Where is he sir? RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. What's he doing? HE'S ON THE= PHONE. I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit. Gotta go. Yes. You'll be outside. Well yes I suppose ... I don't understand.... I'm a field agent.St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas. Front pew. Right leg. = Hollow. Yes. To wish someone a prosperous jouey. I'm not a fool, Billy. Womack ripped it up, right? Partners. An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll. Surprise, surprise. You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed? Or another portion of your= anatomy .... It's about time. Find the rockets. If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them. Now they only have three rockets left. I'm not the chemical weapons expert. Wrong. Limp dick? No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons. What the fuck do you think? For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del. Goodspeed follows him. For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks. John Mason. ' Don't be shocked. I don't have much time. Please listen carefully .... You suppose? During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail? Tell me what you really do. What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it. What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL? Get him back! Don't let him do that. What is happening? Where's Mason? Spit it out. You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed. Maybe. Not really. No.Give me some time to Blow the man down! Weight! Hey! Blow the man down... Give me some time to blow the man down... Hey! Weigh! Blow the man down...Yes sir. Everybody down! ON THE DOUBLE!! We've got weather moving in from the west. Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side. I didn't know sir. Raise the inner jib! Raise the forestaysail! Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet. Rick, get on the jib sheet. George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse. George will show you what to do. Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward. Yes, Sir. Fifteen. My instinct was to not get electrocuted. Skipper called us out of the rigging. What do you mean? It was an act of God for Christ's sake. You came back, Tod. You came back. Okay, here's the duty. Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint. Corry and Stricklin have the brass. Robinson, you're the Galley slave. March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.No, I can't. All right. I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes... Why don't you go and try some of that on? I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch. That sound good? I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe. Make us proud.When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay. But you can't make this okay, can you? Fine. Okay. Yeah, sure. Where's Mom? Yes sir. What the "Bowsprit Affair"? Whatever. Gieg, Chuck. Yeah. I feel like... we can do anything. You know, I never had friends like this. Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here. I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life. It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out. Anonymous. That we're going back. I don't want it to end. I don't want to be what I was when I left. Feels different doesn't it? Yes you could. You did. This is all you. Nobody else. This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again. When you stand up and are counted. You know? Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?! It's a ninety-one! It's an 'A'! What about you? Ninety-six. You okay? Her name. Bregitta. It's poetry. Bregitta. Do you believe it? Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades. We'll start a private study group. Nobody knows. You'll ace that test. You're not a moron. What? If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right. Where you going? Yeah. So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop. No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath. I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in. What do you mean? He does. I'm just not like you. Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale. I'm never going to be "William". Because it looks good. That's not why he's sending me. It's not a vacation, it's private school. I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve. You weren't there, you don't know what happened. Is it true Phil? Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father. Because of you. Can we talk? You only hurt yourself you know? Why'd you do it? Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move? Shut up, Phil. It was a bad dream... But that's not the point... You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything. We all have problems. Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know? Bein' here together an all... Goodbye Mom. I'll be okay. Look, I just better go. Yes. Me too. No, I didn't. What are you talking about. What are they doing? Jesus, you never told them? Who? Swear to God. Only good advice he ever gave me. Now, go back to sleep. My dad. Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up! You'll be out of it. You'll wake up. Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you? How do you know? They might. I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away. My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?" No way! That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it. Who wants to know? Do what? It doesn't matter. Really. I'm just sorry you got chewed out. I'm used to spending a lot of time alone. I guess that's what I thought it would be out here. But, it's not is it? I feel like I got you into this. I just brought you something to eat. Good. How ya doing? Jesus. Maybe it's an air raid. I don't know. They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same. I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is. What right did then have to show up here? It's his father sir. He's suffocating him. We've all seen it... Of what? He killed the dolphin. Sir...? The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance. I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir. Shouldn't we turn away? Would you, um, say it's a big storm? Face what? It was my fault. I slipped. Yes, sir. Northeast sir! Ah... Northeast... sir. Yes sir.That is unfortunate. We'll have to take him with us. Stow away? But you invited is aboard. Chicken is a fool's game captain.So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake? Then what do you think he was trying to do. Is that what you were trained to do? But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard. Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony. Well, you never can tell these days, can you? Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece. He's a big boy. Take good care of my son. I'll be frank with you. This was his mother's idea. A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me. And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here. Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind. Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October. I'm Francis Boutillier. This is my son, Philip. Albatross? Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. Who is it Philip? Well, what does it have to do with? Us? Listen to me, you thankless little prick. We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat... Oh, really? Spying?! Humor me. Eat it anyway. What's wrong, you don't like steak?They think we're carrying Cuban refugees. Skipper, they mean to board us. Jesus. She's got guns. What's that? And being sixteen. Immortality. What's that? Son-of-a-bitch. I'm sorry, Skip. It's this damned book. Lawford gave it to me. What?! What's happening?!! Yes sir. Yes. I do. I think you were too hard on Weathers.Me either. I'll tell you who you are. You're the glue. You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't. It's a gift. Figured what out? What was that? What? I couldn't have done it without you. I just can't believe it. I know. Congratulations. Yeah. How'd you do. Believe what? They were gonna put me into special- ed this year. I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding. I'll never pass the boards. Wanna bet? Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about. You know why it takes me so long to write papers? because I can't spell. While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary. I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut. I'm a moron, okay? You satisfied?! I cheated to get on the boat!!! All right?! You've gotta be kidding. Get the fuck outta my way! Yeah, that's right. You wanna come in and shake it for me? To take a piss. My old man split along time ago. It doesn't mean anything. You just take care of number one that's all that matters. That's what they get for not locking the door. I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty. She isn't that old. Jesus! What the hell happened to him. Why would you do that? Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule. We'll think of something. That's enough. Will you shut up? You sound like my fucking sister. I don't have to listen to this. Okay donut. Whatever you say. They tell you that? Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair. On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down. Trust me donut. I know. Like you'd know what to do with one. Shut up donut. Don't ever call me stupid. Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know. Because I felt like it. What do you care? What's your problem? Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford. What? What is it... the secret? Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne. Look, save it for somebody else will ya. This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me. I don't.Read on, young John. Read on. College boards are coming. The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall. If it were only that simple, my young friend. Read on, gentlemen. Read on. This isn't just a story!! It's history made allegory. It is a philosophical handbook for life! It holds the secret of this very voyage. You know what he is talking about here? That's not a satisfactory answer. You will if you wanna eat. Right George? If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress. Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him... We've got a problem. What do you think? Tie it off!! It seems we're short on singers. Well, that was neighborly.I know enough. I gotta go. Well that's just typical isn't it? I guess. Like you really care. Like any of you give a shit what happens to me. What's the difference? Like this! God damn it man. I think he broke my nose! Hey, shut up will ya? It's okay. I'll be in, in a minute. Look, what do you want? No. Look, it's me okay? Can't it just be about me? For once? It has nothing to do with him. Look, you put me on this boat in the first place. I didn't want to come but I did. Why do you have to embarrass me. Why can't you just leave me alone? I can take care of myself. Why are you here? I should be eating with the crew. Lemme go! Lemme go!! Me, too. I can show you how to use a slide rule. Oh, praise the lord. Relax everybody. Everything is under control. The jug head's going to think of something. How the hell are we gonna get outta here? Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't. Oh Jesus, oh Jesus. Man I knew we shouldn't have gone. I tried to tell you. I tried to tell you. You guys made me come! You made me come!! About anything. It hurts too much to care. Fuck off man. It's just a fish. They're waving... handkerchiefs or something. You gotta be kidding? He's a human chum line! Son of a bitch!! It's outta here! Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe... Fandango, Junior. I'm gonna do some limbo baby!! There are some things that everybody does in the same language. You've gotta be kidding? Long enough. I'm not gonna kill it. Joy, rapture... I'm not staying out here. No, sir. No. Suicidal... Sir.She said "None the better, you all go to hell..." So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale... A pretty young maiden she happened my way... Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day... Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit. Look, meet us out front when you're through. If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat. Rick March. Who the hell are you? Albatross? About yourself? You're the one who doesn't care, Phil. No, Phil. It's a mammal. What? No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.I can't go in there. I can't make it out? I couldn't. My brother. He fell out of the old beech tree. Broke his neck. I was on a camp out. They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down... They didn't find him 'till the next morning. They didn't even know why he was up there. That's how he died you know. It works? Who told you that? It was so real... Kennet Square, PA. 'Mushroom capital of the world'. Where are you from any way? 'Cause they're getting a divorce. That's why they sent me here. My sister's at Tabor. They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business. My parents don't do it anymore. What'd you do? So... What happened? Come on man, what'd they look like? Ya know... "It". You think Skipper and Alice do it? I'm sorry I left you hanging up there. Forget it. Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself. Fine. I can't watch this. What the hell is going on? Why, man? It matters to me. I figured it out. I've seen 'em. I've seen 'em. What? Come on... How would you know? If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her. I'll read it. I mean I don't mind. Come on, he didn't mean anything. I couldn't do it. Why'd you jump? I don't know. We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this. Come on man. Let's just talk about it. No way Phil. Not like this. Phil. What are you doing? But, they don't speak English. What are we supposed to talk about? How long you been standing there? I hate you, you son of a bitch!!! Aaauuuhhh!!! I can't. I don't know... I'm sorry... What?Thank you. How old are you, son? But your instinct was to lose sail? Why didn't you drop any sail? Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket? Lost everyone on board. In fair weather no less. Do you think this is funny? Some kind of joke? You lost six people out there. ... and that you invited him to strike you? To fight it out on the deck of your ship?! Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier... Except, a "White Squall". With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys... You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions. What makes you so sure it was one? Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew. Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall. Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.Claiming their place in the world. Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences. It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them. Phil, he's not looking inside. He's just striking out at the world. Because we believed we could make an impact out here. Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing. Why did we begin this? I can take it. Guilty. He never would have believed a woman like you existed. You sound so sure. I'd have liked to have said goodbye. All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands. He would have loved this. Yep. It's time these boys saw some real blue water. Did we lose anybody? North, north-east. And Dick, please make a note of our final position. Carry on. Everyone out of the rigging NOW! Well, that's all part of it. Come in. It's your job to know. If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not. Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill? Watch the tell-tales Chuck. If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water. We'll bear off to port and run down wind. Good. Let's go sailing. Everyone aboard young Bill? You should tell him. That's something he can take with him. Does Phil know how you guys feel? They have every right Chuck. Of a fight he can't win out here. The Dolphin was a symptom. Why do you think I'm sending him home? Close the door. Sit down. Can't do it. Well, spit it out. What's on your mind? You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall. Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight. Sometimes it gets exciting out here. Uh, huh. Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it. You all right? All stop on the engine. Unfurl the squares! Speak up boy! Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out. I want to know that you've heard and understand. Raise the mainsail. Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west. He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama. Your cannons made a compelling argument. So is violating international law. What is it we can do for you today? And, of course, we are. We'll do our best. You're welcome to say goodbye. It will be more than that, I can promise you. Happily, it all worked out... This time. Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk. This is a working ship. Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her. Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed. As you can see, there's a lot to do. I know. Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen. It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on. It's very bad luck if you kill one. And dolphins too. Not a chance. Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war. She's Cuban. They'll know about it in the morning. They're in a hurry to grow up. They don't know about consequences or responsibility. That's being sixteen too. I promise you one thing... Spirits have a way of bringing that out. A padlock. I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be... We're short one long boat too. Come on. You're officer of the watch, George. You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing. It's all my responsibility. So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley. We'll get along that way. I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours. We've got to bring them together. Make them a crew. We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way. So, I will challenge them and they will come together. You do? Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere. No. Bring him on deck with the others. What's that? Barometer's dropping. The first blow'll come from the south. Might get interesting. Outer. What's wrong Mr. Lawford. He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly. You already have. Now go on. Do it. Each one of you will be responsible for one student. I'll expect you to be courteous. You represent this school and your country. We'll sail in the morning. I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there. Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear. Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch. Everyone else hit the racks. Excellent. Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition. Then keep your mouth shut. Do you have something to say? The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up. You're a day late. We keep a schedule aboard ship. Lives depend on it. Hello, Philip. No. Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister! Hate it! Hate it away. Hate your way up one more rung!! Do it right now!! Are you hating this?! Are you! You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there! Don't look down. Look in my eyes! Climb! We'll do it together. What are you blubbering about? Sorry won't cut it. What's it going to be? Up you go. Right now. Swing up, son. Yes. I don't think one second of this is funny, sir. Yes, that's true. For killing a dolphin. They are much more than that, sir. We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable... I can't be sure. No. Yes, I was. He climbed when he was ready. I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened. No. I didn't. I am accountable. ... Absolutely not. The Coast Guard 'Eagle'. She never lost a race while you were Skipper. It wasn't hard. I understand.That's not what Skipper thought. He was trying to spill air from the main! Everybody knows why she went over Tod. You jibed the boat. Easy for you to say. Screw you, Valentino. I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody. Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".It's me, don't you see. Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch. I disobeyed order. There's still a way. It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard! Butler, what'd I ever do to you? That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook. They don't know that. We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right? I'm a kid. I'm pissin' fire man. Listen man, I think I have a problem. Sorry to here it. No. Let the blow drive the boat down wind. Neutralize our canvas. No. Twice. I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails. I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam. Or maybe you're too stupid to know that! What's that supposed to mean?! Don't mind him, Chucky. You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.Then what are you trying to say then? If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared? And you didn't do anything about it? The papers are going to eat you alive. Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission. They want someone to be accountable. The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing. Everybody goes home. I used to helm a school ship. A long time ago. How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier? May I ask you something? There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross. I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.You don't give him enough credit Chas. Nobody says you have to be like me. Why then. I thought this was your dream come true. It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff. You gonna jump? Or are you just having a last look?As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese? You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them. No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of. Of what? This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.. Let's get out of here. No, I wanted to make a painting of you. You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads... I'd take some of them out. I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit. I haven't decided yet. Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you. When's your show? Is this finished yet? Rene's been telling me about your work. Really. Huh. Too bad. No. Should I have?Oh, I didn't know that. I think it's in New Jersey. It's in New Jersey. Saddle River's in New Jersey. That would be a pity because you're a real painter. Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death. Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you. That was my favorite part! I don't like beer. I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green. I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents. Well, have you asked her to come back? Do you still love her? What's wrong? Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg. My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well. Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent. Wow... Stop giving them away. I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me? That's good. At least they're interested. Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery. My jacket? Gee, great... Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that! I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good. Ignorant art?That's the same guy who did this painting. How do you know? I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment. Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit! Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out. What about the shit they write? The whole thing � painting. Do you ever get sick of it? See ya in an hour. So what do you think? Naa.. Why, so you could humiliate me? It's always how you would do it. This is my version. What do you think? Not sure. How was yours? I don't know. Hey � it's the big A.M.. I'm a painter, too. My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me? After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing. When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now. People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work. I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you." We can do better. It needed more white. How come you're not peeing on them yourself? Piss painting? You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig? What's with the wigs? Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her. That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina. Ouch.. Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island. Cool. Yeah � I'd do that... You could teach me. Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors � anything with a SAMO tag on it. The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?" I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me. Yeah, I met her already. Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket. You don't even work on your stuff! Ten bucks apiece. Yeah... Like � stupid, ridiculous, crummy art. You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks. Sure. Hi Dad. Hi Nora. I know. When? You want a drink? You name it, I paint there. No. What do you mean? B.B. It's me � Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year? Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour. Sure, ok.. I can get ten. I'm here. I need a dealer. Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him. Should there be? Are those the only two possibilities? You wanna French fry? No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy. Who said that? We don't hang them at home, y'know � just in the streets.. Yup. No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican. Not what? I'm not black. I use a lot of colors � not only black. Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it? A primate? You mean like an ape? Leeches. A long list of leeches. It looks good like that. Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from? Everywhere. They're just words. Decipher? I hate this. Turn that off. Yeah. Yeah, just put their bill on my tab. See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill. Chateau Latour '64, please. What's wrong with you today? Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you. Why don't you try letting her in, Steve � I mean Shenge. Use your fucking instinct. Yeah.. Still not here. Yeah... Maybe just his arms. Put some Cerulean Blue there. Paint it out. Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health! Me fall? Let's get some drugs! I guess it was a long time ago. Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you! 'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?' Good. What do you have? What's your fuckin' problem, anyway? I ain't John Henry. Yeah... I'll paint on it. For real? Come on in! Check you later, man. He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these. So then what? Who's John Henry? Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else. Oh � you mean black people! About what? I am... On Gina. Fuck � I didn't think we were actually gonna do this. We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist � she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me. I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday. Here � I made this for you. Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny. "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken! "She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby! Oh yeah.. Who am I? Who's that? Willie Mays. What's his name? Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were � George? Forget it. Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole. Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're � How is he? Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me. He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him? A present I picked up for you. Hi. What's wrong with me? ... babies. Think so? Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee � Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai? You look fucking beautiful, beautiful. You want some? I'm your family. It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone. You're back. ... What's the matter? Manzanita.... ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face' Do you know what he's saying? ... I'll buy you some new ones. C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now. Wanna go get some breakfast? I thought you hated this place? Party girls? Can I call you? Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do! Can I walk you home? I guess you did. I'll take it. Andy, gimme three thousand dollars. Just the caviar � I'll get the rest. I'll take the whole tin. Is that the best quality you have? Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies. I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job? What's your name, man? Sure. I'd be glad to. That's great. Me? Why? See you later. Stand still. You like your dad's paintings? Hi. No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink. Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town. You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name? Have a Mac. Wanna Mac? I'd like to squeeze your titties. Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it. You don't even know me. I want real respect. No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get. No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me. Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros! Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens. Hey, Rene. I'll make you another one. I can't. After the show. That one's for you. What time is it? So what? Yes, Boss. If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement? I didn't know Tony Bennett painted. Tony Bennett... What do you mean? Fuck... I forgot about that. Jean Michel Basquiat. Can you put me in the ring with him? I didn't know. You don't have any!!! 'Phillips head,' right? Yeah. A what?Drugs??! Sit down! You're gonna fall out! Come on, let's get out of here. She's good. That's not how I meant it. For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell. What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me. I don't really have any problems. Good. What's the rush, John Henry? You gonna carry that around all night? We got beat. Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!! Hi Gina. Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that. What're you doing? You're doing something. He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want? Oh man! Folklore guy � worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike. Got a cigarette? Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry � fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart. Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich. Your people. You're shattering all my myths. Concentrate on the ball. Shoot. Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. You got a date already? Thanks. Your dad called again � something about a job. Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing? SAMO. The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic � writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are.. Hey � Willie Mays.You're a fast mover. I don't eat junk food. No, I'd like the scarf. Come on. How can I ever thank you?You haven't heard? Andy's dead. I didn't see you. It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there. You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it. It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.What? What do you want? What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it. You see? You have someone to live for. What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that? What is it � did your girlfriend leave you? What? Wait a minute... talk to me. That's a beautiful name. French?They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge. Would you check out my studio some time? You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too. I really... admire you.Very well. Really? I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat. Would you like to see the wine list?I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop. Jean? Hold this, please. You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too. That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em! Yeah. A Phillips head. From the toolbox. Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?Tell me about it. What are you angry about? OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work? Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto? Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution? Why, that's from Time Magazine. I see.. And... How do you respond to being called � hmmm... � yes, "the pickaninny of the art world." Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home? Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he? Not black. You're not? What? Yes, but as a black painter � Well, you said that. You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you? Hmmm. And 'Parasites.' You seem to be a Primal Expressionist. What are they? Yes, I understand � but where do you take them from? Yes. What do they... stand for? ... Can you... decipher this for us? What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?It's in New York. New York. Saddle River, New York! Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.I know that. Don't let him get away. MOTHAFUCKAH! Just look at him. Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so. Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick. Who did this? Who did this? Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that? Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business. Forget it. You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother � when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit. Thanks... I'll take it tonight. 5:11. So shut up and keep painting.. You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know? So keep painting. My point exactly. Singing on stage and painting in your spare time. Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts � you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett.. Uh huhh... Band practice? It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...? I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates. But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy. I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything. So what's your real name? 'Samo?' You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.That's ignorant. Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT. Uh-oh! YO!

Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas? Yeah, we're gonna score.Where are his pants? Chief, look! We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him. Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose... Not on him, Chief. Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have... D.C., Chief. Where did these guys come from? We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking? Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in? Cavity search...? It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus. Well, sir it's not good. Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus... Cut the power! I see it. I don't get it. They look like a couple of kids chief. Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look. Ah, the witness? Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived. We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin... Uh... butt-snatch... Uh... dill, um, face... Butt-snatch... Dill-wad... Butt-dumpling...

Who knows? OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it. Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot. Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now. Not now Bork. Agent Hurley... Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley. Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for... the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill! Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference. Well, it's not gonna happen! What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'? Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher. That's better. Yes? Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again. Deep and hard. Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands... Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit? You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away? You see what I see, Bork? Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers? Yes. You can never be too careful Bork. Did you give him a full cavity search? Talk ta me, Bork. Dammit! Where's that damn unit??!!Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya? Damn, she's goin' all the way! Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it. Just make sure it looks like an accident... That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her... Yer late. Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell! She sure does. One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far? She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport. Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her. That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal? Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?Where is it? The next one blows off your dick. The money! Where is it? You don't think I'll do it, do you? The same way you did before. You don't need a key. Open the case! That's right, I know. I fucking know. Admit what? Where is this going, Johnnie? What's that, Johnnie? Two point one seventy-six. Glenlivet, right, Gino? You want to get into this now? Here, put this in his mouth. Whoa, whoa. Come on, he's making too much noise. I can't. I can't. No! Stay away! Sit down, Gino! No, Gino! Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it. Violet! Ask Johnnie! Ask your rat-fuck son! Yeah, I know. What are you going to do, V? Shoot me? Kill me in cold blood? I don't think so. I'll tell you why. If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago. If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home. But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me. Do you, V? Do you? No, I know you don't. You know he would have done you, too. Now that's teamwork. Sure, Gino, sure. Yes, I understand. I'm listening. They're all fine. Just bruises and shit. They were in a car accident. Holy shit, I don't believe it! We've been going crazy over here, Gino! What? Shut up! I had to. You made me. You betrayed me! I saved you. What did she do to you? Shut up, Violet. Don't try to tell me what to do. Stupid cunt! Violet! Shut up, Violet! Where is the money? I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ... I need plastic bags ... tape and rope ... We're going to need some time. Where, then? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! They're just cops. Stall them as long as you can. Fuck. I don't know. We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family. No I didn't. Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here. Then they never showed up. Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened. What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money. ... maybe three hours. Tell them! Tell them! Shut up, Violet! This is between me and Johnnie. All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case. I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you. Maybe two million dollars finally bought you. It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't. If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me. Violet, I won't let you leave. I need you ... You can't leave. See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case. He wants me to hand the case to Gino. Then there is no doubt it was me. Gino will put a bullet in me himself. But it ain't going to happen. I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me! Not like this! No way! He didn't see you, did he? He didn't have that much time. He had to pick up Gino. I bet you he's got it with him. I bet it's in the car. No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to do is get it back. I got it! I know what I got to do! I got to get the money. Goddammit, Violet! Would you just leave me the fuck alone! Please! Leave! Now! Violet, please! Got to think this through ... So what?! So fucking what? Use your head, Violet. The money is gone. Gino is coming here to get it. You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it! Is that what you think? I don't. You know what I think? I think I'm a dead man. I'm one in the brain. That's what I think! I hate that little fuck! I hate him! I hate him! I should've done him! Jesus Christ, Violet! Open your fucking eyes! Johnnie hates me like I hate him! It's impossible! It couldn't have been. What? Why? No! They're still on their way. What are you, drunk? What are you talking about? There's no time. Fuck! Fuck! How did you ... Awwww goddammit! Where the hell's the laundry detergent? I told them to run it through the cycles. But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up. Just look at this mess I got to deal with. It was unbelievable! Un-fucking- believable! Why? 'Cause you know him? What? Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels. You're right. You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to. I just hope you understand you're among good people here. Not bad. What for? What? It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires. Did you know he did time himself? So, you just got out? No shit. Bianchinni hired you? You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really. I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here. Oh, shit ... What the fuck is going on? All part of the business. Good idea. I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay? Oh, right. Fuck, this happened before. It's this shitty ear. Born with it. The batteries wore out in my aid. I'm sorry. How's it going tonight, fellas? Why? When I reach ten, then I'll start with you. I'm going to ask you where the money is. Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger. Where is it? Now, where the fuck is my money? Another time. What? How about a drink? Good. I hate to worry. I got ulcers. How many'd you do? You're helping Rajeev? Where's the fucking money? Call me as soon as you get him. Oh yeah. Violet! Ssh! I can't hear Gino! It's Gino! It's Gino! The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom. Yeah, that's it. Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right. You know women, Mick. Yeah. Oh Christ, the phone ... That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it? Me? Why? Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink. Sit down, Lou. Yeah, it was Violet's idea. I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax. I thought I heard someone knocking. Yeah, Mick. I've got the money. I'm staring right at it. Okay, sure, Mick. No. I don't know where they are. I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer. Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem. They haven't shown up yet. Hey, Mickey. Sure, Mickey. Sure. Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You know how I feel about that fucking psycho. Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around. Go right ahead, sir. Not on duty, sorry. It's all right, sir. Pretty good, sir. This is a beautiful place. You did the right thing. See? We're for real. Ma'am, you have to open the door. No joke, ma'am. Please open the door. We had a report of gunfire, so if you could -- This is the police, ma'am.Give it to me. Gimme the gun. We're family, Caesar. No, Caesar, gimme the gun. You aim a gun at me?! Do you know who I am?! I am Gino Marzzone. You understand? Caesar! Caesar? What is this? We know how this was done, eh? Johnnie, what did I say? Hey, Johnnie ... Done. We go now. Caesar, come here. Sit. We talk now. You too, Johnnie. No, Johnnie. No goddamned phones. Not now. Hey, Caesar! You take care of this girl, or I find out!You're a dead man! A fucking dead man! Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun -- Where's what? I think you're fucking crazy! What are you talking about? How the fuck can I open it? All right! Where's the key? Know what? That you overreacted. That you lost it. Not me. It was your mistake. Just admit it, Caesar. The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ... Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing. Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it. I bet it wasn't a big deal. Was it, Caesar? So Caesar, what did it total out at? I'll have whatever Violet's drinking. No, no, Caesar. Not now. You shouldn't have hit me. You hear that, bitch? Be quiet! Pop, this is important to me. It's a simple question. if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it. Unbelievable. Can you believe that, Violet? Jesus Christ, Pop. You got two hours until your plane leaves. Pop? You are as radiant as ever, Violet.Leave your phone on the hook. You got the key? Un-fucking-believable. I called those highway patrol dumb fucks. Where in the hell is he? Fuck it, I don't need the key. Hey, Caesar, where's the key? Is that the money? Sure, Cease. They make us do stupid things, don't they. Why'd you move all the furniture around? Cease, can I ask you something? Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing. I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal. I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here. We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad. We was worried about you, Cease. That Violet is one nice lady. Wish someone would help me relax. I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower. No, Cease. There was no answer. Good. Sit tight. I'll call you. Caesar, you still got the money? Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do. Don't go anywhere, okay? What? They ain't there? Yeah? Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something? Are you okay, Violet? Sure you're going to be okay? I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands. I told you, the family doesn't want the police around. We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him. I swear I will. Violet? I think everything is okay. Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident. Caesar? What the fuck time is it? Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar. You just get out of here, okay? You shouldn't have to see this. Why don't you get out of here? Go for a walk.Tell me about your garden. Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again. I'm sorry, Katharine. And a good read. Don't waste it. I promise I'll come back. I promise I'll never leave you. And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party. Listen to me, Katharine. You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. I'm going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel. And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you. Yes. Absolutely. I'm just going to find things for the fire. I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a fire. I'll be back. You're wearing the thimble. Don't talk. What? I know, darling, I'm sorry. We've got to get you out of here. Why did he bring you? Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here? Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me. Dance with me. I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there? How can you ever smile? As if your life hadn't capsized? Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it? What? What? That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for? Why did you hold his collar? I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny. Don't go over it again, please. I'm not agreeing. Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Of course. You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face. I don't care to bargain. It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing. Yes. A different wife. Madox knows, I think. He's tried to warn me. He keeps talking about Anna Karenina. I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat. Its my idea of a man-to-man chat. This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine! I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous. Ouch! See - you're always beating me..! It's a long song - Szerelem means love�and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool. For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave. He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of - No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me. It's a folk song. I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth. Swoon. I'll catch you. I can still taste you. I can't work. I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently. Say you're feeling faint - the sun. Say you're sick. Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me. What do you hate most? What else? Okay. And what do you love? Say everything. When were you least happy? When were you most happy? That makes it harder still. You don't sew at all! Good. I believe you still have my book. Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted. No. No, but I think I do. And the marriage - is that a fiction? Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical. Come on, come on! There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid. Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be honored. Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around. All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised. - there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness. Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake. Yes. Absolutely. No. In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand. See what's happening to them - the stars. Look over there. You should come into the shelter. There's really no need. This is just a scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you. We took several photographs, there's no need. What's this? I do not. Pardon? Her or me? He said - be careful. The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer. Haunting the ostrich. A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear. This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich. I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs. As the wife of one of our party. I was concerned. As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to. Excuse me? I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I am rusty at social graces. How do you find Cairo? Did you visit the Pyramids? That insults them. This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton. You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back. Which stall? They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay? How much did you pay? Daskylus� I'm sorry - what have you noticed? What kind of fossils? A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it. Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car. Thank you. And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials� - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood. Isn't that right? Oops! Mustn't say International. Dirty word. Filthy word. His Majesty! Die F�hrer! Il Duce. I haven't, no. Sorry. What? Very well. All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned - I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her. Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her? Safe journey. What kind of photographs? There you have me. Still a car. No! NO! Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep! Look, listen to me. A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here. I have been walking for three days! I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep! Count Laszlo de Alm�sy. The Officer is writing this down. A glance at his Corporal. Am I not talking sense? - forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers. I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society. What? No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle? I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and� Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk. I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident. Could I trouble you for some water? There is no God. But I hope someone looks after you. Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands. Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready. Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you. I told you so. Right. Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round. I believe I'm rather late. Own the desert. Why do they care about our maps? What's the matter with you? In my room. Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy. And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura. No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple! Look! What is that? Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility� Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly. Cut the ropes. I left a note, on his blanket. At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot. The Girl wouldn't leave, of course. Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up. I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane. Her hands and feet were tied. Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we're in London? This girl was probably twelve years old. Fritz? What are you talking about? Who's Fritz? Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me. My wife is dying. Hey! Hey! Stop this jeep! Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!Thank you. Just kiss me. It would mean such a lot to me. You're the prettiest girl I ever saw. Okay.Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Christ. Don't cut me. Come on. Don't cut me. I slept with the girl. I've got a wife in Tripoli. A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble. A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse? Great. Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was - It's impossible. I was buying or selling something. I've been to Cairo many times. I don't know. I keep explaining. You've got the wrong man. My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini. Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you. No. She can take you as far as Florence. Well, then ask him his name! No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song? I liberated it. Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed. I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk. What if I told you he did this to me? Who are his ghosts? You have to protect yourself from sadness. This is the thing I've learned. You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient. Do you think he's a saint or something? Because of the way he looks? I don't think he is. I'll have some of your water. It's hot. Hana? Hana? Are you alright? Some gave me a dress. You know what's great? What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that. You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket. Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life? Rabbit hunting. Supper. Hana calls after him. Fine. I'm not looking. I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep. No. I'd like to stay. That's the long and short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be - -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug. I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that. Yeah, for a while. They're fresh. I haven't eaten an egg in�have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them? I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. Bonjour. Are you Hana? Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious. No, now I can't kill you. You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel. And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave? But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them? There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition. It did this. If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died. What did you say? You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing. Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression. I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name. So, I come across the Hospital Convoy I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat - how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you. There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms? What? You and Madox? Or you and Katharine Clifton? Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know - Have a drink. Is there a song you don't know? For? Thought you'd never wake up! First wedding anniversary - what do you call it? Is it you? If I said Moose� I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you? Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything? I can't hide anymore. I breathe like a dog. I lose my balance. Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus. I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name. And you've forgotten yours. Are you planning to be the exception? Oh, all over. Thief, I think, is more accurate. Hello.Sorry, what's your point? It's Geoffrey under this. Have you seen Katharine? Why are you people so threatened by a woman?! I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife. I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her. I think she's know herself. Are you mad? Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday. Appropriate? You too. Good luck! Portraits. The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing. Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife. A broken car? Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick. I do so love you. What do you smell of? Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war. Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home. Right. Lady H said she thought you might be - Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right? But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems? Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft� Well, she is! I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best - The team is in mourning, darling. Off with his head! Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army. To arm-twisting. Good heavens, are you married, Madox? Oh no, really. She has her book. Apprentices. Isn't it? Wedding present from Katharine's parents. I'm calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.That's your name innit? Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish? Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding. Shut-up!Pardon me? A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears. Only we have to go to work. I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh. A toddler I'll ask the Lieutenant. But thank you. Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others - Hello miss. Yessir. You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last. I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him. Don't move! Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it? I love you. Hana, I know you do! You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk. There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.I'll always go back to that church. Then come with me. It's what I've learned. I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman. I mean home. India. Will you come with me? This is hot! The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him. When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away. That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It's red hot. Then I'd think there must be a reason. I try not to expect you. I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some - he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean - and us - he never once� He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about. Yes. Later. This is what I do. I do this every day. Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut. No. But he hands them over. You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts. Okay. Get away from here. Quick. What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune? I've done this. I've had to do this. You get Hardy. There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over. The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them. I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone. For my hair? Thank you. I've met you before. Is something funny? The Germans were here. The Germans were all over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite hiding places. This is making me incredibly angry. Go away. What's happening? Am I needed? Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never! What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky. And now this. I looked up to you, Uncle. My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them. What's he saying? What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk. And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British. It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives. Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -May God make safety your companion. I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything. Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all. I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis. So if you need it�hard to know how long one's talking about. We might all be back in a month or two. When's Clifton picking you up? We didn't care about countries. Did we? Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans. None of that mattered, did it? It was something finer than that. Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. I'm going to do what I can, but� And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so. Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still� Look, either shut up, or go home. Good, we're all here? A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface. What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa. Don't be so bloody na�ve. You know there's a war breaking out. This arrived this morning. By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939. Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of. And where are the Expedition Maps? Which we've overflown twice. And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore. Bermann! I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside. I was talking about the girl. What did you do? You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable. What did you think you were doing in his tent? Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo. And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons. Very much so. We are all, save my friend here. I won't hear of it. None of us will. Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace. This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes. I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England. We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Alm�sy smiles and walks on towards the others. Marvelous plane. Did you look? Certainly not. Why not? A more modest expedition, or even wait a year. Remind our families we still exist. I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition. Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us. We're not accustomed to the company of women. Your book. Your Herodotus! Alm�sy looks uncomfortable.I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ - Alm�sy - would you mind just spelling that for me? What nationality would that be? Right. And what's your name, sir? If I could just see some identification. Do you have your papers, sir? I see. Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from? Good morning! Then you were married? This was your garden? How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything? Why? Are you German? What about your rank or serial number?No. He's - no. Third Canadian Fusiliers. He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier? If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself. And what if he really is a spy? It's not safe here. The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what. It's madness. I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us. Hana - It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.I'm feeling old. I had a hotel room. A bit of one. We can do that when we're very, very old. I've got a surprise. A boat! We can go to Capri. It's got a cabin, it's private. Whoa - give me a chance!You can't kill me. I died years ago. Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't� I couldn't even do that properly. Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me. Thousands of people did die, just different people. The rest meant nothing to me. I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise. The rest meant nothing to me. And you thought you'd come and settle the score? I see. Me? We shall miss you. Hana tells me you're leaving. What? Very true! I've had a drink. Fatal. Top Hat. Irving Berlin. What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone. I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember. Moose. I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage. It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face. Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in. Like an old boxer. I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name. Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name. I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her. All over? I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed. Are you leaving us? Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds. I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts? Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket? That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club. Who knows the Bosphorus Hug? Why don't you go? You should sleep. Don't depend on it. Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right. I'm still here. - to her cooking. Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent - I don't think it's indifference. You like him, don't you? Your voice changes. Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions. I've been told that before. In that case, I suppose we can't charge. We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do? Why? Is he staying? Really? That's sudden. Sikh. If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh. K is for Katharine. Could I ask you to move? I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry. Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits. That's a different dress. Something smells so rich. My stomach is heaving - Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries - Well then - yes. Of course. Just go off. I'll be quite all right. Your friend? Yes? Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed. Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you? Why? Can he lay eggs? Why are you so determined to keep me alive? Could I have a cigarette? I can see my wife in that view. Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth. I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears? Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils. I can already see. Yes. Dropping off. I'm not laughing at you. Go on, please. Candaules Thank you. My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can read him. Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me? What was all the banging? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army? There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs. Go on, do it. I don't need to hear any more. What are you talking about? Kip? This is wonderful! Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I. So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about? - The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum. I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water? Or my wife's. You tell me. I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France. No. Am I being interrogated? You should be trying to trick me. Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur. Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted. Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way. No. I think I was a pilot. I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some time.You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you. His reactor's starting to overheat. Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south. It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight. Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time. Somebody else was in there with her. Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive. ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. Understand? Understand? You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight. Go on now. Do as I say. Now go get dressed. We have things to do. You never heard of Snake Plissken? You're stalling, Eddie. Talk, you little gringo! Where's Plissken? What? Where? You told me he was dead. Give it. Give it to me. Where is he? We'll see.C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that. Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant. Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre. L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule. The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours. Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how. Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man. You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake. Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype? Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens. Plissken...? Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch. Nuclear turbine to 75% power. Lock fuel rods. No. A medical team will be standing by. Let's just say it's what's best for the country. Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there. Once you go inside, you're on your own. You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you? We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason. All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m. Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States. There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know? Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon. I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken. You don't understand. It's already in you. Having second thoughts? That's the deal. That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back. Top secret. Only on a need to know. Shut up, Plissken. How you doin' Plissken? You like the watch? Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you. Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button. The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President. Shall I begin evacuation? Getting ready to invade. It's the President, for Christ's sake!Cuervo, look out behind you! He's... near. It's so good to see you again. Oh Cuervo... I thought he was, but he came back. You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken. Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you. You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man. He jumped. Down there. He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken. Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised. Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em. So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo. I got an idea, Snake. This looks like the prototype, right? I don't know about this thing. Aw, come on, Snake. Me too? I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit. Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right. I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man. Sure, Snake. No problem. You gonna kill me? I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen... Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you. Right over there. All right. Anything for you, Snake. Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place. No way. Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time. Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you. Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know. Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings. Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake. You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there. Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours. Good. I want you out. This is my sewer. What're you doing in here?Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way. You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help. You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up. Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man. Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake. Could be a big one comin' any minute now... Down that way. Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off. Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress. I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely. She's overloaded! We're too heavy. If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me. I don't know yet. You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world? We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out. Say goodnight, Carjack. Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour. I'm already dead. I got a new deal for you. Don't lie to me. Wait a minute. I know that voice. You're Carjack Malone. I need a favor. The name's Plissken. Got a smoke? Yeah, I got it. It's history. I gotta go. I'm here. 75% power. Locked. She's in the green. Good. Not you? By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin? So you want me to take her out? Is that an order from the President? Where do I put ashore? So what does this thing do? Defense against what? I'll need to know more about this thing. Call me Snake. Get this crap out of me. Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time. Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about? Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A. So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free? And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood. What's the little black box do? You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want? Is that what I think it is? If he lets you get close enough. Yeah, kinda. Don't like it, don't come. Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God. We'll see. How do you know all this? Cease fire with the bullshit. Later. Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe. Not yet. Where are they going? Where is it? I said pull over. Stop the damn car. Delgado? Location. Where are they? Where'd they go? Yeah. So how do I get to Venice? Which way? Looking to get out. Who? Where? Where's... Cuervo Jones...? Which way to the Hollywood Bowl? Who? Find Cuervo Jones. I know that. There are people in some of these cars. What the hell is this? Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil? Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay? How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city. How do we get out of here? The what? This is a dead end. You took us into a dead end! Like hell I do. Don't follow me. Who? No screamin' shit. What are they? Are you crazy? Where's the anti-toxin...? Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in. I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is. Well, I'll think it over. I can see you're real concerned about your daughter. Uh-uh. Bluebacks. The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars. Yeah. Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay. You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland. I'm looking for somebody.You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug. Does he know how to activate it? So where's Plissken? I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man. Give me the prototype. Thank God. You're running out of time. Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack? Shit. I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money. Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him. I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake. Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them. All of us? Hershe, you were in Cleveland? Who ain't? Hey, what's going down, Snake?Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe! I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here! I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out. Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here. ...Is this a fucking joke? Is this a fucking joke here? Drop that fucking money! Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS - I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase! Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance. ...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd. Certainly. Certainly - It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell! Ya find the work interesting, do ya? ... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service? Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter! Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients? Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out! HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!

That's more'n I've heard you say all week. Huh? Grimsurd looks at his thumb. "No." First thing you've said in the last four hours. That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man. That's a geyser. I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. Shit, I'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation. ...Would it kill you to say something? ...Look at that. Twin Cities. IDS Building, the big glass one. Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest. After the Sears, uh, Chicago... You never been to Minneapolis? Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think? ...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think? What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe. Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on. What? Or your fucking wife, Jerry. GOT IT? You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it? Don't you fucking but me, Jerry. I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up. I'll see you tomorrow. IS IT, JERRY? You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em! Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready. Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand. DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP! We need more - That's right. And we need more money. Three people. In Brainerd. ...Blood has been shed. Blood has been shed, Jerry. Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that. ...Who's Jean? Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera. Personal matters. So why don't you just ask him for the money? What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry? ...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks? - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any - You want your own wife kidnapped? I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. Yeah, you already said that. Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30. Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry. The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars. No, that's not it, Jerry.Yah, I don't need no sealant though. Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with. One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar! You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it! And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here! We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five! You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already! I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat! We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!Oh, don't be silly. Oh, don't be silly. Both of these. Yah, he - He's three now. Course, not in that picture. I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan. They can really take over, that's for sure. That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course. Any others? Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?Yah, got a front movin' in. Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in. Uh-huh - in what way? What'd this guy look like anyways? Oh sure. White Bear Lake? Ya got that right. I unnerstand. Uh-huh. Officer Olson. Mr. Mohra? Oh, yah? Twin Cities? Yah. Shep Proudfoot. That's a name. First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence. A Shep Proudfoot. The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night. No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs? Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?One of us pays the other for half. We split that. She started shrieking, you know. Clear him off the road. You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know. Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know. I need ...unguent. Unguent. I did. No. I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know. We stop at Pancakes Hause. Where is Pancakes Hause? Or your fucking wife, you know.They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities? No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even. Uh-huh. Yah. I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised. I dunno. Just funny-looking. Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking. Chaska.Yah. A subconscious-type thing. Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros. He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man. LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.Hold on. Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey. You know what a disparity is? And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me. You're not a C student. I'm talkin' about your potential.Okay, real good, then. ...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now - Yah, okay, but, uh - Yah, I got the money, but, uh - ...The heck d'ya mean? Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal! Oh, for Chrissakes here - Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I - This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal - The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in? Oh, geez. What the heck d'ya mean? What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here - My wife! What the - how's - Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh - Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it. So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters. Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy - Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble - Yah. Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out. Okay. Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and - Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then. Well, okay, it's - Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you - Huh? ...So I guess that's it, then. Here's the keys - Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here? You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super - Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off - One hunnert's the best we can do here. Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat. Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss... Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't - Yah, but this TruCoat - Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert - Yah, but that TruCoat - No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous - Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him. Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots. No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear. They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow. Yah! No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal. Yah, right - ...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about? Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee. Yah. You wouldn't have an extra ticket there? So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday? We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty... No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing! No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right. It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see. ...How ya doin' there, Scotty? ...Yah, okay... ...If it's so damned important to ya! Sure right now! You're darned tootin'! Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!

Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing. No, I - Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy - No. No, ma'am. ...Babe the Blue Ox? ...Brainerd? My father-in-law, he's the owner. Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager. What... What is it all about? Huh? Yah? Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez - It's okay, Scotty. ...Yah. Yah. Yah. Yah!

Okay, real good, then. I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya. Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then. Yah, how much money was that? Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then. Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy - Yah, well, they exist all right. But the deal's already done, I already got the money - Yah, so we're all set. But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the - Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it. Yah, real good. How you doin'?

Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera. I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess. Shep said 8:30. Yah, Shep Proudfoot said - Well... I'm goin' ta bed now. Yah. Okay. Yah, okay. Yah. No, see - The heck d'ya mean? No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone! Now come on here, no way, Wade! No way! You're darned tootin'! No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here! Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade. Well, they - No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we - Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back. No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime - No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see? Yah. Yah. ...Huh? Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty - Yah. No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal. No kiddin'? Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there? How ya doin', Wade? Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him. I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty - Yah, well, it's a chunk, but - I mean a parking lot. lot. It's a limited - Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money - Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata? ...Who they playin'? Whatcha watchin' there? Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya. Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see - Carl somethin'? Well, that's okay, I just - Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh - Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo? Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company. No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank. Yah, that's a good one. ...Geez. Oh... Yah? So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR. They don't got no match yet. ...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m. Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number. Yah... You don't think he's mixed up in - Yah, woulda been cold out here. No way. Yah. How's it look, Marge? Oh, yah? Yah? Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think? You had breakfast yet, Margie? Yah? Geez, you okay, Margie? Ya see something down there, Chief? Yah. Yah. Well - it's cold, Margie. Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here. Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.Ya got that right. Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow. Just a general way. Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'. So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story. Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption. And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.' And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?' So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.' So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk. ...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.' And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.' Yah, right-o. Yah. How ya doin'? ...I'll fix ya some eggs. Ya gotta eat a breakfast... Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge. I'll fix ya some eggs. I'll fix ya some eggs. Gotta go?You were such a super lady... and then I... I been so lonely... ...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've... No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and... I always liked ya so much... I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you... Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?... It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge... Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know... Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh... Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement. And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now. Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda? She was a year behind us. Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to - Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry. ...I was married to Linda Cooksey - Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here? Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that? Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson! Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good. ...What can I get ya? I see that! That's great! Geez! You look great! Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie! Oh, pretty good. Yah? Well, how the heck are ya? I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it! Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there. Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven. I hope I dint wake you.I love you, Margie. Yah, I guess. Yah. Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent. It's just the three cent. Yah. Three-cent stamp. Yah. Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good. Was it reasonable? You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there? Not on your feet too much? Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel? Yah, okay. How's the hotel? Yah, ya think? They're real good. Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year. Uh-huh. Thanks, hon. Yah? Love ya, Margie.Ya kiddin'! They're playin' the Buckeyes! You bet....What's the big deal? It's an hour - Oh, man! Yeah! Uh-huh. Uhn. Uh-huh. Yeah, but - Dad, I really think we should call the cops. What if - what if sumpn goes wrong? Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom? Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -Are you calling Stan? ...Is everything okay? Twice. Stan Grossman called. ...Dad?Nope. Call 'em up. Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him. I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy? Well, I don't vouch for him. Put you in touch with Grimsrud. Mm. Nope. Uh-huh. So? Nope. Yep. Nope.Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry. Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right? Yah. Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call? What's the next step here, Jerry? We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing. Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. You're sayin' - what're you sayin'? Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment. The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee. Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet. I'm tellin' ya. We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots. I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here. He's at Norstar. Congratulations, Jerry.What's this, sir? Can I see your license and registration please? You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window. This is a new car, then, sir?Where're you going? ...Dad? Good day, sir. My patience is at an end. Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department. This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me. Jerome Lundegaard? Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure.. Circumstances have changed, Jerry. Know who this is? All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself? Okay. No, no, fax is - Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on. Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money - No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing - I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me - Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist. Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me - Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month. That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I - Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. You're damned hard to get on the phone. Dad's here. Thank you, hon. How's Fargo? Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD? ...Chief Gunderson? Don't go in! Wait for back-up! Whose car? We've got a - Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em. Oh. Gary's loudmouth. Yah. Where are ya, Margie? Still missing. We're looking. - looking. Yah. Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant. Yah. His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday. Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her. Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now. No. No. They never married. Mike's had psychiatric problems. No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year. Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone. No. His wife? What'd he say? Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya. ...Hello? This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me? Margie Olmstead? Yah, is this Marge?Unghh... oh, geez... No Jean, no money! Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money! Where's my daughter? I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter? Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here. That's that. ...There's a million dollars here! They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional. He points at a briefcase. All the more reason! I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up. It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care? Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing! ... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million. Ah, dammit! Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional! A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter! Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go. - All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional! I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal. I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently. What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here. You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off? But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us. We're good to loan in. Stan and I're okay. What kind of finder's fee were you looking for? 2:30. Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman. We might be innarested. Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet. What's goin' on there? Jean and Scotty never have to worry. I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me. Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha! I know it's a lot. A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there? You told me about it. OOOoooh! His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd. Norstars. Yah, pretty good. Well... Why don't we... Well - He's at - What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl. This is do-able.Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be? Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then. I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud. Ya got the car? We been sitting here an hour. I've peed three times already. Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death... The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed. By freeing them. The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs - It's origin is unknown. The symbol does correspond to a dagger I acquired many years ago. May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long. She's coming back. Keep talking! Concentrate! She can hear you! Go ahead. I believe right now she may hear you. Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her. The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it - I'm going to need some blood. It must be from a woman. Your daughter's been taken. I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in... In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here. She would call me, and I would come by. She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly. Thank you. I believe she would have wanted it. May I come in? ...at her request. She was a very religious woman. You must be a Londrigan. Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass. Take care of the girl. Take care of your family. They are important. I wish I had an answer. Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems. But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us. I didn't do anything...God saved her... Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other - Keep talking! It will not take long... I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there. It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it! We must return it, if you want your daughter back. I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've been here before to cast evil from this house. The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals. It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost. Did you remove anything in the cellar! The amulet... Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over. And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us. Well there's no time like the present. Good night. Perhaps I'll see you in church. I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home. Well thank you for the offer, But I really have to go. Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul. She would hear things, see things... My name is Father Seamus. I'm from Holy Rood church. You must be the new tenants.We don't have proof of that. So many unanswered questions. Why was she buried there. And who killed her? What was her name? Did you find something? What's the matter? I feel something. It's faint, but...it's there... My God, I heard something! Take me to her. Where is she now? Where is she? White meat will be fine... I'm hungry enough to eat a horse. Maura. You've done your homework, Mrs. South. I'm not sure, but I can check. Did the events start before or after you discovered this? If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled. Where is your daughter? She might be able to give us some information. We usually find nothing. We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation. We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems. Unfortunately. I could see if I detect the presence of something. Not at all. I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be. I don't know! Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall! There's something through that wall! There's something in there. Do you mind if I borrow it? I see some faint lettering. It appears to be the...Runic alphabet? Where did you find this? Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at? Not someone. Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before. Looks like we have some animal hairs in here. Maybe some kind of a rodent. Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that. Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend. A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds. That would include myself and an assistant. No. But I'm a clairvoyant. I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.Good-bye. I'm sorry. How's your arm? Are you all right? No! Why don't you pass me your plate? Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us. I have to admit I was skeptical. Until now. How did you meet Dr. Shea? Thank you. If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around here? What will they tell you? Suppose not. Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal - Good night Angel... Well, that all depends. Oh my God! She's in there! Don't be afraid! Fight it back Aubrey. Fight it back as hard as you can! We're here Aubrey! Look, don't be afraid. We want you to come back to us... That's great, honey. That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life. For good luck honey. He's blessing the house. Ok. If you want this room, you can have it. Sure. Did you see the others? I'm all right... Are you all right? Maura! No... NO! Not going! Are you out of your mind?! Wait! Maura, what is this! What are you talking about? What? Know what? No. You two are the most important things in my life. I don't ever want to lose you. You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we? You don't have any doubts about me, do you? Ok... It doesn't matter to me. What do you mean by that? Aubrey! Aubrey?! Aubrey?! I think everything's ready. A friend? What are you talking about? Whoa there... It just disappeared. Literally. I'm being realistic. Look, I have a spiritual side. I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house. That should count for something. Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house. Oh come on! Who? There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something. Who knows? I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting. Well, I try to keep an open mind, but... Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened. So what are you saying? It was in the cellar. Weird. No. The heater's here. ...set up some more things. Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly. I just want to... No. Maybe it was Aubrey. I don't know. That's strange. What? God rest her soul. Or what she was worth. Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her? To our family. Whatever you say. Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura. It's over. You know that. Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it. She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment. What will Aubrey think? Oh come on... What's the matter? Who knows... we have to get used to living around here. Maybe good help is hard to find. The place is pretty dusty. Yeah I'll look into that tonight. Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here... We'll be there. Yes, they are. What's going to happen? I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did... The rain is letting up. It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey. Think about us. We're here for you, we love you... How long will it take! What are you getting at! So what does that have to do with Aubrey! Where is she! What...amulet? This isn't happening... We'll never know for sure. Good night. Thank you. Did you have dinner, father? We have plenty. What was she afraid of? How can I help you? And you...are? Well what is it! What? Not at all, if it can help. Runic? It was nailed to the cellar wall. Not really. Oh, wait a minute. So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here? And what would you do? Oh.Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy? Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz. Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered. Reporters, Jerry. They been callin' all night. "Something in the way. Yeah." "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings... I see what you're saying.Ten seconds, Rod. It's only a half-hour show, Rod. -- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars. Playing in the state where you grew up.You know I didn't ever want to hurt you. No. I'm not trying to make history. _ 67. Listen to me, it's over. There is something missing here. It's over -- Listen to me! -- stop -- I think you added the "brutal." Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty.. Go ahead. Jump right on into my nightmare. The water's warm. _ 65. Look, I don't want a -- Everything's on the fucking run! Everything -- Could you just stop moving? What do I do? How do I spin this? This can't be happening to me. It's a plan -- -- _ 51. Well, no you didn't -- I know. Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there -- Now. Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?" Okay, this is working. That's right. I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time. Seventy-two clients. ONE stayed. Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44. "Dad says we gwan sleep on it. The power move is to go unannounced. Black suit, right? One of the accountants. I know about the bachelor party. You know. I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything! Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop. Just be friendly and say "no comment." Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario. It's big. Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make. Wait. What do you mean? Let me think about that. Want something to drink? Airight. Enough. I'm pulling him out of this. This isn't what I had in mind anyway. Bill, Rod, wait -- ... this is... uh... too funny... You're imagining it. Oh come on -- This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room. Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you. I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you. I missed my wife. We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh -- I love you. You complete me. So this break... is a break-up. What about Ray? I don't like to give up. What if it's true? "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on. It's the theme of my bachelor film -- Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way? ...my soul or something. _ 117. You want... Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run. I stick. Tell me -- let me help -- What -- Why do you love me? Well, when you wonder, ask me. I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible. Will you marry me? If I said that, would you stay? What -- So I'll see you this weekend. Sure you're okay to drive this? And I appreciate that impulse. Another time, okay Dorothy? Easy, easy -- Oh hell yes. Right. I'll come in. Same to you. Well -- this would be goodnight. What? No no no. I just underestimated her... her temper, I guess. Why are we even talking about this? It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it -- Bye you guys. _ 88. Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were... Wow. That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie. You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that. I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk -- -- but we have a company here to think about. I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again. We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere. Look, the other night, I want to apologize. I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and -- Good. Good. Glad is good. Happy. He said "happy?" Well, good evening. No, I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm like... harrassing you... right now. Now I feel like Clarence Thomas. Oh shit. You said "boss." Sorry about this hand. You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment? Mission... statement... Me too. Sure. And I am... We will be fine! Good idea. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Do you have something to drink? And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted. Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here. Yeah. That too. I broke up with Avery. I'm glad you're home. That "alone" thing is... not my specialty... Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy? Hi. Yep. Have a good time at school, Ray. Wish me luck. Thanks. Happy for us. It's all going to work. We're going to save the world. It's all going to work. Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back. I re-signed Cush. We're set. Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery -- No, that's fine. What calls came in today? Hello? Same to you. But I mean really... wonderfully... great. Give me your number. I'll call tomorrow. I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now. But it's going to be great. Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know. Wonder what he said. Dorothy. Ray. A pleasure. I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and... You think so? No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it. I already had my bachelor party. It was called "my twenties." See you later. No no. I knew. Well, take care. Now what did you lose? I know who y6u are. You're Dorothy Boyd. You're in... wait... you're in Accounts. You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body. Can I help? No no... Now. Wait. You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign. Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing -- I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door. So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back? Said who? Sugar? Do I know everything there is to know here? You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you? Denver got very silent about a day ago. San Diego's got a fever for Cush. This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft. People get crazy. And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight. Million. I'll give it everything. It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him. You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go. Oh, thank you. Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI. But to me -- I missed ya. What can I say? Go. Flee. We still having dinner in L.A.? Fine. Airight. Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player. You play with your head. Not your heart. In your personal life? Heart. But when you get on the field -- _ 113. Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on -- Look. I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you. Are we really "friends?" Damn right. No, I'm going to answer you. You want an answer? I'll give it to you. Loyalty. She was loyal. Everything grew from there. You're jabbing at me. _ 112. Not everyone has what you have. No, you're -- Why are you doing this to me, Rod? I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer? What's that supposed to mean? Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster. Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan. We can still take the offer, Rod. I'm a little worried -- No. I didn't "shoplift the pooty." We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who -- Alright, I shoplifted the pooty. The kid is amazing. But I sure don't like that she's leaving. No, I don't know. How do I know? Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego. What do you know about dating a single mother? Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career? Rod, get on the camel. I'll get you some quick work -- It's a risk. If you get injured, you get nothing. I'm out here for you! You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you. Forget it. Forget it. Fine. Rod, I'm not a rascist. I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid. It wasn't just about the money, was it? No, I'm saying to be -- You. Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and -- Great word. Towel? But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82. That's your word? I understand your anxiety. Uh, not today, but -- Oh my God. Another drink please. Why not? It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69. The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic -- See this jacket I'm wearing? You like it? I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom! Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale! What are you doing with me, Rod? Rod -- Very much. Call me tomorrow. Get some sleep. See you tomorrow. I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money." I gotta get back to Cushman. Yeah. And it might have even worked too. At last I find you. Show. Me. The. Money. I got it. Yes. Mmm. Hmm. Now you want Arizona dollars. Okay. Which they do. And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew. So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies. We're getting married in February. But wait... Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet. And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know. And I decide I'm not going to propose. The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't. And she knows I know. So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that. We fly to Honolulu in silence. We check into the Pro Bowl hotel -- To the pools. Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz." Exactly. And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there. A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months. Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months. It's like --ka- boom. The curse of 18 months. --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui... She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now... I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet. I think you'll know when you see him at the gate. Well. Good luck with that -- Jerry Maguire. SMI. Where'd you find the perfect white shirt? I have to ask. Alright, I'm freaking too. But they need you to stay calm. I'll call back. _ 124. Keep the phone open. I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there. He took a shot. He's unconscious. Don't be silly. Marcee -- Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem. I'll go back to them. Damn right. Marcee, things are changing around here. You and Rod will have my total personal attention. Not a chance. How can I make your life better? Marcee. How's my favorite player's wife? SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be? You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone. You'd be my only client on that team... -- and I'll get 'em. I'm over it. Now I want all my clients and yours too. You'll lose. Dick. You... Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene... Pardon me? I'm fine. What's up? Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet... Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock. Dooler, you know Bob Sugar. It's in a cage. Do not be scared of... -- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo. Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of... Right up ahead, buddy -- A lot. We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy. Funny. We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands. Yeah I know. I did. Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed. Okay. I've been hogging it. You're right. _ 76. Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad. Hi Ray. They do, my brother. Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars? Thanks. May I offer you both a ride?We signed an hour ago. You were in the lobby with the black fella. I'm sorry, I -- Hey, I'm learning as I go. Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you. Not right now, Jerry. What happened to Denver? You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak. Denver is where he should be. I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play. Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him. We decided to stay with you.I'm scared. What is it? Show me the animal, Jerry! What's going on, Jerry? Funny... I better go to bed. I don't see any. I won't tell. You said "fuck". Let's go right now. Let's go to the zoo. Let's go the zoo. And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo? Hi. I'm not your brother! No. One-two-three, swing.I've got the clients. I've got the juice. You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always. We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters -- Jerry -- You wanted smaller. Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face! What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor! Can you get past yourself for a second? ... dick? You did this to yourself. You said "fewer clients." You put it all on paper. Scully was very upset. Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him. You did this to yourself -- I know. It sucks. I suck. Came here to fire you, Jerry. I came here to let you go. _ 27. You okay? Pleasure. Cronin's okay for lunch? The best commercial director in the business. I hail you.I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth. He should have kept his head tucked down. What'd I say? He's gonna have nothing left for next season. They're letting him kill himself. That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too. That about says it... Oh yes. Jerry Maguire! My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan. I... I love everybody, man. I love my wife. My kids. Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee. My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out? No, Roy. I'm not gonna cry. Thanks for coming. Jerry! You made it -- Only 'cause my wife likes your wife! Beautiful. I don't want to be friends anymore. I think so. Why not -- For loyalty, you buy a dog. For love, you get married. That's an answer. I'm sorry I asked. Then why'd you get married? I'm asking you as a friend. I'm trying to talk to you. How's your marriage? I'm asking you a question -- You don't want to go home, do you? Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone. Don't I know. Now go home to your wife. I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers. Hey, that's my word, okay? No. I'm worried too. I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago. Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on. Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man. He's gonna get me killed. Well, this was another way to go. You never had The Talk, did you? Shame on you. SHAME on you. No. A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom. Well, that ain't fair to her. A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103. Then you gotta have The Talk. You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know? First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her? Oh I know plenty. I was raised by a single mother. Oh, we gonna be friends now? Dude, know your art form. If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful. There's no need for a camel... you got ME. Good deal, man. Won't happen. I'm strong in my mind. You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude. And I dig that about you. No tell me. _ 84. What's wrong. Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance. "Love me love me love me... put me on t.v." That's the iconography of rascism, man! You're telling me to dance. Is that your porty or mine? No, I air-dry. I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan. Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package. The kwan. -- the kwan. Maybe you don't. Because it's not just the money I deserve. It's not just the "coin." It's the... John Taylor. J.J. Stokes. Andre Rison. I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table. Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?" Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money. Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops! My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years. What's my family gonna live on? What you get me. So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya." You are not allowed to act this way. No. Well, boo-fucking-hoo. Huh? You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow! You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother? You love me now, don't you? I might call you later! Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake? I'm a very good singer, man -- Good. I was just testing ya. But just you saying that? Makes me love ya. You're loving me now, aren't ya? Okay, I understand. I'll boil it down for ya. Fuck Nike. All they do is ignore me... You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there? Did I ever tell you my Nike story? Let's do it again. I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby? Why the fuck am I here? I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom. Congratulations. You're still my agent. Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it? Say it with me. Here it is. "Show me the money." Show. Me. The. Money. _ 36. It's a very personal, very important thing. It's a family motto. So I want to share it with you. You ready? -- now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening? Exactly. And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look! And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water. Say hello to Jerry Maguire -- Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity. I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby. Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS. Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!! Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.So? Just shut up. I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower-- I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends. Catholic school, nasty. And what did she do? It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business. Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad-- I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste. You think I can't learn that? I can fix cars. They stole our land-- Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year. They're not going to jail. So? I can't take any more school. You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun. Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here-- If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends. I don't know what the big deal is.What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old. If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen. Just wondering. A .45-- You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm? Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on. Everybody on the border knows that story. Yeah. That badge-- Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records-- We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones. Yeah, this is Skinny. Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county. I hear they're closing that post down. How's business? Sam the Man.Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me. There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy. Whole different story; isn't it? You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye? I'm not picking it up. That's not the point. It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up. So? What's that for?My father says the day you're born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own. So I'm part-Indian? So how come you got into all this? He's still pissed off about it. I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know-- Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more-- No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's-- Are you kidding? And face a court- martial? That guy who got shot-- You know who I am? But they were Indians themselves. They fought against the Indians? So they stayed in Florida? The Trail of Tears. He a Black man or an Indian? No sir. Cool. Yeah. He lives here, right? Are we going to ever see your father? Fine. I'm pretty much moved in. You wouldn't? You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive. I finished that. I'm just messing around. I have a B average. Dad, I talked to the track coach-- Dad, can I talk to you about track? Dad--? Dad--My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day-- Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man? Something like that. Fifteen years in El Paso. This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber. Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.You're dismissed. If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction. He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena-- He'll live. It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here-- So you knew this young man before? What's it doing on a rifle range? This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber-- It's a .45. Mikey look at this-- Mikey-- Mikey-- Hey, Mikey-- Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man-- Maybe. I think it's beyond what you'd call dating. You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here? Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then-- The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything, You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore-- Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear. It's not just cactus. There's the nopals, the yuccas-- I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head. It's a lead mine. Lead mine. They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year. I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that. You could take it-- We should just do it. Seriously, I think we should get married. Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course. She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood. Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack-- He'll probably be getting a medical discharge-- Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday. Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth. Old bullets. He uhm-- makes art with them. That ring-- This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold. --but just as a kind of safety tip. --warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored Take that pair over in the corner-- You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar. --but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout. Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--You're dismissed, Private. Why don't you start with that? Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers? Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post? Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"? Chaos. Because it's a job? With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service. Do whatever they tell you-- How do you think I got to be a colonel? Please. Well? And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country? Who's "they"? What exactly do you think your job is, Private? You don't sound too enthusiastic. Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson? When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement. Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs? Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army? My mother said he never asked about-- It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command. I'm a colonel. Uncle Al-- Where'd he get all this? I never met her. You've been in this house for a while? If it's too late-- Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in? You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out-- Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over. He does. My father. Good. How's your room shaping up? No. Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life. So you're going into the Army? Tanks, huh? Homework? How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point? I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough-- Big O was always there with a smile or a loan or a free drink. "Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?" Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life. I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to. I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it? Substance abuse? Have we had trouble there before? Why would you want to do that? And people make their choice-- I hear things, too. People call you the Mayor of Darktown. The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is. That's right. We have an enlisted man's club at the post. I assume a lot of your business is from our people. So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits. Nice to meet you, Ma'am. Deal drugs in the bathroom-- You get much of that in here? That where he was shot? Black Seminoles?Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun-- Protection? Reputation? Eladio Cruz. I haven't seen anybody doing that. Not much, jefe. Some watermelons. No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.] Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.] Como se llama? [What's your name?] No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.] Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way! Aqui! [Here!]Senora, anything it costs, I can work-- Donde vamos? [Where are we going?] We have a daughter. I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child-- Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.] No es la verdad--[That isn't true--] No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--] They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa-- We was crossin' the river-- We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water-- I have some friends who have had a accident-- Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--] Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid] Senora Cruz? Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction-- Is very beautiful, your car. Es muy lindo, su coche--Your mother was a saint. Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him. That Buddy was a cool breeze. '57, 1 believe-- Tell that one, Hollis-- They just wanted it to be one of theirs-- Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish-- Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park? Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P-- He was a unique individual. Buddy Deeds. He had a way.--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation. We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him. He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail. "Mas cerveza por favor." And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county. The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58-- Hell, everybody heard that story a million times. That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people. Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him. King wasn't Mexican, Fenton-- Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected. Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man. He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it." "Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!" Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it. Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late-- The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help. Buddy Deeds-- Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met-- Hey, Sam. You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that? Do you? I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't. We have a murder? Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something. And I understand why you might want to think he could. We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business. There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years. No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though. You think it's Charley Wade, huh? He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O-- I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's-- Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body? Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie? Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color-- You go by your old house? Sounds great. Where do I sign up? Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky-- Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well-- Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning. Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town. She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part. Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news-- There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben-- Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail-- There was a mandate in the last election-- He agreed it wasn't exactly news-- I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story. Sam-- We're building up tourism, Sam--They were using M-1's, yeah-- Yeah? What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here. If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine-- Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains-- I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part-- Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice. But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse. You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy? You going to get married? Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder. Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole. We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much. He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey! Cliff-- Cliff-- Looks like a lot of cactus to me. You finding lots of cactus and shit? Right. What? This place is a gold mine. Appreciate it, sir. Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since-- You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch-- There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof. By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it. These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor-- When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him. Didn't have a father? Well-- PDA? He's a pretty tough old man, huh? You didn't go telling your father you were here? I got a pretty good guess. They were in the Army. Like your father. Same as they done in Mexico. Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche-- They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass. They teaching that now? Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee. He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma-- Both. Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse. Go out through the back. You weren't in here tonight, were you? Because I'm your father. I gonna meet that family of yours? A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other-- Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place. Right. I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here. Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call. Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born. This is an official visit, then-- So. This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore. If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands. It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out-- That's where he fell. Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission. Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up. I'm not open. We were just talking. Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side. Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged. What about it? Could of been. That was white people's business. Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope. I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood. He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you? Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade-- It could have just been a box lunch from the jail. And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day. He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people-- That's how I ruined my stomach. Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal. Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s. I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest. It was for personal consumption. Three months. Time marches on. Morning, Sheriff.Well, it's a complicated issue-- I didn't want to be going around your back. How 'bout you? Yeah. Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me-- Oh. They got telephones. The Republicans? Uh-huh. Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately. You're out early. Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today? Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before. Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape-- This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come. Just doing my job. You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now-- Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here-- No, Sheriff, I'm just-- You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up-- Otis, apologize to the Sheriff-- Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail. You got to investigate. No question about it. So is Buddy on your short list? He swore by it. What? Colt Peacemaker. So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack. You got a cause of death? You know the popular version of how he left town. --it didn't come out of a cereal box. Charley Wade. Nice job. Skinny? That the word on our boy? Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops. September '97, that's all she wrote. Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated. Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down. You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you. I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter. What? It wasn't just you, Bunny. Suppose not. You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's-- No. You? Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there? Best part of the job. Same weight I always was. You were in a fight-- Yeah, well-- You look good-- No, you look good. I was just wondering. Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication? You still going to all the home games? Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore-- That's in Maverick County. Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz? Made some money, came back here-- You lived in the States for a while? You own this place? Pleased to meet you. Treasure hunter? Masons been around a long while. I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work. I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio. Yeah. I bet he would. You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job. Good deal you were born down here, then. If the next guy's a redneck. When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office. Hey, folks-- We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school-- We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow-- We don't need a new jail. Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue-- Seems like we have another one every week. Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have. And the ten thousand? Buddy Deeds was a murderer. Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy-- Imonna find out one way or the other. Open late. Fellas. I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight. I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back. I got an idea what happened. Charley Wade. You thought any more about our murder? Morning, Hollis. People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it. And Buddy was one of them. Besides my father, I mean. Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there? He still living? Bledso You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you? All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge. You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason? We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time. No. I haven't been out here for a while. Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer-- I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons. Right. Never heard from him again? That so? --Santiago. I heard there was a bit of a fuss. Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail. It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters-- Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time. The Perdido thing? You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"-- People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon-- Do you remember the last time you saw him? People didn't complain? And my father? He squeezed money out of you? You had to deal with him in running the club. So you must remember Sheriff Wade. He had the club out on the old trail road-- You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick? I've seen 'em. Yeah, that's the story of my life. I'm Sheriff Deeds-- Mrs. Bledsoe? Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade. He ever accept cash for a favor? What was your deal with him? And when my father was Sheriff? That was the night he disappeared? And that was the last time you saw him? Murdered him? I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans-- You built our patio while you were on the county? Well, you were working there-- So I've heard-- I'm surprised he bothered with it. I thought he busted you a couple times. You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana? You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight. How much you got left? Hey, Pete. How's it going? Yeah-- If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you. I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of-- He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him. Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry-- Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it-- You have any idea when your father died? Eladio? You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other? What was your father's name? Pilar-- I've felt that way, yeah. Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on. Two years. More, I hope. I don't know. It just feels good. Always did. Yeah. I came back 'cause you were here. You know the other day, you asked why I came back? Nothing. Yeah. Yeah. Pilar-- You've got your mother, your kids-- I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows. Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me-- It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack. Fernando did okay, and he dropped out-- No-- Nice-looking kid. Your boy, there-- Yeah. Most people did, yeah. They cooked the whole thing up without asking me. She's done well for herself--on her own and all-- I see she built a place up here by the river. Your mother still doesn't like me. Want to take a walk? Field trip? He's all yours. Yeah. I'll go check on your boy. I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since. I'll see what's going on. Got him here? Something wrong? You think we need a new jail? I appreciate you telling me. Don't know if I'll still want it. You'd do a good job. They want you to stand for Sheriff next election. Gotta be in person. No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody. I'm going over to the other side. I been working on a few things. Yeah. Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later. Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club. The shooter local? Sure. Yeah. It's quiet-- I haven't seen anybody come by. What's up? You know who it was? Another woman? No-- You think he killed anybody in Korea? So when did Buddy leave? Hell of a spot to put a business. You sell much out here?You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo. White man just using you to keep the Black man down. You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch-- You don't need to cuff me.You little pissant-- You're fired. You're outta the department. Who said anything about shootin' anybody? You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son. You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon-- There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys. I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera." Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens. Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that. You carryin' a firearm, son? Don't lie to me now. There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection. Bandidos, Injuns-- You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio-- This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo? I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road. What's in the back? Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?] And people better clear out of here! Now! What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law-- You telling me what to do, Roderick? That the problem, son? You Slow? Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there. How come you don't took familiar? Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that. As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son? Why you think that was? I sent your Daddy to the farm once. One of Cleroe Payne's boys? Otis what? I know you?The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is-- Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through. If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later. Me neither. They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this? For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on. Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out. But you don't see much competition, do you? How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much. --but longhorns are hard to come by these days.Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz. Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--] No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!] Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]Been away. Up to Houston. Runnin' numbers illegal. I know that. Uh-huh. Payne. Name's Otis.It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other. He's gonna find out. You going to tell him?You believe that? So? What's he gonna do, arrest us? He doesn't need to know all my business. You going to tell her?The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella-- I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud. We'll get 'em-- So you livin' out here now? We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way. Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.To friends. Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... Come on! You asked for my help. You asked for my help...come on... C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.Maybe we don�t have to know what he looks like. If he�s got that list, he�s going to want to check it. We should be looking for laptops. Nothing but civilians, Gene. What kind of show. But why tell us? What�s Hunt doing on the TGV? Only four more cars. What about him...? Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing he's always wanted! The NOC list! That's S.O.P.. So what do you suggest? Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.I always have, Claire.. Claire. Claire...Hey... Of course - I�m sorry to hear you say that Claire. You are my eyes. Stay with him. Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is he from Luther? Is this the only way? I sent the message to Max. We�re on for tomorrow. He's expecting my call. I'm going to the station... And I'm going to call him. Kittridge... We did what we had to do. What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe. I just need you to be safe. I didn't say that. It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away. May I come in? We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local. You're sure about this? I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job. I'm going to answer it. Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me. I've been disavowed. They think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list. Who sent you?! Who sent you? Did they send you...Did they send you? That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here? Where were you? Take off your God damn coat! Take off your coat. There was nobody on the bridge. Don't give me that! I was on the bridge. Shut up! I saw you. You were in the car. You were in the car! Don't move. Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes. If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch. Talking's good, walking's better. Walk, just walk. Start walking. We got it. On your feet. If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse? Can I ask you something, Kittridge? I see you've been out visiting the folks. Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset. How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole. This whole operation was a molehunt. But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. The arms dealer. Let's see if you can follow me around this room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. Why ? Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight. Why was there another team? Who else is left? You mean I've lost enough agents for one night. Yeah. I follow you. Yeah. No sir. You�re in Prague? Yes. I don�t think so. Do you read me? The list is in the open ! They knew we were coming. Golitsyn�s dead too. The disk is gone. My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- don�t know They�re dead. Go secure. Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way. He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough. Gotta catch my flight.. So. How's it feel being a solid citizen again? Just don't know why I'd be doing it. It's all one big negotiation, isn't it? You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? You're more than that, Luther. They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it. They want you back in. Here's to you, Luther. To being off the disavowed list. Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys. About what? I'll get you close. Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing? Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it. Now I want you to hold onto it. Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down. Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses. May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you. You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks. This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of. What'd they used to call you? The Net Ranger? Phineas Phreak? The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom. Profitable. Information. What about Job? It doesn�t, dear girl. as long as you tell me where the money is. I wouldn't dream of it. I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money. How will you make sure Job will be there? Ten million. Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached. And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange. What was your deal with Job? Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine? Okay, use it. But I suggest pack up first. Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car? Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits. Because I can deliver the actual NOC list. The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location. Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. That's the question I want to ask Job. I'm NOC. Was. Now disavowed. Like Job? The disk Job sold you is worthless. It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That depends. Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. I need one hundred thousand dollars. Let's move! Do you want to blow the fire through the whole building? I gotta go in there and shut it down! What sector's the air conditioning? What's the matter, you don't know this trick? My contact is extremely shy. We're not outta here yet. Time up. Zero body count. In Langley. IMF mainframe. Simple game. Four players. Exfil opens the pocket -- -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. Stairway, you�re wrapped, go to transport. In position. Jack open the door, let the package roll. He's got it. Saved your ass again Jack. Jack. Jack. Give me the God damn gum. Always. IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! Jack. No, we�re going to recover the disk, understand?! Now move! Sarah eye on the package. Jim, I�m coming to you. Jim we can�t. Jim. Jim. He�s in the open. OK. Taking Golitsyn's exit. Jack, open the doors. Right, right. Good. Higher. Higher. I'd say you've got about two minutes. I'm willing to take the chance. I don't communicate very well through a shroud. Then what am I doing here? I thought I was going to see Max. Why? Jim, it�s over. You�re wrong about one thing. I�m not the only one who�s seen you alive. Aren�t you going to thank me Jim. Ten million is better than six. Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town? I knew about Jim. Before London. But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago. And get a doctor. Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash. I�ll call you from Paris. You�re probably right. Jim...? If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. I�ll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train. Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris. A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris. What he didn�t get in Prague. The NOC list. We don�t have to, Jim. He�ll come after us. How did Kittridge do it?.. Kitteridge. Oh my god! Kittridge is the mole? Jim, who do you think you're kidding? A doctor's gotta look at that. You can't sit up straight. I remember.. You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street. Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records - - and picked us up in the States - About two hundred yards from the bridge. Negative , Golitsyn�s on the move. Can you lose him? We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times. Sure. If the main character does. He won't be back in a hurry? Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? You're going to use Walter? How was Chicago? Why not? I guess. What problem? Tell you what? Oh? What's the problem? I thought I'd take some now. Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.Wait! Hold it - it's on. Let's go. Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off. Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.Roger that. Opening doors now. Give me a break, Pops. I didn't touch it. Just don't chew it. Sorry, am I interrupting? Just waiting for you, tubs. Claire. And a lonely ass. Too wicked to have a drink later? That's what we do isn't it? Why don't you take a look? What's going on? No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now? Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge. Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here. Can you hear me?Yes, Anatoly, yes. His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. You're right, of course. They'll kill me. I don't remember what happened! We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.Good idea. This is bullshit - we don�t even know what Max looks like. I don�t know. It didn�t say on the tickets. He�s putting on a show, Barnes. High speed train. No-one gets on. No- one gets off. High security. Good place for a pass off to Max. And if we don�t find him - we�ll search the whole train again. You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops. Understand? It never happened. Okay! Think , for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face! What does Ethan Hunt want ?! S.O.P.. Let's not waste time chasing him. Make him come to us. Everybody�s got pressure points. Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze. What can we do, Barnes? Put a guy at the airport? How many identities do you think Hunt has? How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries? These guys are trained to be ghosts. We taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake! The man's gone black, Barnes. He's under until he decides to surface. I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me? Certainly Ethan. It's Hunt. What do you need for a pinpoint? Been watching a little T.V., have you? Kittridge. Ethan, I can understand you're very upset. Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan. So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane... Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said. You survived. Correct the actual list is safe at Langley. "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours. That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations. We have a penetration. The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max." You're right. Maybe this'll save some time. I don't quite follow you. What? Yes. I see your point. You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan. We've lost enough agents for one night. Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley. Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. Follow me? I can't tell you how sorry I am. I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan. Personally as well as professionally. One hour. Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Don�t disappoint me. Location green. One hour. I�ll be there myself. Don�t think , be sure . Are you clean? Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay? Were you followed? Are you intact ? Are you damaged? Who�s dead? Go ahead. This is Kittridge.Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you? Not while I'm holding this. May take a little time. If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA. Is he serious? That's not it. That's not the list. You're not going to any meeting without me. Merci. We'll see. Where exactly is it? Bank?Oh man...I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable. You really liked Phelps, didn't you? Why don't you come back with me? I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it. Sure. They want me back in so I won't break in! They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it. Hey, I'm the flavour of the month! The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards. Reach your folks? How they feeling? It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close. I'm not letting this list get out in the open. What makes you trust me? Krieger did have the NOC list. I can't just hack my way inside. There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone. I'd have to be physically at the terminal. And I get to keep the equipment when we're done. Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- with the artificial intelligence Risk chip -- You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto. Cray access. STU 3's -- There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that.. With that exceptional piece of work. What kind? What are we downloading?Forty-four. Forty-five. Very well. If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely. Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say. You misunderstood. No one sees Max. You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission. Would you remove your hat please? It�s working. I always check the batteries. It�s not working. Connection denied. Yes... It�s him. Twenty minutes. Thirty-two and change. Twenty-six, twenty-seven. So far so good.Now we don�t have to eliminate him? You like that, don�t you Claire? Don�t you? Fold it. Fold it tight. Satisfied? Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them? Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well, Claire, you�ve asked the question and you are the answer. Two minutes til Krieger shows. This�ll have to be quicker than I�d like. Certainly quicker than you�d like. Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan? Ethan - I�ve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you. Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye. Don�t flatter yourself - six was for Eastern Europe . You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too. Keep counting Claire. But, he didn�t know about you. In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods. "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbour�s wife", Ethan. Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it. And like all the world�s lovers, he�s tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?" They stamped it, didn�t they? Those damn Gideons. Good luck. You got it. I usually am. - no. She can�t know about me. No one can. Not til this is over. There�s too much at stake, Ethan. I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking I�m dead and gone. God knows what she�s had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I.. Tight security. No guns. Real plus. Jesus, Ethan. Good for you. What�s going to make him do that? ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>. The son-of-a- bitch! How <i>dare</i> he? You realize it�s over, you�re an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, you�ve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year. Kittridge, we�ll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time! Yeah. I can sit up straight. I just can't..sit up straight very well. It's not important! I saw who shot me. Ethan, I saw the mole. It was Kittridge. <i>Kittridge!</i> Hey, I showed 'em to you! - so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy. - but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places.. ..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases. They�re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications. Repeat. Cut all radio communications. Where are you? Abort. That�s an order. No. Abort. I�ve got a shadow. Jack's pinned down Sarah. Should be a second. Keep dancing. If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable? No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work? Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. He's our guy. Wonderful. Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel. You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years? His wife's got a year old kid. So he says "All right. Who was it? My friend Harry?" She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy." She says it wasn't Sammy. "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou." "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!" Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out. Ethan, you can't burn out. Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here? When you started noticing your short term memory loss. What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev? I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me. What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too. A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want. After this one.If I did-I don't-now. I think you mean that. Me? This is it, Betty. They'll find us again, fog or no fog. Shut up! Cut it out! Even if I have to kill both of us-- Would I want to? You think Magruder wants to hang beside me? Who'd believe it but you? I took him out to sea and threw him in the water. Even if they find him, what connects him with me? Mitchell was dead enough. Mine? It wasn't the time or place. Don't worry about the note, baby. I'm playing for my neck now. I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since. Don't go soft on me, baby. I've got your note in my pocket. You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it. It has to be found in exactly the right place. Magruder obliged me. No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up. I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore. Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing. Not this one. And not Mitchell. No. I paid him off. It buys things, just like any other kind. Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father. I thought it was a legitimate business. He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies. I never saw the pies. They had names. For the record. Innocent names. You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you? So could you. But our records were a little against us. In a way. I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune. Most of it pretty dirty money. I don't care to have that known. Including Killaine. That's right. That, and the fun of it. Wonder what? Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink. Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now. Cold? There would be a moon tonight. See anything? Killaine's wise. We can't wait any longer. Here, put this on. But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor. I'll tell you when. Well? My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am. I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail. It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so. It did, but it never paid off-- until now. I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway. You'll be safe here. I won't be long. Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there. You can make coffee if you like. The best interference runner we've got. He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman. Come here, baby. If they had any reason to. Why make it tough for themselves? Why go to all that trouble? Here's an open book. Close it. No reason to keep it open. She was a nice girl, anyway. And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose. Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know. Give her the benefit of the doubt. Leave her stay where she is. Close the book. Finis. Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere. Of course she might have run away--if she knew how. And where to go. She might have dyed her hair. Bleached it before probably. And changed her name again. But look at this note. And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there. Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that. Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance. I run over to Victoria. Play some golf with some people I know. Do it all the time. That's why I have a cabin cruiser. Custom- built.Forty knots. Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure. Member of six golf clubs. Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course. You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie. Came alone? Sure. He always comes alone. Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man. This is the ace, Betty. But not of spades. They'll find out about the other. They might know already. And when they get this-- What would they look for? Where? Out there somewhere? How bad is the other thing? The secret? How bad is it? Bad enough for-- There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note. After you're gone where would they look for you? Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser. And I have a pocket full of money. And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me. If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty. Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine? I know. Killaine has a warrant. No percentage in that. You're probably mistaken about that. Let's get together sand talk it over. There's always a solution to these problems. But it must be near the water. Quite near-- Yes, if you don't mind waiting. Cant be too close for me. Right across the street from it suits me. Anything else listed? I don't think that's on the market anymore. I'd like something much closer to the water. It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact? From you, I like it. That's the second round I've lost tonight. That fellow hurt me. No use waiting, then. It still doesn't matter if I kiss you? Try not talking. Anything I can do about it? Why? Us? He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me. He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it. We'll find out. Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby? Couldn't be. Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no. I didn't notice him. I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it. Why not? Want to dance? At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks. Cold? I'm different. I like it fine. Just who are you, anyway? Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us. So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance. Quarter after one. Why? He could hardly help suspecting you. Bad? You didn't have to tell him that. Want a spike in it? It's always a mistake to run away. Always. You tried to run away. I'd rather wait until it does matter. He was a great boy for that. What else? Nice of him. How did you meet him? They'll know whether he killed himself. Sure... but somebody always does.. He got in here how? What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells. Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy. I know it's a littler late for an apology. Dance? He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor. Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good. Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it. I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone. Whatever you say. I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself. No. Are you really going to drink that stuff? I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests. Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you? No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But.. If you really want a good dry Martini.. Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb. It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome. It might be worth a Martini to you. A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored. Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one. Sit down then. We often have a double up here. You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time. This way. Who's Goble? All right. Get him. Morning. Any calls? I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's. There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night Got the information on you? A thousand. You mentioned information. For two hundred? For five hundred, what do I get? If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign. I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose. That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck? What have you got on Miss Mayfield? What are your rates? Private eye? Name it. I'm still asking. What do you want? Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning. I'm not interested in blind dates. Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him. Leave that one lay. Sometimes. You, Killaine? What'll you have, Margo? Let me introduce you. Mr. Killaine, Mrs. West. Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together? I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you. How are your teeth getting along? Who told you my name? So you're not a cop. All right, let's see the buzzer. You asked me where it all came from. I had a father who knew how to steal. I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately. Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it. Wait a minute. I'll go with you. You forgetting the gag line, Killaine. The police don't take anything for granted. Where would she go, anyway. Don't tell me you haven't got her covered. No idea. Romeo in reverse. Uh-uh. No sale, Killaine. Mitchell was too drunk. How could Mitchell? After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in? And old man Clarendon? He had a motive, too. Margo and her money. Your concentrating too hard, Killaine. What about Margo West? She had a motive. I guess you know by this time whose gun it was? That COULD BE TOLD. Don't kid me. You don't think she murdered Mitchell. You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up? Doesn't answer the question. Would that make me a heel? That must hurt. A couple of hours. Could we discuss that some other time? I wouldn't know. I never notice the view after the first week. If it doesn't take too long. Drink? Well--good night. In case you want to have us followed. How are you two getting along? How about a cup of coffee? Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure. No. Could be. On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better. Yes, I've seen it before. That's what I thought, at first. Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party. With my liquor of course. Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name. Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down? Round of golf Saturday? How's life treating you? You're not English. What? Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric. Want to walk out... or get thrown out? I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners. Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench. Lay off, can't you? Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell. Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell.He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why. With what motive? How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear. Convenient, isn't it? So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have. I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious. I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again. Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun. And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him. Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"? They always have another. See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys. I don't think you locked your door. So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair. I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again. Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night. No, Not recently. I'm sure of that. I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..Magruder's conked out. Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent. He may come out of it and he may not. As a source of quick information, we can't forget him. Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco? How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector. If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections. Send that? I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business. Greer won't give out. If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea-- We've done that. He's a San Francisco private eye. Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E. Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it. Goble and Greer is the firm name. You told me when we'd identified this fellow-- Got a moment, Inspector? I'm an Irishman, sir. An Irishman is always logical. I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years. This man hadn't been dead an hour. He wasn't killed last night. He was killed today. In broad daylight. That's no drunk- rolling job. You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets. Not a floater. Only just dead. The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare. Why not here? Get it in half an hour. Got it on you? Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it. I stick around and wait for the five hundred. I go home and paint the kitchen. Bluff. You've waited too long. You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand. Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic. Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon. $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer. You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding. Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio. That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work. Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long? I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me. You asked for it. I'd like a few words with you, in private. Open it and count it. You get it's brother. One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed. Not too fat- not too thin. It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet. I have an appointment with him, right here, right now. I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco. Just like you thought...Two murders in two days. Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number. You win, Inspector. You win all along the line. Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us. Yeah. Of course you did. When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake. No suicide. And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out. How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it. I've got to find a way to handle it, openly. Like Brandon. I've handled it. Mitchell's handed it. If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide. If I leave it here....no suicide. This is the shell. What about the gun? Pretty big chance, huh? Do I know that she's out of the room? Likely to be out of it for some time? Do I know who lives down there? Such as? Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people. I'd want to know just about everything about them. If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters. Should be over there. I think so. Maybe we've been pretty dumb-- That's pretty risky business, Inspector. Gigi, huh? Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies. Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold. I guess I'm just ballast around here. She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night. Anything special you're looking for, Inspector? Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector. Unless the gun was slanted up. This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall. Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there. It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him. I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun. ... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector. They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl... Right. You in charge here?What's this in favor of? The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble. I've got good ears. Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon? What's a buzzer?Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time. I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield. Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank. Good morning. Can I do something for you?What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed? Just drunk enough. Maybe you're going to have to like me. How careful should I be? Why certainly, baby. Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield. If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz. Okay. You win. Don't I even get my face slapped? The brush-off, huh? Nobody I'd rather have on a leash. Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go. Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock? A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there. We have some nice places around Vancouver. What's the matter? Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away. Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know. How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side. I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all. I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector. A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something. Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you? No thanks? Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too. You don't know. Indefinitely? A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for? I'll make one for you. I live there. Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know. Or Reno? They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard. Vancouver, B.C. You could tell me your name. And where you're going. Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type. My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver. You don't throw guests out, Brandon. How would you know, Brandon? Did I do something wrong? Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby? What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore? The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have. Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies. I'm afraid this is all for the moment. A little something on account perhaps? Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell. Unsophisticated? If I knew about this babe... I say YES! In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there. Be nasty. I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you. Right. I told you she's just.. Of course. I didn't mean it that way I'm sorry. It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this. How long have you had it? What's this? That's not very kind. It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill. I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be. What'll we do about it, Margo? Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me. I have a rough idea. I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky. I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor. Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why? Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way. You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly. She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you? Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield. So-so. I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.Possibly, Miss. Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry. Otherwise they might think... Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer... I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane. Good evening, Miss.Brandon handled the money envelope. This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon? You'll have to take my word for it. We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison. Mayfield? She fit into this? So far. He checks too. No doubt about that one. Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women. I've made slides for two. They handled both envelopes. Yes, I think so. Here are two glazed manila envelopes. One is the bag type. The other one had the money in it. Don't ask me how I know. I know.Right, Miss. Beer or ale, Miss? Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law. Yes, Miss.FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT! Where the fuck did she go? She can't get both of us. I thought she was dead. It's on the table. Get the gun. I'll untie Pops. And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending. What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone... Ready? You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today. Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath. And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid. Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him. It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die. Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn. I was hoping Sid and I could talk. You ready to party hard tonight? Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive. Duh... that's quick. Thanks, butt wart. You did good. How'd you do? You open your mouth and stupidity pours out. No one's saying you did. It's called tact, you fuckrag. No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff. Yes, sir. I just wanted to see her, that's all. I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother. You bitch -- where the fuck are you? Hello? Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out. Jesus... fuck, that hurt. We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something. Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive? We already played that game. You lost, remember? It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE! It's okay. Give me the gun. I'm alright. Gotta... get... help. You don't still think it was me? Yeah... and when I called no one answered. I called my dad. What? Are you serious? What? Sshh... it's okay. Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise. Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre. Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father. Oh Sidney... You lost your mom... So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry. Subtlety, Stu. Look it up. You have to move on, Sid. When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back. It's been a year since she died. Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy? Then what is it? Is there somebody else? Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me. See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember? The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid. Hey, hey, it's just me. I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay... What's that? I'm going... I'm going. No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff. Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television. And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you. It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window. Close call. I'll only stay a sec. You sleep in THAT? I'm sorry. Don't hate me.I'll call for backup. We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here? Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car. I don't think you're so bad. Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious. Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago. NO! I mean... I should probably take just you. Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town. A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road. Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me. Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out. Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose. What brings you out to these parts? Evening, ma'am. I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year. That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person. If you'll excuse me, ma'am. We haven't ruled out that possibil... No, not yet. We're tracking the cellular phone bill. Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice. I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am. You're not supposed to be here, ma'am. Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being. I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye? She's with me. I just wanted to check on things. Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise. A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me. What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law. Hold up a sec... Does mom know? You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene. What are you doing here? Not yet. Afraid not. Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid. You girls ready. I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself. Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas. I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him. Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls. Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything... We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry. He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel? You're sure it was the Hilton? You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit? Yes, sir. She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight. She's with my sister. Should I bring her in? You think he could still be in town? Have you contacted the bureau? Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned? Keeping my eye on Sidney. Yes, sir, sheriff. We haven't located her Dad yet. They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it? That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records. She's tough. Drive by patrol. I was first to respond. He's her boyfriend. We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis. It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.Casey! Casey! Where is she? Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit. Call the police. Casey? Casey? Jesus... That fish smelled strong.About thirty seconds. The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture. What's the plan? But it's so much easier when we make it up. When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge. You want to go live? What? What?Your call. There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live. What door am I at? Answer the question and I will. Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out. Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel. Afraid not. I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer. Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH. Then answer the question. Same category. But you're doing so well. Now for the real question. YES! What's his name? Come on, yes you do. Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters. Name the killer in HALLOWEEN. I'll even give you a warm up question. It's an easy category. Movie trivia. Come on. It'll be fun. Turn off the light. Which is it? Then he dies. Right now. I wanna play a game. That all depends on you. Guess. Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again. His name wouldn't be Steve, would it? I believe you... I'm getting scared. Sure... I thought you didn't have a boyfriend. Or else what? TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE. They'd never make it in time. More of a game, really. NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND? You getting scared? To talk. I told you not to hang up on me. Don't... Don't hang up on me. Wait... I thought we were gonna go out. What do you think I said? I want to now who I'm talking to. Because I want to know who I'm looking at. You never told me your name. Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend? So, you gotta boyfriend? Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary. Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers? Guess. You have to have a favorite. What's your favorite scary movie? Do you like scary movies? Really? What? I only eat popcorn at the movies. You're making popcorn? What's that noise? You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. Why don't you want to talk to me? I want to talk to you for a second. Wait, wait, don't hang up. To apologize. I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number. Do I? I don't know. What number is this? Who is this? Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again. Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you. Hello Sidney. If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother. Uh-huh. Right here. That's the original part. Your front porch. The question is not who am I. The question is where am I? Maybe that's because I'm not Randy. Are you alone in the house? And why is that? What's your favorite scary movie? Do you like scary movies, Sidney? Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.Sleep tight, sweetie. ...so call if you need me. No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton... I heard screaming. Are you okay?Twice. Working, thank you. Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced. You got it. Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it. Don't shoot. It's me. She's the Scream Queen. No, Sid. Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one. Yeah. There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back." Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit. There goes my chance with Sid. What's Leatherface doing here? We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly. I had 'em hid in the foreign section. It's 1995 -- motives are incidental. You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect. So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition. Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict... Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me? Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him. There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience. Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited. You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead. If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section? Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste. We had a run in the mass murder section. Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox. Besides -- "Takes a man to do something like that." It would certainly improve your high school Q. And are the police aware you dated the victim? Before she dumped him for Steve. That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here. Did you ride past Casey Becker's house? And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too? You rode your bike out there? Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight? Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out. Hold off for now. Just stay close to her. He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney? They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house. There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man. Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed. Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy? She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around. She staying with you? Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know. What about the cellular phone bill? Have to be. The shit she's gone through. How is she? What were you doing out here? Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus... How is everything?I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep. I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'. Odds are -- she'll miss anyway. She looked dead. Still does. No, it's not. That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy. Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel. Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead... Yeah... This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last? That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules. Nope. Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun. And if you get it right -- you die. You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night. Oh yeah. Dude. What are you doing here? You know it. Oh... I was just asking. Why are you always at me? So you gonna try and make up with Sid? Piece of cake. She'll be there. Sorry. Owwww... I didn't kill anybody. Sorry. What? She asked. Come on, Sid. Give me the gun. His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho. I'll be right back. Wanna another beer? I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts? Like you had one. He came to make up. I can cry on cue. I thought everything was checked out. And what would be your motive? Which is you... I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass? She's saving herself for you. So what's his reason? Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend? The why'd the police let him go? It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything. What? You coming tonight? Jesus, this place is packed. I'm gonna gut your ass in a second. What are you saying? That I killed her or something? For about two seconds. Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that. Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive. The official term is "psychotic". It's all part of the game. Guess, I won't be needing this anymore. You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever. Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food. Remember, there's safety in numbers. My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'. And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house. Are you kidding? This is like Christmas. You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up. Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY? I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage. With that set of lungs -- she should be. Where you guys been? We had to start without you. Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you. Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened? Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it. I did. He's full of shit. Because there's no way a girl could have killed them. I don't know, they just did.Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am. Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door. Them french fries good? There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too." Get it? That's a goodun. Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge? Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with. Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you? All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow. Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime. See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first. You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow. All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller? Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good. I'll let you off while it's still daylight. Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night. You got any money? If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later. Yeah, me too. We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little. They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things. Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there. Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good. Sure. He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good. Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything. But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him. Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way? How 'bout you, Jerry. Good to know you, Karl. Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it. Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway. That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe. Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter? Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness. I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em. Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did. Do you know Scooter, Jerry? Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name? Okay. You don't have to though. About a half a mile I think it is. I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead. He got hit by a train. Yeah. These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too. Sixty for small and seventy-five for large. Yeah. French fries. I like to eat them pretty good. Well, I guess it's all good. Did you decide, sir? Naw, we don't have biscuits. Well, what did you want? Can I help you?Well, it's not too big in here, is it? I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details. ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy? I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world. ... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.Catch you later Freddy! We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race? Yeah. Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass. Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on. Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch? How'd your baptizin' go? What are you doin' with that damn hammer? What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night. Don't tell me what to do. Don't tell me what to do. Don't tell me what to do. Don't tell me what to do. You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail. You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you. I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go. But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things. Okay ladies and gentlemen or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy. Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here. Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank. Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time. You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low. Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would. You know what we ought to do tonight? You know what, by God? Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat. Well, I wouldn't let it get to you. See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy. Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back. Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag? You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet. Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something. He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank? I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for? Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See? Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really. You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out. Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you. That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune. What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time. Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be. You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet? Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl. Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here. You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'. No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you. Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard. Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I? Was I? Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me. I thought I told you to keep out! That's funny. You go to bed and take snot nose with you. I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back. We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back! If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance. You got that shit right. Sarcastic right? You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you. I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you? Shhhh! This is the national anthem. Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work. You enjoying yourself, Karl? You like that Vaughan? I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney. Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home. Don't rush ever'body, honey. I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV. What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of. Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess. Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em? I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway. You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here. That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine. Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you. Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do. Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson! On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins. On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group. On drums "The Johnson." And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here. Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl? You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then. It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy. Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you? You believe in the Bible? What's all them books? What's in your bag?Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said -- I hate you! Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here. I get nervous, that's all I know. Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me! Stop it, Doyle! Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage. I want to watch T.V. I ain't sure. No sir. He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'. But maybe just for awhile -- Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books. He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so... I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him. I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones. Okay. Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right? You know I would. Whatever you want. Like something different. I don't know. You're leavin' ain't you, Karl? I've got a feelin' today. Man. Thanks. You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why? You don't want to give away all your books. I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that. Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things. Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama. You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off. Just diggin'. I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born. Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here? Yeah, I guess. Can we play ever' Saturday? It was fun, anyhow. It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you? You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing. I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me. We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast. Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone. We'll be on teams, me and you? You will? For sure? Is that right? I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it. Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl? What you readin'? She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right? Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too. I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm. Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did? That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'. That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother. It was still alive when you buried it? You threw it in a trash barrel? A boy or girl? It was alive? So it died when it come out? Why? Why not? It died? 'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with? And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny. You know why I want you to play ball with me? You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother. Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you. I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her. I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it? Oh, jackin' off? What do you mean? And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all. Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her. I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me? I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store. Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you. You know that girl I told you about. The one I love. I was wantin' to ask you somethin'. Yeah, me too. That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers. Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they? I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while. You want to go with me? It's name's A Christmas Carol. I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you? Where'd you get them flowers? Hey Karl, you off work? I like the way you talk. I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of. Will you stay here with us for a long time? Well, I hate him. I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him. It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense? Maybe they needed it. Were they bad people? Who did you kill? 'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine. Karl, did you really kill somebody? It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose. Karl. You know when I said daddy got hit by a train. She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why. He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle. I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em. When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now. Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then. How did your mama die? How do you know? They still around, your folks? This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off? They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'. Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'. Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama. Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight. Did you want to play ball with us? Yeah. What you doin' by here? Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl? Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later. Do you like to play football? You don't seem like you'd kill nobody. Are you well? How come? They let you out? Why'd you live there? Don't you live somewhere? How come you're carryin' them around with you. What are all them books? What's you last name? We've had a real hard life, too, Mama. He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better. I love you, too, Mama. Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he? Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about. Mama? I bet he don't. Karl likes me. Did Karl go to bed? Did Vaughan go home? We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama? You all right, Mama? He ain't ever okay to me. They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar. I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous. I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there. Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do. Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat. Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends. Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night. I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful. Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?Thank ye. Hit ain't got no gas in it. I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good. That boy wants me to. All right then. They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters. Yeah, they's good all right. I don't reckon. I like them french-fried potaters. I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit. Thank ye. Karl's my name. I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first. How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh? Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it? What you got in there, warshing? Give me the big'uns. How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon. French-fried potaters. What do you like to eat here? What you got that's good to eat? You have any biscuits for sale? I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat. Don't say nothin' about that boy. It's too big. They was a boy. We made friends. I aim to kill you with it. What numbers do you punch? How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police? Don't hit that boy no more. I want to be baptized. Childers. I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember. A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it. Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em. This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot. Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here. Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it. Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to? Reckon what kind of a feelin'? Yes sir. I aim fer you to have 'em. Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas. Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that. I aim for you to have these books. I'm tired, too, Frank. If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat. That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me. You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language. I'm glad of it you was borned. I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more. I knowed you'd be here. What are you a-doin' digging with that stob? Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg. If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out. I'm proud of ye. I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do. No sir. Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard. I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me. Yessir. Yeah. I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference. Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early. Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time. I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is. Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far. You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye? I reckon. Yes sir, I reckon it does. I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades. Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out. I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow. I heared it cryin' a little through that box. I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon. A little ol' boy. Yes sir. Right then it was. My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel. Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with. Yeah. I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with. Naw. I don't reckon I know. He ain't no count. You ort not to pull on yourself that away. Yes sir. You ort not know that language. Pull on your works. Your privates. That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though. You don't touch yourself, do you? Naw. They ort to. You're a good boy. I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye. If you want me to. Yeah, I recollect it. All right then. Hit was right thoughty of her. Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy. All right then. Yeah. That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about. Naw. You can look at all my books you want to. That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her. Yeah. I like the way you talk. I reckon it tastes pretty good to me. I reckon if you want me to. I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some. He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama. Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly. You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy. I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody. I thought they was. Two people. Yeah, I did. Why did he do that, reckon. Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that. How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her? You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other. He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much. My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though. Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon. I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste? I don't want to worry your mama with company. All right then. I ain't no good at it. I just come by. You told me to come by. Yeah it is. Your name's Frank. I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it. I reckon I feel all right. They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose. Yeah. I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail. I did live there in the state hospital. Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down. Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter. Childers. Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that. A blister shore can hurt. I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon. I reckon. I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time. Yes ma'am, I reckon. That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye. They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well. I'm ye oldest boy name Karl. I'm ye boy. That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks. I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits. My history. Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir. He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned. I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere. I never was no good with history. I reckon. I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot. Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway. Naw. I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it. I want to come back and stay here. All right then. I ain't got nothing but them books. I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too. I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people. Thank ye. I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine. You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'. You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye. Ma'am? He wanted to go off and play, I reckon. You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none. Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors. No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers. I could shore use some. Thank ye. All right then. Yes ma'am. I like your garage. I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing. I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it. Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital. I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends. I wouldn't mind a havin' supper. Thank ye. Mustard's good on 'em to me. Yes ma'am. Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out. Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits? Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe. No ma'am. I didn't aim to. Tolerable, I reckon. I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy. You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades. That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy. Naw, not yet. I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox. That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it? This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight. I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor. I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read. Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry. I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters. I wouldn't never hurt them. I've heard it said that way. Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer. I reckon not. I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow. I done et just a little bit ago. Quite a spell, I reckon. Naw, I ain't. That boy wants me to. Yes sir. Not really to speak of. I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit. They turned me loose from the state hospital. What's that you say? I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old. Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be. I ain't got no boy. I ain't got no boy.I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go. Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago. I can't remember. Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life. Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her. It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's. I don't really understand the meaning of the words. What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand. Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled. Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol. I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow. Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right. That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie. I know Albert. We're friends. Sure, I guess. What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here? Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he? What's wrong? Is everything okay? Okay. Karl, what are you doing here? Come in. I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly. Oh. How about before that? That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now? Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way. There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you? Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you? Homosexual. I like men. Sexually. Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind. I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care. You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay. Does that surprise you? That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you? Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon. I mean tomorrow or the next day. Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch? How long have you been standing here? Did you knock on the door yet? So, you're really going to stay here? Do you have family here? Is that right? Are you going to be staying here long? Why are you here now? What brings you back? It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something? I don't think I've ever seen you before. Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table. I'm sorry. Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night. Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook. Karl is a guy guy? What about me? He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him. Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy? He just got out of the state hospital. Can I help you, sir? Yes. Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private. Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.I'll see you, Bill. Can I see him? Is him stayin' here workin' out? Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out. How are you, Bill? Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss. This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back. He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself. He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back? He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid. No, don't guess I do. Scooter, good to meet you. This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young. Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'? I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back. I'll be. Yeah. Do they know about you? Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy? Well, I guess we better hit the road. Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night? Karl, you up? She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name. No, I mean your past. About why you were in here. I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable. I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history. I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try? Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job. You follow me? Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you? Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me. I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody? Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out? Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please. Karl, what in the world are you doing here? You better go get 'em. You better go get your things. Yes, I guess you are. As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now. Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here. I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all. We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot. Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write. He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more. It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry. But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him. One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him. I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin. His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex-- You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right? Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom. I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science. The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women. Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage. Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee? I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right? Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you? My name's Jerry Woolridge.Okay, whatever you want. Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know? Do you wanna go to the van? Yeah. Mm. Hey, what are you doing now? Sounds like a bummer. Any gunshot victims? Your a nurse? You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something? I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit. Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it. A cloud. It's really not about anything. Yup. No I quit. Hey! Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming? Want a beer? Is Pony coming? God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow. See, I wasn't making shit up, man. Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there! Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead! It's bullshit. Look! Look! Yeah, man. That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit. Bullshit. Tim... She's dead? What? What she doin' in the van, man? Hey, man. What? Wait. Hey, man. Y- s-sure it did. Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man. No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say? Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica? I know, man. Oh, and guess who showed up. But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel. Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics... No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus. Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape. I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean... Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady. Yeah. Hey, you know me. Sure. Good. No. Life is too short. She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that. Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze? Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze? Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night. Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet? In the limo!!! Fuck it! You know what we should do? Go to the... Go! So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood. A long, long, long... A long, long, long, long, while. Yeah, a long while. A long, long while. Ah! Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it! Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk. I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan. Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that? Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge! You wanna bet he's with a girl? Sorry. Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh! That's the rock star thing. The dude wants it. Yes! Pony's coming here to the corner?! But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner? Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday! It's your birthday? You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy? Stuck with what guy? Stuck, who? What guy? Huh? Where are you-hoo? And your mom. Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls. Yo, your gettin' me all upset here. Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard. Needs some pizza in his diet. You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in. Hey, come on, man! Limo! Wait, what happened to the tree? Play it! Come on! Yeah. Yeah, right, publicist. Fuck her! Come on, let's go. Ah, you know people there? Hey, man. They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun. Great. Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city. Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man. Wait, so Pony's coming by here? Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend. You're fascist, man. Neofascist. I will. I can come visit? Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A. Yeah? Oh, how did you get burnt-out? Hey! Hey. Yes! Free concert! Buff. Mm, in a horizontal and wet way! So, then, you're, like, available? Shit. Well, that's one way of putting it. Mm. And your like, what else? Your his publicist? Yeah. Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...? Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A. You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay. Good. See you later. Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili. Glad it's okay. Are you talking to me? Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama! No, you don't belong here. We were here before you. You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it! Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors. It's safe, come on. We're your customers. We're not complaining. Hey, we're just having a conversation. Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God. He paid you man. Score! Yeah! Thanks, man! Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright. I didn't want to eat this much, man. A reel? Yes! Yeah. I could. "Closed, closed, closed." But with your music. Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now. Thanks. See man? No man. He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here. Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important. Whoa! I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm... Please. Well, play it, man. Yeah, we're all above that. Oh, So what about her? So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock? No, but I heard it was great. Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!Come on. Inside. Will you stand up for me? Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend. Okay, come on. Time to slow down. What's up guys?Uh-huh. Can you tell me what happened? Two-fifty? They go up?You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result. You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life. Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is. Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony. We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking. It was pretty bad, huh? I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab. Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink? How long were you in there? Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense. In Group? Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"? You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense. Can I have some? I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink. Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black! "Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think? Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck. I don't know. Uh, yeah, she should be coming by. Alright. 'Bye, Buff. No. Guess not. Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then! Oh, really? You wanna go look? No, no, no. Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer. Look, Tim confessed to me last night. She's dead. Buff... She's in the van. Look. Erica is in the van back there. No. It didn't, Buff. Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night? What, they're looking for her? You know? No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble. Buff, can you listen to me for a second? Buff, listen to me. Could you just- No. Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright? No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony? No, no. Uh, last night... Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious. No, I mean, no one. Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright? No, I'm not worried. No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried. No, no, I wasn't trying. No. No, no. You know what? Go with him. Just go with him. So you can do an album cover? ... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on! So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that? Okay. Okay, okay. Watch out for that tree. I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin. No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it. That sounds so depressing. That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon? I'd get bored. You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit. No, he's not with a girl. Jesus Christ. Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff. No, no. No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo. Don't let 'em fight. I don't know. Later. I don't know. Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea. He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna... Yeah. No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday. What? Shut up! Aw... No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets. No, I'm here. Where are you? Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars. Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie. You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile. Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi. Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake. Is that Bee-Bee? Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous. That, that's Indian? He's got a gun. He's got a gun. Just put it down. Will you just put the gun down? They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know? Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you. Just go home, alright? What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off. No. No. I don't know. The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking. You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again. Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser. Because I care, I'm a fucking fool? Why? Because I give a shit? Yes. No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life. You lied to me. They let you out? Oh fuck. Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious? You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her? What'd you do? Well, w-what happened? What? What'd you do? Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out. Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man! Yeah, fuck 'em. What? No. I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit. See ya later. Tim, what are you talking about? No, wait, no, I thought about New York. Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man. I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message. No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright? Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole? Wow, that must be pretty nice there. Sooze wants to see him. No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to... Nobody. Sooze. You don't need to sit next to me right now. Because I'm alienated. Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from. Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much. Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy. I don't know. I think she's breathing. Please? Nazeer what? Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff. No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name? That's right. Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me. I don't know. Why we're just standing here. I gave it to you. What? Just go. Just go. Go. Do your covers and all that shit. Oh, fuck it, man! Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out. Oh, no, no, no. No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say. Well, what about us? Wait. What, what are you saying? To his hotel? Wait, away? Where are you going? Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing? No, no, I have to talk to you. Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out. I, yeah. And I fig- and I figured something out. No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here. But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry. No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know. Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost. No, I just don't feel like it. That's all. No. No, no, no. So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead? FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert! No, I don't. No, I don't. No, I don't. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down. Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should. I don't know. No, no. Mm-mm. So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better? Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine? Mm-hm. Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground. Nothing. No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal? And? Us. Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York? Sooze. ... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there. I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh... I would've stopped it. Yeah. Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something. It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt? Tim! Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start. Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play? Can I talk? Can I talk here? Let me talk. I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth! Yes, I stand for - No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest. No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit. Hey! One! Name one. Like what? About what? No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate? What are you trying to communicate? Tell us. Oh, well, then you better listen to him. No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent. "The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you. Your sure as hell right about that. Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am. No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life. Yes. Was that supposed to be me? Okay, so maybe later. Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now. Oh! Trim it! I know, I know, I know. God, I haven't seen you all day. I don't know. I don't know. Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes. I'm sorry. I, I gotta... I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly? No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah. No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey. No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know. W-wait a minute, wait a minute. Of course it does. Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special? Yeah, well, that's what I do too. Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you? So who are you? So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house? For a while. Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh... Great. Now? Really? Yeah, they could be songs. Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things. So you think I should? You know, I've thought about that, actually. I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know. Sorry. Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets. The prom. That's funny. Yeah, I crash there. Yeah. Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex. Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh? Yeah. Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall. No, it's not... Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo? Good, man. Hey, Pony.Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of. Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat." You're a drunk and an idiot. In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here. I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay. It's okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself. Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around. Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here. Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go! That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police. Please! Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain. This is private property, my friend. You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty. Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty. He causes problems. He was here earlier. He's drunk. Always two-fifty, my friend. Two-fifty. Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside. This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof! How is she? Look, look, just get off my property. Nazeer Chaudry! Okay. Nazeer, okay? Look, why do you care, huh? Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm? Oh, it's very complicated, huh? You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy. You know, this, what you're doing with your life... Look, your trespassing. Seven-twenty. No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility. This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah. What are you saying? Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming. Get off my roof! Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum! Look Pakeesa... Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police. Get off my property! Look, get down off my property. Please. Look... Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan. You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here. What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man. No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife. Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.I'll be in the car, okay? Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know? Wait, I'll get you some air. You okay, man? You okay? Yeah! I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel? Yeah! You could do it. You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed." You make videos? You know? I remember coming here with my parents. Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh. Hey, thanks, man. No, no, whoa! Don't drop the guitar, man. I just started it. No, no, no, no, no, it's new. See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about... Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that. Oh, thanks. Thanks. Oh, you were there? Erica, you coming? Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water. Um, mother-daughter. Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so... Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band. Funny shit, man. He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class. Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs. We were? I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom. Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home. Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff. Oh, sure. I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back. Hey, where's Erica? Burnfield. No place like it. Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over. Oh, yeah. Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff. George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff? Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food? Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really... You know what I'm saying? Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound? What? I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it. What do you mean? No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier. Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us. Well, not exactly. Yeah, maybe later. Hey! Hey! Yeah. Yeah, really. Yeah. You should show 'em to me. Like songs? What? No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit. So how's college? Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight. Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man? Yeah, good. The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's? Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know? Nah, nah, nah, nah. We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know. Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just... Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed. Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin? Nobody's fucking anybody! I think I gotta go. Really? What else does your mother say? Yeah? Is that Jeff? You do? Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right? Yeah, I have, I have, yeah. I think about you. I mean, a lot. Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing. That's because I am. I don't know. I say what I mean. Yep. Mm-hm. If... I can't believe you're still here. You done? No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I... Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know? Mine too. "Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while" Chorus here. "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be" Alright, alright already. Oh, no, man. I can't. And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money. Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out. Yeah. Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know. I get final approval. It's in my contract. I'm always serious. I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover. Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover. Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album. Hey. I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know. You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall. New York, huh? Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp. Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard. Yeah. It's pretty exciting. Oh, yeah? Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting? Look at you! It's stupid. Oh, it's stupid, isn't it. Hey! Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay? Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer. ... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay? If you hit me... Don't do that. Yeah. You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay? Don't do that, man, okay? Whatever. The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly? About where she went. I mean, what bar? Yeah? Well, what'd she say? Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper. Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer. Oh, How'd she get back? Where's Erica? You seen her? Tim? "I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how" "See what's around you listen to their lies" Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.So where are you? Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim? Uh, eleven twenty-five. Just one? Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?Hey. Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off! Really? So, how was the ride, kids? Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan? Come on man. I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off. Okay. We'll go for a ride. Okay. Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'? Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig. You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk. Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know? Taking care of business. No, no, see, you, you don't understand. Yeah? I'm not a nice guy. It's nice to do a lot of things. It's a mistake to think that. Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica? What was your name again? Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on. "It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man. Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life. You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life. Oh, yeah? Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me. Military marching bands. What about me? I don't have a car. Mm. What'd he get you? And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair. He is. He is? Oh, me too. Middle-class. You rich? So you, like, come from a town like this or...? Hi. Yeah, totally. So, uh, what do they interview you about? So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV? Come on! Jeff! Come up here! Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma! Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application? Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out. Jeff, stay there. No. What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit. They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me. This is my home. Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man. No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick. Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh? You don't know? Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it? Good, good. I, I hope he does. I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless. Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you? Oh, shit. Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool. Wow. You did that for me? You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless. Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit. Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts. Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore. I hit her. Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really... That chick, Erica? No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff. No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em! Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean? Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer. Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places? Good. That's good. To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom. What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock? Ask your girlfriend. I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib. Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy? Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man. Wow, you're cute when you're angry. Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease. Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV. Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us. Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave? Who were you talking to? If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead? Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land. What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same. Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat. Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem. Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay. You're fucked now, pal! Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay. Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck. Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town! No, this has everything to do with you. I hope you're happy! Ready? Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here! You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on! Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened? Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do. Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself. Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can? Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine. Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem. Camel jockey. Well, what about this? Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right? Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right? Your manager? Yeah? What are you going to do? Hm? No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me. Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?! It's none of my business? Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road? Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to. Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock. She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel. About what? Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright. What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first. I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard? Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel. Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot. Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice. So, like, your dad's a big deal, right? Where do you get your ideas? I'm here. It's not the air force anymore, Scuff I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you? Yeah. Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow? Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel. There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash". Oh that's nice for you. Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole. Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze. Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals. Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas. Hey, your gonna regret this. Fucking drunk, huh? Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head. No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on. Why don't you go back to where you came from? I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac. Seriously? It's a great idea. Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back -- OK. Same again? Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt. Bit fucking late, like. It's fucking boring after a while without the cards. It's fucking boring after a while without the cards. The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards. No. On you go. You were in my way. Shut you mouth or you'll be next. You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in. Shag her senseless. If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail. Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt. All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot. For fuck's sake. Ninteen. Twenty thousand. Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt. I'd fucking kill you. For four fucking grand? One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow. Did you bring the cards? Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds. Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement. I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it. I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy. Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on. I've no fucking cigarettes. Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way. And remember, Rents: no skag.Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit. No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke. Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Sorry, mate, I'll get you another. But it's not worth more than fifteen.Strive, hope, believe and conquer. Do you recall the school motto? I'm an old boy myself, you know? One of Edinburgh's finest schools. Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know. You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it. Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry. I guess you would, Franco. We'll be half-way down the road with the money. Buy yourself that island in the sun? This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton. Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again? Jesus. Let's face it, it could have been wonderful. Can you not go yourself. What? It's a scandal, Franco. Aye, OK, Fr. But the good times couldn't last for ever. So, what's he like? Happy birthday. And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen? What? Steady like? Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together. So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught. It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six. Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him. It's Iggy Pop. You're too young. Well, it isn't. No. Yes, as a matter of fact, it is. Yes. What do you want? Certainly not. Easy for you to say. And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet. No, not holding hands. Because it's illegal. Jesus. Come on. What? Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978. Sorry. Diane. think I left something back at the - Eh- I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything. Great. Where's that? Where are you going, Diane? What's your name? Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special. I didn't either. What the fuck is it? I bet Lizzy told him where to put it. Eh? How's that? What was it, pneumonia or cancer? Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world. Of course, the motto, the motto -- Oh, really? Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather -- Indeed, yes, those halcyon days. No problem. No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood. No, I'm clean. I'm sorry, Tommy. Aye. Aye. No. Me Neither. Following the game at all? Are you getting out much? Another dab? Try this. It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope. Exactly. But try too hard -- If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right? Now remember -- Good luck, Spud. Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds. That's tough. But you don't have the money? What was your price? So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal? So? How much? What? Why would I want to sell my passport? Why? It was my fucking television. I can't believe you did that. Fuck you. You're all hear. You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet? When are you going to visit him? And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off. He made me lick it. No, he didn't make me touch it. What? It wasn't that bad. I'm cooking' up. There is a silence. It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human. I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have. Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem. Give me the gun. That's your theory? Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it? Despite the Academy award? What about The Untouchables? OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make? So who else? Some of his solo stuff's not bad. What do you mean? Roald Dahl. Fuck me. Who wrote it? The park? You don't know, do you? Who wrote it? OK, so who was it, then? Eh - Ian Fleming? Lewis Gilbert. One hundred and sixteen minutes. Nineteen-sixty-seven. The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that - People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit. I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin? You'll have to send us a postcard. Sounds great, Swanney. Sure. Great. No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please. In that case -- Stick it on my tab. Why, thank you. Excellent. What's on the menu this evening? No, I don't think so. That's hardly a substitute. He's always been lacking in moral fibre. The Sick Boy method. I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good. Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite. From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.I'll be right after you. I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK? Christ. Well, why didn't you bring them? I'm sorry. Well, I've not brought them. Well, I've not brought them. What? Did you tell him? Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London. We're two thousand short. Four Grand. So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London. About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- } There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear. It was just an idea. Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price. Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that? I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money. And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing? I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think? Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse. Don't know. Maybe Thursday. Cut it out. God, you're sick. Oh no, don't even mention it. You know. Did he -- you know? Eughh. Sounds horrible. Say something, Mark, say something -- Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison. What's wrong, Allison? Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights? Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated. Yeah. That means fuck all. The sympathy vote. I don't rate that at all. All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory. Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. - No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite. Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed - It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life. Roald Dahl. Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up. And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow. But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even. You can look it up. Fuck off! He never wrote any of them. Screenwriter? Director? Running time? You Only Live Twice? I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant. Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success. Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us. It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now? Are you serious? Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question? If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing. This had better be good.You've stabbed me, man. No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all -- I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly. I want the money, Mark, that's all. The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks. Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it? Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right? No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am. I'd really rather take care of it myself. It's no problem. No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back. Sorry about last night - Would not say no, would not say no. A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre. My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer. Nightmare. And you might get the fucking job. Right. Yeah. Cheers. I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal. But where? What? So what's it going to be? Went ballistic? That's fair enough. I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you. She read it in Cosmopolitan. It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in. Six weeks. No joy yet. No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us. No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right -- I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.Sure will, pal, sure will. Yeah. The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon. And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem. As you wish. Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago. And would sir care to settle his bill in advance? Your usual table, sir? Your favourite dish. To see you through the night that lies ahead. you'll need one more hit. He knows a lot about Sean Connery. Yeah, well, it surely worked for him. Sure, sure. I've heard it before. Well, it's up to you. Are you serious?It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake. Fuck, OK. Now? Thanks, Mark. Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque. Have you got any gear on you? That's nice. Clear? You take the test? No. No. Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish? It's fresh air. It's the great outdoors. There. Such as? It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack. Well, what are you waiting for? A walk. We go for a walk. Well, I've paid for the ticket. Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.' Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night. Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us. Six weeks and no sex? Where did she come up with that? Six weeks! How long is it? How's it going with Gail?Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood... surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp... Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?! You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together. Isn't that right...? They're reaching out to you, Rowan! With his hands! Two heartbeats. There are two. Are you alright...? You look pale. Lasher will act, Rowan. Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it. facing him alone... I don't like - But you've not told Michael. I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both. Thank you for this honor, my dear. Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane... geography seems irrelevant now. A spacial entity. An organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence. Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith. Rowan... What are you talk--- Every day twice. Nothing was ever more false. Yes - and you have. Do you see...? He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could... What have the witches always asked of you...? Michael, Rowan should - Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you. Take off your gloves, Michael. There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid. what defines you in the landscape, Michael...? what anchors your life...? Your work...? Your creativity...? A spirit. Perhaps evil... ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him. Come. There is a lot to read I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated. A few hours. With her family. Rowan's mother died yesterday. Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael. At the cemetery by now, I would guess.I'll tell OR we're bringing - uh - then he - be just - - and he seemed okay. Just banged his - Parents say he - uh - fell -Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch! I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did. They made a deal with the devil. Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit. And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...' In certain cases, hell is the operative word.Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come. Your time is gone. Ju1ien was your father Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same... That is why he fought carlotta for your life. They want to come back. We have a pact - of mutual desire and consent. The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry. I have weaved you all together - from the start. I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne. He had genius in him. Scientific, precise. It was a perfect start. And on it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter... It was an accident. Gifford, too. Tell me what I am, Rowan. That is what you must discover. see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am. There was no thought. There was no act. That is not what I am. I do not understand... What is wrong...? Go on. Rowan. Go on. Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything... Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me... Then help me--- for his sake... --- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat. I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers... Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...? to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.? I did not choose to be such as this! Suzanne brought me here. She called to me! No, my love. I want nothing more of the dead. I want you to --- chang me. I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do... ...but Marguerite could not help me. Nor Julien... Do not tell me that! But I could understand. I want to understand! you crave what I might show you. What you can learn. What I can give you. So much more than Michael can. A girl...? From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me! suzann. and Deborah. Stella - Marguerite - Antha - Diedre - All of them. And you will have a child... If that were true, I would not be here. There is no one here but the dead. I bring her flowers too. I am only what you are --- what all of you have been. what do you think of yourself now, my love...? If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me. Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel... If you knew how I yearn for that... It is from love. Explain this to me --- violated...? I 1ove you, Rowan. I've always loved you. I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now. Always loved you.. I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be. Like this...? There are things you will not tell him. You do not love Michael How can you love - if you lie...?I am your son. I would not wound you. I could not - ever. 'Kill you...?' You are my mother. Do you think I would hurt you...? ENOUGH! He is dead. You are here for me now. Michael is gone! How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?Always loved you. Rowan. Always... Like this... LIKE THIS...? Rowan...You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back! He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child! Aaron - lieten to me... It's been Lasher - from the start!

All I meant was - Doctor's orders- - -? Why don't you let at do that...? Okay. y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah. Ms. yin, and Mr. yang Aha! It's come to that, huh...? Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...? He fools around with his patients too. Too much... too fast...? Really...? Your family there...? Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's... The Man With The Eyes In His Hands... My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.

That I could lose the gloves at some point. Go away, GODDAMNIT! On which planet...? Go home, Stu I'll call you. I just - hate it when they're - finished.But it doesn't make sense. They - they used Lasher... they conspired with him. But why would they do that...? Two what...? I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health. I'm the doctor. Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's. Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael. I can't bear to see anymore. He's not to know. Swear to me. I have seen him again. Last night.

I know that you're evil. I LOVE MICHAEL. MICHAEL!! I LOVE him! What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand. It's too soon to know.

Pretty, huh...? Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever --- You're very clever, aren't you...? It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose. And you will feel that. Do you understand...?

No - I didn't kill him. Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...? Michael! Nobody makes a car like them Nasis... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmmm... Dropped it. A little wine...? So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...? Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence - That's GREAT! And I thought I was the mindreader. Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael. No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know. Than letts get rnarried, Michael. I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes. I don't think of us that way - ever. If we married, we'd shut him out forever. He can't hurt us, Michael. It's us - our love. He can't find a crack in it. He can't find a way in. Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff--- Everyone - this is Michael curry. You sure...? I'll bet she had a wonderful smile. They need doctors in New Orleans too. Michael - think what I could do with the money! I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch. I've come home, Michae1, for the first time. I want to stay here - with you. Do you love me, Michael...? I am! And so are you. You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause) Michael, if you don't want - Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon. And my life is not a cosmic whim! I am in charge of my life - - and I want to stay. Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me. Helpless. I should have been here. But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...? He's in there! Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?! where are you, goddamnit...?! Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...? God, Michael --- what am I...? Michael - I saw him! Twice! Carlotta said I --- killed Graham - with - with my anger. She - she said I - I was a --- You know...? Goodbye, Michael. I love you. Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans. Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me. I'll call you there. Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I - Listen. Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael... Michael! Jesus I've been trying - We're quite a pair, you and I. You could fly down tomorrow. I could be there the next day I think I can last that long without you. Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...? I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute In L.A., remember...? He said he'd see you. He was intrigned. Michael - this place is increadible. You - you're brilliant... The things you created... Stop it. I'm serious. You don't - Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...? We don't even know - You don't know what you meant - because you don't know me. Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there. Captain's orders. Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D. Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H. Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence. You look very deep when you do that. It's interesting. We're Complete opposites- I'd never just sit and wait for insparation. I'd skip my turn and swap some letters. you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging. Kinky...? He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings. Mm-hmm. Scared- I feel a little like the moth and the flame. Nope- My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth. El1ie was my only blood relation. so she brought me here... the day after I was born. I was born, in New Orleans, too- You still feel that crazy...? And whose houses do you design...? It's unbelievable that you can do that. My uncle. Graham. He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me. He - he - had a stroke- Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year. What else did you see- Michael...? I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you. Yessssss... HARDER! Harder... No. I'm not. Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things. You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body - Just one. The bar's closed. What do you see...? Do they keep everything 'out' ...? Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative. I'm in the life business - remember..? I'm glad you're around to say it. I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage. I guess so. The trick is remembering how to act like one. I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you. Why don't we go to my office... Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool. Aloof. Is that what you were doing...? I thought it was 'whistle while you work. I like him. He can stay. He's got great hands. I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...? Rowan Mayfair. I plan on liquidating almost evetything. No tax shelters. No funding. I want to fund the clinic - exclusively. The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic. I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction. I've decided not to open a practice here I want to set up a research clinic. For infant genetic disorder. Papers...?Yessss... Harder... Harder...That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash. That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that. Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could - Standard for a Mayfair marriage. Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael that is it's in the will - for centuries. Tradition enjoins, Rowan. of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into - We'd better get to work on the papers.A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville. Oh, sweet decadance. Left behind...? This about Rowan...? You okay...? Wow... That's a wasp. Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored- so - where is she...? Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time. How are the hands...? You can't just - Bullshit! Let me in! Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont. sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change. You always do. Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that. I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...? Is that a crack about our singing...? Hey - I love gloves- I look really great in gloves. You really love this guy...? Sut McKinley. Marry me.
