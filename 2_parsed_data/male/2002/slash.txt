...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"? Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too. You ever hear of... the harvest of blood? 'Course, it's none of my business. Maybe you don't want to remember. Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did. 'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds. Your pa's waiting for you up at the house. You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em. Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about? I ain't never played a banjo in my life. You were a beat and a quarter behind. Nope. Two.. maybe three days. Could take a little while, though. Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem. You're standing in horseshit. I'd watch your step if I were you, son.AAAAAAAAAAAA -- You need someone who can protect you, Suzie. Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you. Not someone -- Mac. I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown... There's something weird going on here, Suzie. Sorry. Hey, isn't that the preacher? I didn't do anything -- Yeah. It's the alternator all right.You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah. Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night. Book of Jeremiah. Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord." Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.I thought you said two hundred. "Peggy-Sue" -- Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy? Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison. All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail. Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down. Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next. Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack? I could. You sucked. The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here! Come out, come out wherever you are! He's right. Nice guitar break. Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE! He means moon shining. Hi Suze. "With a hack-hack here --" "-- an AXE!" Should we be doing this, dude? So... what does it do? Hmmm. This shit isn't bad. Are you crazy? Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows? Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure? You're out of your mind, man. Well, there goes our record deal. Shotgun. Suicide. Next?Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime. Bus broke down. Sounds familiar. You're not going to arrest me for it, are you? Gene. Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old. It's time to make amends. -- It's not me! That's your grandfather you're talking about! I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life. Sure. What do you want to know. You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying. You'll be back. Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say. I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away. Wasn't much right before that, neither. You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think. Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you? That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it. Pardon? ...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home. Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back. Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it. Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?! Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now! Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes? Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song? See? Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what? What's a "little while?" Alright! Oh yeah? Why's that? Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes! -- "Billy-Jean" -- Nike specials. Two hundred bucks. Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next. Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn. That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man. Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?" Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye. Hey. Fuck you. Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing! What the fuck you talking about, man? Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come! What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?! He started it. Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" -- Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta. Who you callin' "boy?" Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet. Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride. Who? Us?! You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song. Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating? Chicken sandwich? Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next. Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind. Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior! Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens. Yeah. That's just the problem. Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig". Yes! Shit!Chicken blood on the crops. Superstition. Let's say today, we make it your business. What are you talking about? Meaning? How'd he know I'd come? I -- Amends...? Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?! Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off! People say he was a murderer. That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro. I don't think so. "Blood?" She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"... Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel. I'll be fine here. This is his room... isn't it? Aunt Edith. How did she... die? How... was she "called?" I'll be gone again tomorrow. I came back for the funeral. That's all. Joseph Macdonald... Your son. I'm your son. And Laureen's son. You know who I am. You invited me. What are you going to do? Shoot me? Is that right? How does it feel, Keith? You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break. Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl. Try taking a left after the next cow pasture. Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band. Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today. Never. Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together... The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire... Get out of here. Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it. Don't look. Suzie -- Listen to me -- No -- Suzie... No. I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me. -- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"? What are -- Wait a minute -- Suzie -- You wouldn't understand. Strange... I can feel my old self coming back... Look. You want to talk about this? Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone? I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep. I said that's enough! Let it go. When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here... This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic. Nah. Just you. Still trying to figure it out myself. Name something. My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye. Nothing to tell. -- picked tonight to come by and watch our set. Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --Hey -- Macdonald's farm! Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time. Ow! Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse. You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better? Never heard of it. I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again? Throw me one.We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff-- Carl! Oh Carrrrl! Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse. Harvest moonshining! "And a slash-slash there --" "Old Macdonald... had --" Metaphysical question, man. It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades. Manure... is life. Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it. The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was. I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold. Nah. We still got Billy Bob. Curt Cobain. Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off. Bzzzzzzzzzt! Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer! It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines. Someone better tell Mac. CARL??? Carl did this?!! Where's Mac? Us? We been... moonlighting. Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone. It's coming right up. After the third verse. Like what? She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall. What is it?!! Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me. I was getting 'warmed' up.
