A puppet. You're not Gibarian... I can trust Rheya. Can it work? What do you want? Gibarian. Where's Snow? Did you call him? How quickly? You fucking bastard... Why would you let her to do that? She'll come back. You murdered her! You killed her! That's fantastic. Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants? No. There's no behavior modification. Listen -- They shouldn't let people like you into space. Her? Who are you talking about? Where's his body? I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. Now: What happened to him? I want to hear your version. What happened to Gibarian? All right. Maybe you can. Jesus... When did this happen? What's wrong with you? We need your help. I love her. Into what? Her oxygen would have run out. Yes. Just get him to stop. I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan. No. She knows everything. She knows who she is. Get out -- She drank liquid oxygen. They come when you sleep. Human beings can die. But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything. Presented me with your double, and you with mine. I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now. Why now? No. Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying. Consciousness should be enough for anybody. Not necessarily. -- we are not sure of that. We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating. When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt? Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean? I don't think so. Why? What is it? Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed. I don't know. To who? I wish you'd told me. Will she come back? Rheya. My wife. And professionally? What was it? Shut up. That depends. How much sleep? Tell me. I won't think you're insane. She was real. Where did she come from? Gibarian warned me. He left me a message. Is there anybody else here? He'll let me in. Where's Sartorius? What? How? What's wrong? What happened to Gibarian? How can you be here... Last night. You were talking to someone in the corridor. Where did you go before? Please. Don't. What does it want? A sleeping pill. Do you want yours? I don't know anymore. All I see is you. It put you here. I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream. I saw your mouth. And there you were. Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter. The decision we make now is all that matters. Stay with me. You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters -- I think they help. I wish you wouldn't. Is that really what you want? Yes. I told you. It was exactly like mine. Yes, you are -- Who are you, then? You exist here. I keep telling you. I want you here. Then you won't make it. I can't stay here. I never said I didn't. Neither did I. Thank you. You should have told me. I want every second I can get with you. Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you. No. Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here. You are her, you are Rheya. Rheya -- I don't think it knows it's torturing us. It's just watching. That won't happen again. We're different. I love you. It's all right. He is. But he was here... Gibarian. He was here. Do you? Not this time. Neither can I. Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap. There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us. For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me. That's all I know right now. Rheya. Don't debate him; he'll say anything. Those are dreams. Can you sleep? No. I love you. You... she said I didn't love her. Yes. Especially toward the end. I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are. When? When I'm asleep? Who have you been talking to? What are you talking about? Stop. What's wrong. Yes. Yes. It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice. He does have a point. That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven. Well. He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God. Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth. This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home. I know. I'm putting that in my next report. How could she not be real? I can smell her, taste her. She does exactly what she did... it's not possible. I think so. It's genetics. You know this. You know where it comes from. There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires. I don't know. I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me. You don't know? I did too. I know. I know. We don't have to talk about that. What kind of look? How old were you? Where've you been? You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why? As I said, it is beyond our comprehension. You're talking about a man in a white beard again. You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human. Human beings look for causes and patterns. How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything? The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man. Even the limits we put on it are human limits. It can do this, it can do that! It designs, it creates! It's something. Intelligent beyond our comprehension. Not exactly. It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time. It was completely counter-intuitive. We had to unlearn everything. Do you remember Beethoven? The Beatles? Movies, books, restaurants, friends? What do you remember? All right. How about I feel better when you take them? You're better when you take them. I am. Please come with me. I don't want to do this here. Let's go home. Rheya. Not here. Stop it. And tonight? You didn't look very happy. Poem. Dylan Thomas. I thought of it when I saw you on the train. "And Death Shall Have No Dominion". Rheya... Yes. To calm your anxiety. I'll be right back. Why? I'll just be a minute. I need to see Snow. Oh, God. I'm awake.Yes. If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it. It's changing characteristics. It's solidifying taking on weight. Whose side are you on? It's not human, Kelvin. Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that. Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win. I want humans to win. So I am killing it before it kills me. No, she won't. Kelvin, she begged me. I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters. She walked into it and disappeared. She was gone. Not her. It. Why did you agree to come here? Yes. She reappeared exactly as she had before? We're done. Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow. There's something wrong with him. Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is. I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home. In the lab. With her, probably. The same thing that could happen to any of us. Who, here, could possibly care what you want? At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction. They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you? Didn't you talk to Snow? You have to give me your word you won't come in. Then I'll come out. You want it coming back with us? Fuck me. I knew it. Snow, get up here, now. Gibarian was helpless. It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here. Followed by non-human manifestations. A recoil, with no compensating mechanism. They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual. We thought you'd be alone. We want to talk about... Why do you say that?But I can't leave with you. I won't make it. Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake. I won't be making the trip. You do, you don't. She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it. Don't you see? No, you don't. You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do? Who are you trying to please? Yourself? Her? Which her, this one or that one. Can you face both? We are in a situation that is beyond morality. So: Leave with her. You'll see the transformation. Maybe she doesn't need any. Should we check? Kelvin, she'll disintegrate. You don't believe me? Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it. I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours... What do you want to do, leave the station with her? What plan? What do you want? She knows everything? Does she know she came once before and you put her in -- Oh, this one you love? What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space? You didn't love her? Why do you think she hasn't suggested that? It's the most obvious solution: Escape. She knows she can't leave here -- What happened? That's right. And we all have to sleep, eventually. But they are human. They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own. DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough. They build up with experience. Perhaps it did. Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right? Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it. Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth. We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement. We can liquidate the station. Take the Athena back. Who are you trying to convince? Stop equivocating! Unbelievable, how you equivocate! You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen! This is happening, Kelvin. Wake up. If God is beyond our comprehension, and she -- -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here? You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book. We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own. That proves that -- I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances. Just a little strategy session. But in person this time. Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour? Kelvin, you awake? That's ludicrous. This is contact. We have found God. The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth. So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all? An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long. You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you. What are you going to report back to Earth? What will you say? Told you what? Probably. It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition. We were ready to go home. She has materialized from your memory of her. What was her name? Dead? I'm not sure. It started with Gibarian. He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door. He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown. I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there. By this time, we were getting visitors, too. He was desperately trying to figure it out. Day and night. Who was she? Personally, I think it's God. At least, it fits my definition. I told you, try to stay calm. You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch. Was her breakfast conversation that bad? Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door. How long can you go without sleep? How much sleep do you need? Oh, that's a relief. Who was it? Why, who did you see? Kelvin, if you see anything unusual... In his lab. He won't let you in. I can't talk just now. I'm too tired. I love chocolate. I realized just yesterday how much I love it. I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it. You didn't bring any chocolate, did you? He's dead. You go ahead. Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now. Everything's a blur. I like distinctions. I got rid of him. I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow. I'm not Snow. Gibarian was under enormous -- Are the actions of Solaris premeditated? And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness. It's an experiment. We want to talk freely. He won't. He won't do it.
