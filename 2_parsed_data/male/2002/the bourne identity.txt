You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over. Call it off. No you're not . You're not going anywhere. I'm shutting this down. We don't know what we're into! Forget it. -- inside the house? -- -- he went inside! -- This doesn't go upstairs. No. We can't risk it. What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned? I'm not asking. I want a second opinion. Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem. I'm bringing in some people from upstairs. Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is. I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility. And what if I couldn't do that? They're putting together an agency oversight committee. They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that? Yes. We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone. Was this Treadstone? Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.Why? What do they want me to do? I think so. What is Treadstone? Treadstone. Yes. Paris. I live in Paris... Treadstone? What do you mean? I won't ask again. That'll be their second worst mistake. Keep it. Jason Bourne is dead. I don't think so. That's all I get? So now you know. I know you've been trying to kill me. I don't know. What did you do to me ? Are you Treadstone? I don't know. Who do you think sent me? It's a lot more stressful than I thought. MPG Capital. Yeah, I know... Look, maybe I should just... I have a passport. I've got... Actually, it's a little complicated. Right. Yes. I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes... Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane? -- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait -- D'accord... Merci. Un moment -- un moment -- Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne. Paris? ...yes -- oui -- uh... Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number? Right. Yes. Of course. Who? Who came? ...I understand... Yes. Yes. Is he there? Yes, I'm here... That'd be great. I hadn't heard. Excuse me? Okay. Yes. Did you? Really. Thanks. Not really. Think I could rent a scooter? This your store? I'm gonna find the end of this. I can't protect you. I can't protect you anymore. If you're lucky. Take it. There's enough in there to make a life. Any life. Just get out now. Get low. Stay low. Take it . xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx We have to keep moving. xxxxxx I won't let that happen. xxxxxx Stop where you are. xxxxxx. You could do that? Go back to the hotel. I don't know. It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht. He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package. He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. Nykwana Wombosi. Let's go -- We got to get away from this phone. Who paid the bill? I don't know what happened! I don't know who he is! I don't know what he wants! I don't even know who I am! The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out! -- forget it -- -- how? -- -- there's no time -- You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know -- But I can't stay here. I can't . And where is he now? You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous. I didn't know this would happen. You're wrong. I didn't know. No. -- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now -- -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here -- Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this -- -- let me do this, okay? -- Marie, just -- -- just stay there! -- just -- -- just -- What? -- what? -- -- what is it? WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME? Open it -- -- do it -- what's he got in there? -- quiet -- quiet -- -- no -- Marie -- no ! -- it's not like that -- Go ahead. All this stuff -- it's all about boats. I think I'm in the shipping business. I guess so. How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know. Look, you could come up. Or you could wait if you want. I could go check it out. You could wait. Look, I don't know what's up there. Thanks for the ride. I don't remember any of this. I guess. Yeah. Pull in here. Park it. No. No. Go around. Keep going... Four-fifty. That's the address... Slow down. No, don't stop. Just... I thought about it. I don't know. I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up. I don't think I smoke. I can't believe I slept. Where are we? Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door -- I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it. I knew how to do it. There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports? I was shot twice in the back. I don't know. -- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it... But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and... I think something bad happened. I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could -- Nothing. It's just not there. No. That's what I'm saying. Look, go ahead...put the radio on... No. No, I mean, I really don't know who I am. I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago. I'm serious. I don't know. I don't know who I am. Listen to what you want. I don't know. I'm sorry. Really. What do you want me to do? I know that. Then I'll find another ride. I won't hurt you. I don't want to go alone. I want you to drive me to Paris. Like we're a couple. Like we're a couple and we're travelling together. That's all we're doing. I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home. Look, I want a ride to Paris. That's all I want. I swear. Wait up -- -- just wait up -- Okay. Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there. I said ten thousand. I want to go home. Get me out of here. Please . You don't want the police any more than I do. I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris. I've got a situation here and -- Please. I don't want to scare you. I need a ride out of here. I need a ride. -- here we go -- I found it -- -- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? -- -- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page -- -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? -- Is this it? -- -- this is it, right? -- Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In fact, I insist on it. Where's the book? I gotta sign in -- Shit, we didn't sign in. Where did this body go? I'm sorry. You're in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain. Get everyone down in the basement. Get in the basement. He run away often? Where's the dog?Wait a minute -- What the hell're you talking about? What? That old beast? Miss his breakfast? Not a chance. It's always something, right? My husband's out looking for him. xxxxxx... So now you're asking for a student visa? -- Miss Kreutz, please -- -- it's not the source of the information that's important here -- Miss Kreutz , excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States -- Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.I can't call it off. He's not responding. Get out of my way. You're not doing shit. You're so scared you can't even think. I'm going to Paris. We're in the shitter, man! Pick your poison. Maybe he's in there to finish the job. Maybe he's working for Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV together. Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move! What do you want to do? -- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike. -- if we can get a clean shot -- Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago. Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge. This is it. He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear. You give him another day to run and we may never find him. Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn? That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen. I have work to do. This is an operations desk . We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been sleeping down here. We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we finally have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here? I'd rethink that. No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is. We're exploring every possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you? She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one. Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far. Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it? We'll clean up the field. You clean up your budgets. You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical. You'd want to sign off on that. I thought you were never going to do that. You're asking me a direct question? I don't know what we're talking about. Jason... They can't let you go... There never was a Jason Bourne . You have to come with me. It's the only way. We can give it back to you... We have to go home, Jason. We'll make you better. We can put the pieces back. We can do that. So it's time to go home. Of course. We had to try. We didn't know what was wrong. We didn't know you were in trouble. They're right about you, aren't they? You're fried. You really don't know what's going on, do you? What did I do? I spent thirty million dollars on you. I spent three years finding you -- four years training you -- What did I do? What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason? Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell're you talking about? -- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here -- -- let's check that Interpol window again -- Enhance it. What's that? What do they have on the streets? The area. They must have something. And that's the best angle of the courtyard? That'll solve all our problems. What? It doesn't matter now. We've just got to be the first ones there. Get everybody up. I want them all activated. What the fuck is he doing? What? -- but it was him -- -- and they're sure it's him? -- Tell him we're busy. What?-- you gotta give me more to go on -- -- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! -- -- what're you talking about? --It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland. You drink rum? Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay? It came from your hip. Under the skin. You have a bank in Zurich. You remember Zurich? I told you. You need to rest. You we're lost at sea. They pulled you out. Who are you? You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back. You understand me? Who are you? You're on a boat. A fishing boat. Italian flag. We're out of Vietri. It's the cold that saved you. The water. The wounds are clean. I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay. It's clean. You're American. I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work -- You're awake. Can you hear me? You've been shot. I'm trying to help you. You were in the water. You've been shot. It's okay now.-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going -- -- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? -- -- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that -- So get the hell out of here. I said, someone came last night -- Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --...they won't let you go... ...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem... ...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up... ...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights... ...pills, right? Treadstone had those pills... ...it's a problem... ...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches... ...which one are you?... Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but... I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone.Let me get you a new copy of the proposal. We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke. Was it the break-in? We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive. Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better. I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel? Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat. We thought you were gone for good. Well... I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised. Mr. Kane... Come right in...please...have a seat.-- I'm on it -- It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just... Sir... Hang on... That's the only angle.-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! -- -- call the code! -- I want everyone out! -- -- we're evacuating the building --I won't forget this. I don't know. I don't remember Zurich. No. What if it doesn't come back? How did I get here? Where am I ? Where am I?Abbott. He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell. All of them? Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying to send us a message. Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag. Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night. -- yes, sir, it's confirmed -- -- he accessed the account -- I tried. Abbott wants to talk.
