-- Jesus, look at him -- -- what? -- you never saw a dead man  before? -- -- look, look he was shot -- -- don't, don't do that -- -- he's dead, you think he cares? -- -- so have some respect -- it's a -- -- it's here -- hang on -- it's here  somewhere -- give me a minute -- get  some blankets -- get some blankets  on him -- -- here we go -- here it is -- Giancarlo. We pick him up? Okay, we have to  pick him up. But that's as far as it  goes. He needs a doctor. Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't  care. We've wasted two hours on this  shit already. You do what you can,  but we're not going back. You understand me? Yes, sir. Let's get back to work! You're awake. Can you hear me? You've been shot. I'm trying to help  you. You were in the water. You've been  shot. It's okay now. Where am I? You're American. I thought so. From  your teeth -- the dental work -- Where am I? You're on a boat. A fishing boat.  Italian flag. We're out of Vietri. It's the cold that saved you. The  water. The wounds are clean. I'm not  a doctor, but the wounds, it looks  okay. It's clean. How did I get here? You we're lost at sea. They pulled  you out. Who are you? You were shot -- two bullets -- in  the back. You understand me? Who are you? I don't know. What if it doesn't come back? I told you. You need to rest. I can read. I can read that sign on  the door. I can count. I can talk... What are you doing? What is that? It came from your hip. Under the  skin. You have a bank in Zurich. You remember Zurich? No. Look, I'm just on this boat, okay?  I'm an engineer. Whatever this is,  it's not for me to be involved, okay? I don't remember Zurich. You drink rum? I don't know. I don't know who I am. Do you know  who I am? Do have any idea who I am? Tell me who I am. If you know who I  am, please stop fucking around and  tell me. It's not much, but it should get you  to Switzerland. I won't forget this. Una sola via? Si. One way. Una sola via. That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in  Paris the day before yesterday. I'm  sure most of you have a passing  knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of  you on the African desks have worked  with him over the years. Some of you  very closely... ...He was an irritation before he  took power. He was a problem when he  was in power. And he's been a disaster  for us in exile. Wombosi likes to send us messages  through the European media. This is  an interview we pulled down from a  local German television station in  Dresden. We've been getting these  little broadsides every couple of  months. He knows this -- he knows  that -- he's writing a book about  the Agency's history in Africa --  he's going to name names. It's  basically a shakedown... This interview -- and I'll make the  tape available for anyone who wants  it -- he goes on to claim that he  has just survived an assassination  attempt. He says it's us. He says  he's got proof. The overwhelming negative  ramifications of this should be  obvious. The Director wants to know if there  is any possible shred of truth in  this accusation. Can't you read the signs? On your feet. Let's go. Right now. The park is closed. There's no  sleeping in the park. Let's see some identification. Come on. Your papers. Let's go. I've lost them. I've... My papers. They are lost. Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up. -- look, I'm just trying to sleep  okay? -- -- no -- please God no -- please  don't -- please no -- my Go Abbott wants to talk. I tried. Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It  looks like rain and I don't have a  thing to wear. We're talking about Marseille. We're  talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And  I'm asking you if this abortion in  Marseille has anything to do with  Treadstone. Was this Treadstone? Yes. They're putting together an agency  oversight committee. They're going  to look through everyone's budgets.  Treadstone is a rather sizable line  item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that? And what if I couldn't do that? Can I help you? I'm here about a numbered account. If you'll just enter your account  number here I'll direct you to the  appropriate officer. They've been waiting your hand, sir... ...yes... The box. My name is Jason Bourne. Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason  Bourne, nice to meet you. Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I  live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris. I'm trying to think how long it's  been since I was here. I'm not sure. Must be three weeks. Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna  have to ask you to keep your voice  down. Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you  entered into a fraudulent marriage  in an effort to circumvent the  immigration laws of the United States -- -- it's not the source of the  information that's important here -- -- Miss Kreutz, please -- So now you're asking for a student  visa? -- he accessed the account -- -- yes, sir, it's confirmed -- You're up. Yes. I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes... Right. I have a passport. I've got... Actually, it's a little complicated. Look, maybe I should just... Yeah, I know... -- stop! -- stop right there! -- -- YOU -- red bag -- the red bag --  stop right there! -- hands up! -- -- no -- no -- hold your fire! -- -- he's got a gun! -- he's got a  gun! -- -- red! -- red! -- red! -- code red! --  South side entrance! -- male -- five- ten, brown hair -- black jacket --  red bag -- Excuse me?  Can I help you? -- what're you talking about? -- -- we're evacuating the building -- -- we're in the middle of a trade  meeting! -- -- call the code! -- I want everyone  out! -- -- you gotta give me more to go on -- -- he's running from the cops, he's  got a bag filled with God knows what,  he's in the building and I don't  know where! -- -- no! -- the other way! -- take the  backstairs! -- the backstairs! --  he's on the other side -- there's a  bomb! -- -- HALT! -- STOP WHERE YOU ARE! -- -- blow it -- shoot it open! -- -- check the closets! -- get those  back doors covered -- there's a  kitchen back there -- go! -- go! --  go! -- we're gonna go room by room until  we find him -- so let's get teamed  up -- I need a ride. I need a ride out of here. Please. I don't want to scare you. I've got a situation here and -- I'll give you ten thousand dollars  to drive me to Paris. You don't want the police any more  than I do. Get me out of here. Please. -- we got a cross-ref ready to go  here, sir, we're running hotel,  airline, train, and medical variables,  anything else you'd like? Sir... Zurich police are looking for an  American with a red bag. Apparently  he put two cops in the hospital last  night. Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying  to send us a message. All of them? Sir, the cross-ref is coming up  cold... I want to go home. I said ten thousand. Okay. Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there. Wait up -- -- just wait up -- Look, I want a ride to Paris. That's all I want. I swear. I don't want anything but a ride.  All I want to do is go home. I don't want to go alone. I want you  to drive me to Paris. Like we're a  couple. Like we're a couple and we're  travelling together. That's all we're  doing. I won't hurt you. Then I'll find another ride. I know that. I'm sorry. Really. What do you want  me to do? I don't know. Listen to what you want. I don't know. I don't know who I am. No. No, I mean, I really don't know  who I am. I can't remember anything  earlier than two weeks ago. I'm serious. Look, go ahead... put the radio on... That's what I'm saying. Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121... No. Nothing. It's just not there. I kept trying things, I thought if I  could find all the things I could  do, I could -- -- which was okay for a while, I was  okay with it... But then -- there's all these other  things -- all these other things I  know how to do -- and this -- this  stuff from the bank and... I think something bad happened. I don't know. I was shot twice in the back. There was a gun. Who has a safe  deposit box with a gun and all this  money and all these passports? I fought my way out of an embassy.   I climbed down a fifty-foot wall --  I went out the window and I was doing  it -- I just did it. I knew how to  do it. Why do I? -- I come in here --  instinctively -- first thing I do --  I'm looking for the exit -- I'm  catching the sightlines -- I know I  can't sit with my back to the door -- I can tell you the license plate  numbers of all three cars out front.  I can tell you that the waitress is  left-handed and the guy at the counter  weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds  and knows how to handle himself. I  know that the best, first place to  look for a gun is the cab of that  grey truck outside. I know that at  this altitude I can run flat out for  half a mile before I lose my edge. I  knew that you were my first, best  option out of Zurich? How do I know  all that? How can I know all that  and not know who I am? How is that  possible? That's the only angle. Hang on... Abbott. He knows about the embassy.  He's coming down for a show and tell. Sir... It's an angle of the street -- some  sort of alleyway -- you can just... Where are we? I can't believe I slept. I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm  asleep and I can't wake up. I don't think I smoke. I thought about it. I don't know. Who is she? Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty-  six. Born outside Munich. Father was  a welder. He died in '91. We don't  have the mother. There might be a  step-sister, we're trying to track  that down. It's tough. She's a wanderer. She  pops up on the grid here and there  but... I mean, the last time she  paid an electric bill in Europe was  '94. No taxes. No steady employer.  She's got three arrests. Two  shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one  in Germany. And she actually did  three months in an Italian detention  center for credit card fraud. No political affiliations? I'm assuming we're exploring that  possibility. Pursuit would indicate that you know  exactly where he is. Yes, well, I think we need some fresh  eyes on this problem. I'm bringing  in some people from upstairs. I want a second opinion. I'm not asking. Slow down. No, don't stop. Just... Four-fifty. That's the address... No. No. Go around. Keep going... Yeah. Pull in here. Park it. I guess. I don't remember any of this. Sorry. The money, right? Thanks for the ride. Look, I don't know what's up there. Look, you could come up. Or you could  wait if you want. I could go check  it out. You could wait. How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know. Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming... Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was  wondering -- I haven't seen you -- Here I am. I've been ringing your bell. It's  good you were away. We had some  trouble with the hot water. It's  been repaired. Great. We could use a shower. It was a long drive. I guess so. This is my frying pan. This is my spoon. I'm Jason Bourne and this is my  kitchen. All this stuff -- it's all about  boats. I think I'm in the shipping business. Go ahead. "You have no messages." ...yes -- oui -- uh... Paris? Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason  Bourne. D'accord... Merci. Un moment -- un moment -- -- hang on -- I need you to check  another name for me -- hang on -- un  moment, s'il vous plait -- Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael  Kane? Yes, I'm here... Yes. Is he there? Yes. ...I understand... Who? Who came? Right. Yes. Of course. Do you -- his brother -- do you have  a phone number? Hang on. I'll check the kitchen... Maybe it takes a while to get all  the way upstairs. Yeah, it's cold in here, too... Let's give it another minute. -- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not  like that -- -- quiet -- quiet -- Open it -- -- do it -- what's he got in there? Who are you? -- who are you? -- who are you? -- tell me who you  are -- who sent you? -- -- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME? What? -- what? -- -- what is it? -- just -- Marie, just -- -- just stay there! -- just -- -- let me do this, okay? -- Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's  going on? Is everything all right in  there? --I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne --  you give me no choice -- I'm calling  them right away! -- -- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? --  where are your shoes? -- Marie -- Marie -- look at me -- there's no  time for this -- -- we can't stay here -- I can't  stay here -- it's not safe here -- -- we can go -- I can get us out of  here -- but we have to go now -- No. You're wrong. I didn't know. I didn't know this would happen. And where is he now? You believe what you want, but I'm  telling you the truth -- I never  would have brought you here if I  thought it was dangerous. You stay -- if you want, you stay --  it's okay -- it's better -- maybe  it's better -- I don't know -- But I can't stay here. I can't. -- there's no time -- -- how? -- -- forget it -- I don't know what happened! I don't know who he is! I don't know  what he wants! I don't even know who  I am! The only thing I know is that  if I stay here, I'm never gonna find  out! Come with me. I can get us out of here. I know it.  Then we can think. Then we can work  it out. We'll explain it then.  Once  we're safe. I can protect you. Let's assume that's true. What if he is working for someone  else? What if he turned? No. You know who you are. You know what  that's worth? That's everything. I can't live like this. I can't do  anything until I know who I am.  Believe me, you don't want what I  have. Who paid the bill? Destin Navigational, can I help you? Hey, how are you. I'm trying to reach  Richard? Is he there. I'm afraid there's no Richard here. Well, where are you? Where am I  calling? This is an answering service, sir.  The company's located in Southampton,  but -- -- this is a tire dealership, right? No sir, this is a navigational chart  registry. I'm afraid you have the  wrong number. Marseille-Tropez Marina, how can I  help you? Hey, so this is the Marina, right? Yes, sir. Can I help you? This is the one in Marseille, right? The number you have dialed has been  disconnected. If you think you've  reached this message in error-- "You've reached the office of Simon  Rawlins at Alliance Security Maritime  Division. Paris office hours are  from nine a.m. to six p.m. If this  is an emergency, please call our  twenty-four hour help line at..." -- I'm on it -- Sir. I've got a code here from NSA --  they're not gonna give us Keyhole  satellite clearance unless we have  sign-off from upstairs. No. We can't risk it. This doesn't go upstairs. Mr. Kane... Come right in... please... have a  seat. Thanks. Well... I must admit, when my assistant told  me you were here I was, really -- I  was quite -- I was surprised. Really. We thought you were gone for good. Did you? Well, I mean it's a tough business,  isn't it? Cutthroat. Look, our bid -- it was competitive --  but definitely at the high end of  competitive -- when we didn't hear  back from you, we did some re-analysis  of the numbers, and honestly, we'd  really like a chance to do a bit  better. I'm assuming you're still in the  market. It's the same vessel? Yes. We just picked up a job quite like  the one we were bidding for you.  Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy-  five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think  we learned a few things that might  allow us to make our proposal for  your job, as I said, a bit more  competitive. Okay. Was it the break-in? Excuse me? We also thought we hadn't heard from  you -- we've had a bit of a publicity  nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into --  vandalism mostly -- shortly after we  last spoke. I hadn't heard. Let me get you a new copy of the  proposal. That'd be great. Let's go -- We got to get away from this phone. Kane. John Michael Kane. I want to see the body. What the hell's going on here? They came last night.  His brother. Who are these people? Who are you? What's going on here? Where did this body go? I said, someone came last night -- Look, this isn't a carnival -- people  call and they make an appointment  and they follow the rules -- everyone  signs in and out -- this is a serious  place -- serious work -- it's not  just to come in whenever you like -- Shit, we didn't sign in. So get the hell out of here. Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In  fact, I insist on it. Where's the  book? I gotta sign in -- Is this it? -- -- this is it, right? -- -- slow down -- you can't just take  the book like that -- -- don't sweat it, I have a pen --  no problem -- just let me find the  page -- -- honey, why don't you wait for me  outside, okay? -- -- we have rules here, this is a  very serious place -- I'm the one  who decides who gets in here, okay? -- -- what do I? -- I put the name of  the person I came to see? -- -- this is serious business down  here and we cannot have people coming  and going -- -- here we go -- I found it -- -- what are you? -- what are you  doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped  the book! -- you stupid fucki-- Nykwana Wombosi. It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty  million dollar yacht. He's the proud  owner of an Alliance Security package. He also paid a visit to the morgue  to see John Michael Kane. I don't know. Go back to the hotel. They found him. They found Bourne. Where? You better come in. Omigod. -- minutes -- he's close -- -- he went inside! -- -- inside the house? -- Forget it. We don't know what we're into! Is he here? MPG Capital. It's a lot more stressful than I  thought. Who do you think sent me? I don't know. -- he's not responding -- -- we just ran a remote diagnostic,  sir, it's not the unit -- What are you doing? No you're not. You're not going  anywhere. I'm shutting this down. You just blew up a house in Paris!  This program is over. Call it off. You could do that? xxxxxx... xxxxxx. Stop where you are. Where's the dog? My husband's out looking for him. He run away often? That old beast? Miss his breakfast?  Not a chance. It's always something, right? Get in the basement. What? Get everyone down in the basement. What the hell're you talking about? You're in danger. All of you. I have  no time to explain. Wait a minute -- I'm sorry. xxxxxx I won't let that happen. xxxxxx Go! We have to keep moving. xxxxxx xxxxxx Wait 'till he's close. xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Who else is coming? I won't ask again. I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone. What do you mean? Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone... both of us... I was  warned but... Treadstone? ...which one are you?... Paris. I live in Paris... ...headaches... you have that... I  get such bad headaches... Yes. ...it's a problem... Treadstone. ...or in a car... when it's dark...  something with the headlights... ...pills, right? Treadstone had those  pills... What is Treadstone? ...what did you do?... you must've  really fucked up... I think so. ...someone said caffeine -- for a  headache... doesn't seem... What do they want me to do? ...they won't let you go... Why? Look at this... ...least you have a woman.... Take this. Take it. If you're lucky. Take it. There's enough in there to make a  life. Any life. Just get out now.  Get low. Stay low. Take it. I can't protect you anymore. I'm gonna find the end of this. I can't protect you. What did you do to me? Are you Treadstone? What did you do to me? I don't know. I know you've been trying to kill  me. So now you know. That's all I get? I don't think so. Jason Bourne is dead. Keep it. That'll be their second worst mistake. The Treadstone project has actually  already been terminated. It was  designed primarily as a sort of  advanced game program... ...We'd hoped it might build into a  good training platform, but quite  honestly, for a strictly theoretical  exercise, we thought it was far too  expensive. The cost-benefit ratio  was just too high. It's been all but  decommissioned at this point. All right, what's next? Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar  is a joint, DOD, communications  program that we really feel has good  traction to it. This your store? Think I could rent a scooter? Not really.
