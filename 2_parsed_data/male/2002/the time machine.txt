Yes. Just about here. Around here. ... Well, you wanted to see it. I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire. So we can find our way home. Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt. I'll find her. I think we should go on by ourselves. What happened? What kind of stories? You have books?! Kalen, you've got to take me there. There might be history. Records. Something to help us find where the Morlocks took -- Where? Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them? How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened? I'm so sorry, Kalen. Exactly like you. Well, maybe not as healthy. ... Thousands and thousands of people. And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories. 'Fraid so. Just a regular old... mud carrier. Ah... no. On the towers? I had an accident. The journey is part of my work. I will... I'll never forget this. I don't understand. I won't leave you like this. Vox... What can I do? Tell me what to do. Vox -- This has to end. This has to end. No... What do you mean? Why did they built it? What's it all for? Vox? Do you know which way? Machines? Yes... Thank you. Yes. But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again. This is the way in? Oh, shut up. Yes. Yes... My God... I saw this. Kalen... hold on a minute. What? Last night. I'm used to that. Yes. You'll live like this forever. Alone. You were meant to help. To be with people. Not like this. Because you'll never die. We need your help. Can you show us where they live? How have you survived so long? But you escaped. Do you know where they live? You know of them? Please, we need your help. The Morlocks have taken -- Sir... have you a name? I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that -- What are you? 1899. How did you know?! Because... I don't think that's going to happen. I'm tired of running. I know. I'm a foolish man. No... No... A man can change his history. You took her because she helped me. So you take their best... Why? I could tell them. Warm them of what's to come. Say I just come back again? Why would you let me go back? What? It can't all be like this... But this is barbaric! Have you completely lost all sense of -- No... they didn't survive only to be your food. You did that. And what of the Eloi? How? How do you control the Morlocks? As slaves. Created? You came underground when the world was ending above. And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others -- Alexander. You have my word... ... She's just a beauty. Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment. I just love mechanical things. How do you keep the water temperature stable? I've only read about them -- and the new internals. It's spectacular... Why is it -- breaking up? No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible! What's happening to the moon?! I -- what are you?! I have something for you... Let them. It's only a machine. I've seen it. The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels. Not like this. Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare. And I will thank God for them every moment of every day. No, I'm fine. I'm... ... wonderful. Just walking down the street with you again. My God... I want to get into the light, that's all. Please... Shhh. Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right? Nothing -- let's just get out of the park. No... let's walk through the city. Not here... alone. Please. I need... to talk to you. Holding you... again. You know I can't. Got here as soon as I could. Your birth stone. I thought -- I know it's not a diamond but -- Hold on... I know I have it... Oh dammit, I love you! I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently. I mean... well... affection. Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you. What? Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors. Not here... alone. May we? Please? I need to... um... talk to you. Sorry... I was distracted. What? You know I can't. Got here as soon as I could. This... was my home. And this would be my study. There was an elm tree outside the window then. Good night, David. In a week... we will never have had this conversation. You won't say that in a week. That's absurd -- I can't leave when I'm so close. I can't do that -- I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you. You wouldn't believe me. David... I appreciate your concern, I do. But I ask you to have faith in me. Just for a little while longer. I'm working on something now. Something... extraordinary. That's where you're wrong. I will change it. Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now. The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story? In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger. I have to make the decision. Which door conceals Emma? And I just stand there... looking at the doors... You don't know that. You couldn't possibly. If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later. If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring. You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong. I live with it every minute of every day. That's because I'm working. You remember that? You used to care about your work. Hiding? You care for me. And you're concerned. And I have to start living my life again. I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day. For God's Sake, David -- Then why are you here? I'm sorry, David. I've been working. Perseverance. Oh? Do you have a romantic bone in your body? That's how I knew we were destined to be together. When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk. They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled. At that moment -- I just knew. How did you know with Molly? Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me. Nothing. In the future, we'll be better. But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this? I don't. I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see. Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat. Do you want your students to turn out like them? You sound like my father... Where's the challenge in that? ... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination. The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity. God, and I'm running late -- Damned if I can keep her out of my equations. I was not. ... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order. All right, all right -- here -- everything -- I don't understand. Sir...? Thank you... My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is. Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen. Mara -- what -- ?! Mara...? Mara -- I could... Yes... I suppose so. Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape. Good -- it looks fine. We had quite a ride together... You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives. Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much. I thank you for that. If you only knew... Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better. Yes. This is where my journey started... right here. Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path. We're on the carriage path. Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park. Orion's belt... Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but... Oh, it was... ... Most of the time. Only to keep warm. For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night. Oh very. Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time. Night and day. Oh, very much... ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think. A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature. ... It was a great city. The greatest city in the world. How do you decide? What are you? Or mud carriers. Most things. We're very high on purpose. I mean, why do you do it? What purpose does it serve? What's it all for? What you need is an engineer. If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily. I can see Kalen's point. And this is your "work"? This is magnificent... You share dreams? That's incredible. All of you? Yes! Yes. Mara, I had a strange dream last night. I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then... Good night. Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights. I never really noticed them much... You can see so many here. Thank you... I will... Is he all right? For a time it was astounding. I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by. We made such advances. I don't understand half of them. There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists -- Yes. Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged... Why not? More than 800,000 years. Allowed me to travel from my time to yours. I know it's hard to believe, but it's true. You might find the truth rather hard to understand. What makes you say that? It's hard for me to imagine a better place. Where I come from there's so much... frenzy. Day and night. It seems we're all running faster and faster... ... All in identical bowler hats. Your husband is dead? His curiosity is amazing. Some. But I mean we aren't all so... handsome. Thank you. Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really. It's rather hard to explain. Yes... That'll be all. All right, Mrs. Watchit. You can go. Tell him to go away -- Here? Ouch -- all right, wish me luck. Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me? What's the matter with -- ? -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit? Don't torture me -- do you have it? Do you have it?! Yes, sir. Because it's a new way of seeing the world! Of seeing our place in it! My equations are not parlor-tricks! With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could? Sir -- No, sir -- And roosters. Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date. The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times. They want to explore. Because the assigned curriculum is boring. Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit. Imagine that. Exactly correct, sir. I see. You won't even try? Then it's time to change that -- My God! How can you just do nothing!? They're your friends, your family. You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to -- You know that's not true. What do you mean?! We have to go after them, find where -- ! Where do they take them?! I suppose so. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps? Yes. I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to? An elder or patriarch of some kind? To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley. Oh, very different. But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such. But not everywhere. And more roads. And buildings. I took a different route. No... Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers. "Eloi"? I did...Very good. Now if you will excuse us for a moment. Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point? The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks. Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen. I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years. I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding. Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records. No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters. They are science. Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you. Perhaps they don't "challenge" you -- Do they? Might I ask why? But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum. Well, just as I thought. Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics! As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct? Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen. I received the most extraordinary letter last week. From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents. They are our employers, after all. This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen. Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go. You supported his application, Dr. Philby. You are his senior, advisor. I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses. Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both. Young man, we have a way of doing things here. Radical theorizing is not acceptable. Have I made myself understood? My fowl have polluted the yard.But there's nothing here. This is it? But you're only a mud carrier. No... He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that. I don't think he even got this far. I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare. About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts... No one ever comes here. My mother told me stories about it late at night. They tell all the children. I shouldn't have mentioned it. We can't go there. The Hall of Books. There's a place that might help... we could try going there. We're not supposed to think about it. But I dream about it sometimes... What else can they do? She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her. And everyone looks like us? Don't tell me you're a mud carrier. I'm training to be a high climber. What do you do on the towers? I figured that. What kind of accident? Now how did you get hurt? It must have been hard, leaving your work. They're inside -- They're here! They're inside the house -- ! You'll tell me more tomorrow? I want to see your home. Will you take me? I am. Are you a climber? What did you do at night? I found you. I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place! How did you get hurt?We can't change the day and the night, Alexander. This is the world. We are what we are. This is out life, Alexander. It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived. We choose to believe it. They've gone to a better place. Alexander, I know you're trying to help. But they don't come back. We don't know. Good morning, Alexander. Feeling up to some work? Of course. You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight? My father has gone to a better place. I am the oldest. New Yorkers. Why? He said he traveled for two months. We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren. Do you know him? New Yorkers. What are your people called? Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside. And hungry, I'd say. You had such a long journey.Next time then. We perambulate here most every night. Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation. Tell you all about her. God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell! How did you know to do that? There's a cantilevered gasket on the -- Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on. Thanks. Old Nell's my girl all right. Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.And why not? But you've earned a reward for your valor. I think you should become. You'll like it here. Once you get used to the darkness. Oh, you won't be running for long... Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware? I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds. That was a foolish thing to do. It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?... If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger... Now will you go? After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that? She won't remember you. None of them will. You will be forgotten. That is how history works. Yes. Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi. But you should be happy for her. She won't remember the creature she was. She will... become. When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool. We're breeding them for submission. Soon they will be fully domesticated. We have lost the capacity to reproduce. But the species must continue. Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw. Why would you come back to this? To save a few cattle? No. Because the past is immutable. Frozen. Dead... And you are the past. Go back to where you came from. Or die here. And who are you, Alexander? Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution? This is the world now. I am fact. I'm afraid your indignation is lost here. I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot. It's just how we live now. They survived above. Became what they are. As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated. We make them see what we wish. And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't. Our adaptation was too successful. We survived... we endured... for this. To work the machines and build the tunnels. You can't imagine what it was like when it all started. We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails. Endlessly. For generations. And we... became. You wouldn't understand. We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs. No, we created the Morlocks. Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions -- What's your name?His home. I'm glad. Good night, Alex. All right. I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed? I pray to God that in a week you're not here. You're dying here. Don't you see that?! There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes. A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them. Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here -- When's the last time you were outside this house -- -- or this room? Why don't you come to our house instead? I would. What is it? Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but -- Do you find her? It wasn't your fault, Alex. I know that -- What happened to Emma will never go away. It's part of you now and it always will be. But you have to learn to live with it... I care more about my life. And yours. You know that's what it is. Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night -- But you won't listen. You won't see me, you won't see anyone. What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy? That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory -- There are some things I need to say to you. You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance -- It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson. He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming. I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore. It hurt me, Alex. Very much. I came by the house every day after the funeral. And then every week. Then every other month. Then I stopped coming. Did you even notice? All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?! She's gotten into your equations. Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you. No, I'm all bowler hat, remember? She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted. The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand. How romantic... What? You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex. Little grey men with little grey hats. I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge. Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor. You might want to play things a little more conservatively. You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers. Tonight's the night? Somewhere around "D+2xy something something." Do you know you were humming? Yes, sir. If I might explain, sir -- Sir, if I may -- Dean Fulton... I have no doubt of that. I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it. Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit. I'm glad he's gone. Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy. And you've no idea where he went? I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for? Hello, Mrs. Watchit. You're looking in the pink.Did you hear me, lad? And your jewelry too. I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss. I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now. Couldn't help but overhearing. Two fine young people starting out on the road of life. I wish you the very best.I should hope not... ... Alexander... Make them read my books. Tell them who they are. Who they could be. Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate. I'm going to end it, Alexander. As we discussed... Go back to the light. You weren't made for this. I was... I was made for this moment. I'm babbling. Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go. Take her out of here... ... I don't have long. Nothing to do, I'm afraid. I'm just a librarian after all. Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling. Very Byronic end, though. I appreciate that. Do you know Byron? Takes a licking but keeps on ticking... ... For a while anyway. Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays... End...? How are your dreams now? They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them. Trust me... You don't want to see any more. Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you. You're not going to find what you're looking for. The Morlocks didn't build this. The air... the power. This way. Yes. In for a penny, in for a pound. Do you know that saying? Yes... Are you sure you want to do this? It's what they want you to see. Aren't you a plucky little -- ? So, do we go on? It was meant to. It frightens you. Send him home. You don't want him to see it. Send him away. When was his mother taken? And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time? So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you? See all the mysteries exposed? Excuse me? Why should I help you? You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed! A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world! You're no better than the Morlocks! Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand. It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity. I was lucky. The others weren't. Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time. They used us much as your people did. Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts. Who doesn't know the Morlocks? Morlocks -- I am called Vox... ... Now you are Eloi. An "automaton"?! Please! I'm a biomechanical organism. Well, what's left of one. What's left of all of them, actually. I am the last... ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins." T.S. Eliot. You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour. Very shy though... hiding over here... I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian. I must say, you look remarkably good. You don't want a book then? I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for -- -- 800,000 years perhaps. Don't keep me in suspense. What year? Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth. This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances. It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden -- Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible. The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies -- The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies. Can I tell you more? I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk. VOX registration NY-114. May I help you? May I help you?
