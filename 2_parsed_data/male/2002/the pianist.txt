Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews. A beauty. Who is she? Someone you know? Why are you here, Mr. Wladek? I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany! To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse. Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them? Will I still be able to play? What did I tell you?Who told you? Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance.. It costs. Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me! Tough luck. I haven't seen him. I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work... Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street? Someone's got to do it, Henryk. Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police... We're recruiting.Yes, please. But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean... Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see! Who's recruiting? Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them! What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour? Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja. What's this about? The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything. And suppose they take the table away? Yes, that's why I brought it. 'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?' You'll be deported. You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise... Hungry. That's also my business. It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business? I can look after myself! What did you pay him? Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach? You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him? Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie. You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn. Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions. Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys. No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy. A good place for what? He's insane! We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this. In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it. You know what we do? We use psychology. No, no. Listen, I've been thinking -- Mama, that was a great dinner. Warsaw's not the only radio station.Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him? I'm not, but Majorek is. Why didn't you come to me? Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek. I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble? I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York? Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty. That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets. There are always notices going up. You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical. You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough. Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God. The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov. No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite. Ah, here. Today's news from the other side....not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you. Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station-- Wladek! How are you?Liar, you fell asleep. Pig! If I play like an angel, why don't you listen? Takes one to know one! Pig! Dirty pig! Pig! Pig! You know what? You treat me like dirt! Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician. You can't, it's too dangerous. Oh, yes. I remember.I was listening, Kitten. You're a dirty pig! Bitch! Cow! I treat you like dirt because you are dirt. What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice. In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up. Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often. Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day. You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her. Yes. It's like this... I...we...all of them. Who wants me to stop? When's your baby due? And how's Yurek? How long have you been married? I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay. I need help. I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr-- -- a Mr Dzikiewicz. Dorota. I'll see you...soon. Don't worry, it won't last long. How are you doing? Dorota! Wladek, please. Wladek, please. Yes! It was...it was unforgettable. You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful. It's nothing. Who are you? Hello. For what? For my tie? How will we sleep? Let me see this. Let's find out. What are you doing? Where do you want me to go? Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here? What's happened? What's happened? Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on. I'll be fine. wish I knew you better. Funny time to say this. Halina? Calm down, what, what is it? What's happened? What, I'm working, what? People I know. They said you're an important man. Yitzchak, they told me you had influence. I've no money. Can you help us? Can you help? Believe me, they've picked him up. Henryk's in there. Very appropriate. What are you reading? Otherwise what? What's that mean, no employment certificate? What's the matter? Are you sick? You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad. They were taking you away. Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food! I didn't grovel, I asked him to help. You're out, aren't you? What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work. It's not funny. I know. That's better than yesterday. You sell anything? But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw! Just shut up. Of course they'll notice it. But look-- This is a good place for something. We use what? That makes a change. It certainly was. They bombed us, we're off the air. Yes, but what good did it do? Yes, so did the Germans. should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them. Can you help? I've no money... I didn't know you were in the certificate business. I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops... You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East? Not this week. Toilets? There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables. But I want to help, I want to. Jehuda, give me something to do. I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news. So, what's the news? You're amazing, Jehuda. Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career. Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek... Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you? Jurek? Wladek Szpilman. You made contact? I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends. I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here? Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here. If you need help... How long have you been here? I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all. No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home. I'm not going anywhere. And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases? Out of Warsaw. Where? Where are we going? It's a little cut, nothing. Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks. Sorry, I don't remember. No, I don't think so? Szpilman. I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio. What about you? I don't know how to thank you. Are the Russians here? What's happening? What's all that gunfire? In the attic. I am... I was a pianist. I was... I was trying to open this tin.Szpilman. Good name for a pianist. Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you. I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over? Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe. Not yet. We're getting out. The Russians. On the other side of the river. All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks. Show me. Where are you hiding? A pianist. What's your work? Where do you live? What the hell are you doing?
