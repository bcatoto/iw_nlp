Hello. Who are you? It's nothing. C'mon, Dorota, you can write him a  fan letter later, this isn't the  best time, c'mon. Jurek, why have you been hiding  her? What you think, should I take Uncle  Szymon's photograph? He'll come home, he'll be all right. It's a little cut, nothing. I told her not to worry. You had  your papers on you. If you'd been  hit by a bomb, they'd have known  where to take you. What did I tell you? What are you doing? They bombed us, we're off the air. Warsaw's not the only radio station. Where are we going? Out of Warsaw. Where? Heard what? The government's moved to Lublin. There's hardly anybody left in  this building, only women, the men  have gone. And what do you think you'll do  while you're setting up a new line  of defence? Wander round lugging  your suitcases? I'm not going anywhere. No, no, no, I'm staying put. If  I'm going to die, I prefer to die  at home. Sssh! Ssh! I've got something, listen... ... an important announcement.  News has just been received through  the BBC that Great Britain, having  had no reply... ...and therefore has declared war  on Nazi Germany... ... next few hours... awaiting  latest news... ... but France is expected to make  a similar announcement... ... Poland is no longer alone. Mama, that was a great dinner. It certainly was. Here's to Great Britain and France. I told you. Didn't I tell you? All  will be well. Five thousand and three. Yes, five thousand and three zlotys,  that's all we've got left. Banks? Who'd be stupid enough to  deposit money in a German bank? No, no, no. I'll tell you what  we'll do. We'll use tried and tested  methods. You know what we did in  the last war? We made a hole in  the table leg and we hid the money  in there. And suppose they take the table  away? The Germans go into Jewish homes  and they just take what they want,  furniture, valuables, anything. Idiot! What would they want with a  table? No, no. Listen, I've been thinking -- That makes a change. You know what we do? We use  psychology. We use what? We leave the money and the watch  on the table. And we cover it like  this. In full view. The Germans will  search high and low, I promise  you, they'll never notice it. Of course they'll notice it. But  look-- This is a good place for something. A good place for what? He's insane! Just shut up. My violin? Will I still be able to play? Let's find out. Jurek? Wladek Szpilman. Wladek! How are you? Fine, we're fine, thank you, and  you? Fine, we're fine in the  circumstances. But I can guess  what you've called about. There's  nothing we can do; they won't reopen  the station-- Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek... ...not even music, nothing, no  radios for the Poles. But I'm sure  you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist  like you. Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't  be offended, I didn't call to  discuss my future career. You know something? Meeting you  like that was absolutely wonderful. Yes! It was...it was unforgettable. Wladek, please. I could accompany you, me on the  piano, you on the cello. Wladek, please. 'Re: emblems for Jews in the Warsaw  District. I hereby order that all  Jews in the Warsaw District will  wear visible emblems when out of  doors. This decree will come into  force on the 1st December 1939 and  applies to all Jews over twelve  years of age. The emblem will  be worn on the right sleeve and  will represent a blue Star of David  on a white background. The  background must be sufficiently  large for the Star to measure eight  centimetres from point to point.  The width of the arms of the Star must be one centimetre. Jews who  do not respect this decree will be  severely punished. Governor of  Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer.' I won't wear it. Let me see this. Doesn't it say we have to provide  these armbands ourselves? Where  will we get them? We're not going to get them. We're  not going to wear them! You! Why didn't you bow? I'm sorry I... You are forbidden to walk on the  pavement. Walk in the gutter! What, I'm working, what? What is it? That's where they're going to put  us. What d'you mean, put us? But...they won't get all of us...  we'll...it's too small...there's  four hundred thousand of us in  Warsaw! No. Three hundred and sixty  thousand, so it'll be easy. That's the price. That's what I'm  offering. And my advice is to  accept. You won't get more from  anyone else. Two thousand. My advice is to take  it. What you going to do when you're  hungry? Eat the piano? Get out! You're a thieving bastard,  we don't want your money, get out!  We'd rather give it away! Get out! Hey! Hey! What's the matter with  you? Haven't you eaten today, what  you suffering from? Hey! You people are crazy! I'm doing  you a favour, two thousand, and  I'm paying for the removal, I'm  not even charging for the removal. You haven't eaten today, you're  crazy... Take it. Dorota! How are you doing? Don't worry, it won't last long. I'll see you...soon. To tell you the truth, I thought  it would be worse. How will we sleep? You sell anything? Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot.  Three zlotys. That's better than yesterday. Three lousy zlotys. And there are  people here making millions. I know. You don't know, believe me. They  bribe the guards. The guards turn  a blind eye. They're bringing in  cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor,  French cosmetics, and the poor are  dying all around them and they  don't give a damn. I'm afraid not. Sometimes I wish I could go mad. This is totally insane; why do we  have to have a gentile street  running through our area? Can't  they go around? Don't worry about it, they're about  to build a bridge, haven't you  heard? A bridge, a schmidge, and the  Germans claim to be intelligent.  You know what I think?  I think  they're totally stupid. I've got a  family to feed and I spend half my  time here waiting for them to let  us through. Dance! Faster! Go on, faster! Dance! Dance! Dance! What's this about? So, what are you doing here? He brought cakes. His father's back in the jewellery  business and doing well, isn't  that so, Yitzchak? Amazing.   Jewellery. We're recruiting. Who's recruiting? Don't be clever with me, Henryk.  I've come here as a friend. They're  bringing Jews in from all over the  country. Soon there'll be half a  million people in the ghetto. We  need more Jewish police... Oh? More Jewish police? You mean  you want me to wear a cap like  yours, beat up Jews with my  truncheon and catch the Gestapo  spirit. I see! Someone's got to do it, Henryk. But why me? I thought you only  recruited boys with rich fathers.  Look at my father, look at us, I  mean... Yes, I'm looking at you and that's  why I'm here. Your whole family  can have a better life. You want  to go on struggling for survival,  selling books on the street? Yes, please. I'm doing you people a favour. And  what about you, Wladek? You're a  great pianist. And we've got an  excellent police jazz band. They'd  welcome you with open arms. Join  us. You've got no work... Thank you. But I've got work. I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you  to stop. Who wants me to stop? Help me! help me! I always say look on the bright  side. You're in the small ghetto,  intellectuals, professional people,  you're better off than us. Here,  in the large ghetto, it's a  cesspool. But you, you're living  in Monte Carlo. You could say you're  privileged and that, of course,  goes against my principles.   Nevertheless... Ah, here. Today's news from the  other side. You're amazing, Jehuda. No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers  everywhere. They bring me news and  food. We care about our fellow  human beings. Workers of the world  unite. So, what's the news? The Germans are advancing on  Kharkhov. I don't know why I come here every  evening, it's always such bad news. Bad news, you crazy? You have no  world view, Wladek, that's your  trouble. The news couldn't be  better. The moment Hitler invaded  Russia, I knew we'd be all right.  Remember Napoleon. Same business.  The Germans will freeze to death,  please God. Jehuda, give me something to do. You're an artist, Wladek, you keep  people's spirits up. You do enough. But I want to help, I want to. You're too well known, Wladek. And  you know what? You musicians don't  make good conspirators. You're  too...too musical. There are notices going up. The  city's to be cleansed of  undesirables. There are always notices going up. Majorek, this is the greatest  pianist in Poland, maybe in the  whole world. Wladyslaw Szpilman.  Meet Majorek. Majorek used to be in the army.  Brilliant man. He's got a mind  like a searchlight. The only thing  I've got against him is he's not a  socialist. You'd better go now, Wladek. It's  nearly curfew. You see these, Wladek?  You know  how many copies we print of our  newspaper? Five hundred. You know how many  people on average read one copy?   Twenty.  That makes ten thousand  readers. These will start the  uprising. Majorek hides them in  his underpants. And leaves them in  toilets. Toilets? Okay, then I'll tell you something  funny. You know who I mean by Dr.  Raszeja. The surgeon. Well, for some reason,  don't ask me why, the Germans  allowed him into the ghetto to  perform an operation... He got a pass, that's all I know.  Anyway, he puts the patient to  sleep and starts the operation.  He'd just made the first incision  when the SS burst in, shoot the  patient lying on the table, and  then shoot Dr. Raszeja and everybody  else who was there. Isn't that a  laugh? The patient didn't feel a  thing, he was anaesthetised - What's the matter with you all?  Have you lost your sense of humour? It's not funny. Well, you know what's funny? You're  funny with that ridiculous tie. What are you talking about, my  tie? What's my tie got to do with  anything? I need the tie for my  work. Your work, yes, playing the piano  for all the parasites in the ghetto,  they don't give a damn about  people's sufferings, they don't  even notice what's going on around  them! I blame the Americans. For what? For my tie? American Jews, and there's lots of  them, what have they done for us?  What do they think they're doing?  People here are dying, haven't got  a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers  over there should be persuading  America to declare war on Germany! Stand up! Stand up! Run!  Run! What's happened? Calm down, what, what is it? I'm afraid not. What's happening? They've got my grandson in there.  They pick 'em up, they take 'em  away. What do they do to them?  I've stopped believing in God! Yitzchak! Yitzchak! Here, please! Wladek Szpilman! Henryk's in there. I haven't seen him. Believe me, they've picked him up. Tough luck. Can you help? Oh, you need me now, yes, now you  need me! Can you help us? It costs. I've no money. Then there's nothing I can do. He  should've joined us when I gave  him the chance.. Yitzchak, they told me you had  influence. Who told you? People I know. They said you're an  important man. Boys, keep your peckers up! And  girls, keep your legs crossed! Don't let 'em get you down - Bandits! Crooks!  Thieves! Good day, Herr Rubinstein. If that means good day, I'm your  man, you gangsters, robbers,  pirates! Mad! Ich bin meshuge, you bandit! You go to Heller, did I ask you to  talk to him? You're out, aren't you? Did you beg, did you grovel to  that piece of shit, that cockroach? I didn't grovel, I asked him to  help. What did you pay him? Pay him? With what? With what could  I pay him? Every zloty I earn we  spend on food! I can look after myself! They were taking you away. It's nothing to do with you. It's  me they wanted, not you. Why do  you interfere in other people's  business? You're mad, that's your trouble,  you're mad. That's also my business. What's the matter? Are you sick? Hungry. What's that mean, no employment  certificate? You have to have an employment  certificate to work for one of the  German firms in the ghetto,  otherwise... Otherwise what? You'll be deported. So the rumours were true... They're going to resettle us. Send  us to labour camps. In the east.  And they're closing the small  ghetto. Wladek! I thought you'd be off on tour,  playing London, Paris, New York? Not this week. I have to say you look terrible.  What's the trouble? You've heard the rumours they're  going to resettle us in the East? Rumours, rumours, you take it all  too much to heart, Wladek. I've been trying to get a  certificate of employment for my  father. I've managed to get  certificates for me and the rest  of the family but I need one more  for my father. I've been trying  all the firms, the shops... Why didn't you come to me? I didn't know you were in the  certificate business. I'm not, but Majorek is. Can you help? I've no money... Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him? You see what a wonderful piece of  luck you've had today? That's die  historical imperative in action  and that's why I always say, look  on... ...the bright side, yes, I know. Thank you. My pleasure. It won't help you  anyway. At least we've got work in the  ghetto. At least we're still  together. Out! Assemble in the yard! We're employed here, we've got  certificates - The rest of you get dressed then  report back here. Bring your  belongings. Fifteen kilos only. I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought  the certificates would save us  all. You're going to work. You'll be  much better off than in this  stinking ghetto. The gates are Move! Let's sit over there. I'm telling you, it's a disgrace. I can hear you. We're letting them take us to our  death like sheep to the slaughter! Dr. Ehrlich, not so loud! Why don't we attack them? There's  half a million of us, we could  break out of the ghetto. At least  we could die honourably, not as a  stain on the face of history! Why you so sure they're sending us  to our death? I'm not sure. You know why I'm not  sure? Because they didn't tell me.  But I'm telling you they plan to  wipe us all out! Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me  to do? You want me to fight? To fight you need organisation,  plans, guns! He's right. What d'you think I can  do? Fight them with my violin bow? The Germans would never squander a  huge labour force like this. They're  sending us to a labour camp. Oh, sure. Look at that cripple,  look at those old people, the  children, they're going to work?  Look at Mr Szpilman here, he's  going to carry iron girders on his  back? Stupid, stupid! She smothered her baby. They'd prepared a hiding place and  so, of course, they went there.  But the baby cried just as the  police came. She smothered the  cries with her hands. The baby  died. A policeman heard the death  rattle. He found where they were  hiding. What are you reading? 'If you prick us, do we not bleed?  If you tickle us, do we not laugh?  If you poison us, do we not die?  And if you wrong us, shall we not  revenge?' Very appropriate. Yes, that's why I brought it. Idiot. What's he think he's going  to do with the money? How much for a caramel? Twenty zlotys. What? For one caramel? What d'you  think you're going to do with the  money? Twenty zlotys. Have we got twenty between us? Halina? Funny time to say this. wish I knew you better. Szpilman! Szpilman! Papa! Papa! Mama! Halina! What do you think you're doing,  Szpilman? I've saved your life!  Now, go on, save yourself! Don't run! Well, off they go for meltdown! Why are you here, Mr. Wladek? It's like this... I...we...all of  them. Perhaps they're lucky. The quicker  the better. It isn't over yet. We'll stay here  for a couple of days. Until things  die down. I've bribed a policeman. He'll  come when it's over. My God. I haven't been outside for -  it must be two years. Don't get over-excited. Can't be the first time you've  ever seen Jews. Someone you know? Yes. A beauty. Who is she? A singer. Her husband's an actor.  I knew them well. Good people. I'd  like to talk to her. Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they  hang them for helping Jews. Halt! Lie down! How long have you been here? If you need help... Hope you played the piano better  than you carry bricks. He won't last long if he goes on  like this. I'll see if I can get him something  better. Trouble. Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews!  Poles go on working! Only the Jews!  Poles go on working! I have important and good news for  you. There are rumours circulating  that resettlement measures are  again going to be taken. I want to assure you personally  that no such measures will be taken  now or in the future. Posters will  be going up also to this effect.  As proof of our good will, we want  you to select a delegate, who will  be permitted to go into town once  a day to buy, on each worker's  behalf, five kilos of potatoes and  one loaf of bread, which you will  be allowed to take back into the  ghetto. Now, why would we do that  j if we meant to resettle you? You can do good business on what  you don't eat. Isn't that what you  Jews are best at? Making 'geld'? Carry on. Majorek! Have a favour to ask. I want to  get out of here. I know. But last summer, I worked  for a day in Zelazna Brama Square.  I saw someone I knew. A singer.  Her husband's an actor. They're  old friends. ( I've written their names down. And  their address. If they're still  there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej  Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you  go into the town every day. Would  you try and make contact? Ask them  if they'd help me get out of here? Any fucking plaster? What were you up to? What the fuck are those? We're allowed to take food into  the ghetto. Five kilos of potatoes  and a... Open it. It's only potatoes and bread. Fuck that, you're lying, I can  smell it. Open it. You're all the same. Give a Jew a  little finger, he takes the whole  hand. You lie to me again and I'll shoot  you personally. You made contact? Oh, shit! No. Why? Hey, ranks unite  And follow the White Eagle!  Stand up and fight  Our mortal enemy. Riflemen, hey! Let's give them fire and brimstone. We'll blow away  The yoke of slavery. Punish and rout  The rapists of our nation. We'll smash the knout  To save our dignity. Soon we'll be proud Of our liberation - Get on with it and fall in! Fall  in! Thank you, I don't. I'll be fine. Yes, but sometimes I'm still not  sure which side of the wall I'm  on. Puppydog, what d'you mean, you  forgot? What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I  forgot, that's what I mean. You know what? You treat me like  dirt! I treat you like dirt because you  are dirt. Pig! Cow! Pig! Bitch! Dirty pig! You're a dirty pig! Takes one to know one! Pig! You play like an angel, Kitten. If I play like an angel, why don't  you listen? I was listening, Kitten. Liar, you fell asleep. Pig! Kitten, let me in. Thank you. should never have come out. I  should've stayed there, fought  with them. Yes, so did the Germans. Yes, but what good did it do? What's happened? What's happened? Where do you want me to go?  Look  at me. No, no, I'm not leaving.  Can't I take my chances here? It belongs to a friend of mine. I  came to visit but I must have just  missed him. Mr Gebczynski sent me. Dorota. I'm sorry - I was given this  address. I'm looking for a Mr-- -- a Mr Dzikiewicz. I need help. I've been in hiding. I need  somewhere to stay. How long have you been married? And how's Yurek? When's your baby due? Oh, yes. I remember. Mr Gebczynski said to contact you  only in an emergency, but... Don't worry now. We can't move you  tonight. You'll sleep on the sofa. Excuse me, could I have a piece of  bread? Yes, of course, we'll eat. You're in a very German area. The  building opposite is a hospital,  taking in wounded from the Russian  front. Next door is the  Schutzpolizei. It's the safest  place to be. Right in the centre  of the lion's den. I'll be locking you in. No one  knows you're here. So keep as quiet  as possible. All well? Thank you. This is Antek Szalas. He's going to look after you. I've  given him a second key. He'll bring  you food. See that you're all right.  He's with the underground, a good  man. You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman? No, I don't think so? Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.  I saw you almost every day. Sorry, I don't remember. Doesn't matter. You've nothing to  worry about. I'll visit often. And you'll be pleased to hear the  Allies are bombing Germany night  after night - Cologne, Hamburg,  Berlin. And the Russians are really giving  them hell. It's the beginning of  the end. Let's hope so. I don't know when  I'll see you again? Still alive then, are you? Here.  Sausage. Bread. How long is this meant to last? think I've got jaundice. You don't want to worry about that.  My grandfather was jilted by his  girl friend when he got jaundice. In my opinion, jaundice is not  very serious. Drink up. Why didn't you come sooner? It's  been over two weeks. Problems. Money. I've got to raise  money to buy the food. I need things  to sell, it' s not easy. Sell this. Food's more important  than time. Oh, yes. I meant to tell you. The  Allies have landed in France. The  Russians'll be here soon. They'll  beat the shit out of the Germans.  Any day now. You can't, it's too dangerous. Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's  a pediatrician. No, you stay, I'll go. Acute inflammation of the gall  bladder. Liver the size of a  football. But he'll live. I'll try  to get hold of some levulose, but  it's not easy. Who knows? Doctor, thank you. Don't speak. Rest. Where? Where? Just get out!  Everywhere! Get out into the street! Get out now! The Germans have  surrounded the building! They're  going to blow us to pieces. Everyone out, please! Leave your  flats at once, please! Fourth floor, Fischke! At the double, Fischke! Who the hell are you? Who are you? What the hell are you doing? I was... I was trying to open this  tin. Where do you live? What's your work? I am... I was a pianist. A pianist. Play. Are you hiding here? Jew? Where are you hiding? In the attic. Show me. Have you anything to eat? I'll bring you something. Open up. Please. What's all that gunfire? The Russians. On the other side of  the river. All you have to do is hang on for  a few more weeks. Come down. What's happening? We're getting out. Are the Russians here? Not yet. I don't know how to thank you. Don't thank me. Thank God. It's  His will that we should survive.  Well. That's what we have to  believe. What about you? I've got another one.  Warmer. What will you do when it's all  over? I'll play the piano again. On Polish  radio. Tell me your name. I'll listen out  for you. Szpilman. Szpilman. Good name for a pianist. ...German army! Polish soil  liberated!  Official! Stop, for God's sake, I beg you,  I'm Polish! Don't shoot! I'm Polish! He's Polish! Come out with your hands up. Don't shoot! I'm Polish! Please,  please! I'm Polish! Yes, he's Polish! Why the fucking coat? I'm cold. Take him to headquarters. Look at them - bastards! German fuckers! I prayed for this, never thought  I'd see it. Do you happen to know another  musician, a Mr Szpilman? A pianist!  Polish radio? I helped Mr Szpilman when he was  in hiding. Tell him I'm here. Ask  him to help me... Hey! No talking to the prisoners.  Get away from there! It's not here now. You didn't catch his name.
