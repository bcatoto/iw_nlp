Daddy. No dad! Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it. A hair. There's dust in it. She doesn't answer me either. Does she ever answer back? Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself? Only for pee or poop. It tastes old. I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water? Houdini's sick. Me too. I don't want you to die. The same windows. My ballet recital. I heard them Morgan. It tastes funny. I think it's contaminated.Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A? You got two minor league home run records don't you? It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear... I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.Don't touch him. See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed. I'm letting go now. This one? This one? No. It makes me feel better. What are you thinking about? Right. What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night? What's wrong with the water next to your bed? What's the matter? Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight. What? Colleen?... Colleen? I'm here. ...I will. ...I will. Good. Does it hurt? You love walks. Hi baby. Don't. Don't touch him. Me too. He's not strong enough to fight off another attack. Have they said anything about our area? No. How do they know it's over? How many died? They're broadcasting... It's getting stronger. I can feel air. They're distracting us? Merrill! Merrill -- I'm sorry I hurt your arm. He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it. He was only a year and half old. They're right behind the door. Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm? We have to go in the basement. While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you. They already know we're here. Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon. Extra bacon. Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade? Ray Reddy's house. The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell. What time is it? What's furry, furry rabbit? What does it matter then? Do you feel comforted? That wasn't the answer you wanted? Yes. Morgan, be careful. It's probably picking up another baby monitor. It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this. Let's get out of the car okay? I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood? He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high. Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves? Yes, it was. Yes it was. I cursed. No I'm not. Explain noises. It doesn't sound natural when I curse. I'm not going to curse. Explain, act crazy? This is not an intelligent way to approach this. Yeah baby. I think someone did. I can't even imagine. You're scaring your sister. Stop crying! Now we're talking. How about you Merrill? We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner. The family room. We'll have to board up the bedroom doors. What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something? What's two? Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile? I just asked his name. Bimboo? That means they're unemployed. Who wrote this book? Oh. Morgan? I'm getting out now. We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this. It's old Morgan. I have some upstairs. Edgar, come inside. Yes. What did you say? Pinned? What does that mean? Why not? Is he okay? There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure. It's good advice... Say hi to Marcia for me. And three weeks. Six months. No. No. I don't think so. Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement. But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar. I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious. I would say so. He definitely wasn't a midget. It does seem kind of odd doesn't it? Sounds like a virus. What was the first thing? It's not broken. What about them? You said something was strange. What's strange? Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now. Don't call me Father.Five. The five longest. I got the bat at home... On the wall. Clear for what? I see. You do? Graham. Graham. That's good enough for me. I know. We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham. Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure? He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine. Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother -- -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night. I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious. A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now. They're leaving. Beat. They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong. It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up. We won Graham. I'm close. Me too. From what? Got it! I'm looking! We won't be able to get out of there. What are you doing? Should we make a run for it out the back? This is going to do nothing. They're on the roof. Should we turn off the lights? Chicken Teriyaki. I'm sorry, what book is this? Where are you going? Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something. They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky. They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion. Eleven a.m. They're gone. That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments. For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right? Yes. Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort? How can you say that? Do you think it's a possibility? I got him. That's right. It's noise. Pharmacy crowded? That roof is over ten feet high. This guy got on the roof in like a second. It was very dark. It was very dark. I heard. You want him coming in the house next time? Are you going to do this or what? Just make noises then. You don't mean it. It's just for show. Curse and stuff. Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'! What book! Don't worry. It's like War of the Worlds. You'll lose the signal! Yeah.I'm scared. Who said I was going to die? That's weird. Dad! Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there... For your children Bo. Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill? He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind. It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl. You don't even know what that word means. Did someone save me? I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets. They'll read our minds! Don't yell at her! French toast... and mashed potatoes. What about Isabelle? Where are we going to sleep? Sounds made up. They win. They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later. Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them. Dad. Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book -- Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs. It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet. They tell you everything in this book. So the aliens can't read our minds. It gets clearer, the higher you hold it. Don't do it. We might lose the signal. It's still making the noises. It's broken. These are D's; I need double A's. It needs batteries. Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie? They'll find a way in. The book says they're probably very good problem solvers. Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world. Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill? They think it might happen all at once. They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver. Don't do it! Is that him?
