You cannot pass! Gandalf! I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder  of the Flame of Anor! Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark  Fire will not avail you, Flame of Ud�n!  [Camera zooms in through the mountain  and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog  on the bridge of Khazad-d�m. The Balrog  strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming  sword. Gandalf parries the blow with  Glamdring, shattering the Balrog�s sword.] Argh! [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains  him.] No! No! Gandalf! Fly, you fools! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into  the chasm] Noooooooooooooooo!!!! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into  the chasm] [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into  the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!! Gandalf! What is it, Mr. Frodo? Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.] Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth  we don�t want to see any closer, and  the one place we�re trying to get to.  It�s just where we can�t get. Let�s  face it, Mr. Frodo, we�re lost. I don�t  think Gandalf meant for us to come this  way. He didn�t mean for a lot of things to  happen, Sam... but they did. Mr. Frodo? It�s the Ring, isn�t it? It�s getting heavier. [Clutches the  Ring by his chest and sits down, still  panting. He then fumbles for his water  bottle and takes a sip.] What food have we got left? Well, let me see. [He takes out a package  of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes,  lovely � Lembas bread. And look! [He  digs deeper into his pack] More lembas  bread. I don't usually hold with foreign food,  but this Elvish stuff, it�s not bad. [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits,  does it Sam? Those rain clouds might. [They continue trekking through difficult  terrain, often huddling underneath their  cloaks.] [Looks around] This looks strangely  familiar. [Exasperated] It�s because we�ve been  here before! We�re going in circles. Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant  there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you  smell it? Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper]  We�re not alone. The thieves! The thieves! The filthy  little thieves! Where is it? Where isss  it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.  [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse  them! We hates them! It�s ours, it is...  and we wantssss it! [menacingly] This is Sting. You�ve seen  it before, haven�t you... Gollum! Release  him or I�ll cut your throat! It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty  Elves twisted it. Take it off us! Quiet you! [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum  cries some more and collapses onto his  back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.] It�s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor�s  going to hear this racket! Let�s just  tie him up and leave him. No! That would kill us! Kill us! It�s no more than you deserve! Maybe he does deserve to die, but now  that I see him, I do pity him. [Begging] We be nice to them if they  be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears  to do what you wants. We swears. There�s no promise you can make that  I can trust. We swears to serve the master of the  preciousss. We swears on... on the precious.  *Gollum. Gollum.* The Ring is treacherous. It will hold  you to your word. Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss. I don�t believe you! [Gollum backs away,  frightened, and climbs onto a boulder]  Get down! I said, down! Sam! He�s trying to trick us! We let him  go he�ll throttle us in our sleep! You know the way to Mordor? [nods warily] Yes... You�ve been there before? [nods again] Yes... [Frodo reaches out and takes the rope  noose off Gollum�s neck. Gollum seems  surprised and relieved.] You will lead us to the Black Gate. Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.] [sniffs the air] Man-flesh. [quietly to himself] Aragorn! Their pace has quickened. [He looks  up.] They must have caught our scent.  Hurry! [He runs off.] Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli  and then runs after Aragorn] [pauses in his steps and huffs] Three  days� and nights� pursuit. No food.  No rest. And no sign of our quarry but  what bare rock can tell. [Runs after  his companions.] Not idly do the leaves of L�rien fall. [stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may  yet be alive. Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs  off again] Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them! [Panting] I am wasted on cross-country!  We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very  dangerous over short distances! Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There  is something strange at work here. Some  evil gives speed to these creatures,  sets its will against us. Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see? The Uruks turn northeast. They�re taking  the hobbits to Isengard! Saruman. [The tower of Orthanc stands amidst  the smoking caverns of Isengard. Saruman  stands in his chamber, communicating  with the Dark Lord through the Palant�r.] The world is changing. [View changes  to the tower of Barad-d�r, with its  huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now  has the strength to stand against the  armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand  against the might of Sauron and Saruman  and the union of the two towers? Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule  this Middle-earth. The old world will burn in the fires  of industry. The forests will fall.  A new order will rise. We will drive  the machine of war with the sword and  the spear and the iron fists of the  Orc. We have only to remove those who  oppose us. The horsemen took your land. They drove  your people into the hills to scratch  a living off rocks. Murderers! Take back the lands they stole from  you! Burn every village! [Roars with approval] Argh!! [They stomp off to destroy the villages  of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still  among the stampede. A Rohan village  is in pandemonium as people try to escape  the on-coming pillage.] It will begin in Rohan. Too long have  these peasants stood against you. But  no more. Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall. [A group of horsemen ride to Edoras.  �omer is in the lead, carrying a gravely  wounded Th�odred.] Keep breathing! That�s the key! Breathe!  Ho! They�ve run as if the very whips of  their masters were behind them. We�re not going no further till we�ve  had a breather! Merry! Merry! What�s making that noise? What? Alive? Carve them up! ARGH!!! [Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises.  Blood has been spilled this night. Riders of Rohan, what news from the  Mark? Give me your name, Horsemaster, and  I shall give you mine. You would die before your stroke fell! I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This  is Gimli, son of Gl�in and Legolas of  the Woodland realm. We are friends of  Rohan and of Th�oden, your king. We are not spies. We track a party of  Uruk-hai westward across the plain.  They�ve taken two of our friends captive. But there were two hobbits. Did you  see two hobbits with them? They would be small � only children  to your eyes. Dead? It�s one of their wee belts. [with his head bowed and eyes closed]  Hiro �th� ab 'wanath... (May they find  peace in death) [Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!!  [He falls to his knees.] We failed them. [Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks  catch his attention.] A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback:  Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair  of thrashing hooves bearing down on  him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.]  They crawled. Merry and Pippin crawl frantically away  from the battle.] Their hands were bound. [Flashback:  Merry rubs his bonds furiously against  the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds  were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken  length of thick rope.] They ran over here. They were followed. The tracks lead away from the battle...  [They break into a run and then stop]  into Fangorn Forest. Fangorn. What madness drove them in  there? Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think  we lost him. Merry! [Pippin looks down in horror but as  he turns his head, he spots a pair of  gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the  tree he�s clinging to. The tree starts  to move and groan.] Argh!! [Pippin loses his grip in fright and  grabs at the air futilely as he falls.  The tree catches him before he hits  the ground.] Run, Merry! [Merry tries to run away but is scooped  by the tree.] It�s talking, Merry. The tree is talking! Don�t talk to it, Merry. Don�t encourage  it. And whose side are you on? The White Wizard? See, see, we have led you out! Hurry  hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find  you. Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting  a wide berth between him and Sam.] Whoa, it�s a bog! He�s led us into a  swamp! A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We  will take you on safe paths through  the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go  quickly. I found it, I did. The way through the  marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't  know it. They go round for miles and  miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick  as shadows we must be. There are dead things! Dead faces in  the water! All dead. All rotten. Elves and men  and orcses. A great battle long ago.  [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead  Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name.  This way. Don�t follow the lights. Ohh! Careful now, or hobbits go down to join  the dead ones and light little candles  of their own. Frodo! [Frodo is in the water and sees many  faces of the dead, no longer still but  screaming and grasping, their rotten  robes and hair flowing about their gruesome  faces. Their hands are reaching for  him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind.  Frodo sputters and gasps for air as  Gollum pulls him out of the water.] [Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude  and disbelief.] Gollum... Don�t follow the lights! [Crawls away] [Runs to Frodo�s side.] Mr. Frodo! Are  you alright? Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo  quickly puts the Ring back inside his  shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching  away from him, stroking the centre of  his palm] our preciousss... What did you say? Master should be resting. Master needs  to keep up his strength. [Moves over and crouches in front of  Gollum] Who are you? Mustn�t ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,  Gollum* Gandalf told me you were one of the  River Folk. Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold  be travellers far from home. He said your life was a sad story. They do not see what lies ahead, when  sun has failed and moon is dead. You were not so very different from  a hobbit once, were you... Sm�agol? [Looks up slowly.] What did you call  me? That was your name once, wasn�t it?  A long time ago. My name... My name... S... S...Sm�agol� Argh!! Black Riders! Hide! Hide! Argh! [Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the  Nazg�l's sword piercing him and the  call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths  come to him in flashes.] Argh!! C�mon Frodo! C'mon! [Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring  on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags  Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble  bushes. The Nazg�l appears, tightening  his hold on the reins. Camera then shows  him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down  across the marsh lands. Chilling screams  of the Nazg�l fill the air.] Quick! They will see us! They will see  us! I thought they were dead! Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No. [cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!  They are calling for it. They are calling  for the preciousss. Mr. Frodo! It�s alright. I�m here. Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very  close. [Spits] Ptui! Orc blood. These are strange tracks. The air is so close in here. This forest is old. Very old. Full of  memory... and anger. The trees are speaking to each other. [Whispers] Gimli! Huh? [Gestures] Lower your axe. [Lowering his axe slowly] Oh. Aragorn, nad n� ennas! (Something is  out there.) Man cenich? (What do you see?) [Close-up of Legolas� eyes] The White Wizard approaches. Do not let him speak. He will put a  spell on us. We must be quick. [With a yell, the three swing round  to attack. Gimli�s axe and Legolas�  arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his  sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp.  They shield their eyes with their hands  from the bright light emanating from  the White Wizard.] You are tracking the footsteps of two  young hobbits. Where are they? They passed this way the day before  yesterday. They met someone they did  not expect. Does that comfort you? Who are you? Show yourself! [The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf,  all dressed in white. The three are  astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.] It cannot be. You fell. Through fire and water. [Flashback:  Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop  D�rin�s Tower.] From the lowest dungeon  to the highest peak, I fought with the  Balrog of Morgoth. Until at last, I threw down my enemy  and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. Darkness took me. And I strayed out  of thought and time. [Camera zooms in  Gandalf�s eye and enters an amorphous  realm of stars and galaxies, ending  in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled  overhead and everyday was as long as  a life-age of the earth. But it was  not the end. I felt life in me again. I've been sent back until my task is  done. Gandalf! Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used  to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was  my name. [He smiles] Gandalf! [With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf  the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come  back to you now at the turn of the tide. One stage of your journey is over, another  begins. War has come to Rohan. We must  ride to Edoras with all speed. That is one of the Mearas, unless my  eyes are cheated by some spell. Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.]  He's the lord of all horses and he's  been my friend through many dangers. The Black Gate of Mordor. [The enormous Black Gate comes into  view with Orcs patrolling and standing  guard on the towers and atop the walls.  From the right, an army of Easterling  soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.] Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing  or two to say if he could see us now. Master says to show him the way into  Mordor, so good Sm�agol does. Master  says so. I did. [Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.] That�s it then. We cannot get past that. Look! The gate, it's opening! I can  see a way down. Sam, no! Argh!! [Frodo goes after Sam.] Master! [Two Easterling soldiers see streams  of dust coming down the cliff made by  Sam and Frodo. They move away from the  troop to investigate. Frodo reaches  Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the  Easterlings move closer and closer,  Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself  and Sam. The soldiers are now directly  in front of Sam, but their eyes see  nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer  from underneath the cloak. The soldiers  soon leave and after a moment, Frodo  throws back the cloak and pulls Sam  out.] I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these  Elvish cloaks will hide us in there. Now! [Gollum pulls them back.] No! No, no master! They catch you! They  catch you! Don�t take it to him! He  wants the preciousss. Always he�s looking  for it! And the preciousss is wanting  to go back to him. But we mustn�t let  him have it. No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] There�s  another way. More secret. A dark way. Why haven�t you spoken of this before?! Because Master did not ask! He�s up to something. Are you saying there�s another way into  Mordor? Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,  and then� a tunnel. closes. Gollum is stroking Frodo�s arm  and burying his face in his cloak.] He�s led us this far, Sam. Mr. Frodo, no. He�s been true to his word. [Whispers] No! Lead the way, Sm�agol. Good Sm�agol always helps. [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares  after him in disbelief.] Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.  There dwells Th�oden, King of Rohan,  whose mind is overthrown. Saruman�s  hold over King Th�oden is now very strong. Be careful what you say. Do not look  for welcome here. You�ll find more cheer in a graveyard. [sees H�ma] Ah. Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You  would not part an old man from his walking  stick? [Looks at H�ma innocently.] The courtesy of your hall is somewhat  lessened of late, Th�oden King. Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind  you teeth. I have not passed through  fire and death to bandy crooked words  with a witless worm! [Raises his staff  against Gr�ma.] Th�oden, son of Thengel, too long have  you sat in the shadows. [Growls] I would stay still, if I were  you. Hearken to me! I release you from the  spell. [Gestures with his hand] [Points his staff towards Th�oden.]  I will draw you, Saruman, as poison  is drawn from a wound. Wait. You did not kill me, you will not kill  him! Be gone!! [Gandalf smites Th�oden as he lunges  at him. Th�oden is thrown back into  the chair and the shot changes to Saruman  flying backwards from the Palant�r which  he used to manipulate Th�oden. He lands  landing hard on the floor of Orthanc,  bleeding from a gash in his forehead.  In the hall, Th�oden lets out a moan  and slumps forward in the chair. �owyn  runs to her uncle�s side as he falls.  Th�oden�s head rises again and his face  begins to change gradually into that  of a much younger-looking man. Clarity  and recognition returns to his eyes.] Breathe the free air again, my friend. Your fingers would remember their old  strength better... if they grasped your  sword. No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.  Enough blood has been spilled on his  account. Th�odred�s death was not of your making. He was strong in life. His spirit will  find its way to the halls of your fathers.  Westu h�l. Fer�u, Th�odred, Fer�u. (Be-thou  well. Go-thou, Th�odred, go-thou.) This is but a taste of the terror that  Saruman will unleash. All the more potent  for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.  Ride out and meet him head on. Draw  him away from your women and children.  [Leans forward and puts a hand on Th�oden�s  chair. Th�oden looks at his hand warily.]  You must fight. You have two thousand good men riding  north as we speak. �omer is loyal to  you. His men will return and fight for  their king. Open war is upon you. Whether you would  risk it or not. Then what is the king�s decision? [Scene shifts to outside Meduseld] Helm�s Deep! They flee to the mountains  when they should stand and fight. Who  will defend them if not their king. He�s only doing what he thinks is best  for his people. Helm�s Deep has saved  them in the past. There is no way out of that ravine.  Th�oden is walking into a trap. He thinks  he�s leading them to safety. What they  will get is a massacre. Th�oden has  a strong will but I fear for him. I  fear for the survival of Rohan. He will  need you before the end, Aragorn. The  people of Rohan will need you. The defences  HAVE to hold. They will hold. [Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him]  The Grey Pilgrim... that�s what they  used to call me. Three hundred lives  of men I�ve walked this earth and now  I have no time. With luck, my search  will not be in vain. Look to my coming  at first light on the fifth day. At  dawn, look to the East. [Opens the stall gates] Go. [Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides  out of the stable and over the plains  of Rohan.] You have some skill with a blade. [With a swift move, �owyn swings her  sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable,  gaining the upper hand.] What do you fear, my lady? You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden  of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I  do not think that would be your fate. Send out your warg riders. [The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him,  ferocious growls are heard and shadows  dances.] Hey Stinker! Don�t go getting too far  ahead! Why do you do that? What? Call him names; run him down all the  time. Because� because that's what he is,  Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im  but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he  wants. It's all he cares about. [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what  it did to him. What it�s still doing  to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.]  I want to help him, Sam... Why? Because I have to believe he can come  back. You can�t save him, Mr. Frodo. [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about  it? Nothing! [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't  know why I said that. [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his  eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't  take your eyes off it. I've seen you.  You're not eating. You barely sleep.  It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.  You have to fight it! [Grows angry again] I know what I have  to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to  me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He  walks away] Can�t you hear yourself? Don�t you know  who you sound like? We wants it. We needs it. Must have  the precioussss. They stole it from  us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,  trickssssy, falssse! Yes, precious. False. They will cheat  you, hurt you, lie. [Tauntingly] You don�t have any friends.  Nobody likes YOU... You�re a liar and a thief. Mur�derer�! Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!! [Fiercely] Where would you be without  me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It  was me. We survived because of me! [Startled] What did you say? What? No!! [Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!! You�ll make him sick, you will, behaving  like that! [Holding up the two rabbits]  There�s only one way to eat a brace  of coneys. What�s to ruin? There�s hardly any meat  on �em. What we need is a few good taters. What�s taters, preciousss? What�s taters  uh? PO-TAY-TOES! Boil �em. Mash �em. Stick  �em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips  with a nice piece of fried fish.... Even you couldn�t say no to that. [He  takes a sip of the stew] You�re hopeless. [Frodo follows the source of the sound.  Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is no  longer in his sight.] Mr. Frodo? [He goes in search of Frodo and finds  him lying down near some bushes looking  at a Haradrim army marching across the  land. He moves to lie low beside Frodo.  Sm�agol also moves in beside Frodo.] Who are they? Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They  are called to Mordor. The Dark One is  gathering all armies to him. It won�t  be long now. He will soon be ready. Ready to do what? To make his war. The last war that will  cover all the world in shadow. We�ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam. [Suddenly grabs Frodo�s arm] Mr Frodo!  Look! It�s an Oliphaunt! No one at home will believe this... [Looking around] Sm�agol? [Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out from  below; the soldiers are being ambushed.  Cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrows  at the soldiers and Oliphaunts from  behind bushes. One of the Oliphaunts  starts trumpeting and stomping towards  Frodo and Sam, swinging his huge trunk  and tusks. Faramir takes aim and shoots  a soldier. He falls from the Oliphaunt  and lands right behind Frodo and Sam,  dead.] We�ve lingered here too long. Come on,  Sam! Ah! [He charges at Faramir but is grabbed  by another ranger and thrown down. A  sword appears at his throat. Faramir  appears.] Bind their hands. [Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are  heading towards Helm�s Deep. Gimli is  on a horse, chatting with �owyn who  is leading it by the reins.] It�s true you don�t see many Dwarf women.  And in fact, they are so alike in voice  and appearance, haha that they�re often  mistaken for Dwarf men. [Gestures and whispers] It�s the beards.... And this, in turn, has given rise to  the belief that there are no Dwarf women.  And that dwarves just spring out of  holes in the ground! Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous�  Whoa!! [Struggling to get up] It�s alright,  it�s alright. Nobody panic. That was  deliberate. It was deliberate. I am asleep. This is a dream. Min l� pennich nin i aur hen telitha.  (You told me once that this day would  come.) [Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i v�d o  nin. (My path is hidden from me.) Arwen� [Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers  on his lips. As her hands moves down  to rest on the Evenstar pendant around  Aragorn�s neck, he clasps her hand in  his and they gaze into each other�s  eyes.] Elrond is speaking to Aragorn in Rivendell,  before he sets out with the Fellowship.] Our time here is ending. Arwen�s time  is ending. Let her go. Let her take  the ship into the west. Let her bear  away her love for you to the Undying  Lands. There it will be evergreen. But never more than a memory. I will not leave my daughter here to  die. She stays because she still has hope. She stays for YOU! She belongs with  her people! Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o  auth a n�r a naeth. (You have a chance  for another life. Away from war... grief...  despair.) I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was  a dream, Arwen, nothing more. This belongs to you. She is sailing to the Undying Lands,  with all that is left of her kin. What is it? H�ma? [Their horses become restless.] Wargs! [Just as it starts to turn on Gamling,  Legolas runs over and kills the warg  with an arrow. He then draws his knife  and kills the Orc.] Argh! [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout! [Running back to Th�oden] Wargs! We  are under attack! Get them out of here! [Trying to mount Arod] Come on, get  me up here, I�m a rider! Argh! [Tries to get Arod to move] Forward.  I mean, charge forward! March forward!  [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather  unsteadily.] That�s it! Go on! Bring your pretty face to my axe! [Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas  kills it with one shot.] [Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged]  Argh! That one counts as mine! Argh! Stinking creature. Argh! [As he tries to lift the warg off him,  an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills  him quickly, twisting his neck, and  it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at  the Orc and makes a face. He tries to  lift both the warg and Orc off him.  Just then, another warg comes upon him  and bares its teeth, ready to strike. [Eyes widening] Ooh..! [Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes  on horseback and throws it at the warg.  It dies, landing on Gimli and adding  to the pile on top of him.] [As the warg lands on him] Oooh!! [Th�oden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn  is knocked off Hasufel and attacked  by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the  warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt  and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while  the latter is half-dragged by the warg.  In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off  and he rips the Evenstar pendant from  Aragorn�s neck as he falls. Aragorn  tries to let go of the warg but finds  his wrist tangled with the saddle straps.  He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle  himself and is dragged closer and closer  to the edge of a cliff at great speed.  The warg runs right off the cliff and  they both disappear over the edge. The  battle is winding down as the Rohirrim  finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.] [Looking around] Aragorn! Aragorn? [They come near to the cliff and hear  Sharku wheezing and laughing] [Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me  what happened and I will ease your passing. He�s [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took  a little tumble off the cliff. [Looks towards the edge of the cliff,  and grabs Sharku] You lie! Make way for Th�oden! Sire! Make way for the king! [�owyn rushes down to meet them] [Going up to �owyn] My lady... He fell... [�owyn is shaken and raises teary eyes  to Th�oden. The latter looks down and  then walks away, confirming her unasked  question.] What of those who cannot fight, my lord?  The women and children? If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep  will fall. Tens of thousands. A new power is rising. Its victory is  at hand! This night, the land will be stained  with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms  Deep! Leave none alive! To war!! [The army cheers and roars even louder.] [Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men. Look! There�s smoke to the south! What is it? [Mumbles] Brego� [He grabs hold of Brego�s  mane, pulls himself onto the horse and  rides slowly to Helms Deep.] [Coming into her room] Arwen. [Arwen hears him and sits up.] Tollen i l�. I chair gwannar na Valannor.  Si bado, no c�rar. (Arwen, it is time.  The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go  now... before it is too late.) He is not coming back. Why do you linger  here when there is no hope? [Walks towards window and looks out]  If Aragorn survives this war, you will  still be parted. If Sauron is defeated,  and Aragorn made king and all that you  hope for comes true, you will still  have to taste the bitterness of mortality.  Whether by the sword or the slow decay  of time, Aragorn will die. And there will be no comfort for you.  No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.  He will come to death, an image of the  splendor of the kings of men in glory  undimmed before the breaking of the  world. But you, my daughter, you will linger  on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall  in winter that comes without a star.  Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,  under the fading trees, until all the  world is changed and the long years  of your life are utterly spent. [Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there is  nothing for you here, only death. A im, �-'erin veleth l�n? (Do I not  also have your love?) What news? Our scouts report Saruman has attacked  Rohan. Th�oden�s people have fled to  Helm�s Deep. [Points at the map] But  we must look to our own borders. Faramir,  Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling  an army. Easterlings and Southrons are  passing through the Black Gate. How many? Some thousands. More come every day. Who�s covering the river to the north? We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but  if the city is attacked, we won�t hold  it. [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks  from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The  fight will come to men on both fronts.  Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us  soon. And he will strike hard. He knows  now we do not have the strength to repel  him. My men tell me that you are Orc spies. Spies?! Now wait just a minute! Well if you�re not spies, then who are  you? Speak. We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins  is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee. Your bodyguard? His gardener. And where is your skulking friend? That  gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured  look. [The merest hesitation.] There was no  other. We set out from Rivendell with seven  companions. One we lost in M�ria. Two  were my kin. A Dwarf there was also,  and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son  of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor. [Intently] You�re a friend of Boromir? Yes... for my part. It will grieve you then to learn that  he is dead. [Shocked] Dead? How? When? As one of his companions, I�d hoped  you would tell me. [Pause] He was my  brother. Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found  the third one. You must come with me. Now. [Frodo gets up and follow. They come  to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking  the Forbidden Pool.] [Pointing down] Down there. [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving  into the water.] To enter the forbidden pool bears the  penalty of death. [He gestures to archers  hidden in the bushes.] They wait for  my command. Shall I shoot? [Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges  from the pool onto a rock. He holds  a fish in his hand and starts singing,  slapping the fish on the rock as he  goes.] [singing] The rock and pool is nice  and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish  [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch  a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The  fish almost wriggles out of his grasp  and he whacks it some more.] Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature  is bound to me. And I to him. He is  our guide. Please, let me go down to  him. Sm�agol. [Gollum turns round at Frodo�s  voice.] Master is here. Come, Sm�agol.  Trust master. Come! We must go now? Sm�agol, you must trust master. Follow  me, come on. Come. Come, Sm�agol. Nice  Sm�agol. That�s it. Come on. Don�t hurt him! Sm�agol don�t struggle!  Sm�agol listen to me! [wails] Master!! [A black cloth is brought over Gollum's  head. Frodo stares after them with a  stricken expression as Faramir leads  Gollum and his men away. Back in the  cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground.  Crying, he crawls into a corner and  curls up into ball.] No! No! Where are you leading them? Answer me! [Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder]  Sm�a�gol... Why does it cry, Sm�agol? Of course he did. I told you he was  tricksy. I told you he was false. Master betrayed us. [Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy  little hobbitses. They stole it from  us. What did they steal? [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression]  Myyy� PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth  and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!! We have to get out of here. You go.  Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,  Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.  Disappear. I can�t. You were right, Sam. You tried  to tell me, but� I�m sorry. The Ring�s  taking me Sam. If I put it on, he�ll  find me. He�ll see. Mr. Frodo... [They both stand as Faramir enters.] [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is  the answer to all the riddles. Here  in the wild I have you. Two halflings  and a host of men at my call. The Ring  of power within my grasp. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,  to show his quality. No!! [He runs away from Faramir] Stop it! Leave him alone! Don�t you  understand? He�s got to destroy it.  That�s where we�re going. Into Mordor.  To the mountain of fire. Osgiliath is under attack. They call  for reinforcements. Please. It�s such a burden. Will you  not help him? Captain? Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to  Gondor. [He turns to leave.] [Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen,  Brego, mellon n�n. (Well done, Brego,  my friend) [Pushing his way through the crowd.]  Where is he? Where is he? Get out of  the way. I�m gonna kill him! [He sees  Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the  canniest and the most reckless man I  ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless  you, laddie! Gimli, where is the king? [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn  makes his way in, he runs into Legolas  who stands waiting.] Le ab-dollen. (You�re late.) [They smile.  Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorn�s  wounds.] You look terrible. Hannon le. (Thank you.) [�owyn looks on and smiles even as tears  fill her eyes.] All Isengard is emptied Ten thousand strong at least. It is an army bred for a single purpose:  to destroy the world of men. They will  be here by nightfall. This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.  These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick  and their shields broad. They do not come to destroy Rohan�s  crops or villages. They come to destroy  its people. Down to the last child. Send out riders, my lord. You must call  for aid. Gondor will answer. We need more time to lay provisions  for a siege, lord � [to the soldiers] Secure the gate! Move back! Move to the caves! Keep moving! Quickly now! [Old men and young lads are being drafted  for war. The women and children say  their tearful and reluctant farewells  as their fathers, husbands and sons  are led away by soldiers. In the armoury,  weapons are being distributed. Aragorn  picks up a battered sword, looks at  it and tosses it back.] Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These  are no soldiers. Most have seen too many winters. Or too few. Look at them. They�re frightened.  I can see it in their eyes. [The men  around them fell silent. Legolas speaks  to Aragorn.] Boe a h�n: neled herain  dan caer menig! (And they should be...  Three hundred against ten thousand!) Si beriathar h�n. Amar n� ned Edoras.  (They have more hope of defending themselves  here than at Edoras.) Aragorn, men i ndagor. H�n �-... ortheri.  Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors.  They cannot win this fight. They are  all going to die!) Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses  and then walks away. Legolas makes as  if to go after him.] [Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go,  lad. Let him be. Every villager able to wield a sword  has been sent to the armory. My lord? You are our king, sire. [Puts armour onto Th�oden] Your men,  my lord, will follow you to whatever  end. Give me your sword. What is your name? This is a good sword, Haleth, son of  H�ma. There is always hope. [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his  battle gear. His sword is handed to  him as he reaches for it. He nods and  accepts the sword from Legolas.] We have trusted you this far. You have  not led us astray. Forgive me. I was  wrong to despair. �-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing  to forgive, Legolas.) If we had more time I�d get this adjusted.  [He drops the bundle and the chain mail  lands with its length right to the floor.]  It�s a little tight across the chest. That is no Orc horn. [They run out to  the battlements.] [to another guard] Send for the king.  Open the gate! Open the gate! [An army of Lothl�rien Elves march up  the Causeway into the Hornburg. They  are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers  look upon them in wonderment and delight  as they pass.] I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.  An alliance once existed between Elves  and men. Long ago we fought and died  together. [He looks up to see Aragorn,  Legolas and Gimli running down the steps,  and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance. [He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome,  Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace.  Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back  lightly.] You are most welcome! [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other  on the shoulder.] [Turning to Th�oden] We are proud to  fight alongside men, once more. [Grumbling and straining to look above  the wall.] You could have picked a better  spot. Well lad, whatever luck you live by,  let�s hope it lasts the night. Your friends are with you, Aragorn. Let�s hope they last the night. [The marching and thumping grows louder  and louder. Lightning flashes and it  begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army  continues to march at the fortress,  an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.] A Eruch�n, �-dano i faelas a hyn an  uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no  mercy! For you shall receive none!) [Jumping and straining to see] What�s  happening out there? Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at  Gimli with a grin] Or would you like  me to find you a box? [Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!! Dartho! (Hold!) [The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring  and thumping. With a hollow groan, the  Uruk that was shot collapsed to the  ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their  teeth and roar with anger. With a cry,  the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon  in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts  charging.] Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!) [The Elves notch their arrow and aim.] Faeg i-varv d�n na lanc a nu ranc. (Their  armor is weak at the neck and beneath  the arms.) Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!) Did they hit anything? [to the men] Fire! Fire! [Impatiently] Send them to me! C�mon! Pendraid! (Ladders!) [The Elves draw their blades in preparation  for combat. The first ladders are almost  reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk  Berserkers on top of them.] Swords! Swords! Good! [Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai  climb over the wall.] Legolas, two already! [Holding up two  fingers] I�m on seventeen! [Outraged] Argh! I�ll have no pointy-ear  outscoring me! [He turns to a Uruk just  climbing over the wall, whacking it  in the groin with his axe and killing  it as it falls.] [Fires two arrows] Nineteen! [The Ent Moot is still in progress.  The Ents sway a little as they continue  to deliberate. Merry and Pippin are  sitting a distance away. Suddenly, Treebeard  nods and turns to the hobbits.] [Gesturing] Merry! Well, that�s good news. Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!  Twenty-one! Twenty-two! Na fennas! (Causeway!) [Directs the  Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.] Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down,  Legolas!) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai  in the shoulder but the latter keeps  going] Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!  Kill him!) Aragorn!! Argh! [He is soon overpowered. Aragorn gets  up and sees Gimli falling.] Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind  him] Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!) Herio! (Charge!) [Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge  towards the Uruk-hai streaming in. He  rushes to Gimli�s side and picks him  up. At the top of the battlements, Legolas  grabs a shield and sends it sliding  across the ground. He then hops onto  it and surfs down the steps, releasing  three arrows as he goes, and kicking  the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he  lands at the bottom.] Maybe Treebeard�s right. We don�t belong  here, Merry. It's too big for us. What  can we do in the end? We've got the  Shire. Maybe we should go home. Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get  your men out of there! Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!  (To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep!  Haldir, to the Keep!) [Protesting] What are you doing? Argh!  What are you stopping for! [Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs  up the steps to Haldir�s side and catches  him and he collapses. Haldir's head  rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing.  Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then  with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and  swings down to the ground, killing as  he goes.] Brace the gate! Hold them! Make way! We cannot hold much longer. [Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai  through the broken gate] How long do  you need? Brace the gate! Gimli! Timbers! Brace the Gate! [Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit  and stand on a ledge just to the side  of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over,  seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming  the gate.] Come on! We can take �em! It�s a long way. [Gimli takes a peek and then steps back.] [Mumbles] Toss me. What? I cannot jump the distance! You�ll have  to toss me! Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorn�s hand] Don�t  tell the Elf. Not a word. [He tosses Gimli to the head of the  Causeway and then leaps over.] [Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai] Make way! Follow me to the barricade. Watch our backs! Throw another one over here! Hold fast the gate!] Aragorn! [He throws them a rope] [Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand and  the rope with the other as they are  pulled up the wall. Just then the Uruk-hai  load and fires enormous hooks over the  battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb  onto super-ladders as they are pulled  up towards the walls, the super-ladders  locking onto the edge of the battlements  with their steel grips. Legolas takes  aim as another super-ladder is being  pulled up and shoots away one of the  ropes. The ladder falls back onto the  Uruk-hai army.] Fall back! Fall back! Fall back! Hurry! Inside! Get them inside! Into the Keep! [They all run towards the keep, Legolas  firing two arrows into the Uruk-hai  army as he goes.] Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to  a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take  us south! Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can  slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer  we are to danger, the farther we are  from harm. It�s the last thing he�ll  expect. No we won�t. Not this time. [Faramir and company draws close to  Osgiliath.] Look! Osgiliath burns! Mordor has come. [With tears in his eyes] The Ring will  not save Gondor. It has only the power  to destroy. Please, let me go. Hurry. [He presses them on] Faramir, you must let me go! [Frodo and Sam are pushed on towards  Osgiliath] I�m sorry, Treebeard. Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern  shore. Their numbers are too great.  By nightfall we�ll be overrun. Mr Frodo! It�s calling to him, Sam. His eye is  almost on me. Hold on, Mr. Frodo� You'll be alright... Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir  sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will  change our fortunes in this war. Do you want to know what happened to  Boromir? You want to know why your brother  died? He tried to take the Ring from  Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect  him, he tried to kill him! The Ring  drove your brother mad! Watch out! [A boulder crashes into a tower overhead  and shatters it. Suddenly, Frodo�s eyes  roll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.] Mr Frodo? [In a faraway voice] They�re here. They�ve  come. [Looking up] NAZG�L!! [He grabs the  hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.]  Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his  men] Take cover! [Carrying a table with Legolas to shore  up the door of the hall] You said this  fortress would never fall while your  men defend it! They still defend it!  They have died defending it! Is there no other way for the women  and children to get out of the caves?  [There is no answer.] Is there no other  way? There is one passage. It leads into  the mountains. But they will not get  far. The Uruk-hai are too many. Send word for the women and children  to make for the mountain pass. And barricade  the entrance. [Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and  meet them. For Rohan. For your people. The sun is rising. [Aragorn looks up at a window to see  faint light streaming through. He recalls  Gandalf's words.] Look to my coming at first light on  the fifth day. At dawn, look to the  east. Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to the  horn of Helm Hammerhand] Gandalf. Th�oden king stands alone. Yes! What are you doing? Where are you going?! Frodo walks up some stairs and stands  on a bridge. A Nazg�l on a Fell beast  emerges in front of him. Frodo stares  at the Nazg�l, fixated. Feeling the  call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir  watches the unfolding tableau from below.  As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his  finger and the Nazg�l flies closer and  closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo  over. Faramir releases an arrow and  shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam  roll down the stairs. As they come to  a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam  in a death grip, yells and points Sting  at his throat, his eyes livid with madness  and anger that someone would try to  take the Ring away.] Aaarrgghh!!! [With tears running down his face] It�s  me. It�s your Sam. Don�t you know your  Sam? [Slowly and with despair] I can�t do  this, Sam. [Getting up slowly] I know. It�s all  wrong. By rights we shouldn�t even be  here. But we are. [He stands and leans  against a wall, looking out into the  distance.] It�s like in the great stories,  Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.  Full of darkness and danger they were.  And sometimes you didn�t want to know  the end. Because how could the end be  happy? [Images of the riders winning  the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm�s  Deep] How could the world go back to  the way it was when so much bad had  happened? But in the end, it�s only a passing  thing, this shadow. [The women and children  welcome the men as they return. �owyn  runs up to Aragorn and embraces him,  crying tears of relief.] Even darkness  must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard  is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on  from their perch on Treebeard. On the  balcony, Saruman stumbles back into  his chamber] And when the sun shines  it will shine out the clearer. Those  were the stories that stayed with you.  That meant something, even if you were  too small to understand why. But I think,  Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.  Folk in those stories had lots of chances  of turning back only they didn�t. They  kept going because they were holding  on to something. What are we holding on to, Sam? There�s some good in this world, Mr.  Frodo. And it�s worth fighting for. I think at last we understand one another,  Frodo Baggins. You know the laws of our country, the  laws of your father. If you let them  go, your life will be forfeit. Then it is forfeit. Release them. [Sam shakes the ranger�s hand from his  shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir  with gladness. Over in the realm of  Rohan, Gandalf, Th�oden and company  ride to the top of a slope, looking  towards the Mountain of Fire in the  distance.] Sauron�s wrath will be terrible, his  retribution swift. The battle for Helm�s  Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth  is about to begin. All our hopes now  lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere  in the wilderness. I wonder if we�ll ever be put into songs  or tales. What? I wonder if people will ever say, �let�s  hear about Frodo and the Ring.� And  they�ll say �yes, that�s one of my favorite  stories. Frodo was really courageous,  wasn�t he, dad.� �Yes, my boy, the most  famousest of hobbits. And that�s saying  alot.� Huh, you left out one of the chief characters  � Samwise the Brave. I want to hear  more about Sam. Frodo wouldn�t have got far without  Sam. Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn�t make fun.  I was being serious. [smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk  on] [Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives  his backpack a heave and follows Frodo] Sm�agol! We�re not gonna wait for you. Come on! Master broke his promise. Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy,  false. We ought to wring his filthy  little neck. [Twists the branch of a  tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them  both. And then we take the precious  and we be the master. Then we stabs them out. Put out his  eyeses. And make HIM crawl. Kill them both. Where�s he gone? Hey Gollum, where are  you? Sm�agol? [Softly and sinisterly] We could let  HER do it. Yes, precious she could. And then we  takes it once they�re dead. Shh� [He pops out from hiding in front  of the hobbits.] Follow me. [ Camera pans up over the forest and  Ephel D�ath to reveal the desolation  of Mordor. To the left of the frame  is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-d�r,  and to the right of the frame is the  fiery Mount Doom. Three Fell Beasts  circle the dark skies. Lightning flashes  as the scene fades to black.]
