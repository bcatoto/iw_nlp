I'm always here, Pete. When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you. -- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both... Yeah, ya like to do things on your own I been thinkin' lately. Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad-- Cause if you get in a bind-- Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money? Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't. S'funny. When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world. Ya still follow the Mets, Pete? Eh. If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'. Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way. Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline. Ah, ya know. Neighborhood's not what it used to be. Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day. So, uh... how's college goin'? What, want a glass? Here you go, Pete.See? -- but they got it all wrong. Any fool can figure it out. Spider-Man nailed this guy! No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer-- Come on, laughter's the best medicine! Mistake? Hey, guy, get back here! Hey, guys. Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool. I'm parked illegally! Lizzy!Or was it all a dream? I was there. Flash, drop it-- Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded. Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo. Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed. I got you a present. You get mugged or something? And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard? I feel like a complete idiot. Jesus Christ. I am not pitiful! I am the bridge to the �bermensch! You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me? Why home? The real world beckons, man! The possibilities are endless. Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey? Screw scholarships! Universities are death! They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas! Burn 'em down, I say! "Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times." "Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University." Ooooh. Your feet are on fire. A little bunny I saved from dissection. They'll never take me alive.You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy. How are you doing, kid? Get away from me, freak! Lemme down, bugface!No! Now get outta my face, kid. No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs. Did you get pictures? Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them. Did you get pictures? I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em! I can't print this surreal garbage! I got a question, college boy. What the hell am I supposed to do with these!? I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get? Salvador Dali! When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for-- I like enthusiasm. That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids. Not just 'cause they work cheap. I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker. I do. Gimme that. Pick it up later. Seventy. But I want blood and gore. You know, sexy stuff. Get inside and get pictures. Fifty bucks. Parker-- you go here, right? Got your camera? You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets-- Too hip. Your photos suck, kid. Hmf-hrr? Frmpph-yrr. Police, help! Po-- mmph. I don't submit to blackmail! The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--An even five I throw in the jacket. You're making my life difficult. Eh. Week from tomorrow. What's this? A cockaroach? No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.Are you quite finished? All right, amazing. Are you quite finished? I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street? Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe? I see. So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name-- Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?Roz? Rosomoff? What is it? Nope. Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent. Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput? Yeah, Roz. Einstein, right? We'll see ya. It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try. Funny coincidence, huh? You sure about all this? Toxic dumps, huh. Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer-- Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos. But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms-- Some of him� char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide. Any bad blood between him and Ock? You were the last one to see Thorkel. In Octavius' hospital room.I will finish what I've begun� No! I don't care. Cretin. This is the unified field! All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly! I couldn't care less. What I've done is-- In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century. With more power, I could-- Proof. Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof. Ha. Anti-gravitational particles. Truth. Truth alone exists. Truth must be released... Oh, Roz. My mind is so far beyond yours now. I could beat you at chess now. I'll repeat the experiment. I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters. Truth. Pure, eternal. Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality. You're wrong. Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation. My� self. I don't matter. This human life, all life- insignificant. Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. Ach, theories! This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe. I left a paper in my desk. No. No thank you. I have work. Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.I know. Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not-- No, no. Oh, sure. Remember Little League? No�not really. I know. Still thinking about retiring? You stop him? Same old stuff. How's the pharmacy? No. No, that's okay. Uh, Uncle Ben, I-- Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself... Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but-- You're not half the idiot I am, Harry. Mm-hmm. Don't be pitiful. Great idea. Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home. I know. I've got one too. Let me guess. The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship. Harry� Harry! What's in there? You maniac. You'll blow your scholarship. Right. Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really-- Are you okay? That's not even close. Now tell me you love me. Can I get a word in edgewise? Mr. Jameson-- You print pictures of Bigfoot! Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in-- Mr. Jameson-- Well, thanks. You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan-- Can't focus... Can we make it a hundred? Yeah-- You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson? Come on, that's pure luck! The guy was in the right place at the right time-- I think you're trying to tell me something. Deal. But don't tell anyone. I want to keep a low profile. Two suits by tomorrow for $400? How about tomorrow? A spider. Eight legs. Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight. Bright colors. Red, maybe a deep midnight blue. Nah. Hold it. Can we stop being clever, just for a moment? I... I like you. A lot. Hello, Liz. I'm here... Strong... Oh, God, I forgot to-- I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon. Unh-huh. Excuse me. I've gotta go. Am I? I'm not so sure. I used to be sure of a lot of things. Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore. You'd feel what? Well, no. They keep saying there's nothing I could've done. That's a lie. I could've done something. If only I'd paid attention to my feelings. I think I'd like that. -- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon. That was then. I'm better since the lobotomy. No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style. Hey, look-- let's go to lunch. Someplace nice for a change. Sort of. I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back. This from a girl who still plays with dolls. I've got no problems. Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them. I'm sure you kept warm. Hi, Adele. I've gotta study. I'd never admit that. Does it have a human name? "Flash," Liz. You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash." But you like that in a man? What? I suppose. My my. Maybe. I could have stopped it, though. Back to the lab. Harry'll probably lose his scholarship. -- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka. Thank God. I hate-- I hate the Platonic idea of you. I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise-- I-- uh-- Huh? It's too early to be clever. Good morning, Liz. How is he? Aunt May, what happened? It's fine. Tell me what-- A match made in heaven. Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn-- Oh, not that. You promised you'd burn it. What the hell is that? The record-- No. It's Friday night... I'm a photographer, remember? I'll introduce you. I am old enough to-- When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle-- Aunt May, you're trespassing. There's nothing in there worth stealing! Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious-- I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls-- Hi. I've got sort of a hypothetical question. Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility? Oh. Yeah. Thanks. I'll try. Thanks. I don't think I'll be running into him. Luck. The right place at the right time. Need any more help? Not a lot. I saw inside of the Science Center. What exactly happened? Caused by Doc Ock's experiment? Really, Professor, I-- Actually, I got this spider bite� An extension on that astronomy paper? Because, uh... Hi, Professor. What's up? Why? It is a wrestling match, or� No� Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss? I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day. The guy in the mask? Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then. Bye. Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight. I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation? Kid, you were terrific. Max Reiss, novelty acts. Was that judo or something? Ah, skip it. Question is, can you do it again? I just gave-- yeah, sure. Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow. I asked if you felt like a drink-- ... a couple a drinks at Sardi's? Yup. Oh, here's your check, minus my commission. Solid, solid novelty act. Nah. The big mask was better. Where'd you get the clown suit?Oh, that? It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest. Bye. Fine. Thank you. Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that. Would you cool it already? Relax, Jameson. This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive. On one condition-- Just about. See, I also have this amazing strength. Just about. You see, I also have this amazing strength... Well... Thanks, I already ate. Just call me Spidey. Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this. Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter-- No. No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong -- I need to make a phone call. What? So they're airing this tonight? Like it? Up here, Docky Ocky! Professor, you ever fly one of these things before? I'm not so happy myself. Phooey on that. No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way. Just drop me off here. Bonkers. Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now. And blow up the universe just to prove he's right? Bit egotistical, isn't it? The usual. Heredity and environment. What's the deal with Doc Ock? Imagine how I feel. Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey. Lucky you showed up when you did. Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?Doubtless. And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work. Somewhere else. Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering� the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron� That Nobel Prize will just have to wait. You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary. Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel. What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown. Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year. I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius. A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures. Let's talk in the hall. Power down. I need to talk to you.
