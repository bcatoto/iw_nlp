Lyrics by John Lennon, music by Paul McCartney.  Lucy Diamond Dawson. Becca!  Becca! Didn't you just fall asleep, little girl? Okay, if you say it's time to get up, then it's time to get up, time to get up. Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Quite a bit of business. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Let me see let me see let me see. You look very beautiful this morning, very beautiful. Everything's so tiny, tiny.  Tiny.  Everything.  Won't you please come over?  Help.  I need somebody.  Won't you please please help me. Her mother?  Her mother said "This isn't my life.  I'm outta here when she comes.  It didn't mean anything, Sam.  It was just one night.  The two of you.  That's all I need..." Annie, what if she's sick? A lot, Gerber, Carnation, Gerber. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Three squares hot. Oh.  I'm sorry Lucy Diamond. She never really goes to sleep. What are you doing here now?!  Her first sound sleep, not a sound, not a sound. Eight years every Thursday Video Night and you forgot?! Oh my god, Video Night.  First Thursday of the month.  Video night at Sam's house.  I'm sorry, I forgot. Becca's gone.  "Gone with the Wind" is a very sad movie. Oh here we go...Everything changes now.  Soon you'll forget about Wednesday night Denny's and Friday night Karaoke.  And I got hit by a car today. You did? It's probably that guy from the V.A. What guy? I can't discuss it.  And now this. She looks smart, doesn't she? Of course, look.  She's already reading the newspaper.  I have five smart sisters in Pakistan.  I am only brother.  "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" was a wonderful movie I forgot to bring last week for Video Night... Did you get "Blade Runner" for tonight? Now it's all my fault?! Don't tell me you forgot again.  I broke a date with a daydream to come here. Mom!  I told you Video Night's over at nine!  It's only six-thirty! She needs motion.  My father drove my sisters in his taxi to get them to go to sleep.  Two-fifty surcharge on all taxi's from the airport... I got hit by a taxi on Tuesday. Main and Temple...again.  She out yet? Almost there, almost there.  One more round and she'll be down for the night. Double macciatto, low foam, low-fat.  Good choice, very good choice. Please, Annie!  She's too big to take to work. It was her first word.  Very first word. Groceries, Annie. Let me see, let me see.  I've never been there but they say it's somewhere near China. The Beatles. I think she fell out of love with me.  Not you, never you.  Me, just me. Somewhere in Florida, I think. Paul McCartney lost his mother when he was fourteen.  John lost his mother twice.  First when Julie gave John to her sister Mimi to raise.  And then again when Julia was hit by a car.  They say God picks certain people, special people.  That's what they say. Do you mean - what do you mean? What do you mean?  I mean, what do you mean? I'm not am I.  I'm sorry. We are very lucky, aren't we? Good choice.  Very good choice. Brad, I know it was your turn.  I'm sure of it. I swear to God it was Robert's turn. Why is it always my fault? I keep track, last time, I say to myself, I say, write it down... Bank of America give away beautiful calendar, every month a picture of wild animal, look June, an Elk.  Elke Sommer...she starred in the remake of "Prisoner of Zenda"... Three stars Leonard Maltin video movie guide. You need a good sturdy school shoe.  Arches are very important. Sturdy is boring.  Red shoes bring good luck. But red doesn't got with green. Except on Christmas. No brown clodhoppers.  Everyone will make fun of her. NO ONE will make fun of Lucy. She might be stupid. No she's not -- Did they test her? You don't know for sure. Yes I do. But if she is, don't make her go to school. Don't let her in the lunch room.  Johnny Marzettie's there. And gym.  Get her a pass.  The rules for volleyball are so hard to remember.  "Rotate Rackman Rotate." Throw the ball at his forehead and the water on his brain will come out his nose. She know what she likes.  She likes these.  How much are they? Forty-nine ninety-nine. One penny less than fifty.  These shoes are one penny less than fifty? No, no no no no. We'll all give ten dollars. I've only got three plus five.  But I need one for stamps. Don't pull your wad out in front of people. Thank you, thank you.  We are rich in friends.  That's what our fortune cookie said.  1, 2, 3, 4, quarters that makes one. I'll count it. Is it enough? If there's a God. Do we get a balloon with these? Yes. All of us, or just her? Beautiful kick!  Very close! Thatta girl!  Thatta girl!  They're getting scared now! C'mon, Conner!  On your toes!  They're all counting on you! Hurray, Lucy!  You're getting the hang of it now!  You've got them scared now! L-u-c-y!  That's our battlecry! The whole game was right in front of your nose!  I leave work early to watch you blow the whole game!? Ha! What's wrong with your father?  Why's he acting like a retard? Are you? Are you sure? How do you know? But he's a retard. "They perched in sisisi..." "...silence for a long time."  Boy.  Your teacher chose a hard book this time.  "How can we be so difdifdif..." "I am Sam, Sam I am.  Do you like green eggs and ham?  I do not like them, Sam I am!" "And I will eat them here and there.  Say I will eat them ANYWHERE.  I do so like green eggs and ham, thank you thank you, Sam I am!"  One more time! Just the part about the boat and the goat in the rain in the train? But Wednesday night's Denny's, Thursday's Video Night, Friday Night Karaoke. How about one more time, just the beginning?  "I am Sam, Sam I am..." Well, if he has the arrow. You're a good reader. You're lucky.  I'm looking for a smart, good mother. Oh, good.  Good. Oh no no no.  I don't believe in that. Gentle.  Gentle.  Yes.  Do you tell stories? I have to pick up Lucy at Annie's first. French, French the language of France.  You could teach my daughter, Lucy. After?!  No no, Lucy comes too. Not so fast.  You're under arrest.  Solicitation. It's the first time in nineteen years I actually believe the guy when he says he didn't know she was a hooker -- ...Your teeth don't sound like they were brushed.  Do it with me now. Let him go.  He says he's never spent a night away from his kid... Come with me - I got a guy who beat the shit out of his two year old.  Again. Thirteen up...not on the gum line not on the gum line, 1, 2, 3. Mr. Dawson, do you understand what Miss Wright is trying to tell you about Lucy? No one wanted The Beatles to break up.  But you can hear it on the White Album.  They were going in different directions. Yes you do.  It starts with a "d" -- I don't believe you. Yes.  Now read the word. No you're not. It makes me happy.  I'm happy hearing you read it. I'm a Super Freak! And I thought my dad was a dork. A new place.  Your choice.  I said we'd go to a new place.  And here we are. The napkins are much stiffer at Denny's.  They make better birds.  There's not so much stuff on the tables there either.  Why do they have two kinds of mustard on every table? No, no coffee.  Sam's system can't handle coffee. I'll have the fish special, side of potatoes, salad with Thousand Island Dressing, cherry pie, and... Chips, chips?  You mean potato chips?  I don't want potato chips.  I want a side of potatoes. No, a side of potatoes, like at Denny's.  A side of potatoes. Denny's has new potatoes.  Six new potatoes parsley garnish parsley garnish... Fish and chips fish and chips.  I will not eat fish and chips. Now when they come through the door, everybody yell "Surprise!"  Do you want to rehearse again? No.  I bet she already knows. I didn't tell her.  Did Brad say I did? Is that Lucy?  Annie's supposed to call and warn us.  Shhhh, everyone. Put your present over there - Hurry up!  Lucy might be on her way. Hello?  Annie says she's coming up the stairs.  Everyone be quiet.  Assume surprise positions! Be quiet!  Assume surprise positions! Oh brother! Why are you such a party pooper?!  Assume surprise positions! Make me! Hey! He's gonna ruin the surprise!  He's gonna ruin the surprise! He touched me!  I've got cooties!  I've got cooties! Get your hands off my boy! Surprise!  Happy Birthday! You don't have to call him "Daddy". She says you're not her real father, anyway.  She's adopted! I'll go get her. No, no no no.  It's her birthday!  It's her birthday! Run, Lucy, run! Given the fact that the father was arrested for solicitation, did not cooperate with the police... ...could not control his emotions, endangering other children.  Miss Brown also cites Mr. Dawson's mental deficiencies which raise serious questions about his ability to properly parent.  I agree to grant petition.  The child shall be removed from the home until a forma jurisdictional hearing.  Mr. Dawson, is there anything you'd like to add? Yes.  I just wanted it to be a nice surprise party.  I had gotten the plates at Pic-N-Save.  Pink and yellow, pink and yellow.  Like a princess.  And the balloons at -- Mr. Dawson, it sounds like a lovely party, but right now I want to talk to you about your legal rights.  I would strongly suggest you get yourself legal counsel and allow your attorney to present your case at the jurisdictional hearing on February 13th.  Counsel, are you available? February 20th.  8:00 a.m. Twenty-two days?  Lucy will come home and you want me to bring Lucy back in twenty-two days? No, Mr. Dawson.  You'll have supervised visits twice a week for two hours.  Now I'm sorry, we have thirty more cases to see today.  Next!  Hopkins vs. Clifford. Thursday?  Today is Monday, Mrs.  Brown.  That's three days away.  That's too long.  She can't sleep without Mr. Jeeters.  Well if you're not available until Thursday, maybe I could see her without you there... maybe the Judge made a mistake - maybe he doesn't know that for seven years I played with her without you there...No Mrs. Brown, I'm not trying to violate the court... Mrs. Brown? I bet they were recording the whole conversation.  Check your phone.  You can't make a move.  You need a lawyer. Call Jerry Spence.  He has his own show.  He must know what he's doing. No.  Johnny Cochran.  He has his own show, too. Yeah!  He can even get a guilty person off. So you think I'm guilty? No.  You didn't kill anybody. But she said I'm not her father. She didn't say that.  That runty kid with the blue shirt and the mean father whose voice sounds like the man on the Channel Four News who has a toupee.  Toupees are expensive. But Ifty.  She said it. But she didn't mean it.  I said I hated my mother once.  "Once upon a time..." is how stories begin. You should get a personal injury lawyer.  You've been personally injured. Here - look at this - "Sebastion Gibson."  He can do anything.  Pedestrians.  Back and neck.  Uninsured Motorist.  Dog attacks. The Social Worker said it's a custody case. Then get a divorce lawyer. When Dustin Hoffman was trying to keep Billy from going back to Meryl Streep, his lawyer said it was going to cost him fifteen thousand dollars - and that's if we win! Fifteen thousand dollars! Don't worry about money now.  Get the best.  Century City - Here: "Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams". Good choice, very good choice. Is it free? ...Lucy had an ice-cream cake with pink flowers - pink, not white not white...Lucy's favorite is cherry vanilla which is pink, too.  Cherries and vanilla. Burt Bacharach shared billing with The Beatles and Jose Jiminez on the Ed Sullivan Show June 5th, 1968. Yes.  A little one.  Your son's on line two. Since you would like to, why don't you talk to your boss.  Maybe he would let you. I earn eight dollars an hour at Starbucks.  I can pay your hourly rate, rate by the hour, hourly -- Is there a child involved in Mr. Kresges' case? This is Lucy.  One year old.  First word, "apple".  December third.  3:16 p.m.  December third. Here's Lucy two years old.  First merry go-round ride.  June 6th.  4:13 p.m.  June 6th.  Here's Lucy.  Seven years old.  The day the police took her away. Thank you for telling me not to give up.  I won't give up. You did say "over the trees" instead of "over the sea."  It's hard to remember all the words to all the songs.  There's so many. you have a child Rita rubel Bly Harrison Williams.  If they took him away wouldn't you hire the fastest talking four-named lawyer you could? I'm ready. Let's not add more stress to your life. I'm ready.  I'm ready to make coffee.  Lo-fat decaf latte.  Coffee up to here.  Add steamed milk up to here.  No foam, no foam.  Cinnamon or chocolate sprinkles. That's pretty good Sam.  I'll think about it. I know what that means.  I stock shelves at Lucky Supermarkets.  I want to bag groceries, Miss Losey says "I'll think about it."  Randy Brenner gets the job.  I was the janitor at the La Reina Theater, I wanted to take tickets.  Mr. Jenkins said he'd think about it.  Larry Peters gets the job.  Lets his friends in for free... I promise you, Sam.  I'll honestly think about it.  You have my word. Words, words, words.  I need more than that.  I need to pay my lawyer.  I need to make coffee. Non-fat vente cap.  I'm sorry to bother you, but did you call your friend? Your friend from college, your friend who does this kind of work? Oh, that happens.  That happens.  People lose touch.  Will you call me if you find it?  If you get back in touch? 32nd floor.  32 floors more.  31st floor.  31 floors more... Oh my God oh my God!  Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams! Yes!  Alright!  I liked Sonny Bono too! ...and she's a Century City lawyer - a very famous lawyer.  Guess what her name is?  Rita Harrison. Harrison.  Just like George. You've grown. Your ears are larger.  And your eyes are older. I'm gonna get a phone machine.  Next paycheck.  If I'm not home, you can leave a message.  "Hi, This is Lucy." Yes we can.  I'm in line for a promotion.  Big promotion.  A promotion that's big. Set your dreams high, Lucy. No, Lucy.  Don't say that. I - It's - They - But it's an emergency - lots of three syllable words urgent open at once. I know and I want you to object. Here.  Don't be sad. Okay okay I know I take the #34 bus and transfer to the #13...than the Downtown Express to Wilshire then - Red means stop yellow in the middle means no no no...I don't like shrinks.  I've seen too many shrinks. Your mother sent you to shrinks, too? That's nice.  Did you notice that everyone else is driving slower.  I noticed that did you? She's gone.  She's at the Park Lane Mortuary.  Two from the left.  Under the big tree. Too many shrinks...I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson, if I were you I wouldn't waste any more time.  I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson it must be a tremendous disappointment.  I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson I think you'd both be happier if Sam was in a home. Mr. Dawson, you do understand, that since I am a court appointed psychologist, the traditional client therapist confidentiality will be waived. Mr. Dawson, do you understand that the confidentiality will be waived? Before you read your message press the red button for record, when you finish, press the yellow button.  If you press the green button, it will play it back you.  Let's start with the "ogm". Okay, okay.  I'm ready.  Hello, I am Sam. No, no.  I didn't press the red button. Oh, yes.  False start, false start. It's not working.  That's what you get for buying a used machine.  Used means broken.  You're asking for other people's problems, you have enough of your own, not that everyone doesn't have problems. It's not used.  It's pre-owned.  Guy bought it for his auto shop and then he got a secretary. Testing, one two three. That's a good code.  I'll remember that.  One, two, three. Quick, you're recording. I'm hi.  I am Sam.  I'm not home. No, you don't want to say that.  you don't want them to know you're not home. But then I'm lying. Everybody's lying. I'm not a liar.  It will send a mixed message to Lucy. You're on the air! Let me see, let me see, let me see.  Hi, how are you? That was pretty good.  That was natural. Did I sound like a good father? It's the outgoing message.  You need to sound more outgoing.  Let's start again. Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop.  We'd love to show you our body work, but it's invisible.  Leave it at the beep. Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams thirty second floor, thirty-two floors up. Sam.  I am Sam. He works in a bank. Sam is a very concerned father.  He always saves his money at Bank of America.  Last year there was a lion on the calendar.  This year a gazelle.  The gazelle is national bird of Tunisia.  We have clients, not customers.  At Bank of America.  Bank on us. What was the question again, please? He always made a point of feeding her breakfast when "Bewitched" was on and lunch when "Jeopardy" was on so she'd be smart.  Is that Wonderbra you're wearing?  Because you look wonderful. Why are you recording this?  Who's listening? Who are you really? What's that supposed to mean? I need to talk to my lawyer. Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop - Tall's the smallest. Do you want it here or to go? Annie, it's one day.  One hour.  Maybe only 53 minutes.  Lucy needs you. You went to college.  You can give the right answers. We can't lose her. All rise for the Honorable Judge Phillip McNeily. ...there is an unhealthy reversal of roles here.  As you can see from her drawings, she has an exaggerated sense of responsibility.  Lucy feels she has to take care of her father.  Although at her birthday party her true feelings about her father were revealed. The state is paying Miss Geller for her opinions - Objection your honor - Objection. I think they want you to stop. We all appreciate your assistance Mr. Dawson - continue with your witness, Mr. Turner. Now Ms. Geller, I assume in your therapy session, Mr. Dawson extolled his parenting abilities. On the contrary, Mr. Dawson admitted he felt profoundly inadequate - that he was terrified he'd made and would continue to make - and I quote: "Huge mistakes, huge mistakes, mistakes that are huge." No further questions. Yes. Objection.  It's Mr. Dawson's parenting.  Not Ms. Geller's that's at question here. Overruled.  I'll allow it. Objection. Get to the point, Ms. Harrison. I - I - Objection! I will - Yes. You made her cry. That's not nice.  Not very nice. Your secretary too.  Yellow and green in one bowl. You separate the Lima beans from the corn please? Absolutely. My treat.  My treat. I said it's my treat.  That means I'll get it. Trying to what? Like a what? A real man? You're my lawyer and you think what they think.  I don't have a chance.  No chance at all.  Even with an expert witness. Answer the question. Do you think what they think?  Sam can't order food.  Sam can't pay a check.  Sam can't take care of Lucy? You're my lawyer it matters what you think. Me.  It matters to me. Fourteen thirty three.  That's 5 ones, 2 quarters and 16 cents less than twenty. Yes. Caffeine.  Sugar.  And my mother's confidence in me. She had great instincts. In the lower ranges.  About eighty. No.  My mother's condition taught me what they can't teach you; compassion and patience. How'd you get through medical school?  Where'd you live? We lived with my mother's parents. Oh, Grandma and Grandpa.  Would it be fair to say your grandparents were of normal intelligence? Yes. And didn't these people - your grandparents - with normal intelligence - have the real responsibilities? Motion to strike that from the record.  Irrelevant, immaterial and immature - I'm not talking about the rights of the parent, I'm talking about the rights of a child. I'm talking about entrusting an eight year old's welfare in the hands of someone whose records show he was diagnosed with infantile autism, mental retardation... Oh, I'm sensitive.  I'm real sensitive when I see people like you -- come here and try to give meaning to your life by screwing up somebody else's! That's enough.  Both lawyers approach the bench! That's it.  I fine you both for contempt.  Two-hundred fifty dollars. What's that to her?  She gets that for picking up the phone. I'll tell you what this is about.  See this is an award for you at some luncheon.  But I'm here everyday. You win, you're out the door.  But guess who I see come back?  The kid.  Most of the time, in less than a year.  Only now it's too late.  So you're right.  I'm real sensitive.  You can't even touch that area. Columbus had to sail around the world to prove it was round. What's going on?  What made her change her mind? That was so nice of her.  Very nice. No, Lucy. That would be wrong. I won't let that happen. I love you Lucy.  I love you. Hey, buddy.  No loitering.  Move it. Not yet not yet not yet. You want me to get a black and white down here? Not yet not yet not yet. Jesus Christ. She hasn't been sleeping well.  She needs a good night's rest.  Let her sleep, let her sleep. What are you, crazy? I - She - But Lucy said - I heard you turned seven this year.  That's pretty exciting. What'd you get for your birthday? Really?  That's odd.  Why not? Oh, I'm sorry.  I was confused.  I thought you didn't open your birthday presents because you ran away from your own party when your best friend told everyone that you were adopted. Why would your friends say it if you hadn't said it? May I remind you Lucy that you're under oath? And do you know that means if you lie you could be in serious trouble? So now that you and I have agreed to tell the truth, where did you sleep last night? All right, Lucy.  If you're not going to tell the truth, I am.  Your dad kidnapped you last night and the police found you sleeping in a seedy park a hundred miles from here.  You're lying right now because you're afraid.  Afraid that everyone will see how scared and frustrated you really are.  You're afraid of hurting him, but now we need to tell the truth.  The truth is deep inside you know you're not getting what you need from your father.  Isn't that right, Lucy? No, Lucy, you lied. Jo Jo isn't us.  The truth, the truth, when the judge hears the truth, he'll know, he'll know we should be together. I CARE!  DO YOU HEAR ME?  THE TRUTH. Help me, God.  Help me, God.  Help me, God... Sam's my most reliable employee.  He's never missed a day of work in eight years.  Always warm, always friendly. Admirable qualities for a single father.  Mr. Walker, in these eight years, have Mr. Dawson's responsibilities, which...let me see...would include bussing tables, replenishing Sweet 'n Lows, and sweeping up the place... increased? No.  Not really. And isn't that because he's mentally incapable of learning management skills or working the cash register or even making a cup of coffee? You may answer the question. Well as a matter of fact, Sam and I have been discussing a promotion that I was planning on putting into effect at the end of the week. Oh boy!  Thank you, George! Yes.  Thank you, George.  Now, after eight years, Sam can finally measure out a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water.  Now, he must certainly be able to help Lucy with her geometry. No further questions. I answer in one sentence. Yes.  One sentence.  Short and sweet.  My aunt was short and sweet.  But her cooking was too spicy she... Annie!  I can't believe it! Can Sam add? How about multiplication? So what you're saying is that Sam can not even multiply two times two? I bet he's knocking on your door all the time with questions. So let's see..he doesn't know math...he can't even wash her clothes.  How about puberty?  I can only imagine how much insight he'll bring to approaching the sensitive issues of a young girl's development. And you've had plenty of opportunity to observe fathers, haven't you? But the fact that Ms. Cassell hasn't come out of her room in years might have some effect on her perception. I'll allow it. What about your father, Ms. Cassell?  Since you appear to be an expert on father-daughter relationships. Excuse me, Ms. Cassell, I didn't hear your response.  What about your father? Objection!  No further questions! Excuse me, Mr. Dawson? I said that's enough!  I will not allow it!  Overruled!  Overruled!! Extraordinary.  Truly extraordinary. Effective.  Very effective. Annie's not quite ready to go outside yet. Guess. Well where was he last night? There you guessed it. That's what he said. You.  But you said you were working late. Then go work. You have to work.  Go work. This is my favorite part.  Hey Dommy, this one looks like he's suffering from shell shock. Boy I guess we can shell it out... It was a shell of a good hit. "Turtles in the half-shell, turtle power!"  Rita!  Come this is the best part. You eat too fast.  Come watch the movie. Bad? Let me see let me see let me see. Could you slow down?  Why do you eat so fast? But I didn't.  You did. No...You're so lucky.  You get to play with Danny all the time. Yes he does.  He does he does.  He thinks you don't want to. Tweak, tweak. Tweak, squeak, peek peek... You know I didn't harass him, Rita.  You know that, you know that! Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.  I didn't harass him, Mr. Turner.  Mr. Turner - You don't look like him. You're so much prettier. In some ways.  But in other ways, she's not, I think. I think. I think in other ways I'm smarter than her.  Smarter than you are, Mr. Turner.  In fact, in some ways I'm smarter than you, Judge McNeilly. What parent doesn't want more for their child?  To be more than the sum of the parts of the whole of them. I won't let that happen.  I won't. Respect is not just about how smart someone is.  Smart is not just about how smart someone is. Lucy is happy!  We have fun!  We go to Denny's, we go to video night.  I know how to love her.  I know I'm not going to able to go to law school and learn how to be a mean person, but I know how to love.  I know how to be her father, Mr. Turner! You look great, Sam.  What time do you have to be in court? Half day, half day.  I take the stand at two. Okay, we need two grande cappucinos, non fat. Sprinkles or Cinnamon? What is this?  I ordered an Americano, not a latte. Americano, Americano, not a latte. I'm going to be late!  I'm going to be late! I'll call a taxi. No, no, I can't wait.  I can't wait.  I've got to go right now. Your Honor, if the defendant doesn't have enough interest in his daughter to even show up - Make it brief, Ms. Harrison. Lucy needs me. Lucy needs you. Ms. Harrison.  We need you! There's a free program at the YMCA.  Lucy can go there. The Fosters don't know her.  Why can't she live with me and they can come visit if they want to.  I'm firm on this.  And I'm getting firmer.  Lucy belongs with me. Paul wrote the first part of the song "Michelle".  He said to John, "Where do I go from here?"  John had been listening to Nina Simone.  There was a line in it that went something like, "I love you, I love you, I love you..." They put that into the song.  It wouldn't be the same song without that.  It made the song complete.  That's why the whole world cried when they broke up on April 10, 1970. Did you get that, Mary? When you were Lucy's age, were you living at home? No. Were you living with your mother and father? No. Well then where were you living? In an institution. So your parents put you in an institution? Only after my mom got sick. What about your father?  Where was he? Gone with the wind when Sam was born. So, you weren't raised by your mother? I saw her I saw her. When? Christmas, Easter and my birthday. Oh, once a year on your birthday.  So in a way, the people at the institution were your parents.  Were they nice to you? Some yes.  Some on.  Some yes. Did they hit you? Sometimes.  Sometimes they did sometimes. Like when you hit Lucy's friend at her birthday party? Let me rephrase that, strong-armed.  So what role model do you call upon as a father when you're parenting Lucy?  The head of the institution?  The Principal  the warden? No.  Not Mr. Whitehead.  Not him. Then who? Myself. you have the mental capacity of a seven year old.  So you ask yourself, a seven year old - I am not a seven-year old. How to parent a fellow seven-year old? Yes.  No.  What was the question? The question is: what makes you think you can be a parent?  Your background?  Your IQ?  Your friends who can't even testify for you? My friends - My friends love Lucy even if Rita thought they weren't smart enough to testify.  Even if she said you'd wipe the floor with them. Excuse me, Mr. Dawson, your lawyer just objected; that means you didn't have to answer the question.  You can't even follow the simple rules you've watched here day after day.  You really think you can raise a seven-year old?  A ten year old?  A thirteen-year old? That means she'll be six years more advanced than you. I've had a lot of time to think about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent.  It has to do with constancy.  It has to do with patience.  It has to do with listening.  To pretending to listen when you can't even listen anymore. It has to do with love, like she says... And I don't know where it's written that a woman has a corner on that market, that a man has any less of those emotions than a woman.  Billy has a home with me!  It's not perfect!  I'm not a perfect parent!  Sometimes I forget he's just a little kid... We built a life together and we love each other and if you destroy that, it may be irrep, irrep, irrep... Irreparable. Joanne, don't do that, please.  Don't do it twice, not to him.  Then Meryl Streep can't even look at Dustin Hoffman after that. Right, "Kramer vs. Kramer."  Thank you for the commentary, Mr. Bhutto.  It's hard to find words isn't it, Mr. Dawson.  It's confusing.  It's confusing to know what to say to Lucy half the time, isn't it? No, yes, no. No what? Let me see let me see let me see. You don't know what? Yes. Yes.  You're right, you don't know.  You don't know enough to really raise your daughter? I am Lucy's father. Are you?  Are you really?  I'm not talking about the fact that you got some homeless woman pregnant. Denied.  Get to the question, Mr. Turner. The question is if you love your daughter as much as they say you do don't you think she deserves more?!  Don't you?  In your heart of hearts, secretly question yourself every day?  Don't you?! Yes. Was that a "yes?" Yes.  She does.  She deserves everything.  In my heart of hearts. Yes she does.  And you agree with everyone, you can't give her that? Maybe.  Maybe everybody's right. No more no more!  Let it stop!  No more!  No more!  No more! Your teacher told me you were an artist. I am, aren't I.  Maybe you could teach me how to paint. Excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee, could you clean this up? I said I need a refill and a towel over here. You need a towel?  A refill?  A glass of water?  You need more than you already have?  You have everything - Everything.  But it's not enough.  Take my daughter, too! No. Oh, he must've forgotten to put the gift in. You know, this wall really needs something special on it. Megan stayed a little over a year. No room.  No room. Sam makes life too hard.  Sam makes life too hard on everyone. I don't want to work there anymore.  Too many people. Lucy doesn't need me anymore.  She has a new family.  She doesn't need me anymore. She didn't have to say it.  I may be stupid, but I know.  I know. I tried.  I tried. You don't know.  You don't know. You don't know what it is to try and try and never get there.  You were born perfect, perfect. That's right.  People like you don't know. People like you don't know, don't know what hurt feels like, people like you don't feel, don't feel anything. You're enough.  You're so much more than enough. Lovely Rita... You're early. All the lights were green. There's a reason for the court schedule.  You stopped showing up.  Lucy has had to rebuild her life. I want her back.  I can do it.  I know I can. That's not up to me, but I'm telling you, I will do everything in my power to prevent Lucy from getting hurt again. Whose dogs are these? Supplemental income supplemental income - bathe, walk and feed.  Sam Dawson meets your canine needs. Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! I never forgot you.  I forgot me. I hate you I hate you I hate you! Lucy, I tried to write you a letter last night... Gesundheit, Buster.  Buster has a cold.  But the letter had too many big words.  Pokey, sit. Dear Lucy.  Pokey sit.  Dear Lucy, I'm sorry that I hurt you.  Every moment of the day I thought about you.  Lucy in the hammock, Lucy at school.  Lucy in the sky...XXOO.  Daddy.  P.S. I love you, recorded September 11th, the day you took your first step. Napa cabbage, excellent choice.  Purple and green, purple and green.  Very rich in Vitamin C.  Good choice. Very good choice. Hello, lawyer. No.  We already did.  Don't tell anybody. Here. Isn't it illegal?  It's illegal to go through stop signs.  It's illegal to cross on the red. They're reaching right through Sam as if he doesn't exist.  As if he's a ghost. You're saying I don't have a chance.  That's what you're saying. That's what you said last time and look where he is now. Stop.  Rita's not saying I don't have a chance.  Are you?  Tell me I have a chance. Oh my God!  6:35 is Video Night at my house and I'm not even there! If we get there before you do we'll wait for you - check! Sam get your dessert to go. This is very hard to say.  I'm having my dessert here.  With Rita.  I'm not coming to video night. I said no, Rita. What?  Do you want me to go? Where? Fine. Fine. I've got it. It's good to chew.  You're eating more slowly. Coconut Rhubarb.  Sidebar, we need to talk.  Sidebar. I need to get Lucy back.  We need, we need - to be professional. When dealing with Starbucks' customers, be friendly but not familiar.  I can be your friend. You need to leave your husband. 'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend.' Well that's one way of looking at it. What are you doing here? I live here.  This is where I live. I wanted to be close to you.  I wanted to be closer.  Look at my apartment number. John was born on October 9th.  His son was born on October 9th. His mother lived at 9 Newcastle, Liverpool. Lucy, give me one minute with your father.  Sam, I consider myself an understanding person but I don't understand this.  You can't close the distance between you and Lucy with a new address.  We go to court in a week - I don't want to spend half my visit with Lucy on the bus getting to Lucy.  I don't want to waste one more minute. He's better, much better.  Now I'll have one box of mint chocolate cookies. Lucy Lucy.  What are you doing?!  You could have really hurt yourself.  What are you doing? No. She couldn't sleep. Give me my daugh - Give me - I'll take Lucy. Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three times, tell her two stories and give her half a Denny's blueberry muffin and a third of a glass of milk she'll sleep.  Good night. Lucy.  Come here. I made us a midnight snack. I understand that you want to see your daddy.  And I don't want to keep you from him.  I honestly don't.  So you tell me when you want to see him.  You can see him anytime you want.  But we have to arrange it first.  Do you understand? Now would you like a snack? Goodnight, Lucy. Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid. You worry you did the wrong thing? No no no.  I'm the lucky one.  I have the lawyer that never loses. Them first, then me.  They're a nice couple.  They have a nice house.  She's pretty.  She's smart, too.  I can tell.  The manager of the salad bar is gonna testify, isn't he?  That will help us. Nobody believed that George Harrison could really be a song writer.  But he wrote "Here Comes the Sun".  John and Paul said it was one of the best songs on ABBEY ROAD. Lucy's was Paul. What honey? She fell asleep on the car ride over.  I was gonna turn back and tuck her in to her bed...with the pink canopy...and the quilt I made...But I was afraid she'd wake up at our house... ...and want to come home. I was gonna tell the judge that I could give Lucy the kind of love she never had.  But I would be lying. I hope I hope I hope that you're saying what I think you're saying even though you're not saying it. Goodnight.  I'll see you in court.  Save me a seat...on your side. Randy!  If I tell you I can't do it alone, will you tell the judge? No. Promise? Promise... I've looked and looked for a mother for Lucy.  Help, I need someone, help, not just anyone.  You're the red in Lucy's painting. Penalty!  Rules broken.  Penalty, please! I saw that!  You gave him a secret signal!  Didn't you? Keep both eyes on the ball, Lucy - balls are round - on sale at Kmart.  The earth is a ball, too... Penalty!  Repeat!  Rules broken!  Penalty! Play ball!  Play ball!
