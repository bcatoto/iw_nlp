PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle Times. Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap. Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit. Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him. The PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red baron hat. Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of them.  Looks at Will. ELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN hosing down the side of the building. Ellie puffs up. The old man screws up his face, confused. Ellie, used to not being taken seriously.  Turns back to THE ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip.  Coming to a stop.  She hurries over as the door swings open and... WILL DORMER steps down.  Slipping on his sunglasses. Scanning the nothingness around him.  Spots the swinging sign. Hap, right behind him.  Rubs his neck. Limps from behind his desk and gives Will a shake and a slap on the back. Nyback shakes Hap's hand.  A reunion. Looks at Will.  Down at his boots. Will.  Looks at Nyback's gut. They LAUGH.  Eyes twinkling. He starts back over to his desk.  Notices Ellie still standing by the door.  Points to Will. Ellie straightens.  Smiles.  Looks over at Will. Ellie, realises they want to be alone. Will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack. Hap picks up a cheap trophy.  Reads the base. Nyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times.  The headline:  "Deeper Investigation into Special Branch"... Will and Hap share a look.  No more joking.  Hap folds over the paper. Nyback winces. Nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk. Hap tosses a glance over at Will. Nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the trash. A cloud passes over his face. Holds up a file.  The name written on the lip:  KAY CONNELL. They turn a corner and stop at a door.  Will glances up: MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over it. Nyback opens the door onto... The Inuit, FRED DUGGAR, snorts.  Takes his feet of the desk. Will puts out his hand. Fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache.  Stands. He heads off across the parking lot.  Will and Hap exchange a glance. PULL BACK to reveal Will, Hap, and the COUNTY CORONER standing by a stainless steel table.  The naked body of KAY CONNELL is laid out before them.  Fred hangs back. The coroner tugs at her surgical gloves.  She's in her late seventies. Will points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and breasts. The coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet. Will stays her hand. He pulls the sheet back down.  Studying the body of Kay Connell.  Starts walking slowly around the table.  In his element.  The faucet drips.  Drips.  Drips. He bends down to smell her hair. Takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers. Continues around the table.  Picks up one of her hands. Examines her fingers, her nails. Continues down around her feet.  Checks between her first and second toes. Will stands there.  Looking down at the body.  Slim.  Young. Beautiful.  Skin like marble. Will looks up and locks eyes with his partner. Rachel looks at him.  Goes to a small file box on the desk. He glances out the window.  It's as bright as day. Will SLAPS the magazine back. Hap opens the door.  A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS. He walks over to the big window.  It overlooks the harbor. Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance.  One lone TUGBOAT in the harbor towing a freighter. Will reaches into his suitcase.  Pulls out a shirt. Will throws him a look. Will goes back to his suitcase.  Hap follows.  A thin film of sweat on his upper lip. Will flares up.  Struck a nerve.  Turns to his partner. He grabs a hanger. He takes out a handkerchief.  Wipes his brow. Will turns on his partner, eyes burning. The partners, lock eyes.  Years of working together.  A thousand things unsaid.  Hap reaches for the door. He puts the bag on the dash.  Looks out the window. Nightmute's main street.  A line of shops.  Undistinguished Town Hall.  Elementary school up on a hill.  Sign out front: Sign-ups for Midnight Little League! He looks over.  Ellie's listening intently. Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with... On top of the bureau, a stack of photos.  A couple torn up. Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair.  Laughing. Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed.  A bell JINGLES when he shakes it.  Will crosses to a closet in the corner. Will pulls a dress out of the closet.  Small, black, elegant. The tag's been cut out.  He pulls out another, then another. Feels the fabric. Fred and Ellie exchange a look. Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table. Pulls out a pretty gold necklace.  Holds it up. He hands the dresses to Ellie.  Heads out of the room. The shoulder jerks away.  PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room.  Longish blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to grow a moustache. He takes out a cigarette.  It's bent.  He lights it.  Hap sits opposite. Randy throws him a look. Will goes over to a coffee machine.  Pours a cup. Randy flicks his ash.  Shrugs. Will turns with his coffee. Randy glares. Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the collar.  Nose to nose. Randy's lip curls.  Red-faced. Disgusted, Will shoves Randy back into his seat. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace from Kay's room.  Hands it to her. Ellie smiles, teasing. Will heads over to him.  Ellie watches his neck.  Her hand closing over the necklace. He puts down his menu.  Reaches for his drink. Will drains his drink.  Locks eyes with a big GUY over at the bar.  Beer froth on his moustache. Will looks back at his partner.  Hap's fidgeting with the end of his tie. A cold flash down Will's spine. Hap avoids his eyes. Just then, his cell phone RINGS. Ellie, Fred, and a couple other GUYS huddled around a desk. Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not.  Will reaches into the bag.  Pulls out two text books. He shoves the books towards one of the guys. He continues through the bag.  Pulls out a little plastic bag with "Hello Kittys" all over it.  Dumps out the contents. Looks up at Fred. Fred looks at him.  Not happy with make-up duty.  Will pulls out a hair brush.  Hands it to Ellie. Next, a couple worn paperbacks. He looks up at the group. Farrell straightens. Will tosses them to him. Down to the bottom of the bag.  A Ziploc with a half-eaten sandwich and an apple core.  Will hands them to Ellie. Upends the knapsack.  Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers. Fred reaches for the knapsack. Will takes it, walks slowly over to the window.  Thinking. Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the Will ignores the question.  Walks back towards them. He hands the bag to Farrell. Will pulls out a handkerchief.  Wipes the mud off his hands. Taking his time.  Finally turns to Fred. WILL lowers his binoculars.  He's standing on the black rocky beach.  It's damp, slick, and cold.  A fog's rolling in. Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks.  A couple paper bags and a megaphone.  They're comparing guns. Hap reaches into his holster.  Pulls out a... Fred Duggar's standing on the other side of them.  He's got a pair of binoculars, too.  They're staking out the cabin. Been there a while. Fred shoots Will a look.  Down at his cowboy boots.  Will gives him a smile. Fred goes back to scanning, pissed. Hap and Farrell chuckle.  Hap unscrews the thermos.  A cloud of steam. Will looks down at his partner.  Holding out the thermos like a weird kind of truce.  Will turns away, rejecting it.  A swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as... Fred tenses. Hap and Farrell scramble to their feet.  Will whips up his binoculars. POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - a FIGURE making its way to  the cabin.  Furtive. Will lowers the binoculars.  Snaps his fingers at the men. POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - the FIGURE, looking around, running towards the cabin.  Leaping from rock to rock. WILL reaches for his Smith and Wesson. The men jump into action.  Race down towards the cabin. Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks.  Will and Hap, harder going.  Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small crevices.  Rocks sticking out every which way.  The fog, thick and white... THE FIGURE disappears into the cabin. FRED AND FARRELL leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down. Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready... WILL rounds the boulder, Hap panting behind him.  Joins Fred and Farrell at the door. Will levels his Smith and Wesson at the door, and with a nod to Fred as he KICKS it in... They look around:  Nothing.  A few old nets, a wooden table rotted through.  No knapsack. In the corner, a TRAP DOOR, left open.  Will races over. Looks down into the darkness. Turns and points to Farrell. The men nod. They rush out the door and split directions.  Will crouches down by the trap door and... Farrell can't answer that. Farrell lifts his bloody hand.  Points off towards the water. Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind. Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few  seconds to listen, to adjust.  Heart POUNDING.  Blood  pumping.  Like an animal tracking its prey.  Leaps up onto a plateau of rocks when... CRACK!  Squeezes off a shot.  Misses!  Can't believe it. Goes for another... Nothing!  Jammed!  The figure, disappearing.  Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13... Fred emerges from the fog. CRACK! as another shot rips through the air.  Fred and Ellie freeze. The fog starts to dissipate.  They reach the water to see... Starts shaking the limp body.  Teeth clenched. Hap's head, rolls back.  Mouth agape.  Face white... Will, rips off his tie.  Presses it to the gaping wound... trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the water... Ellie watches.  Horrified.  Fred races over to the body. Feels for Hap's pulse. Will, shaking Hap again.  Jaw set.  Eyes intense.  Veins popping up along his temples.  Fred catches his shoulder. Will looks up at Fred.  His face contorts. Suddenly leaps to his feet.  Grabs a rock and hurls it savagely into the thick fog. Will sits opposite him.  Wet, dishevelled, dirty.  Hap's blood smeared all over his shirt.  Staring off into space. Will, hesitates. He blinks.  Looks down.  Swallows. Nyback sighs, shakes his head.  Reaches down to his bottom drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass. He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head. Stands.  Paces.  Rakes his hand through his hair. Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk. Everything CRASHES to the floor. Nyback looks up at him.  Calm. Will clenches his fists. Nyback gets up.  Limps over to his old friend. Just then there's a soft KNOCK on the door.  The men look over.  Ellie sticks her head in.  Speaks in a tone that belies that a man has recently died. Ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor.  At Will's back. Ellie looks at him.  Confused.  Lowers her voice. Ellie's shoulders droop.  Thought she was playing with the big boys.  Just then Will turns abruptly and grabs his coat. Nyback catches his arm. Will looks at him.  Know's he's right. It clicks off abruptly.  Rachel appears in the doorway. Takes in the blood on Will's shirt. He smiles faintly, turns to go.  Just then the phone RINGS. PAUSE.  A bemused VOICE on the other end. Will.  Not giving this asshole an inch.  Rachel, trying not to listen. Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist. Will turns from Rachel.  Eyes burning.  Voice steady. SLAM!  He hangs up the phone.  Runs his hand through his hair.  Turns back to Rachel. He gets tangled in it. Pulls it off and flings it in the corner. Will whirls around... ...nothing.  No one's there. Will stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows.  His suit pants are slightly wrinkled.  Nyback nods towards Fred. Fred, stroking his moustache, nods.  Nyback turns to Will. Will looks up.  Everyone's eyes turn to him.  He shakes his head. Feet shuffling.  Chairs scraping the floor as people get up. A sense of determination in the air.  Will grabs his coat. He looks down at the map.  Ellie watching his face. Hands her back the map.  Smiles.  Just then Fred walks up. He pulls on his coat and heads for the door.  Fred watches him leave.  Sticks a toothpick in his mouth. He pulls up a chair.  Nods to the paperback. Farrell bites into the candy bar. He stops chewing.  Realises the association.  Swallows uncomfortably. Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers.  Like a little boy.  Furrows his brow, trying to remember. Will sighs, rubs his eyes. Just then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup.  Pretty, freckled face.  Not much older than Kay Connell. Lonnie gives him the cup. Will looks up.  Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his mouth. CLICK!  Kepp takes the picture. Ellie furrows her brow.  Just then... FRANCIS appears.  Slips on a rock but catches his fall. PULL BACK to reveal a long line of PEOPLE stretched out across the road about a mile up the beach.  Some old, some young.  Linking arms and moving forward.  Looking down.  The Will turns.  A couple burly GUYS with some BLOODHOUNDS. Will points over to the woods on the other side of the road. Nods to Fred who's standing nearby.  He hands the guys two radios. Just then two young OFFICERS pull up in a squad car.  Young and apple-cheeked.  The first one holding a piece of paper. Hands the list to Will.  He glances it. The Officers nod, put the car in reverse.  Fred saunters over.  Nods towards the searchers. Will shakes his head. Fred shrugs, skeptical.  Just then, his cell phone BLEATS. He reaches for it. Will looks back at the search team.  Slow.  Meticulous. A local WOMAN.  At the end of the line.  Glances over her shoulder.  Looks at Will.  Smiles.  You'll help us catch him. Will turns back to him. Fred crosses his arms.  Sarcastic. He starts up the stairs.  Notices Rachel straining to return the key to the top of the clock.  Backtracks to help her. She gets it without his help. Rachel looks at him.  Can't figure this guy out.  Remembers something. A TINGLE skips down Will's spine.  He looks at her. Rachel thinks for a second.  Leaning against the clock. Ellie, sits up... Suddenly, he stops talking.  Slowly sits up.  Sensing  something.  Ellie, noticing the shift. Francis turns. Stops at an open doorway in time to see Will clears his throat.  Closes his cell phone. The coroner nods.  Goes to wash her hands. Shrugs off her lab coat.  She's wearing a blue dress.  Looks like a piano teacher.  Heads into an adjoining office. Will.  Alone.  Steps into the room.  The smell of formaldehyde.  Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray. Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape under the sheet when... SUDDENLY Hap's HAND drops down.  Thick fingers.  Wedding band. Will jumps... The coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila envelope.  Hap Eckhart written on it in black pen. Will rubs his face.  Tries to focus on the clipboard.  The coroner holds out the envelope.  Smiles. He takes the envelope.  The coroner peers up at him. He looks up.  Will standing before him, holding the manila envelope. Fred throws a look over his shoulder.  Opens the locker. INSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope.  The name on this one: Farrell Brooks. Fred reaches back for the other envelope.  Will, hesitant to give it to him.  Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom corner.  Hands it over.  Wipes his brow. Fred slides it in beside Farrell's.  Closes the locker door. Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye. Will looks at him.  At the key.  Plucks it from his hand. Just then Nyback's SECRETARY appears in the doorway. Nothing.  Someone's there but they're not saying anything. Will, too tired for this shit... Then...the VOICE.  A MAN's voice.  Not John Warfield's. This voice is medium-ranged.  Higher.  Nose sounds stuffed. Will straightens.  Something weird. A little TITTER on the other end. A PAUSE.  Will loosens his tie. The voice.  Dropping to a WHISPER. Will, furrows his brow. CHIEF NYBACK, exits his office.  Looks at Will and smiles. CLICK.  The line goes dead. Will, throat constricted.  Listening to the DIAL TONE. Smiles back at Nyback.  Turns.  Slowly hangs up the phone. White as a sheet.  Trying to act normal.  Trying to act calm. SOUND returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different. Looks over at Gets in and closes the door.  Puts his hand over the box. Ellie comes up to the window. He turns the ignition.  Pulls out with a SQUEAL.  Ellie steps back, watching him drive away.  More curious than stung. Will jumps.  Quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  Fred  Duggar standing behind him.  RICH by his side.  Will clears his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand.  Then Farrell's.  Angry. SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him.  Fred and Rich exchange a glance. Will, startled, looks down.  A LITTLE GIRL stands before him. Curly hair.  Glasses.  Holding up a bucket.  He shakes his head.  Looks back up at THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's casket. AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane.  Two GIRLS, look like sisters, holding each other up.  A MAN with a thick red beard.  A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with a pink ribbon... Will, looks away.  Then.  At the end of the line.  Something catches his eye. He starts off.  Ellie, looks back at Will. Ellie nods.  Catches up to Fred.  Will turns his attention back to RANDY AND THE GIRL.  Over at the far end of the  cemetery.  Standing next to Randy's motorcycle. They look over.  WILL walking towards them.  The wind whipping his jacket.  His tie.  Randy makes a face. Will arrives at the bike.  The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at him curiously.  Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost translucent.  Something sexy about her.  Has the carnation stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket. Randy kick starts the bike.  It dies.  He kicks it again. Calls out over his shoulder. Tanya hesitates.  Pulls a cigarette from her purse. Tanya shrugs.  Lights the cigarette.  Takes a drag. Tanya makes a face.  Reaches out and taps the hula-girl. The truck BEEPS.  Will goes faster.  Tanya takes her hand from Will's neck.  Holds on to her seat. Will goes even faster... Tanya steps back. He grabs her by the arm.  Jerks it up.  She CRIES out.  Will leans in. Tanya's eyes grow wide.  She looks around her.  Disgusting, rotten.  A SEAGULL pecking at the body of a dead bird.  She tries to break away... Tanya looks away. She struggles more.  No good.  Will's grip is like a vice. Tanya, squirming.  Angry. The dogs break.  Trot over to him.  Wolf down the treats. Will scans the place.  Small, cheap.  Matching sofa and easy chair, corduroy upholstery.  The walls, lined with old 1950s movie posters.  All second-rate detective movies:  "Another Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat." Will walks across the room.  Repulsed.  The pathetic hovel of  a killer.  Looks into the Will freezes. Will turns back to the window.  Looking furiously... Will lunges for the phone.  Snatches it up just as CLICK! the tape cuts off. Enraged, he PUNCHES the receiver through the wall. Holds out a one-page report. Will takes the report.  Heads over to the coffee machine. He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book.  Holds it up.  Otherwise Engaged.  In hardback. Will blinks. Will pours himself a cup of coffee.  Trying to keep the stream steady.  Ellie continues typing...CLACK...CLACK... CLACK...CLACK...CLACK...Will rubs his chin.  Looks back at the report.  Judicious. The CLACKING stops.  SILENCE.  Will turns around.  Ellie's staring right at him - that isn't like him. He turns back to Fred.  Beat. The CLACKING resumes. Will opens his eyes.  Trying to focus.  Looks up and sees, in the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus. Will struggles to his feet.  The OLD LADY who hit him, wearing overalls.  Reaches out. Will stands, wavering.  Flashes her his badge. Will looks over at her.  Shifts in his seat.  Ouch.  Feels like a couple cracked ribs.  Peers out the windshield at the TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them. Walter continues looking out the window.  That same stuffed- nose voice. The ferry pitches again.  Will grabs on to the railing. Looking down at this little man.  Hate in his eyes. Walter reaches up to blow his nose.  Will's eyes look on in disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  From beating Kay Connell to death. He points to his hearing-aid. The ferry's engine HUMS to a stop.  Walter smiles. He points off to the horizon. Will's lip curls.  Watching him. SUDDENLY Will lunges at him.  Walter's eyes widen in surprise as he grabs him up by the collar.  Nose to nose.  Will barely keeping control. Walter flounders. His jaws tense, nostrils flare.  Walter, red-faced, sputtering... Will clenches his teeth. Just then a SHRIEK.  Will looks over A COUPLE KIDS.  Further down the glacier.  Having a snowball fight. Will looks back at Walter.  Has to take it easy.  Shoves him away in disgust.  Walter falls down onto the snow.  Dislodges   his hearing aid. Watches Will pace.  Head throbbing.  Ribs, screaming in pain. Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  Puts it back around his ear. Gets up.  Brushes the snow from his butt.  Checks something in his pocket. Walter turns back to him. Walter shrugs. Will stops short.  Eyes burning.  It's all he can do not to throttle this weed. Walter looks at him.  Scratches his head. He takes out a handkerchief.  Blows his nose. Will stares at him. Will runs his hands through his hair.  Half-crazed.  Heart pounding.  Turns to watch... THE KIDS down the glacier.  Making angels in the snow.  Their GIGGLES carried along by the wind. Will, squeezes his eyes shut.  Trapped.  About to defy every instinct in his body. Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid. Walter smiles.  Pleased. Walter rubs his hands together.  Thinking. JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.  Low and loud.  Walter looks down at it. He starts down.  Will watches him pass, has no choice but to follow.  Walter, going over the details in his head. Snaps his fingers.  An idea. Will nods.  Walter smiles.  Spreads out his hands. TOURISTS.  Boarding the ferry. Walter heads over to the ramp.  Will stops, grabbing his side.  A PANG through his ribs.  Excruciating.  Calls out to Walter. Walter looks back.  Waves. Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER.  Gets on.  Walks back to the stern.  Looks out at Will.  The HORN sounds again. Walter, at the rail.  Smiles.  The ferry's engine, churning up water.  Starting forward just as... Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.  Holds it up for Will to see. Will, on shore, sees it.  A cold flash ripping through his  body.  That motherfucker.  Bolts through some tourists towards the ramp but... A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.  The Ticket Taker, grabs his arm. Will, jerks his arm away.  Stares off at the ferry.  Walter Byrd and his tape recorder.  Receding into the distance. Ellie grabs her bag.  Joins him.  They start walking. He signs.  Hands it back to her.  She slips it into her bag. A slight stutter in Will's step. Turns and starts up the steps. Ellie, watches him for a second.  Then calls out. Interrupted by a CLICK... Walter Byrd's voice.  Recorded from that afternoon. Will, hears his own voice... Then, another clumsy CLICK.  Walter Byrd gets on. He hangs up. Will SLAMS down the receiver.  Then again.  And again.  Yanks the cord out of the wall and HURLS the phone across the room. His body, drenched in sweat.  His breathing, quick and ragged.  Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed.  Looks across the room and sees He smiles.  Sympathetic.  Looks over at the window just as... The BLANKET.  Drops to the floor.   LIGHT floods the room. He heads back over to the window.  Rachel now notices all the stuff piled up.  Softens her voice. Rachel walks up behind him.  His cramming, more desperate. More urgent. Rachel reaches out.  Catches his arm. Will tenses his jaw.  Rachel, listens in horror. Rachel reaches for Will's hand.  Squeezes it. He pauses. Rachel looks at him.  Goose pimples on her arms.  Realising the weight of the confession. He sits up.  Abrupt.  Wincing from the pain in his ribs. Rests his arms on his knees. Rachel rubs his shoulder. There's a PAUSE.  Rachel, studying Will's back.  The cuts. The bruises.  Not sure how to answer. Walter smiles modestly.  Looks over at Ellie. Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged.  He holds it up.  Opened to the signature. Will, from over by the window.  Interrupts. Walter looks over.  Wide-eyed. Will turns.  Accusatory. Walter blinks. Fred shoots Will a look.  Ellie, watching him. Will heads over to Walter's chair.  Fists clenched in his pockets. He turns to Fred and Ellie. Fred stops Will with a look.  Had enough. Tense BEAT.  Will stares at Walter.  Revulsion.  Heads back over to the window. Fred, sits up. Walter hesitates.  Takes a sip of coffee. Walter furrows his brow.  Taps his hearing aid. Ellie's eyes widen.  Fred glances at Will.  But Will's too busy watching this little man weave his web. Walter looks right at her. Fred stands.  This is big.  Calls out the door. Walter takes a sip of his coffee.  Cup's empty.  Holds it out to Ellie.  Smiles. Ellie nods, takes the cup.  Heads over to the coffee machine. Fred turns back to the door... AND AT THAT MOMENT Walter levels a look right at Will. Mouths the words Wild Card. A shiver down Will's spine.  Wild card.  The gun.  Randy. Will hears some SCUFFLING.  The sheet being pulled down.  The CLATTER of tools. Parts pulled off the shelves.  The bike, shoved to the side. Then.  A SILENCE.  Followed by... Will shuts his eyes.  Heavy FOOTSTEPS head over to the bike. Someone's pulled the gun from the can. Fred's voice, calm. More FOOTSTEPS.  Randy, desperate. Will opens his eyes.  Fred's voice.  Almost sympathetic. More SCUFFLING.  A chair knocked over.  Something SMASHES. Will looks down at the floor as FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams. Fred grabs Randy's shoulder. Randy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost kid.  Tears streaming down his face. Will shifts his eyes to him. Fred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car. Will barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on. Fred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him. Takes it. PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting at a small, round table.  Fred's passing out the beers.  Dive bar.  MUSIC blaring.  3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall. Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN. Rich takes a glass from Fred. Fred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell. Farrell shifts in his seat. Will nods.  Jostled by the crowd.  Reaches for his beer. He and Francis GUFFAW. Farrell looks over at Will. Will slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke. Fred pats Will's shoulder. Francis grabs a handful of peanuts. Will turns to Fred.  Wiping the foam from his moustache. Ellie reaches into her vest pocket.  Pulls out a Ziploc with the SHELL CASING inside. Ellie brushes off the shells.  Looks right at Will. The guys don't protest.  Will starts heading for the bar. Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  Smoke. MUSIC.  Laughter.  Arguing.  A mass of bodies and sound. Like being swallowed up in a black hole... Looks back at the table. Ellie appears at the top of the stairs. Will enters the monument. A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument. Will's eyes pierce into him. Will holds out his hand. Walter looks at the open hand.  Hugs his jacket to him. Will breaks.  Rushes Walter.  Slams him against one of the concrete pilasters. Another wave CRASHES.  Sprays them.  Walter looks up into Will's bloodshot eyes. Will tightens his grip. He holds up the tape.  Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the side.  Yanks the tape out of the cassette.  Steps back and HURLS it into the sea.  Waves engulf it hungrily. Walter watches him. Steps closer to him.  Beseeching. A couple RAVENS alight nearby.  Flapping their wings. SCREECHING into the wind. A dark shadow crosses his face.  Holds on to the coiled rope of the statue.  Will hisses. Walter.  Squeezing the bronze rope. Locks eyes with Will.  Conspiratorial. WILL'S HAND shoots out.  Clamps around Walter's neck. Walter's face, starts turning red. Will looks deep into Walter's eyes.  Squeezing harder.  Pure hatred. Their eyes, locked.  Veins, popping along Walter's temples. Lip quivering... JUST THEN a BELL sounds in the distance.  Will looks up. A LINE OF FISHING BOATS coming back in. Will, looks back at Walter.  Throws him to the ground. Sickened. Walter COUGHS.  Holding his neck.  Enjoying this. Will shoots him a look. He pulls himself to his feet.  A little unsteady.  Takes out a handkerchief.  Dabs his forehead. He shrugs.  Walks past Will. Will turns.  Watches him walk away.  Walter hesitates.  Turns back. Will looks at him.  Back straightening. Will's stomach jumps.  Walter turns back.  Continues on. The little man in a beige windbreaker. PULL BACK to reveal Chief Nyback sitting at his desk.  Will stands before him.  Signing papers.  A bottle of bourbon on the desk.  Some paper cups half filled. Will checks his watch. Fred, standing over by the filing cabinet.  Toothpick in his mouth. Nyback chuckles. Will shakes his head. Looks over at Fred picking his teeth. Will caps the pen.  Uncomfortable.  Nods towards Fred. JUST THEN the door swings open.  They look over as ELLIE hurries in.  She smiles.  Looks tired. Will whips around. WALTER standing there.  At the other end of the hallway. Shoulders slumped. Will shakes his head. FLIES, bouncing against the screen door. Walter looks around. Walter looks at him. Will takes a step forward... Slowly reaches into his jacket... Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON.  Walter.  Looks at the gun. Inches back. SUDDENLY, darts out of sight.  Swings back into the doorway with a SHOTGUN... BAM!  Will's shoulder explodes with blood. WILL'S HAND suddenly shoots out.  Grabs the shotgun barrel. WALTER stumbles back.  The shotgun goes off.  BAM!  Chunks of ceiling rain down.  Walter falls to the ground. Nothing.  Walter continues staring out the window.  Will raises his voice. Walter jumps, whips around.  Comes face to face with the  barrel of Will Dormer's gun.  Surprised.  Absently touches his deaf ear. Walter looks at Will's 45. The men LOCK EYES.  Wind HOWLING through the boathouse. Killer and Detective.  Only a bullet separating them. WALTER suddenly jerks up his shotgun... BANG!  He stumbles back.  Hit in the gut. Will's Smith and Wesson, smoking.  No longer jammed. Walter, touches the blood.  Looks back at Will.  Staggering. CRACK!  The rotting floor gives way beneath him.  He CRIES out, falls.  Drops into the icy water below. SILENCE.  Will steps over to the hole.  Looks down at Ellie kneels down next to him.  Pulls over her vest.  Covers him. Ellie, tearing off her boot.  Yanks off her sock. Ellie, wraps the sock around his leg.  Starts twisting.  Will grimaces.  Ellie swallows.  Doesn't want to ask this. A pained looks crosses Ellie's face. His blood, pumping out in rivulets.  Ellie looks down at him.  Her hero.  Moves up to the wound in his arm. His eyelids, growing heavy. Ellie blinks away the tears.  Knows what he means.  What he wants.  Watches as the calm spreads over him. Will closes his eyes.
