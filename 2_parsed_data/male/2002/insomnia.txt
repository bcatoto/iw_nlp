Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's. Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours. That's all, for now. Too bad... It's only gonna make you crazy. Will, you can't blame yourself. About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot? Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here. What's the D.A. got them on? Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it. What's that, then?We'll get the other one, though. Oh, you know. Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through. What I saw? We just gotta catch the bastard, right? I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better. Take him fishing or something. Sorry about...This is a local writer. Kay had all his books. I think we should check it out. Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house. It's signed. Personally. One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack. And something else that might interest you. I beeped you over two hours ago. Forget your pager? I'll call him now. Dormer. Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell. What are you doing here? I'll stick it in the evidence locker... Has her books in it. Randy Stetz. Her boyfriend. We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything. Around twelve-thirty. She left the party early. Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out. Like I said, no. We know about those things up here. No. Are you sure about that? Randy Stetz? How do you mean? Did she? What happened at that signing? Where you signed this?You don't have to be involved, Will. I'm thinking I could get off with probation. Keep half my pension. That's all I want. I wish I could stick it out like you. I just, with Trish and the kids... Will? What are we thinking? Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's what Flynn's doing... Maybe not. We could talk to Buck... You know I remember that. Well, I gotta tell you. With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard. But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>. On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it. Dammit, Will. Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday. <i>Five</i> hours. Asking all kinds of questions... To do nothing. When's that, a week? Two weeks?... We have to figure out a plan of action now. You know what about. Even the best make mistakes. I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force." Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years. They're turning it into a witch hunt. Something on the news about it practically every night. Eight years.Thought I smelled something. She didn't tell me. I don't know. Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions... How should I know?... I told you I don't remember. Just stuff. I don't fucking remember. Stuff. I don't know what you're fucking talking about. She loved me. She wanted to see me every night. Huh? Huh?She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night. Bruises all over her back, her upper arms. I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it. Wanted to keep it a secret. That's right. That boyfriend. Randy. She wasn't happy. I was someone to talk to. Yes. Not that much at first. But then she became more comfortable. Started visiting me every week... She flattered me about my writing. Asked if she could visit me. To talk about my books. That's right. Wild card. You're not following procedure. Where's your back-up? If you want it to be... Yes. Like that. It was when I went to kiss her. She started laughing. I got angry. After all I'd given her. All I'd shared with her. I just wanted to make her stop. That's all. I didn't want to kill her, Will. Then so was mine... Kay told me. She comes to me, you know. Tells me things. About you. About me. But we work so well together... I thought maybe we could talk some more. Told you I could write an ending. He. Well, he... I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have. Yes. Yes. I was a mentor to her. No. I suppose. She was only seventeen. Down at the station? Thought you might find that. Oh? I'm sorry? No game.I have to get back. I had him! And then I lost him. In the fog. That's I.A.'s pit bull. Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft. So far. Nice kid. Just after Leland Street. What about your shoulder? No. But I covered it up. I lied. Byrd's dead. Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell. Her things are in the house. It's legitimate. Not really. Duggar called him? I don't remember. Then change it. I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records. It's okay. Happened a long time ago. He was killed in a fire. In New Mexico. She your only sibling? Who's playing? I could say the same thing about you. Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet. We can get it in by the morning editions. This murder was in the papers, right? Good. He's up next. Who's that? Do it again. I want you to check this out, Ellie. Typical seventeen year-old. She went to a party Friday night? It's all about the small stuff. Small lies. Small mistakes. Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case. It's human nature. Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap. Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality. You did your homework, Officer. My partner... Right. Got lost in the rocks. Anything. It's important. That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell. He would have liked that. Thanks. Where is he? So? That's right. No. Good. What? First I need a copy of the key. I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now. You get the search party together. No fewer than thirty people. I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes. Don't waste any time. I told her to come. No. We're sure it's hers? Who was the last one to see her alive? What time was that? No fibers, skin flakes, hairs... You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not... Goddammit, Hap. Think about what you're doing... Don't do this, Hap... Looks like the natives are restless. Well her mother didn't buy them for her. Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap! We are nothing like Mike Flynn. We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did. And every bastard like him. We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk. Every last one. And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen. No deals. No compromises. No discussions. No way. One word to I.A. and he walks. Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat. You remember that? We say nothing. It goes away. Simple as that. He's just rattling your cage. He's asking everybody questions. That's right. You know my plan of action. We'll talk when we get back to Seattle. What do you want to talk about? He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks. They're all over everybody. Seven years. We're under investigation now. Back in Seattle. Hap wanted to talk. As soon as we got back. Thought he could work out some kind of deal. There've been other cases. Where we've changed results. Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence. But Dobbs. I wanted Dobbs more than anything. Me and Hap. A year and a half ago. I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty. Smug, cold. Dead eyes. We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it. Nothing concrete. Went over every inch of that apartment. What is it? What did he look like? I'm not expecting anyone. Fred Duggar? Habit. I'm always all business. Good to see you, too, Randy. You don't know. Ran like hell to go to him... After that she left the party to go to him. The other guy? What kind of stuff? Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about? But she was seeing someone else on the side. You heard me that time. "She was nice." Wow. That makes me all soft inside. Ever occur to you she didn't love you back? Kay Connell. Did you love her? Did you love her? What was it? Who? Who? What was? But you were such good <i>friends...</i> You don't know. Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz? Told each other everything. That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau? You and Kay were like sisters? Thought you wanted something fun... You want me to take you somewhere? Must be tough for you. What happened. That's a long time. Best friend? You're not missing much. Drop the gun, Walter. Procedure went out the window a long time ago. No back-up. This an accident, Walter? Couldn't get it up, Walter? Don't you pull that shit with me. I told you that was an accident! What the hell do you know? There's nothing more to talk about. Congratulations. Randy Stetz is in jail. What about him? Doesn't sound like a mentor to me. Expensive dresses. A heart necklace. You gave her gifts. But you wanted to. Did you have sex with her? But she was an attractive girl. Yes down at the station. You're going to be brought in for questioning. Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books. I said you're going to get a phone call. The phone call. The knapsack.
