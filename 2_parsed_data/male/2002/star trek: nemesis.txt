Indefinitely. No. I must deactivate you. Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship? Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation? I know. You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship. Because you are dangerous. No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines. Is that your final answer? Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel? Can you remember our father? Do you know where you are? No. My name is Data... I am your brother. Do you know who I am? Yes, please continue. Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you? Sir. Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here. We are being hailed. Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine. We are losing dorsal shields. Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications. We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it. I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon. No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me. He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman. I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual. Of you? At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes. Ready, Captain. Do you think this is a wise course of action? Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals. Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive? They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and... There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location. Yes, sir. Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise. It would appear so. Aye, sir... This way. He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels. My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation. Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage. Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing. Sorry, sir. He is very observant. The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline. The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir. To new worlds... If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you." The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving. That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge. And this makes you "sad"? And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan? Sir. I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously. To happy endings. Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle. This is not an appropriate time for a conversation. You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me. What is our approximate distance? We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten. I am not. But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions. No, I do not mind. Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions. What purpose does this serve? Yes. I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual. Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities. At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state. Do you have a name, sir? Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development. I thought only me, myself and Lore. Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III. Thank you. I would like to pick you up now. May I do that? The resemblance is... striking. Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources. It appears to be... ... an arm.Emergency force fields are holding. Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope. It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics? It seems to be a redundant memory port. Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload? Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is. An individual more like you, you mean. He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that? I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download. Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment. The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I�d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data . Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning . How many of you did Dr. Soong make? I'll take care of it, sir. Sir, we're being hailed. Aye, sir. Sir, we won�t be able to bring you back. It�s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter... The targeting sequence should take about four minutes. Ready, sir! Aye, sir. Sir? What's he doing? He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent. It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet. Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain. There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs. That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material. It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship. Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it. I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface. Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan. It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.Why? Why? You have a red shirt. You do not look like me. Why am I looking at me?Not tonight, I have work here. Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know... How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything. To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran�s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket. I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there. How long does he have? Dying? But the Romulans abandoned the plan. Can you describe it, Deanna? I wish I could believe that, Doctor. Yes. I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace. He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning. Remember him? Beverly, come in. Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options. I think a skin cell�s the more likely of the two. When was he... created? Please, Beverly, this is hard enough. I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole� me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don�t show up for my physical on time! Negative. Deanna, stand by. Open a channel. Divert power and compensate. Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers! Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers! It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography? How can you be sure? He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him. Yes. "For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror. How long until we reach the fleet? Fire! We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark. Well then... only one way to go. Can you open the shuttlebay doors? What do you imagine this is? While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open! Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander. We'll find a way off together. Recommendations? It'll only work for one of us. A weapon. A bit less florid, Data. Good work. The download? On my way. Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed. Data! I can see that. Mister Worf, accompany Data please. Thank you, Data. Let's see what she can do. New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds... Now, you make a toast. You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own. Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer... Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them. Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical... I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time. So... To happy endings. This isn't about me anymore. Make it so. Counselor? I know how he thinks. Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults. I need you at my side. Now more than ever I... I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me! How could I not? Is he sincere about wanting peace? I'm going to miss you. As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment. You're speaking of emotional investment? Of course, sit down. Counselor. May I have this dance? The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed. The least I could do for you, Deanna. Besides, you know me... I�m a talking head. Thank you, Commander. Open a channel. Understood. Do you have life support? When this is over, I owe you a drink. Your timing is impeccable, Commander. Number One. You have the bridge. Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors. On screen. You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar. Now, Mister La Forge. That's an order, Commander. Prepare for a site-to-site transport. How long until he can fire? Deanna, on my mark. Geordi, put 211 power to the engines. Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me. We�ve got him! He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do. He wants to look me in the eye. What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack? And that's exactly what he's going to do. As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties. I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical. Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready. What programs were accessed? Cannon fodder. What do we know about the population? Theories? What do we know about the planet? Just lucky, Admiral. Not with the Romulans. Understood. New Praetor? With or without the rest of the fleet? Admiral Janeway. Good to see you. There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species. That will never happen. What are you doing to Counsellor Troi? Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to... What's this? On my way. Please notify Commander Riker. Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts. On screen. Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes. Who was it? On screen. Tactical analysis, Mister Worf. No! Not yet, Mister Worf. If you don't mind. What sort of signature? Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of? Won�t do what, Mister Worf? The honor was mine. Captain Riker. When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him. I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice? The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her. Agreed. Counselor Troi, report to the bridge. Report. We can only hope so. And the Romulans invade. His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth. Can anything be done for him? Away team. Transporter room four. She's a predator. Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait. Counselor? It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy. A coup d'etat? Acknowledged ... ...I'll talk to Data. Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you. I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo. Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you�ll excuse me. I�ll be in the gym. I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare. Still well on our side... I am. You can still make a choice! Make the right one now! Please. But you want to. So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that? The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that! I see more than what you are. Not so long. I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be. Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are. You know that's not possible. And what of the Enterprise? Why are you here? We are. I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you. Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons? If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation. I won't defend my life to you. I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is. You're not Reman. What's this all about? All of this so you could capture me? What are you doing? Why am I here? In time. If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned. Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you. With a full head of hair. So I'm not as tall as you expected? After you, Praetor. New worlds. Yes. No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth. It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life... There's so much, and so much of it is dull... And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions. I have no reason to. You're doing this to liberate the Remans? How did you end up on Remus? Yes. The eyes have it. Not quite. I envy the hair- line. You'll acquire a taste for it. What happened? You know I need to verify this. We need to talk, just you and I. You know I do. Yes. Yes. And the Senate supports you? I would be interested to know what we are talking about. Praetor Shinzon. We�re not here to discuss your lack of a social life. Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now. Praetor? And you're not as we imagined you. Praetor Shinzon?But, Praetor, you won't survive without him... What about Picard? Disruptors are off-line, sir. Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan! Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.Serving with you has been an honor. I intend to. Anything. But she's not the Enterprise. She's the most beautiful ship I�ve ever seen. Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark. He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock. Strength in numbers? Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled. Sir? He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span. Not very chatty. She's not out for a pleasure cruise. Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are. It's working. Why don't they answer our hails? The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him. We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators. Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command. Sir -- Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you -- Thank you, sir... Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone. Let's go. Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived. Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online. My God... Runs in the family. So they�ve got him up and running. Well, that sounds relaxing too.I can feel your desire, Deanna. Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic. To leave all of this behind and be with me. I'll always be with you now. Now and forever. Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins? He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you. Imzadi. This is so good. Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful. Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die? I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc. I have no choices! I can't fight what I am! It�s too late. That's your life... not mine. I don't know. Yes. He is what his life has made him! Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now. Long ago. I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world. I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed. To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship. It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me. You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone. I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself. It amazes me how little you know yourself. Oh, but it does. We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest. My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma? I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be. And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see? Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured? It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who... Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe I�ll snap its ugly head off. Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ... You may go. I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. I was lonely... Hello, Jean Luc. In time, Jean Luc. I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence. I know. There is that. I always hoped I would hit two meters. Age before rank, Jean Luc. And you dreamed about what was up there. About... Looking up at the stars. Were we always explorers? I want to know where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past. All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you. Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you�d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would. You don't trust me. No race should be a slave to another. For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals. They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was... I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew. Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident. A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes. It's not quite the face you remember. Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it. As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that. And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan. I know. Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us. No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain? Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels. But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me. And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?. Right now, you�re thinking this all sounds too good to be true? I have dissolved the Senate. I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas. Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace. Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. There's so much we have to talk about. On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere. I am, Commander Riker... May I touch your hair? I've never met a human woman. No? I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light. Our greater goal is more important, brother. Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth. Target disruptors. Destroy them. Report! On my way. What is it?!! Focus on your job!! FULL STOP AND FIRE ! You heard me. Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop. How long until we reach the Rift? How long? Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.' Do as I tell you! Find her again. My time. I'll spend it how I choose. He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor. Are we prepared? And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect! Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you? I thought we discussed patience, Commander. The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space. Now go. I have some personal business. You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard�s whip and you'll soon understand patience. Silence, Romulan! I have a purpose. You don't have to understand. I came this far alone ... The Scimitar will serve my needs. None. It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath. And? Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet?For the moment. And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while-- Praetor. Then perhaps you will enlight- en us? And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve? Then I don't understand the reason for the delay! But surely... Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you. How many Warbirds will you need? They will obey, Praetor. They're holding position.I look forward to the sport. Take him. It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest. Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly... I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours. So, human... you've met your better self! I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates. Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar. She is here. Praetor... What?! Seven minutes. A matter of hours now. It's accelerating. You have no more time for games. No -- this is wasting time. The bond is broken. Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out. This is a mistake. Yes, Praetor.If you wouldn't mind. No. It's you. Why is it moving? Your new chair, sir. Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock. Aye, sir. Sir, we're being hailed. Aye, sir Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer. We're being hailed. Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields. Captain! Sir, I recommend we raise shields. To find the head, sir? I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system. Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked. I won't do it. Intruder alert! We're being hailed. Minimal damage to the Scimitar. Should I raise shields? He's a very unusual android. It is... invigorating.
