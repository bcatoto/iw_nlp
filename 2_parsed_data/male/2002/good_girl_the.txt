Hey, Justine. Can I talk to you for  a second?  I was just curious. Have you ever been  to a Bible study?  We got a good one going on every Wednesday  at the First Church of Nazarine. Rodney  comes, Benita comes. You got any interest  in reading the Bible?  We don't preach fire and brimstone.  Just the Ten Commandments. We’re not  interested in scaring people. We’re  about loving Jesus.  Well, maybe you'll have nights of eternal  hellfire to yourself. Just kidding you.  Drive safe.  Hey, Justine.  Hey, Teeny. How was your day?  The wind was flipping paint in our eyes.  Paint stings. Feel like I've been attacked  by hornets in my eyeballs.  Why?  ...including this gorgeous eggplant...  I think we got most of it out.  Like what?  It's the wind doing that. They the wind's  coming in different lately.  Catcher in the Rye’ I'm named after  it.  Holden. After Holden Caulfield. He's  the main character.  He's put upon by society. Hypocrisy  of the world.  I'm a writer.  Novels, plays, screenplays, stories,  poetry.  Oh, he has a nervous breakdown. Goes  to a mental hospital.  You could make paint where, at different  angles, the house is different colours.  You stand at the front door and the  house is red. You stand at the street  and the house is green. Or you could  make, like, an invisible paint. Make  the whole house disappear.  What would be really neat is a paint  that could change the molecular structure  of a house, like a chemical acid deal.  What do you think, Teeny?  That oneright there.  No.  Excuse me?  Oh, I'm not buying anything today.  I didn't bring my purse.  That makes two of us.  Maybe you're a maniac.  Twenty two.  How old are you?  I don't know.  How long you been workin' here for?  Oh, I live right down the street.  You wanna come in?  Well, I'm not gonna beg ya.  I'll be in my room.  It's my slave name. Holden's what I  call myself. This is my room.  They're okay. They don't get me. I mean,  they're alright.  Since when do you have a husband?  What's he paint?  Um, I had to drop out. I had a problem  with drinkin' and stuff. I'll go back.  I just gotta prove to my parents that  I can fly staright. You go to college?  Teeny, you're pretty. Bubba, isn't Teeny  pretty?  I've seen better, I've seen worse. Nah.  That's why I ain't never married. You  got yourself the best fish in the sea.  I wonder what it'd be like to be a woman.  All that smooth skin and long hair.  If I was a woman, I'd be a slut. A lesbian  slut.  Lowers it to where?  I twisted up my ankle on the stairs.  I was wonderin', maybe you could give  me a ride home?  Alright I'll talk to you about it later.  Well I'm not a pagen but thanks all  the same.  My, uh, left.  Okay.  You said he was a pig.  I was thinking about what you were sayin'  about my sperm bein' low. I mean, I  know I got good sperm. It's baby-makin  sperm. I suppose it couldn't hurt to  have it confirmed by an expert.  What the hell?  This is for you Justine. It's from Holden.  He's got the day off. He came by this  morning with it.  Don't mention it. Hey, Gwen.  Dear Justine. Because of you I'll be  quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last  two days have been the most god-awful  days of my life. I've not been able  to get rid of you in my head. I never  wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted  many things. I'd given up long ago on  being gotten by someone else, and then  you came along. The idea of being gotten,  because of circumstance, will never  get got is the worst feeling I've ever  felt, and I have felt many bad feelings.  I'm sorry I can never see you again,  Justine, forgive me for being so weak,  but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden  Wurther. If for some reason, you could  change your mind and want to be with  me, body and soul, meet me after work.  I will be waiting for you at five PM  outside Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not  there at five, you will never see me  in your lifetime.  Justine? Justine what's goin' on in  here? Gwen, you sick? We gotta get her  to a hospital. Justine you drive her.  It's aquarter to five. Why, you gotta  be somewhere?  Hey. Oh god, I'm really glad you came.  Oh god, thank god.  Let's go to my house.  Let's just park somewhere.  Look. I don't know. I don't care I just  wanna hold you.  That's fourty five dollars even. And  I need you to fill this out for me.  We'll be back here before you know it.  Justine. I'm yours. I'm all yours.  Hey.  Were you been?  Did she sick up on you?  Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles)  Justine? What happened to you?  I went down to St. Catherine's to check  up on Gwen. I looked all over for you,  she was askin' for you.  She was heavin' up until there was nothin'  left to heave. Doctor said she must've  eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite  in it or somethin'.  They're gonna keep her in there until  she gets better so you're gonna have  to supervise cosmetics.  Who cares, I don't care. I crave you.  I wanna know everything about you. Who  are you?  I wanna knock open your head and see  what's inside. I've had so much pain  in my life. I know you have too, I can  see it.  I just wanna leave some kind of legacy.  Somethin' great. After that I don't  care what happens to me.  I would.  Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious.  And dark and twisted.  Yes, you are.  I don't know.  I won't let him hurt you.  You can't worry about somethin' that  hasn't even happened yet.  Okay. (leans in to kiss her; she pulls  away)  Justine! Poor lady. She just passed.  Gwen! She just passed away.  It got worse. She was on life support  all day.  It's God's will, Justine. No one can  understand it. It was just Gwen's time  to fly away home.  What? Are you kiddin? What for?  You okay?  Paintin' on Bovery. Why?  We knocked off early 'bout four. Bubba  had a date with a stewardess, why?  Don't say that, Teeny. 'Course you were.  'Course you were.  Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack  Fields, your store manager. Before we  open today, I just want to share some  terrible and shocking news. One of our  best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday.  Gwen was a real class act. She had a  good attitude, she had ideas. We're  all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y'all  need to collect you thoughts and remember  Gwen. GWEN, then today's the day. You'll  be excused from work and we'll just  have to do without you. Gwen, this one's  for you.  Makin' one out of two.  Justine, will you leave him?  Away. With you on my arm, my folks'll  think I've changed. They'll stop thinkin'  I'm suck a loner, I got a girlfriend,  a pretty one, who knows me and likes  me. And they'll be so happy, they'll  give me money to write my novel.  We'll be like... Catcher in the Rye.  Only by me. I'll be immortal and then  like JD Salinger I'll just vanish.  Hey, Teeny. We've been up to no good.  We got the day off on account of the  rain.  So I heard about your friend bein' dead,  and all. I'm sorry.  Well, at least you were with her when  she went. (intense voice and look) Ain't  that right? You were... with her, when  she went?  Oh, I wish it would rain every day from  here on out. Never have to paint again.  Hey Justine. How you holding up?  Real shocker. I decided to move Cheryl  over to cosmetics. She got a little  too creative on the P.A. Maybe she'll  watch her P's and Q's over here. If  not she's out on her but. Now you listen  to Justine, sister.  You want me to help you get stuff out  of storage?  Well, are you gonna give me a ride home?  My ankle's actin' up.  Forget it.  Well, can't we go to the motel?  Well, let's go in the store room.  Tomorrow night at eight. We'd love to  have ya.  'Course! A couple that prays together  stays together.  What's this?  Not very light is it?  I heard it was the couple that lays  together stays together.  Wait, you gonna do my hair?  No.  I completely didn't remember...  Workin' on your spiritual life?  Ain't that a hoot and a holler.  I saw you, Justine.  I saw you. We got some things to talk  about, you and me. You come by my place  after work. If you knwo what's good  for ya.  Hey. Where's Bubba?  Well, I'm ready. Let's go.  I don't know what to say about Jesus.  I'm stoned.  Jeez. We forgot the Bibles, Justine.  Hi. Welcome. Hey there people! Glad  you could make it!  Y'all are in for a treat. We got a good  discussion going tonight. If man is  made in God's image, what does that  say about God?  Yeah, that sounds like a good one.  What?  What's goin' on?  What the hell?  Why not?  Justine, this is embarassing. We're  runnin' away from Bible study like a  couple of Devil worshippers.  You are freakin' me out, man. Why?  You just said a few minutes ago they'll  forgive us.  I'm never goin' back to Bible study  again.  I think I look too white, don't you  think?  I think I look kinda wierd.  Oh.  Well, you're the professoinal.  Justine, what happened to you? I looked  up and I saw you two drivin' off like  vampires in the night.  You coulda looked off your neighbor.  It's a church, you know. You can't make  water without bumpin' your nut on a  bible.  (looks at the customer) What in blazes?!  Do you like it?  What?  I thought you said we'd go today.  What came up?  I'm starting to wonder if you even want  to go. I'm startin' to think you don't  get me.  You do, you do get me you just don't  want to me 'cause I'm too intensified  for you! Justine, who cares, who cares  if someone finds out. We don't have  to live like this, Justine. I know what  it's like to go home every night and  feel like you're hidin' out. We can  leave all this behind...  You just, you just gonna give up?! You  gonna go crawlin' back?!  You're so fucking afraid it makes me  sick. Don't give up on us.  Okay. Good luck on your important thing.  Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner!  Back in your corner! Back in your corner,  Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'.  Sit. (Yells at dog again) I'm in shock.  You know why.  But don't you see? This is my chance,  for liberation.  I'm gonna have to tell Phil then.  He's my best friend. I can't keep him  in the dark about somethin' this big.  He's a cuckhold.  Well that's different. That isn't about  him. That's about my salvation. Look,  you've got your choice to make. Either  destroy your marriage, and break your  husband's heart. Or have sex with me  right now.  You're paranoid.  Phil is never gonna find out about any  of this. Don't fret. (the dog is still  barking)  You're lookin' at a free man, Justine.  A free man.  Thank you. (Yelling at dog again.)  I'm nervous.  'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow  and jism into a cup, that's why. What  if I can't do it?  You know, If you said you'd help me  I'd feel alot less nervous. It's gonna  be on your lunch hour anyway.  You didn't even say nothing about the  TV bein' fixed.  You're welcome.  Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you  talked to Holden lately? He didn't show  up for work today, I wanna know what  gives. I know you two are friends.  You eat lunch together every day.  Well, if you see him, tell him Jack  Fields is lookin' for him.  You're a hooker, you hooker.  So, how many guys you gettin' with?  You gettin' with every guy in the state?  I'm so alone!  Yes, I'm drunk! And I'll be drunk every  day until the day I die! What do you  care?! You jump on any pecker that's  put in front of you!  I saw everything. Oh god. Oh god.  Where you goin'?  What?  I can't share you, Justine! Maybe with  one man but not with a whole bunch of  'em!  Wish me luck.  Knock 'em dead, partner. (Justine and  Bubba watch Phil walk into one of the  rooms) You look nice.  I know you're angry and I can figure  why. But, from where I stand, what happened  yesterday was a wonderful thing.  Well, I'm awful grateful to ya, Justine.  Let me just ask you one thing. How do  I stack up against Phil? You know, how  do I stack up where it counts?  Who's there?  C'mon. I can't do this on my own. I  need help.  Not in a place like this! Not where  I have to hand over the results! Just,  let me hold your boob.  You know, sometimes, I think to myself,  at least it can't get any worse. But  it can. I can worse. As long as you  can say you've hit rock bottom you can.  A blind man can go deaf. A widow can  lose her children. Babies starve and  they never get food. They never get  any food. They just come into the world  and they die.  I can't calm down! I'd be easy if I  was a hooker like you. I could calm  down all over town.  I know you're not. I'm in agony.  What do you mean 'why'? I thought you  hated your life.  I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his  sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal  the money whatever it takes. You just,  just whatever you want as long as it's  you and me. Please don't forsake me  Justine.  A tin for two dollars, miss. (gives  her the blackberries) There you go.  We need a plan. We can't keep livin'  day to day. We gotta chart a course  and we just gotaa stick....  But, they're dirty. (hesitating, he  eats a blackberry and then smiles) They're  sweet. If I could only get my hands  on some money, someone could just tell  me the answer. I gotta do. But If I  ever do, I end up thinking about it  instead. I gotta do. But do what? (Justine  pushes the blackberry he's about to  eat away from his mouth) What...? What  was that for?  What are you doin' in here? What's that?  Why you takin' it?  What's it say?  I wanna be here when you find out.  The little plastic doohickey's turnin'  blue. What's that mean?  Bright blue.  ALRIGHT!  I knew it. Waste of time going to that  sperm doctor. We did it. We're gonna  have ourselves a baby.  And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate  at Senor Tuna. Yes we are. I'm gonna  bring Bubba. You can bring some of your  friends from work. Or Bible study guy.  Whoever. Too bad Gwen's dead.  Let's do it mellow then. You sure don't  seem too excited.  Don't think negative. Think positive.  We could have ourselves a tiny Phil.  Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny's gonna have  a tiny weeny Teeny.  What do you mean? Everything's gonna  change.  What do ya mean?  (picks up the phone) Hello?  It was a wrong number.  Either of you seen Holden? Boy is out  on his ass!  Justine. Can we talk to you for a second?  Hi, Justine. Go ahead and have a seat.  Justine, you like workin' at the Retail  Rodeo don't you? Like the company, like  the people? You wouldn't want to jeopardize  that by makin' some silly error in judgement  would ya?  Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars  from the safe last night. Did you have  anything to do with it?  'Cause we know you're pretty tight with  Holden.  I've seen you in the store room with  him Justine. On many the occasion. I  think you know him pretty well.  Justine! Justine!  I did it! I finally did somethin'!  Oh, who cares? I'm proud of myself.  Fuck them, Fuck all of them!  Well, we're outta here! Justine, I got  over twenty thousand dollars! I got  a gun, what else?!  It's my baby.  Yes, it is. You know it is.  Yes, you can. I mean, you can't raise  a baby here. You know that. Justine.  You hate your husband. You hate your  job. You love me, so let's go.  Well, then tomorrow. I'll go to the  motel and wait for you. Just be there  by noon.  Justine, what have you got to lose?  So be there by noon.  I love you, Justine. This is all gonna  work out. I know it. I almost forgot.  This is a story of your life. You inspired  me. (they kiss and Holden gets out of  the car)  Hey Teeny!  We were gettin' worried about ya!  Justine, this is Liberta. Liberta, this  is Justine.  Congratulations, on your expectation.  Doesn't matter. As long as it plays  quarterback for the Cowboys.  Well, I hear Senor Tuna callin'. (phone  rings)  (picks up the phone) Hello. Yeah. Well,  that's not right. What's that supposed  to mean? Hey look. No. You don't know  shit okay. Justine's pregnant. You got  that? Well, look you better check your  records again, pal, then call me! (hangs  up) Some doctor says my sperm's no good.  Does that mean Justine's not pregnant?  No. That just means they got it wrong,  is all. They don't know everything.  Looks like that wind's pickin' up again.  Holden?  You done good. You're a good girl.  Hey.  What's going on in the bedroom? Looks  like a twister hit it.  I thought we were robbed. Why aren't  you at work?  Retail Rodeo? You know that guy?  Attention Retail Rodeo employees this  is JAck Fields, your store manager.  As most of you all know by now, We lost  another employee yesterday. Holden was  a thief and a disturbed young man, and  what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps  we can learn a lesson from this tragedy,  like don't steal and don't be disturbed.  The important is to move on. Like dozens  of those who quit. This one's for you  Holden.  I was just at your house and the mail  came. Phil was opening letters, and  he opened this bill from the credit  card company. And F&$%. Please don't  tell him about us, Justine. Please.  Please. I love Phil. I love him more  than myself. Please have mercy on me.  Have you been sleepin' around behind  my back?  I said, have you been sleepin' around  behind my back?  Why? Why?  Don't you love me? Don't you love me  at all?  Oh god. Please don't tell me it's not  my baby.  Are you sure?  Who is he?  Yes, it does. Was it some guy from work?  Yeah, I know who it was. It was that  Bible guy, wasn't it? The Nazarine.  That's why you were actin' so spooked.  I'm gonna beat his ass.  You're gettin' all swollen. I'm sorry  I hit you, baby.  I need to get stoned.  I just gotta escape, you know. You ever  feel like that? Like you gotta escape?
