Legend has it, that it was written by the dark ones: To trace the origin of the Book, we must go back...back...to a day when spirits ruled the earth. When the seas ran red with blood. It was this blood that was used to ink the book. The Book of the Dead was last seen in 1300 A.D. It was then that the dark spirits again rose up to battle the living. It is said that a hero came from the sky.  A man who defeated this evi and buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar. And there it lay for 700 years... ...Waiting. And then... Professor Raymond Knowby and his wife, HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small cabin where they could study it undisturbed. Kanda...Es-trata...Ta-toon...Hazan sobar...Ear-Grets, Gat, ...Nos-feratos ...Amantos...Kanda! It was one week later that a group of college students came to the cabin.  Our song. It was in the cabin's cellar that they found the Professor's tape recorder, and the Book of the Dead. Kan Da, Es-trata ta-toon hazan sobar ...Ear-Grets, Gat... ...Nos-Feratos...Amantos...Kanda! One by one, they fell to the possession of the dark spirits. One man, Ash, destroyed the Book. But the evil that had been resurrected from it, lives on. It's gone. Sun's driven it away... for now.  Gotta get the hell out of here... before night falls. Annie! How'd everything go on the expedition? So you said in the telegram.  What condition are they in? Haven't aged a day in three thousand years. When do we begin the translations? Should be, but I haven't spoken to him in a week, what with no phone in that cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there. We'll take my car. Annie, you hinted in your telegram that your father was on to something with the first part of his translations.  What's the big mystery?  What has he found in The Book of the Dead? That's all.  Just a crummy dr- Hello lover, I came from the other side of your dream to dance with you. Even now we have your darling Linda's soul!  She suffers in torment! NO! YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO Eat chainsaw. I'm fine... I'm fine... You bastards.  Give me back my hand. Can't... can't be happening. Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now!? Thas' right.  But you ain't goin' there. Lady, I ain't never seen nothin' like it. Terrific.  Now what? Sure ain't no, road. Hell you wanna go there for, anyway? Hey!  I just remembered... Yeah, that's right... There is a trail. You could follow Bobby Joe and me. That sounds all right. But, it'll cost ya. Forty Fi... Hundred bucks. Sure! Jesus H. Christ!  I thought she was talkin' 'bout them two goddamn little pieces! Ha! You gonna be alright, honey? I don't know. You just sit still fer a minute. You know this son of a bitch? No.  We thought her - We'll throw him in there. Crazy buck's gone blood simple. Wait... I made... a mistake... Damn right, you flat mouthed son of a bitch. I hope you rot down there! N... No. Last night Henrietta tried to kill me. I cannot bring myself to dismember my wife, yet I know that I must, to halt the evil that lives within her. It is October 1, 4:33 p.m.  Henrietta is dead.  I could not bring myself to dismember her corpse.  But I buried her. I . . . buried her . . . in the cellar. God help me, I buried her in the earthen floor of the fruit cellar! Somebody's down there with him. Let me out! It's a trick.  I know it. No. I fear that whatever I have resurrected from this book, is sure to come calling for me. There's something out there.  That... witch in the cellar is only part of it. It lives out in those woods.  In the Dark. Something that's come back from the dead. Jake, let's beat it the hell out o'here, right now.  I gotta get out! Now Bobby, you ain't in no condition. Nobody goes out that door.  Not till daylight. How can you say that to me Annie? You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I remember it well because it was snowing.  So strange that it would be snowing in September. We are the things that were. And shall be again! HA HA HA HA HA! Spirits of the book. We want what is yours!  LIFE! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn! We see you! Start up that saw and hand it here! We're gonna cut him up. START IT UP! Jake, I can't take no more of this. That's funny. What? That trail we came in here on... well, it just ain't there no more. Like the woods jus' swallowed it. What the hell is it? Maybe something... Something trying to force its way into our world. It's in there. We'll all go in together. Hell no, you're the curious one. Annie. Holy Mother O'Mercy. There is a dark spirit here that wants to destroy you.  Your salvation lies in the pages from the Book of the Dead. Recite the passages.  Dispel the evil. Save my soul... And your own lives. Jake, you squeezing my hand too tight. I ain't got your hand, baby. Then who...? Somebody get the light! Hey.  Bobby Joe's gone! BAHHHH! Where the hell is she? We gotta go out there and find her! If she went out in those woods, she's not coming back. Felt like someone just walked over my grave.  It's that picture. He didn't do a very good job. What about the passages? Why the hell would we want to do that? I'm runnin' the show now. We're goin' outside into those woods to look for Bobby Joe, an' once we find her, we're gettin' the hell outta here. If you want to look for her, go ahead. You two comin' with me.  I ain't goin' out there alone. NO, YOU IDIOT.  You'll kill us all. She's dead by now.  With these pages we can... Those pages don't mean shit. 'Sides.  Now you ain't got no, choice. Now move! Move you son of a bitch! No trail.  Which way do you intend to go? Bobby Joe! Bobby Joe, where are you girl? Bobby Joe!  Bobby Joe! You'll get us all killed. Shaddup! Bobby Joe! JOIN US! Get the axe.  Kill it.  Kill it. No.  WAIT! Listen to me!  I'm all right now.  That thing is gone. GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all right!! You'll be the first to know. I'm fine. Then let's head down into that cellar... Groovy. Those pages are down there somewhere. She's playing hard to get... ... rid of. She got hungry. Swallow this. May she rest in pieces. You didn't finish it?! Start reciting it. Finish it! No! Slay the beast! 'Tis a deadite! Hail he, who has come from the sky, to deliver us from the terrors of the deadites! Hail! Hail!
