So...what do you think?  Yes.  Let her go. It's cool.  And Buckaroo Banzai.  Ellie, you heard your m---  Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.  Hi-Durch!  Waow!  Druck!  Jesus, the road!  Drucks! No shit, Sherlock.  Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.  No-I guess not.  Hey--they actually found the place!  Well, maybe I---- Louis, what's this?  You Mr. Creed?  Yes. Just a second.  The movers--  I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow. I bet Mr. Crandall knows!  Great.  Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---  Did you see his shirt? Sure. Bruce Springsteen.  I really do have a million questions about the area...but the thing I'm really curious about is how come this octogenarian Yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with the Boss.  It's me.  Not at all.  God, that's fine.  What were you listening to?  What?  Nice.  The one that goes into the woods--sure.  What's at the end of it? Another day--after you get settled in a bit. Meantime, doc--- Here's to your bones.  And yours.  Church! God, you scared the life out of me!  Waow!  My God!  Sure.  Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?  Not yet...how much further is it?  I think it's rather extraordinary.  Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?  For a little while.  I can hardly read these.  I think it is so, Ellie.  And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.  My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.  Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...  Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.  If it was up to me I'd let Church live to be a hundred...but I don't make up the rules. Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not mine! Not--  She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.  Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?  Rachel...someday Church is going to  die. That is hardly the point! Church is not going to die today, or tomorrow-- Never mind. I can see you don't have the slightest idea what I'm talking about.  Rachel--!  He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is going to be beyond him for a few years.  Good God! Where'd you hear that?  According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.  I just said--  And Church will be fine. Do you promise, Daddy?  Well, honey...you know that...  Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.  Bye-bye!  --nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy, for introducing that colorful phrase into my daughter's vocabulary.  You ought to see a doctor about it.  Holy Jesus. Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed, we've got a mess here! Stat!  Steve, get the ambulance over here right now. He's got to go to EMMC.  The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco downtown, getting--  --a new muffler, oh shit--  Help me hold him.  It wouldn't matter if we did have the ambulance.  It wouldn't matter if we had the SST.  He's going. Steve, go call the motor- pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.  It won't--  I know it won't! But let's for God's sake do it by the rules!  How do you know my name? I'll come...to you. Dammit, how do you know my name?  Louis, they're sending a--  Steve, will you get a sheet to cover him with?  He said my name. I heard it. He said my name.  I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--  Please, I want to wake up. Leave me  alone. It's not my fault you died; you  were as good as dead when they brought you in--  Leave me alone!  Getting there.  Good d--  For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?  Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.  It's Church.  Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.  Yes.  Bagged cat. What a mess.  I don't know.  Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know? Maybe there's a better way.  Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.  But--  Yes, but--  Well, folks, here we are, in Louis Creed Dreamland.  Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?  What do you mean?  We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!  I'm not climbing that.  Let's go. Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.  God, this is amazing!  And don't look down. Right.  Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud?  Is there quicksand?  You're telling me.  It's funny, all right.  You keep saying that.  Whose burying ground?  Why? For God's sake, why?  I guess so...but...  No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.  You think so?  What are those for?  Doesn't look like they last long.  Jud, why am I doing all this?  Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but you were a hell of a good cat.  Oh, shit! Rachel!  But--  Hi, Dory...it's Louis--  That'd be real fine. Hi...daddy? Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy birthday to you! That was awful, daddy.  Yeah, I know...how are things out  there in Chicagoland?  I said that's too bad. What did you get for presents from Gramma and Grampa? Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and a Chatty Cathy doll...  Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie. I haven't seen him this evening, but--  Food, Church...food!  Come on, Church! Chow down!  In a second.  Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded Christ, he ch--  Ow!  What did we do?  What did we do, Jud?  I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...  No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?  Can I have another one?  Wendigo?  You and this old Indian rag-man--  How did your mother take it, Jud? How did she take it when your dog came back from the dead?  Yes.  A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.  What?  You don't understand--  Promise...  How the hell did you get in?  Hi, sugar!  Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.  Yes.  I know.  I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.  Yes--I hate it, too.  Yes. To honor the dead.  Well...a touch of the flu...  That's enough, Ellen.  This babe has said enough.  Hop in, Ellie.  My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."  It's Ellie's cat.  Ellie? What's wrong?  Huh?  What's up, sugar?  What?  Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.  But don't you dare say that.  I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--  Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.  I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.  Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.  Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?  Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?  But we plan on that chair. We believe in that chair. And I plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after I die. I believe I will. You have faith in that.  Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that it is now time for Ellen Creed to get ready for bed. So buzz.  I'm sure you're not.  Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.  I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--  Your sister, I know.  That's forgotten.  Yes, I guess I do.  You're doing fine.  Go, dayee!  Hey, Gage!  Dat?  String! You're flying it, Gage--you got the hammer, my man!  Gage fline it?  Bet your boots. Look--  See?  Gage fline it!! Bet your ass, little hero.  You--  How do you like that, you son of a bitch? I should have done it sooner!  How do you like that? How do--  Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll take y'apart!  Stop it!  Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with you, Louis? It's your son's funeral, not a boxing match!  I don't know what happened to me. Louis, please-- I'm sorry, Gage--I'm so sorry, little hero.  Kite fline too fast!  No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.  Ellie--  Yes--I suppose you can. Good night, Ellie.  Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--  I'm thinking about going to bed.  Shit! Look at this mess!  Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.  I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?  Oh holy Jesus lookit that.  You men get out of here!  Was it?  You see him standing there, don't you? Now get out! Get the Christ off my land! Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an! Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can smell him!  He ain't dead! Give him a day or two and he'll be fine! Don't you say that!  What happened?  I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall!  You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud? If he don't, he don't.  LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING!  This is the final call for United's flight 61 to Chicago...  You better get going, hon.  I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.  I'm sure.  Come on, you guys--before you miss the boat.  Louis, I am sorry. What can I say? That I lost my mind? It's the truth, but no good excuse. We all lost our minds, Irwin.  Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.  I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--  Of what? I don't know. Everything's going to be all right, Ellie. Now go on--get aboard.  I swear.  Anything else for you today? I think we got it all.  Looks like heavy work.  It could be.  It's wrong. (Pause) What happened to you is wrong.  I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.  Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.  If it doesn't work--if he comes back like Timmy Baterman--I'll put him to sleep. But I'm going to try. (Pause) And if it doesn't work...they don't ever need to know.  You know something's wrong, don't you? You know. And Ellie does, too.  I'll drive you. Mommy?  I'll come with you if you want, honey. I've got three planes to catch and I got the last seats on two of them. It's like God saved them for me.  Oh, Gage--oh, honey.  It's going to be all right...I swear it's going to be all right...  I ain't afraid of no ghost.  Please God--let this work.  Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't gonna look down.  I'm sorry...it's been very busy tonight. I really don't have anything.  I do have an Aries K, but it came in sort of beat up--there's a long scrape up one side--  See? Just imagination. Just--  Nothing...there.  It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I think the Wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me.  It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.  Come back to me, Gage. Come back to us.  Hop in, baby.  Lady, I got nine points on my license right now.  That's all right, babe. Only if we get stopped, next time I'll be the one hitchin' and you can give me a ride.  I didn't get a ticket, so you're welcome, lady. Whatever your problems are, I hope they work out.  Miaow!  Jesus!  Gage--?  Oh my God. (Pause) Gage!  Gage!  Hello! Hello, Louis--it's Irwin. I just wanted to be sure Rachel got back all right.  Yes, she's fine. Well, put her on at that end and I'll put Ellie on at this one. Ellie's very worried about her mother. (Pause) She's almost in hysterics.  She...Rachel's asleep. Then I suggest you wake her up. Ellie...I think she had a dream that her mother was dead.  I'll call you right back. Louis--!  Irwin, you'll just have to-- I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come over and play with me? Gage? Mommy already came. We played, daddy. First I played with Jud and then mommy came and I played with mommy. We had an awful good time. Now I want to play with you.  What did you do? What did you--  What you buy is what you own, and sooner or later what you own comes home to you. Wasn't that what you said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it?  Hi, Church. Want some grub?  Don't mind me. Eat it while you can. Eat all you want.  Eat all you can...all you want... that's right...today's Thanksgiving day for cats, but only if they came back from the dead...  No, you don't!  Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead.  Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause) Gage?  Gage?  All right, Gage...let's.  I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm--  I'm going to set things back in order. I...I know just what to do.  Gage?  No fair! NO FAIR!  And what you own always comes home to you.
