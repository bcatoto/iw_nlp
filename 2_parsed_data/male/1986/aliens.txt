Talk to me, Hudson. Position? Rescue mission. There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity. Let's go...let's go. Cycle through! Christ. I never saw such a buncha old women. You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson? Say again? All after incinerators? Let's go. Pull 'em out. Vasquez, take point. Let's move. Ten seconds, people. Look sharp! Awright! I want a nice clean dispersal this time. Awright. Fire-team A. Gear up. Let's move. Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.Well, thanks, I -- In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska. Ripley... PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES! See you soon. I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid. I'll go. I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point. I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours. The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers. About equal to ten megatons. That's it. See it? Emergency venting. Hard to say. It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves. That's if she exists, of course. Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others. A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all. It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society. That is the question of the hour. We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs. Yes. That follows. I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon.I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this. Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right? And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in. Then no exclusive rights, nothing. Now, wait a second -- You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it. Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life. Corporal Hicks!? Don't make me pull rank, Ripley. This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them -- Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments. Let's move cautiously. First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it -- Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action. She's right. Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built... Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so, all over the planet. They're completely automated. We manufacture them, by the way. I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you. Well, it didn't occur to me. It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board. That's the plan. My word on it. Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi... Yes, and I've read it. You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over... If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo. And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it. You gotta get back on the horse... What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract? Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing? I heard you were working in the cargo docks. Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights. We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.' Hear me out... You are a head case. Have a donut. You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo. Just tell them what happened. The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional. Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there. You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys... Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't licked that one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children. Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age: sixty-six ...at time of death. Two years ago. I'm sorry. Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest... You'd drifted right through the core systems. It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right? We're talking thermonuclear explosion. What's he scanning for? It's insured. Still nothing from the colony? These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant? Look, we don't know what's going on out there. It may just be a down transmitter. But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor. That's all.Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over. Flame-units only. I want rifles slung. First squad up, on line. Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear. Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast. Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station. Okay, let's do it. ...that's better. Pan it around a bit. Shit. Apone, collect magazines from everybody. We can't have any firing in there. PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted. Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony. Dead on all channels. We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations. You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety. All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I... I told them to fall back... Shut up. Just shut up! So? So? So. Proceed inside. What is it? Where are your parents? You have to try... Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block? Hold at forty. Slow circle of the complex. Thirty-eight...simulated. We're not making that out too well. What is it? Alive? Okay, stand by in operations. Let's go. ...We're coming in. All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us. First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line. Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower... Are there any questions? Hudson? All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved. What's the question? Yes, Hicks? At ease. I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...Fuckin' A! Well you're not reading it right! Let's get these things lit. The corner! Ready? I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand. We got problems. Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose. Are you finished? You okay? Not that tunnel, the other one! Save it. Don't be long, Ellen. We ain't going anywhere. All right! She's alive. I believe it. But we gotta get moving! Now! Stand back. We didn't miss anything. It's game time. Let's waste him. No offense. Wait a minute. We'd know about it. Yeah. I've noticed. Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that. If it comes to that, I'll do us both. Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine. Maybe. Maybe not. Newt time then can walk right up and knock. Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out. They're in the approach corridor. We gotta figure on them getting into the complex. About seventeen days. Poor bastard.Uh, seems to be in front and behind. Can't lock up... Movement! Hey, 'Top.' What's the op? Whoooah! No shit? I'm impressed. Would you, Sir? This floor's freezing. You tell me. I only work here. Unknown. But, it looks like all of them. Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower. Hah! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen! Found 'em. Sir, the CPU is on-line. He's coming in. I feel safer already. How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit? Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt? Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks. Sir? Let's go! Let's go! Six meters. Five. What the fu -- Seventeen meters. Do it! Maybe we got 'em demoralized. I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this? Aye-firmative. Well that's great! That's just fucking great, man. Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now! Let's get the fuck out of here! Sure, Hicks. No. No! It ain't you. They're inside. Inside the perimeter. They're in here. It's inside the complex. Oh, man. And I was gettin' short, too! Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock. It ain't half fair, man! Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal! Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay? Anytime. Anywhere. Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up. Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man? It's readin' right. Look! Nine meters. Eight. Twelve meters. Man, this is a big fucking signal. Ten meters. Fifteen meters. Range twenty meters. This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place... What do you mean, they cut the power? How could they cut the power, man? They're animals. Oh, right! Right! With those things running around. No way. Think of what? We're fucked. How? The transmitter was on the APC. It's wasted. Uh, what's next? Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here. Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours! Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before... Oh, God. Jesus. This ain't happening. Hey...hey! Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man. Sounds like you, Hicks.Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his. Christ. Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look. They don't say why, and I don't ask. I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.' Yeah. What?Sixty, maybe seventy families. Because I don't have to. The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship. And by the way, they call it Acheron now. Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be... The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe... It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.You're just reading me. Hudson, give us a break. Yeah, bullshit. Watch us. All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest? Fuck you. No. Have you?
