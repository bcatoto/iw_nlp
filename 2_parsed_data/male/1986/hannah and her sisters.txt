And then, uh, April...huh? Uh, who gets dropped first? Yeah. Look at this. Well, let's do it. You want to see some? You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them. I get the feeling you tune in to your environment. Are you really interested? Hi. And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs. I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs. Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first. Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you? We could...we could do that. Well... Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh? It does. It's really sad. They fit right in together. And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then... And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it. Yes. And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. The design's deliberately noncontextural. But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions. Yeah. What time do you get off? I'm an architect. I cry at the opera. Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party. You're Holly. Ah! HOLLY Now. Oh no. Not at all. Is this your first job? Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong. I can't resist. Excuse me, are there any more claims?It's nothing. Will you trust me? You know, there's no reason for panic. I just want to rule out some things. Now, don't get alarmed. These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it's, it's nothing. What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests. And it's just in one ear? You've had some dizzy spells. What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that? When did you first notice this? Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus? Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear. Let's take a look. You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness. ...and, uh, he complained of chest pains. You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus... So what's the, uh, problem this time?Are you okay? You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT Yeah. Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air. It's probably something I ate. I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead. It's not that big a deal. We just didn't hit it off. What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid. What's the matter with you? Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol. And I got a Frank Stella, too. Oh, it's very beautiful. Big, weird...you know. If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird. How ya doin', man? Yeah. It's kind of a weird place, actually. A lotta wall space. 'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. Well, are...are they big? I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid. Hi....cannot go on the air. Yes, but you name names. ...with the affiliates. Child molestation is a touchy subject... Ed Smythe, yes.Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead. Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I told him about your work, and he's very excited. Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it. Lee... And you're in love overnight? Yeah, but we-we made so many plans. But it hasn't been forever. If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you! Uh... I-I-I know. I deserve this. Is something wrong? You've been very cold to me tonight. Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn't need me as much. I'm being presumptuous. Not that you need me. You really do have those thoughts, don't you? Oh, my God. I don't want anyone else ever to have you. This is not an easy situation. I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks. No, no-no-no, I'm sure. Lee... uh... I thought you weren't coming. Your guilt is because you feel the same. Yes, but you, you do care about me. O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out. W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad. But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you? Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions. Tch, w-well, for a million reasons. Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway. Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you. Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her. Hannah and I are in the last stages. I know! I-I-I-I, I realize. I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible. Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you. I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up. I have been in love with you for so long. I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you. Oh! Lee! Lee! Lee, I'm in love with you. And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive. This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically. Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve? Oh, right. Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings? I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites. Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see her wind up settled. She's a tense one. Oh, I would love to hear it. Oh, you-you have that one? He's got like six gold records. Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars. I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together. Oh, that's nice. But I go nuts. It's a conflict. Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods. How's everything? Bye. Page a hundred and twelve. And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve. It reminded me of you. Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime. Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on. And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime. Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this. I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. A poem of his and thought of you last-- You'll be fine, though. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle. She looks at the book. Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much. e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you this. Oh, yes. Who doesn't? Look! How-how's Frederick? Yeah. How are you? Yes. Uh, yes! No! No... No, no. I-I-I understand completely. No problem. Y-you're busy. I-I-I... Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee. Oh, book? Oh, no, I... I'm killing time. I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh... Yes, it's-it's wonderful. Well, i-if-if you have some free time... Yes? Yes? LEE A couple of blocks from here. If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it. I think to myself what problems could she possibly have? I'll never understand it. You're so bright and charming and beautiful. Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy. Where are you headed? Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you? How about you? Well, yes, I'm killing time. I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early. Yes. Yeah, I-I'm kill-- Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore. Hi. Oh, my goodness! Yeah. Like, uh...? Really? So, so, what else? Wh- what are you up to? Oh, great. How's Frederick? He didn't come. You're not lost. It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return! Leave me alone, can you?! Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke. Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject. What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less. You sleep with me less and less. No. Me? Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you. No! But you keep asking these, these awful questions. My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes! What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else. My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No. I didn't say that. No! Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take. You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured. A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut. I-it's all very...preconceived. Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle. But, you got four children! I don't know. Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now. Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea. Was I? I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy. Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I forgot. I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman. You bet. Let's go have dinner, shall we? That's where your talent lies. Great idea. No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well. Your sister is an unbelievable cook. They're fantastic. Mm-hm?Oh, honey! I want ice! Who's got some-- Oh, there it is. We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman... Always. I am glad to see you. Yeah. And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House! This is a toast. You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all... ...this is a toast! This is a toast.I'll either be unconscious or I won't. If not, I'll deal with it then. I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious. How do you know? Of what? I'll be unconscious. Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll be dead. So? Why should I be afraid? But why? We raised you as a Jew. But Catholicism? Why not your own people? How can we be happy?Oh... Jesus...Jesus! You are, you are my only connection to the world! But who? Where did you meet him? Who is it? So you met somebody else? Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back! Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?! You've been with someone! Oh, yes, you have! Oh...Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?! Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now? What are you going to use for money?! Why? Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again? Like what? When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world. I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago. You know, you've been very nervous lately. You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz. More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions. I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?! I don't sell my work by the yard! They're in the basement. ...or films you must see or... Elliot lusts after you. Yeah. Because he likes you. Have I really taught you everything I have to give? I don't think so. Well, there was a time when you were very happy to be only with me. You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music. Hmm? Isn't it enough that I can love you? Lee... you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people. I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone. Absolutely. No, nothing. No, thank you.You're welcome. Hare Krishna. ...read it over, and think about it. Take our literature... You're afraid of dying? MICKEY Well...yeah, naturally. Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something? Yeah, well, what's your religion? What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?Like what? Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I won't go to the opera. The hospital? What kind of tests? Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears? Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something? Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha- what do I have? I always, I-I always imagine that I have things. No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me. Really?! Now I ca-can't remember. Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no. No, I'm sorry. It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear. Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. I mean, he's, you know, he's-- Mm-hm. So, so, but it was when I was younger, so-- This time I really think I have something. We-- We nev-- We don't name names! We say the Pope. Read the papers! Half the country's doing it! Could you-- Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? You-- Standards and Practices? Mom, come out! Well, it certainly doesn't look promising. Yeah, I know. But never to exist again! I don't understand. Aren't you frightened? That thought doesn't terrify you? Oh! 'Cause you won't exist! So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision. I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try. Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ? Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought. I don't understand. I thought that you would be happy. I can't stay on this show. I gotta get some answers. Otherwise I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic. Yes! ...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything. I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything! Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you? That makes everything... I went into a store, I bought a rifle. I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself. The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated. I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first. And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath. A week ago, I bought a rifle. Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret? Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind... No, I'm not dying now, but, but you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right. And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay. I'm not going to go tomorrow. But eventually, I'm going to be in that position. Can you understand how meaningless everything is? Everything! I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless. Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by? No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy. I--How was I to know?! Everyone was pointing back here. Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back! You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor! Don't say that! I don't want to hear that word! Don't mention that while I'm in the building. Like what?! What? If there's nothing wrong with me then why does he want me to come back for tests?! I can't keep my mind on the show. Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing? Like-- N-n-no, not that. Oh, Jesus! Look at this guy. No-- You know... Right. We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and... Hannah and I...can't have any children. Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it-- It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to-- With a, with a stranger? With a-- Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea? What, by a st-stranger? What are you talking about? Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one-- Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies? Jesus! How could I ruin myself? What do you mean, ruin myself? I'm so humiliated. I don't know what to say. I mean-- Well, then a third opinion. Gee. Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this. Come on! Hurry up! Let's go! Go right over there. Isn't that great? Mh-hm. You've always had good taste in husbands, so... ...you know? I, uh... ...so I, so I like that. I always like an underconfident person... H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me... The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt? I like him. I think he's a sweet guy. Really? That'll be terrific for him, I think. Oh! Yeah? Let me get a little reaction here. How's Elliot? Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the presents now. How is everything? ...a little, uh, hey! A little hug! What is this? Now how 'bout a little action from the kids? Yeah, aren't you like, you know... I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta-- I got two minutes. I know...I know. Mmm, what? I don't know how you're gonna top that. You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that it's ironic. I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought that I could love anybody else. And here it is, years later and I'm married to you and completely in love with you. The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle. It really is. I... It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister... doesn't work out... many years later... he winds up married to the other sister. It's, you know, it's a... Oh. You look so beautiful. When'd you get here? Hi. How you doin'? Now don't get nervous. It's just your husband. Do you? I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening? So, so you want to go out to dinner again? I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or... I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault. I-- Oh, don't be silly! No! Don't be ridiculous. Oh, yeah? What? Well... I'll tell you. One day about a month ago... Oh, who cares? I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script. I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it. It was just great. Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff. I am. You-you made my day. Fabulous, I mean it! I'm so impressed. ...but who cares? It was just-- It was fabulous. I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but... Well, it was just fabulous! I'm, I, you know... Yes! I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death? It's great. I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless. I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now. I don't know what to say. I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat. I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned. This is not an insult. I'm amazed that you can... It was-- I just thought it was great. I should have kept going. I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and... Well, what about me? You must be joking. I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know. Come over tomorrow and read it to me? Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it. Really? Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote. Yeah. Hmm. You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing. What...what about your script? So what's it about? I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you? ...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it. But-- I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year... I've done no television whatsoever. No. I'm not anymore. I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year. You have. You've always hated my taste in the past. Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you. I don't know why it would. This is it. Yeah. This is really-- HOLLY Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it? Something...that I wrote? Nobody ever said it. No, I am. I am. No, you can tell me. Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff? Have you? Are you, are you out of work or something? Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it? Well... You didn't answer my question. What are you doing? So how are you? ...namely a personality. Well, I hope you've changed. You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you? ...in a really horrible way. Remember slamming the cab door in my face and.. you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... It was a terrible evening. Yeah, really. You do. You do. You look wonderful. Good. How are you? Oh, that's putting it mildly. We did everything but exchange gunshots. ...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh... I was walking past and I saw you in here... Yes, you do recall, right? Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together. ...I had a great time tonight, really. It was like the Nuremberg Trials. Right. Yeah. I had a... Yeah. Me, too. Jesus... I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people. Really. And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time! What do you, what do you do? Carry a kilo around in your purse? Yeah, that's tough! You don't deserve Cole Porter. You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother! Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing. Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me. Can I take you someplace to hear something nice? Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials. My--uh... Can we, can we go? But, no, you've been doing that all night! You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril! Really, don't, please. Don't, no, please. Will you-- No, don't... I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown! I can't hear anything. I can't hear you. I can't hear anything. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear! I'm-- Well, okay. Thank you very much. Uh-huh. Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me. I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I-- Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.And maybe my lawyer. I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor. Hmm? We got that idea on that trip to Paris. Mm-hm. No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
