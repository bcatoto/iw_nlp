It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell. Right. What about sweating Lecktor? Christ! That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out. At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins. It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away. Library of Congress. Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books... No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible. 'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book? No. The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code. And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him. If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy... He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions. We can make out: 'six-six-six'. I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it. When do they go to press? At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r. Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't... How long do I have?'You're very beautiful. 'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.' We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now. This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?Could he handle a direct contact? What's the bottom line? That's when it happened? His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate? Why aren't you ever alone with him? You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic? He doesn't think you run mind games on him. That was Peterson upstairs. I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. Where? Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place... Not the Bible? Book code? Issue the toilet paper tear as a... The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now. That could be the tip of a 't. Here and here. And here. Twenty minutes max. I need to talk to you about Will Graham. I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can... Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you? Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it... Because it's his bad luck to be special. I have to. Wait for the back-up! Will? Stay in the trees. Three minutes. Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach. Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house. You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us. Will...? Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit... Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van. I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field. At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream. See if there's another label underneath. No. It's Bob's Photo Store in... Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it? There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows. It's the guard in the storeroom. It's getting late and... He had to. Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed. What's that? Will? It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM. The full moon is tonight. Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh... What? There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times. There's no connection between the families. VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what? 'Changes?' When are you coming back? Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit. From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning. You got the message Lecktor called... Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece. It means Red Dragon. That mean anything to you? I'll pick you up in... Wait, Will... It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all. It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address. I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you. Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now. What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write? It's your call, Will. What do we do? Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says. We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week. ...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler. Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD. Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes. Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up. How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop? Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds! You. If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley... Is it weird? For Christ's sake, why? See? You do know something about him. Why? No other possibilities? We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack. What's the other? What's one way? You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print... Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you? I know... A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it. What do you want to do? You said the guy down here is good. He's working on the single print index. What time is it? I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect. These are all dead, Will. If you can't look anymore, I understand... You look all right now. That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think. Last two like this we had, you caught. And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors. Why not? Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call? Typed him from semen. He's a secretor. Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive. Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that; How much do you know? I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here... ...twenty-eight minutes. Cryptography at Langley? Let's get to the physical. For Christ's sake get him! Where the hell's Graham! Will. Get right back here. He just called. ...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong. I AM THE DRAGON! Give me your hand. Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered. Do you know what they call the being that visited these people? You can say. Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta. Do you know what I'm talking about? Me. It's me. Yes. I'll see you later. All right? No. Reba...? The developing room. I need to... see you. Reba... Do you want a Coke or something, Reba? I'll get it. Stay right here. You look very good in the sun... I have work to do at the plant. No! Don't go back into the house... It's too nice outside. Yes, are you okay...?! I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa... It's a surprise. Uh-huh. You worked out well. How did you come to Gateway? Tonic will be fine. Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to. Ride with me. I'll take you. It'll do fine. In eight days. The activities of nocturnal animals. Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights. Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock. I want her! I want her alive... I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!! Shut up. Stop. Stop it. No! No. Good. We'll seal your promise with... You will tell the truth? You did very well. I apologize for the crude images. Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights. Now you will read this into the tape recorder. Are you queer, Mr. Lounds? Do you imply that I'm a queer? Are you a man? 'No' what? Do you see? Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see? Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The Dragon rampant. Do you see? Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see? Do you see? Do you see? Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.' Do you see? Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter. You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead. Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds. In a little while I'll help you understand. Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds? Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds? Do you feel privileged? According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said. You know now, don't you? Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds? Atoning, Mr. Lounds. Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back. No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine. Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you? Do you have it? Yes? Come in. Three, four hours. In a holding cell. It's written on toilet tissue. 'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming. 'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming. Just as the source of light is burning. Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says... 'I have a complete collection of your press notices. I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate. Investigator Graham interests me. Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond. There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part. 'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet. Signed: Avid Fan. It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom. Well, it's about goddamn time! I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and.... Uh... sure... When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him? The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him? As long as it's on soft paper. You may... Find this curious. Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C. Okay. Yeah... She doesn't have a Rolodex. She'll be in, in the morning... Linda doesn't come in nights. Linda King's desk.Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...! And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home? This ends when I make it over. Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming. The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. Why the mirrors? What have we missed? If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. That's what you were thinking, isn't it? He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor... They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. In thirty-five minutes. He doesn't have anything to cut with. The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply. That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me... Read it. Will Graham, Jack Crawford... It's happening again, Jack... There's somebody in the house, Jack... I'll cover the back. How far away's the back-up? What? This is our boy...! Parking permits... It does, doesn't it? Have him peel the top label back. What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri. We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in. They're in the far corner of the room under the windows. Don't talk to me!! You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered? He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door? That's why the boltcutter. You wanna watch this or what?! It's not over yet. Something Lecktor said. He's a very shy boy... There has to be. He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses. If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him. How do I know?! It's a word. Killing them... His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time. And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again... He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before. It's very important. When I'm done. That's narrow? What's it narrow down to? I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes. No. I won't be here. Get me a plane! Get me a plane... Tell me now. What'd it say? Who is it? We will feel sick for a very long time. Run it. And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon. Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper? Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time. Personal ads? We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it... After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. Where's Lector now? What is it? Who did he ask for? Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds? The mark? Yes. To recover the mind set. ...I'm going to see Lecktor. Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack. You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about. The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop. He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time. We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him. Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right? We'll get him one way or the other. I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me. Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index. ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls... Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes. He is good. Bur not as good as Price. Get him to Atlanta. Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints? Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat. As long as they're dead... I am all right. I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. I came down here to get away from all that. That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing. You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack. The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... No. Somebody hurt him? What else did you keep out of the papers? What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions? I don't want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious? Can you read it to me? Where did you get it?! It's Will Graham... I want to see Lecktor now. No. I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. I don't want to do that, He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet. He's very strong physically. He's misunderstood. He's right-handed. Let's get straight who we've talking about. Are you the man I'm interested in? Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you? I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things. Do you know something about that? I don't understand. This is Will Graham. Can I help you? Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog? Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it? What about the dog? I call him a monster. Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. Eight in Mrs. Jacobi... ...that's all I have. That's all we know about. Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... He bites a lot. He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse. Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy. Everybody else was dead. Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you? The report didn't mention nails and eyes. You got a deal... Yeah. That's great. A little time. I tell you what, buckaroo... See you around. Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick... They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me... Small difference: I'm not dead, yet. What's the problem, Molly? What's this Mama shit? Come home with me. Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to... Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer. I want to see you. Mama was probably asleep. Hello. You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while. I'll come and get you afterwards... No. I have to be in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks. I have to go back to Birmingham. Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time. No. I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you. No. You haven't smoked in two years. Yes. I said this is too good to live... I remember. Good for him. Thanks a lot, Freddie! Kevin. We're going grocery shopping. ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby... Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care... Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... Blue, then. Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow. I have to see somebody. I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. Eating junk food. They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it... Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff. How's Kevin? Tell me about yourself. None you'd notice. I'm lonely... Hey, baby! Where are you? It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. I love you... Molly? I don't care. He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence. If I were? What the hell can I do? We have it good, don't we? I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma? I got a diploma and everything. And you said? What did he want? Tell her I called. I know... 'Out in the good air...' Yes. Is Molly there? Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian, too... It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson? Go on to the house... Go on to the house. Thanks. That's right. Thanks for the lift. No, I'm okay. I just wanted to... ...stop by and... My name's Will Graham. I... Are you George Sherman? Huh? ...yes. ...after a while. No. Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him. With a knife. I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar. I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying. I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait. Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them. No. It's just my job to find him. I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs. We don't know that. I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it? Yes. No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are. What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?' He read the Tattler piece, didn't he? It's a precaution... Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float. Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed. In this hatchery? Forty to fifty. Yeah... Why does it feel good? I don't believe in God. Fight what? I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it. What do you want? Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file. No. I haven't decided yet. When you do have one I'd like to hear it. I want your opinion. Yes. I'd considered it. That's interesting. Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why? Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor. No. Yes. Yes. I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... You're insane. You had disadvantages. No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are. I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for. You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...? I thought you would have some ideas. You read about it, I'm sure. It's about Atlanta and Birmingham. I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor. It's in the transcript. What does it matter now? You've read the transcript. It's all there. Very interesting, even to a layman. Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry. No. Stuart is fine. I got it. Thank you. I keep getting it for Christmas. Let's walk the route. Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times' Kevlar Second Chance. Glaser Safety Slugs? Yes. Pretty well.What's that? My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat. I'll bet he's gained ten pounds. Molly's out in the motor home... You going back down to Florida after? Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet. On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?No. Yeah. It's right here. When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around... Dr. Chilton.You like that Colombian stuff, don't you? What kind of coffee do you like? And Hobbs died? She got all right? Did the girl die? You went in the apartment? How? How did it happen? Are you gonna kill him? I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it. This guy wants to kill you? I figured I'd ask you... Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true? Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom? I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom... Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh? How many turtle eggs you think are in here? Will it keep them out?Thank you very much. Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham. Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G. I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone. I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me. Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number. Hi, Linda. .. It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful... You should, Will. God's terrific! He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn. Don't you think that felt good? He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders. When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time! I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us. Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it? You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court. I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will. Do you know how you caught me, Will? I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number? May I keep the file? I don't have one right now. You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you? It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before. Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing. What were the yards like? You haven't threatened to take away my books yet. Do you dream much, Will? Let me have them, and I might consider it. Pictures? Do you have the file with you Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity. You're very tan, Will. What disadvantage? Then how did you catch me, Will? Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me. Pray tell. Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up.
