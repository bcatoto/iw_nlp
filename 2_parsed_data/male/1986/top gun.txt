Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun. Remember one thing. Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack? Tomcats? Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly? One SIXTH the speed of sound! Well? Well... What is it?I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT. YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN... MAVERICK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK. Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang. Can't shake him. OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT! It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject. I'm pulling up. They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted! Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps! Were upside down! Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong! This is crazy! Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up. You. We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage? He better be kidding! What is he doing? It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking! What do you want? What do you want? You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well??? Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you. You're not supposed to... Is it you? Is it the plane? Is there something I should know? I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE... 3,000 feet. We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go! Gotta go, man. What are you talking about, we gotta go! 5000 feet. Speed two hundred. Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness! Swell! Passing ten thousand! I know! Now have you got it? Have you still got it? Don't WORRY!!!? You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY? Ohhh Mother! AND HE'S GUNNING. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE! BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT! CHAFF! FLARES! Don't tell me okay. Do it! Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man! So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified. If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it! Since when did you care about paperwork? What are you doing? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT? WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be. TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY. We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down. No! Now we're inverted! We're not! Trust me! We're okay. You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay! You're crazy. We're level. What? What is it? What is? Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high. Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us. These guys are getting on my nerves. Lordy! Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps! That's missile lock! He's pissing me off! Let's hope you're right! I've got a six strobe. I think he's locked on us. We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them. We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter. Did what? It's not Cougar's place. It's ours. Hey, see any controls back there? And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch! Could use a dash more jet fuel. Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it. This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing. You think you can stay up with us. No shit. The Iceman.... Who's your pilot? This is Maverick. The list is long, but distinguished. Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country. 1000. 3000 feet. I'll do it. Time to go. Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the... Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it. What what are you doing? We're cover! Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood. Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man! Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on! Something bothering you? What the hell is this? Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here. Come on, I got over six bucks on the line. Come on, we're next. Just once, if they take your plane away. You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk! Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there? Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career. I wouldn't call it victory. It's more like...self immolation. Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think? Look, Ma, top of the world! Great move. Great On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT! Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink. Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you? What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty! Gotta keep track of the competition. Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good. What are you doing? Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down. What'd you do? They should have warned you about that one. Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS. No shit! That why they call him Ice? Mav's a great flyer but.... But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best! Skipper, you can't do this! He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun! Don't worry. I'll talk to him.Pulled left, rolled out, underneath. She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up. I was a victim of circumstance. Come on. I died enough for one night. Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you. That's Kazanski. GOT 'EM. He won again. Hear about Ice? Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister. The girl with the purple fingernails? That's because you don't have any women. Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky. It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you? That's not what I heard. Got you here. What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it? You're a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman any time. You saved our lives. You did it! I guess I owe you one. WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? SHOOT IT. I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT? ON THE NOSE? LOOK OUT! NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM. NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE. STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK. IT'S MY SHOT. GET LOST! GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN. ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school. You like to work alone. I've heard that about you. Need a hint? Who is the best. Figured it out yet?Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet. Who's the hell is that? Some guys never get it back. I've seen this before. He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING. He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something. I don't know what to tell you, Skip. Just below ten thousand.Right on the flight line? Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here? Well what? I hope you find him. Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer. ...Something like that. How could you? I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't.. I was, later. Who's gonna win? One more. That's three. What does it mean? Off me or off you? Now? Goose is dead. What truth? How does it go? You're crazy. That's a pretty silly game. Strip reality! How do you play that? How do you play reality. What kind of games? What do you do when you come here? It does. Hardly ever. That's what I want. Yesterday. I want it back. No. I'm not good company. I should be alone. You don't have to do this. Where are we? Not to me. Maybe I shouldn't take it. I was flying...my responsibility. He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault. What? I'm fine. Pawn shop. What's to eat? Just good luck. Lucky charm. Why, what's gonna happen? . Yeah! You ever fly an F-14? Well no...inverse order. Food...and you...my F-14! Why? Anything. I don't know yet. And now I want you. I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun. You want to go ballistic? Come on. Thanks very much. Care for some suchi?. What? I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements. All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead... When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth. That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it. You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV. They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission. It bothers you, why? You're part of it. Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something. About as much as they think about killing me. Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work. You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs? Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die. It's not suffering anymore. That's true. What are you? It dies. We live. Anything. Let's make it at eight. I'm different. What plane. A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park. How about anything, anything you want to do. Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it? What if he's not? Harmless! I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage. What are you talking about? The what? Evan... or Maverick. I thought there was something... That night in the club... Give me a break, I'm asking you out. I'm special. Too aggressive? Um. You. Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want? That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line. Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something. I'm sorry. It is combat. Every second counts. What would you say, too fast...too quick... What would? You let me make a fool of myself. You know. The finger. Two meters. Two. I was inverted. Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him. On his six. Yes, ma'am. Not in this case. CHARLIE You saw a MiG push negative 4G? It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. It's classified. I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive. I saw one. No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that. And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart. Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick. It would have been really embarrassing! Everybody's got to be somewhere. I thought he'd never leave. Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile. I heard of one once. Yeah, most likely. Save you from a big mistake with that other guy. I could be, too. Well, it is. It is that, too. It's not that. Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted. Yes sir! Sir? Yes, Sergeant? No sir! But you have to be ready. Yes sir! F-14's sir. Yes sir. Sir. I was going Mach point one five. Yes sir. I do, Sir. Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir! NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU. YEAH, COUGAR? EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED. ROLL IT, COUGAR. ROGER, COUGAR. Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt. I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. Gotcha covered, don't nobody move. WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING? Let me do the talking. Any more MiGs? What do I want? Well what? MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY. But I have to! Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it! The plane is fine. Just relax. You go. I'm staying with it. 280, 290, 300 knots. I'm not losing it again! No! Not again! Okay. I can recover. Hold on! I've got it -- hold on! Rudder's left, stick's forward. Yawing right. Roger, I've got it. Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it. I GOT ONE COMING UP. BREAKING LEFT! Okay, okay. Not anymore. Saving them some paperwork. NO. NO GOOD. DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD. Let's go. Eject. Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet! I can't eject. I'm pinned to the panel. I guess that's what I'm doing, then. Wood's okay. I want Viper. I want him! I'm gonna take him, Goose. STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN! Nothing. Let's just go fight. Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks. I've had enough...for now. What? Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll? Come on, relax... It's a victory roll. Right. We did it! He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw. I've lost him -- where is he? What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit? Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead. You ever done this before? Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know? Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing? COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL. No. You can be mine! We did it. You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team. WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU. I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT. GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE. OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM. YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN. COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING. YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN. FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE. COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE. SHIT!! I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian. I think I can work it out on my own. Nope. Figured out what? Helping him in. I...FORGOT SOMETHING. COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU? Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. Morning, Coogan. You didn't help. The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister. It was bad. Didn't everybody? Yes sir.. Yes sir! Sir? Me? He's a good pilot. Would you take me back? Would they? You think I shouldn't fly. How can I go on? I feel so... responsible. It's not true. I never heard that. He was by the book, all the way. I'm nothing like him. I know. You think I should quit?! I don't know... Or.... She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me? I called your house. Skipper, sorry to bother you. He was...my responsibility--my RIO. I know. I was there. All right. The flying. The fighting. I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good. Just give me the jet. For the same reason you are. It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff. I can take care of myself. I lost. ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. I wasn't thinking. I just did it. We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it. I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger... Yes sir. Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir. Yes sir.Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat. How was it? What was that? So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man. I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two. Mister to you. Tom Kazansky. So I've heard. So's my Johnson. Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing. He just can't seem to follow orders! Well, you'll just have to make do with him . I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home... Well, he's going and he needs someone to fly the plane. Was. Don't. The wings.. That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time... You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it. Was going. Now you are. I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.Three guesses. So have I. It's only been a week. Keep sending him up. WALKED RIGHT INTO IT. Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class. "Maverick!" Tell me one thing. But you continued to fight. The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight? I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men. I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man. Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen. Not something they tell dependents. They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp. You may not think so, but you are. VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse. Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man. I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you. It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday... I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers. Or you can quit. We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that. My wife's house. No bother. My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it. Goose is dead. How do you feel? Oh, you mean the thrill! Then why are you here? Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive. Why do you have to do everything the hard way? Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed. Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that. SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM.. Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane! The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear? Why? Is that how you remember it? A good man. Good flyer. You're father was Marvin Mitchell.. Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign? I like that in a fighter pilot. It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork. Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.What makes you think we can get back in? We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him. What the hell you doing? Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0. We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.Oh...I'll think of something. Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous. Well, I don't know. That depends. You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away. I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH. What now? I didn't ruin her. That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great. Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party? It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't. No, we...got our butts kicked. A plaque? How's it goin', Coog? No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me? Bad? You won?!!!
