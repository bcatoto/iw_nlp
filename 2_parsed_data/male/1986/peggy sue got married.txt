It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off. I've been trying to drag it out of her for years. You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future. What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy�five? Eighty? Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb. Hello, Lilla! It wouldn't be a lodge without hats. The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one. I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you. Stag movies. Smokers. Let's go. I'd take better care of my teeth. It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together. It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains. Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can... I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped. I'll never give up. Oh, God, Dion. I'll just set it right here. That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger. I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you. But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue. I thought you were...for a while. . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue... Come back to me. But I love you. I'll love you forever. Peggy! Where're you going? Come back! What the hell is that? I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain. I love you. It opens, too. Look inside. Of course. You're crazy! You're really out of your mind! What? Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore. Right here. Now sit down. You're going to listen to me. I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you. Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres. That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand. Does this mean you like me again? If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement? Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it. You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why? That's real big of you. Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other. Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with? How'd you know about that? Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while. Rusty's dead. That's Ajax What're you doing here? You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us. ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian! What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me? But what has to be different? What about everything I said to you this afternoon... What are you talking about? Who's Janet? I will be happy if I have you. I love you. Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man. You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this. Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love �� Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted? I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons... Let's go down to the basement. I have to talk to you.. Don't be cruel to a heart that's true. Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you. Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why? Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts. Nothing.. Selling is selling. Save it. You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood. You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late. Who? But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait. What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it? You know I do. I even wrote you into my will. Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in. Yeah I know. But I don't have to flatter you. It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me. As in is, was and always will be. I'm glad dancing was invented. You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites. There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you.. Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry? Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff? I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals? Is this slow enough for you? Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right? Great, isn't it? Yeah. Like that. In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah... I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious. Looking good out there. Would I?!! Why I oughta... Want me to drive you home later? Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents? It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out. And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean? I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again. How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget? You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense. Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night. I call this the staccato. Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today. How do you feel? No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway. I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie. I'm not going. I'll think of a way to sell, them. One day. You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to... You got a Tab? Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office. I mailed it to you on Wednesday. Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it. And nothing will ever change that. But you love me don't you? Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed. ...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something. We're here on the sofa bed... And we're here on the couch... Of course. What would that be, sir? Yes, sir. Trust is a two�way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands. Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school. Yes, sir. Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook. I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something. Can we split now? Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause. What a treat. I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah. You think so? But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together. At least one more time. But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation. Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah. Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us. Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and... Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone. To freedom. That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid. Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one? A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire. Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life? The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club. Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell�O for me, Mom.' The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy. This is great reefer. I thought chicks like you traveled in packs. What're you doing here anyway? A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life! He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author � fat, violent, drunk... Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself. We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you. Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter. She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes. Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you. Hello, Charlie. Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool! Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn? It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now. You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea? That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them. This is your great invention? Would you wear those things? Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats. Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win. That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up. I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business? This morning was good. It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up. Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank. For me? Doing some shopping? Evelyn, take her to her room! I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room! That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into. Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government. All right. But this better be good. Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay. Thank God for that. Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you? Damn that Charlie I If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too? You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits. Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again. Evelyn, put her to bed. I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded. Young lady, you're drunk! Peggy Sue, watch your mouth. We'll make it, we'll be fine. I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of. I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -�how could you do that? Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump. This is not giving blood. This is drunk.Wait! I'll go with you! Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me. Did you break up with Charlie? So are you. You've got a vision. Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip. Not true. I think I'm making real progress on the microchip. What's the matter? Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis. I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest. Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you. One... two... three. You are now awake. No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it. Will you take of f your blouse? You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex? In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her? Silicon is from sand. What will they be made of? Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips? You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. We'll start with something easy. What is your name? No offense, but you're pretty out of it now. Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back. Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before? Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion? Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht. That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny. That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future? What are you doing? High tech. I like the sound of that. What are you talking about? All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's. Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym? Come on. You can't be serious. You're taking advantage of a minor. Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty�fifty. Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner. I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them. No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you... I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help! But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents? The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world. What if you're not here tomorrow? All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy. You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack. Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible. Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door. There's one way to find out. You're giving me the creeps. You look pretty good for a corpse. I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain. But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it? Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule! How, did you know about my grandfather? You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me. Okay. I promise. Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants. You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other. That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland. And then, there's Richard's Burrito. Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed. Are you doing some kind of science project? I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about? All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four�thirty. I have a rocket club meeting. I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy. It really wasn't that difficult. I guess part of us never really leaves high school. Dancing with you. You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that. You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine. The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four�eyed worm. Gee. I'm sorry to hear that. Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh. You look exactly the same. Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie. What, why? Okay. What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
