Gillian -- Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling? And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours -- I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance. Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long. How're you doing? Heard there was some excitement.A moment alone, please. He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer. Back home, we call him the miracle worker. I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it. Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth. He's coming 'round, Jim... Wake up, man, wake up! Tearing of the middle meningeal artery... Cramps. Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine. Oh, joy. It doesn't look all that different. That's crazy! I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself! Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry.. You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket? Now wait just a damn minute. No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him! Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer! Are you sure? That's what I thought. I mean him , back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters. You sure this is such a bright idea? I just wish we could cloak the stench. You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap... It is. No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts. Well nobody's perfect... Guess, Spock. Your best guess. Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot. Naturally. So what is your problem? You, ah... You present the appearance of a man with a problem. Angels and ministers of grace, defend us. Then how.? You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past. ... My God... That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale? I liked him better before he died. Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth? You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death? You're joking...! Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like? Forget it... How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature? Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine. I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes. Hi... Busy? My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient! Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases! How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma? Reading the patient's vital signs. We're just -- observing.We're out of control -- Rig for collision... Damage report! Can you isolate the wave? What's causing that!?Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor. ... It gives me a great sense of history. Team leader, this is team 2. Come in, please... Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions. I'm wery sorry, but -- I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you. I am? May I go now? I do not know your name. My name? The top of what? My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b. Like what? The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding. Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal. And Admiral, it's the Enterprise. Yes, sir. Sir, heat shields at maximum! Shields, aye. No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations. We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral. Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.Can you protect us? "Neutralized?" How? Status report, Admiral!A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure. Fundoscopic examination -- What's your degree in, dentistry? What the hell do you think you're doing? I was not informed about observers. Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.Go ahead. Stun me. Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun. You play games with me and you're through No, my name. Name? All right. Let's take it from the top. Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is. All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?Not me, Bones... They did it. Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank... Come on, Pavel... An experimental device, doctor. What did you say she was getting? What do you think, Spock? Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source. Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park. If you have a better idea - now's the time. -- That's the general idea. Would you prefer to do nothing? We've done it before. Spock, start your computations for time warp. Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit. Bones, stay here. Bones -- Mr. Sulu... Take us home... It'll come back to him. What do you mean? We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot. Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control! Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm: Understood. What is your plan? Ah, well done, team 2. Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank. No choice now, Scotty! May fortune favor the foolish. Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed! Shields, Mr. Chekov. That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...? Most prudent. Engine room. Report, Scotty. I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage. Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you? You mean this is -- goodbye? Hey! -- Where you going?! ... You have a point... He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong. Mr. Sulu: full power descent! You tricked me. Thank you. For everything. Beam me up, Scotty. I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The frequency . You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century. All I need is the radio frequency to track them. Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now? Calm yourself, Nurse. Scotty, get us out of here! A spaceship with a missing man. ... Damn! ... Gone?! We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam... It's all real. Look. The storage tanks for the whales. Steady, now. We need your help. Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in... Right. Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be. Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them. It wouldn't be my first choice, no. You asked. Now, will you tell me something? George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency? Noon tomorrow...?! Then tell me when the whales are leaving. You want the details? That's what you think. Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species. All right. The truth? No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space. Who do you think I am? Tell me when the whales are going to be released? What's what? What do you mean now? It's not so much a matter of a place as of time. Hm? If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner? You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted. Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them? How will that be done, exactly? You're upset about losing the whales. So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist? Implicitly. It's his way. Just a little joke. See you later, old friend. Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best. In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine. We can't tell you. Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales. No, ma'am. No dipshit. What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances. What's going to happen when you release the whales? Can I ask you something? Iowa. Memory problems, too. Thanks. We don't want to be any trouble. He's harmless. Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS. There's really very little point in my trying to explain. Back to San Francisco. I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help... How soon? Why's that? It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky... You mean man... You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we sink . Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?! Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands. Spock: Condition report! Then... Where the hell are we? Spock... Did braking thrusters fire? Can we make breakaway speed!? You? Spock, that's extraordinary. Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales. Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program? Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me? Right. Will you help us? Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...? Thank you, Spock. Our mission ! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about that !! Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them! That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two? Status? He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever. It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving. ... I see. They have a right to be... Do you think they'll help us? What else did you learn from your mind meld? You've done it before. Can't you remember? You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate. And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth. Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it. About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them. Spock... Come on, fellah -- speak up! Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins.... You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period. Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question? Yes. ... Simple logic. I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie. Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales. How do you propose to solve this minor problem? And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it. How much? Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically. But you said toxic. Explain. Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device! Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit. Well done, Mr. Spock. Earth... But when?... Spock? You've programmed that from memory...? What are the variables...? Surely you can be more specific... What is our target in time? Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command. Mr. Spock, your computations? But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative? That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth. Is there any other planet where this species exists? Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated? Whales? Spock...? Where are you going?! Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors? Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man? Well, I... find that understandable I mean, you've been through a lot. Station, please. Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...? Permission granted. Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu. Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can -- Picture, Uhura! Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up! Mark, Mr. Sulu... Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power. Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz! Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero. Go, Mr. Sulu. We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem. Picture, please. What is our condition? Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?! Steady!!... Now, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed! Steady as she goes... Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort? Weapons systems? Out of control, and blind as a bat! Mr. Scott -- how soon? Estimate range, ship to whales! On screen. Put them on screen! Bearing! Uhura!... Where! Uhura, you did what was necessary. Keep trying. You'll find him... Any luck...? Everyone remember where we parked. We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales? Right. Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before. From a city? That doesn't make sense.... On speakers. Then, this is what it would sound like underwater? On screen! What is it? Mr. Sulu? Systems report. Communications? Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship. Go on ahead... Close the hatch! The explosive override -- ? The whales...?! On my way...! Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future... Mr. Sulu, if you please. Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of - Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems... Mr. Sulu, impulse climb. Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed? How long, Scotty? Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure? Mr. Sulu? Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better! Oh I see -- Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out. What is it? I thought I told you never to call me -- I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this! Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized? Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott. It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott. You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them. Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece. Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks. That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water? Scotty, how long is this bay? Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott. Prepare for departure. Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway? Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye. You will be in good hands here. Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling? Thank you, Lt. Saavik.We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race! Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation! Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself! The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people! We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!We are launching everything we have. We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand... Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.No! No... What did you have in mind...? Please... Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything? Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive. Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit? ... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...! Transparent aluminum? Just use the keyboard... ... Are you joking? That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock. Sill? What else would I be working with? ... Yes? Of course. If you'll follow me, Professor -- With pleasure. Professor Scott, if you'll -- Millions?All right, then this is old stuff to you. Right on. You fly? Hi.Do you have the right to murder? Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events? Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets. Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President. Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother? As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect. Your associates are people of good character. It is not an effort. You are my son. Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises. I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only. Negative. It's impacting on all our systems! Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts? Admiral, you'll be trapped! It's under water! There's no way to reach it... No power to the bay doors. You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off... The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium. Full power, sir. Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work... I'll have to re-energize. Admiral! There be whales here! 10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1. Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve... Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before. I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie... I'll try, sir. Scott out. Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he. It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow. Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now. Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century. Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home. They're giving out. De-crystallizing. Two? Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight? Humpbacked - people.? I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim? About 60 feet, Admiral. We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach. Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard. That's the ticket, laddie. The keyboard... How quaint. Hello? Computer...? Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh? Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water? I notice you're still working with polymers. Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer you . I will. Can my assistant come, too? Well, that's different. I demand to see the owners! I demand -- Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --Humans make illogical decisions... I would accept that as an axiom. I do this because I was there, To Earth. To offer testimony. As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them. The question is irrelevant. I do not understand the final question... You're saying... It is a compliment. ... I don't think he understands... "Guessing" is not in my nature... ... Best shot...? Acceleration is no longer a constant. Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve. Hamlet, Act I scene 4. That is what I said, Doctor. 10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact. Specifically, Humpback Whales. There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man. Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile... Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress. A joke is a story with a humorous climax. It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference. I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines. ... My shoes... Uhura is busy. I am monitoring. Is there something wrong with the one I have? Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor? I was not. The hell they did. They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales. Attempting the hell to communicate. To hunt a species to extinction is not logical. I will, Admiral. No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional. They did, Admiral. Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory. Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will... Make a guess . Admiral, you must wait one damn minute. No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do. Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov. Admiral. Full power is restored. In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail. No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call. The tank will be finished by morning... I meant -- How will playing cards help? I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions. They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man. The hell I can't Exaggerate. I cannot tell a lie. I see. Why not? Yes? Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction. Ah... The giants. For example? Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth... Admiral, may I ask you a question? As you observed, a primitive Culture. How do you know this...? Simple logic will suffice. We need a map. That one should do. Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy? Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels... We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically. If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some. There is a 20th Century possibility. Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time. Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century. I have. Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin. Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory. The late 20th Century. Ready to engage computer, Admiral. In progress, Admiral. There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales. That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily. The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past. The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish. As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales. To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion. A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire. I seem to have misplaced my uniform. Thank you, Admiral. Permission to come aboard. Tell her I feel fine... They are my friends. Most kind, Father. It is kind of you to make this effort. Father...?Arigato. Sayonara. Thank you, honorable sir. Sulu Hikaru. Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii. Yes, this must be true. You talk funny. Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?
