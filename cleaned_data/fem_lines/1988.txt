Figure it out?!?! I'll be insane before I figure it out. The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep. Not while he's using me. I can't go back to sleep again. It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake. I can't find him. It was bad. Kristen... What? What's wrong? Rick...I can't. But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that. I don't want to. What? Kristen, what happened? You what? When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert. I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control. No really, it's a fable. The 'guardian of good' dreams. It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up. My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master? I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad. I'm sure they're around. Here you are. Where were you this morning? Rick's looking all over for you. Then you saw him, too? You've been up all night? We have matching luggage. I know. I know. I hardly have any time to study. You in a hurry? Save it for later. Come on! Debbie. She's gone. I've...collected her, like the others. Here we are. He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him. It's okay, we're just about there. You just feel sorry for me. He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him. Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us. Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't. You don't really get it. He's not a nightstalker. It'll take more than bench presses to beat him. I don't think so. I guess this is my own war. Not really. Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy. Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me. Someone to bring them to him. Three days. The story is, the deaths you can't argue with. Look, you know why, you just don't believe me. I've been working double shifts. No, don't! I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead! I was there in the dream. He took her. It was awful. It was awful... It was no suicide. It was not an accident. It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths. I know. Uh...Alice. Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well. No... I saw it. It was my dream. I brought Sheila in... It was Freddy. I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them. Rick, please.No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play. We've always been here. Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me! He... he loved me. No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick! Yes! Kyle, you don't have... Because I'm going to get my father! I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way! Get out of the way. You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got... What do you mean? What? The box. I need the box. Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway. And you're sure it was a woman? Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh? No bad dreams. Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy. I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised. Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help! I... I had a visitor. God, that's terrible. What's the matter with her? You a doctor, too? Well... G'bye. No. Don't let it. You've come this far. Finish what? What are you talking... You were ALL human! It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think! No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU. No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information. Wait! And what about you? I've come for my father! But I didn't open it! I didn't! The Cenobites. I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came. The mattress... The mattress... JULIA. He talked about Demons, huh? I thought Steve had talked to you? What are you talking about? Who are you? Steve... Where am I?Oh, Adam, don't tease her. You never got an A in science in your life! 3:30 I guess. Just a hunch. We've been given a gift here, honey. A real live little girl. She likes us a lot. She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to things . The house, antiques, your model. Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone. You can build another one... with her. Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls. She's just... missed out on some love, that's all... You know, I've been thinking. I could teach Lydia to sew. Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here. You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers. If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful... Adam ! Why did you build a whorehouse? Have you ever been to...? He might have hurt somebody. Who did the sushi? The sushi? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi? I don't care, I've changed my mind. ... I feel really confident. We're getting better at this stuff. We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight! I've got an idea. You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it. I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there. No, we don't. We can work something out ourselves. We just have to try harder. Honey. Let's go. She's only fourteen... Maybe we should knock first? Oh, Adam. I don't have gloves. My nails keep getting longer. I'll break them. Bet... el... geuse. What an awful name. I thought it was like -- you know. The juice of beetles . What happened? Betelgeuse ! ... Yes this must be him. Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse... Here's something. Then it should be here. Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam? Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot! Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her. You know you're really a pretty girl. Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors. I feel really stupid. God, this is so corny. Have we been reduced to this? Sheets? That guy is in our cemetery. Oh, Adam. We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were -- Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone. No. But it's somewhere without big worms. Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife. Draw door? I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book. I don't know... what are you looking up? We don't know who he is... ... I'm going to talk to that little girl. We're not going to wait here like cornered animals. I can tell you that. We need help. I'm going to talk to that little girl. But she saw us. I could feel it. That little girl saw us. That's it? No number, or instructions? Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something. Death didn't improve your sense of humor. We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people. I know. I'm sorry. Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone. Whatever it is it can't be worse than this. No, I'm not putting up with this. We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey. Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do? Adam, we are in hell. I hate these people. I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever! At least we won't have to worry about her. Just says 'won't.' Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.' She can't see you, right? In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead. What's she doing here? Dishes? We haven't eaten in three weeks! Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around people , get out to the church and go grocery shopping. In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper. I can't clean anything. The vacuum is out in the garage. I can't leave the house. Why don't they tell us something? Where are all the other dead people in the world? Why is it just you and me? There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to last ? I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics. I don't think we survived the crash. De ceased . I don't know where it came from. Yes it did. Yes it did. I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one. That's how long you were gone. Two hours. Oh, Adam. We're home. In our own house. Nonsense. I'll make some coffee. You get some more firewood. I am sitting. I'm not sure. It feels... frozen. This fire wasn't burning when we left the house. Oh... I'm sorry... You're doing it, Adam. You're saving this town. Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty. Adam! Wave at the lion. I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone. Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family. Oh no. Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home. Helen got it for me in Oslo. Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it. You've finished the streets? I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing? I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have killed him. Home. Home . Home ! Just one daughter. Just get some people out of our house. We're... What about Betelgeuse? About what? Our cemetery? What do you mean? What's he do? If... we have trouble. What about the guy in the flyer? Betelge... No. Yes. We're very unhappy. We need help. We deserve help. Are you Juno, our case worker? How'd you do on the science test? So, never let Beetle Juice out. Never. Besides... We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too. No you don't! No... Lydia... Why? No, Lydia, we're dead. No, wait! Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here. We can't. We haven't left the house since the funeral. Tell the truth. We're practicing. If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits. 'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks. And live in what, our station wagon? Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling. No! Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning! That's right, Jane. Complete vacation.Not these people! They are ruthless! I think she's in with them. Just don't tell Lydia. Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration. Otho'll know what to do. I feel like we've been at war, Charles. Lydia, at your age, you are so young . Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door. Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission? I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese. Is there no Szechuan up here? Hunan? It's Otho ! Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors. You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry. It doesn't matter. What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud. I am going to teach you something here Lydia. You've got to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all over you. Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never lived ! All right, you dead people! Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with! Of course we weren't scared. Just a little startled. One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali. Tried to convince me that this house is haunted. Kids. Kids. Kids! I love them. Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon. Don't you dare . Don't you dare talk to others about me. I'm an artist ! The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends. Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone. I can't believe you are doing this to me! Ghosts . I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight. Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic. My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for Architectural Digest . In fact, no one here tonight has not been in Vanity Fair . Except you. Joke! Joke! Aspirin! It doesn't matter what brand. You jerks ! That is my art, and it is dangerous ! You think I want to die like that? Lydia. Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs. We'll be the art center of summer New York. I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture. And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it. This is our first meal in this house, Lydia. Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one? What's happening to them? Are they still here, Otho? Look at the tiny figures. It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in sheets ! She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin... No ! Do not encourage this little... person. Probably the world's largest Reader's Digest collection! C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience. Entirely bare. Maybe Charles does. Attic space. That's Charles' study. But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it. He's such a sheep. Otho, I can not live with these cheap domestic floor tiles. Oh my God ! Of course, her favorite color! How beautiful ! Viridian? What is...? What do you think? I know ... I read your book, The Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf . Okay? What's wrong? The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started? I'm so glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.Oh puh-leeze! So can I? I got an A! I got it. And I took pictures of the new church for you, too. Really. I don't know. Wait a minute. I had some licorice ice cream earlier. You guys could be gas. What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas? God, if this is true this is like, amazing! I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes? You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you? My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don't you leave? And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody? You did this? You carved all these little figures and houses and things? Stepmother. I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles. Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom? I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through Handbook for the Recently Deceased . It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... I am strange and unusual. Is this like a trick question? Night of the Living Dead ? It's this gross movie. I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are sheets . Are you gross under there? Are you Night of the Living Dead under there? Like all bloody veins and pus? A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic? It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way. I said it was against my religion. I got a C. Step... mother. Life is just... too awful. I want to be dead too. He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you. I hate you! I can't trust anybody! I don't wear that stuff to bed . Besides, there's nothing wrong with it. I'm getting out of here. Funeral. God, you guys really are dead ! What was it like? The funeral. Did you cry? I always tell the truth. Of course I can see you. You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet? Your qu...? But you're... W... What is it? ... I will. You've got to help them. They'd look silly on me. I'm fourteen years old! No I don't. I don't take orders from smurfs. You were the snake! Right? I know. I saw you. God, you're anatomically correct! Your name is Beetle Juice ? Yecch! That's as bad as Deee lia Deee tz. I am not ! Beetle... Juice? Breakfast beetle? Beetle? Beetle fruit? Fruit bat? Fruit battle? Volkswagen? Fruit wagon? Beetle! I don't know what that signal means. Your fingers are so small I can't see them. First word -- two syllables. Three syllables. Yes. I... I don't know what your name is. Yeah. Well, it can't be any worse than my life here. I think so. I want to get in. Are you a spirit too? Where'd they go? Of course they're dead. They're ghosts. Mr. and Mrs. Maitland? I've come for the last time. Where are you? Barb... They're... not here anymore. I can't bring the ghosts. They're not here! I cannot believe this. Come on. Leave their stuff alone. Listen, you guys. These ghosts are really nice people. I think we scared them off. Let's just leave them alone. Okay? They're ghosts. They do what they want. This is not a joke ! That sheet was full of ghosts. Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest -- Stepmother's... Dad. Do you believe me? Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw. I'm lonely. Stepmother. I was just trying to open the door. Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key. Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers. Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn. My whole life is a darkroom! One ... big... dark... room. Delia hates it. I'm sorry already. Shhhh. They didn't commit suicide. I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared -- It wasn't a joke. I saw some ghosts. I told them you were too mean to be afraid. Any particular kind? I say let's keep it the way it is. I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food. It's okay. How's the dirt business? Yes, but I'm going to live at home. Is this the key to the attic? What happened to the people who used to live here? Adam ! Adam ! Their wedding clothes. Wait a minute! What am I worried about? Otho, you can't even change a tire! That's slavery and murder. You don't know these people. They're just like you and me. They're nice people! The attic. They don't want to come down. Otho, that's terrible. Hold your breath and we'll pull.Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much. Neither will I. Well I guess this is it. That's great! It's Skip, for you. --but you're father's in there! So am I. Nuke, honey, we need to talk-- You don't have to... Oh--won't YOU come in? it's okay.. He did? What'd he say? Nuke! You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball. Ask Crash. Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are cute! I wanta be exotic and mysterious! Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it-- Aren't I pretty? I'm trying to play with your body! Oh... Crash is a very smart man. Now c'mon, honey, give it a try. What a nasty thing to say. Yes I do... Sure. Unsnap my stockings. I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love. That's my leg. I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie... I'll tuck you in. How 'bout a back rub? I'm so proud of you and all the guys. Want some more soup? Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh-- Get over here. Nuke?! Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right? Breathing through your pingala always works, honey-- I'm yours. Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke-- You haven't been wearing my panties, have you? Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing to be scared of. It's just another way of living. It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training. It's all the same thing. Much better. Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me. This is progress. A little better. He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six. You're patronizing me! I will not be patronized-- Right. Okay, fire a couple in there. The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball. And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch. The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril. There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida". The pingala starts with the left testicle and ends at the right nostril. The right nostril. Good. Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through? Good. Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous. Let's play catch. What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me? Don't I look nice? They did when they were in the Carolina League. You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side. They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters. I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch. There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game. Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever. Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that. You can learn to like it. You see how nice things are when we go slow? Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name? Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things. I didn't say "Crash". I said Nuke. We all deserve to wear white. No, no--I'm fine. Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed? Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you. Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he? That's better. Got the radar ready? You didn't get "lured". Women never get lured. They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions". --Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse. It'll just get everybody in trouble. I can do that, too. What? You'd be great, just great... 'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an' all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it... Not yet. It takes years of practice... Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the witches were? I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball. What happened? It doesn't work like that. God, you're gorgeous. Want to dance? ... so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think? I heard already. Whatta you mean "why not"? Are you gonna play forever?! Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure. No. It's true, It's true! Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash? If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home. Don't you see? If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is! Thurman Munson. He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ... And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition! So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball. I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother... And I saw him. I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home... God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me? This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid! I said when I think about you, I get wet. I'm ready for a complicated man. Crash, I get wet just thinking about you. I don't imagine there's much I could teach you. I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me. I want you desperately! He won't make love to me anymore. I want to be had. Don't you think I'm pretty? He' s confused-- Crash...I want you. I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman. You got me all confused. Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous. Damn. Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it. Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! The record's But they're nice hips. I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great! Damn. Young men are uncomplicated. And he's not "dim". He's just inexperienced. My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues. I'm committed to Nuke for the season. You had your chance the other night. But you were pulling your hips last night. I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius. See my hips? I'm not interested yet. Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date. I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'. Oh my... Don't leave... What do you believe in? Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction. There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart. These are the ground rules. I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training... And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far. So... I thought we should get to know each other. Crash, I didn't think you-- I don't trust a man who don't dance. It ain't natural. Annie Savoy. Wanta dance? Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson. Big mistake... He looks wonderful, Jackson... That's not necessary, Jackson--- Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign. Oh dear....easy honey... It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through. Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings. He looks great, just great! Three-fourteen? Hmmm... Look't those thighs, Jackson Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he? She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will ... Oh let's not... Praise the Lord, eh? He's a good student. Uh oh... Can I offer you some coffee? Shh, shh... "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them" Good--then listen. "I sing the body electric. The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--" Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars. Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman? You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on? No, no, honey... first the shoes and socks. When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch. Shh. I love this part. No, no, no. Put it back on and take it off slowly. No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me. You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down. Oh both of you, of course... Well--you boys stopped fighting yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right? Shall we go to my place? You need a nickname. You got a live arm there.No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream. We never did it when we were kids, remember? Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all. But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own. He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too. I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note... I was on my way down the stairs... It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody. Nor have I. Even though you disappeared... But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous. You still live in Rome? Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa. My husband...you know him. All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then... One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores. I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children? Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him. Don't be silly...I'm old. Don't look at me like that, please. Why'd you come back? The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus. He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me. No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father. So what'd they say? I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here... You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!! For what? But...who... Father, I have sinned... Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye. Hi. Why are you running? Elena. My name's Elena.Rachel! Rachel! I can't. Come on. Rachel come on. Oh Rachel! Can we go home soon Rachel? No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night? This is great Rachel. Come on. I thought you said you were ready. Come on Rachel! Rachel, can I go get my costume on? He's coming to get me Rachel. It was the nightmare man Come on Rachel. The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after? I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids. Hi. Double scoops? I don't want to. But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't. I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out. Your lucky. I wish she could do the same for me. It's been eleven months. Sure it does. Like a real sister? Like a sister? Do you love me Rachel? I can't sleep. You don't believe that do you? Then we'll be safe? Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.Brady! Come with us! Brady! Brady! Brady! Brady! Come with us. Brady! Brady! What does that mean? I don't know! She's not dead! Not without Jamie. 10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle. Michael Myers. We've been better. Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties. So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys. Just leave me alone and lets forget it. You don't owe me anything. I don't know Brady. My parents are going to come home early tonight. Don't get angry. This morning. So I have to watch Jamie tonight. My parents baby-sitter canceled. Its about tonight. We need to talk. Jamie needs a Halloween costume. I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard. You guys always look great. What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself. Can't you find somebody else? Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is. Mom, please Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter? I've got you come on, go down. Well try dammit! I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie? No. Jamie! Real soon, Jamie. Now shh. Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock. Had enough? Jamie, wait for me. I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go. Coming. Yeah, hurry up. What? Jamie, what happened? In a second. You bet. But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating. You ready for some Ice Cream? Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast. How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream? It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy? Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating. Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal. Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment. But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight. Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed. Come on Sunday. Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age. I bet you didn't know that. I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long. We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less. Jamie, sometimes it's... Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you. What is this? Four nights in a row? You going for a record here? The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame? Kido. It's four in the morning. Don't you mean what you do best? You knew. You just didn't care. Hi. Call me. Jamie? I don't know. Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything. Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that. I don't want to look pushy. No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today. You remember Lindsay don't you? Don't touch him Jamie! Sheriff Meeker, we killed him. Uh huh. Okay. Sheriff, what is going on out there? What's going on?My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me. Don't play with me. Take this off. No. I only needed the code from you. They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment? Let me get you another glass of wine. Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you? How's the villa's security? We did a pretty good job of pissing them off. A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume? What's an A.I. Easy... Hold on. You're out of time, man. What is it? My God... these people are insane. We've still got to find the mainframe. ...And if I guess wrong? Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom? When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it? Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since. I know. For Peter, that's a short trip. He projects with neural implants. Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera. Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show. So... did you get a look at heaven? You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined. Case... Are you alright? What's wrong? Don't like flying? Give me five minutes. I'll get the car. Yeah. Case... it's four a.m. Case... Put the gun down, Case. Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you. You okay? Okay fine. Let's get this over with. Dixie McCoy didn't. Won't that mean you're dead? Too late? A regular Fagan. So you're a wire junkie. What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high. If the splices aren't good, you could fry. You're not ready yet. They said two days. Go ahead... Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned. That's not going to help. Couple of days. They'll examine you. We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out. Almost two days. Hey... you're not supposed to be up. You've been calling her name. What's that supposed to mean? I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something. For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever. Couple of months. Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition. Sorry. That's not gonna happen. What is it? You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man. Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales. His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you. Shut up. How are you at riddles, Peter? Get up. Like what? Who? Peter... What do you think you're doing?Well, I'll be... Oh, a ladies man, huh? Yeah... We don't serve formula. Snookums. Familiar. Be careful, Eddie. Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks. Are you gonna call him, Eddie? I was hopin' you'd be there. Maroon's called here about four times. He says he's gotta talk to you tonight. He says he can help you. Sounds like singin'. Got me. But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs. Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again. I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate. The rabbit's wife? Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you? What was that ? Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate? Maybe they just took it out of his pocket. So what's the scam, Eddie? Can you get him out of it, Eddie? So you decided to help him after all? It's all yours. He's a riot. Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is? So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed? The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie. Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages. Do you think the rabbit did it? Bastards put him on notice. A new outfit bought the Red Car. Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries. Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time. R.K. Maroon. Is this paper even good? This is fifty bucks. I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow. So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a dame who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump. And it was a dame who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would. And it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!Eddie, come on. He made me laugh. Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli... When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper. Marvin told me. Doom was after his land. Ne was afraid. That's why he brought me his will. Where is he? I didn't know who I could trust. It was Doom who killed Acme, you know? Don't worry, you're not the first. We better get out of here. That's not Roger. It's one of Doom's men. He killed R.K. Maroon. If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now? It's the truth. Why won't you believe it? I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way. Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant. You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do. No, no, no... I love my husband. You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger. Can you help me find him? I'll pay you anything. Toons aren't given imperfections. Oh... well, I... I just had to see you. Hello, Mr. Valiant. I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it. Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that's what he was after?Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment. Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily. Of course. You're leaving? And you...? Do you love Enzo? Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him. I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods. Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"? I can't... I just don't know how to... No. Yes. ... I'm pregnant, Bonita! Yes. Not like Enzo. ... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little. Yes, isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy. I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world! No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition. Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant. Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me... ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have... One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars. But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me? I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business. Italian is practically the same thing. I tried him, he can't go. His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss. We have to send somebody over there immediately! If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook. There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily. Yes! The notary is a phony. He has the same signature as the contractor! The documents are forged. The mafia! La Cosa Nostra! Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily! ... So am I. Like a popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick until spring. Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say? What kind? Is he alright? What happened? Five minutes and fifty seconds. Why? ... Not yet. How do you know that? He can learn. He is learning. A little... You think it's the same for Jacques? I won't, I swear. Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?! You know what I'm talking about. Enzo, why do you guys do this? What are you doing here? Enzo! Is it a poem? Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques. The Mamma's there too. ... It's a comfortable place. Yes... Well, good night, then... Enzo, stop bitching, will you? Congratulations, Enzo. Okay. ... That's what he's here for, isn't he? No. And just where are you from? I get it, Enzo you were a superior child. What was he like, when he was little? Have you known him long? You'll be lovely, but no thanks. Jacques, would you do a native dance for me? You forgot the Hula! No. Congratulations. In a lake. I think I'll have a coffee. I wish, but it's full. They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full. What's going on here? Johana Cross, pleased to meet you. Well! Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here. It's incredible! Yes. Hello! The guy in the Halloween suit! Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing? ... both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles? Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible. Does anybody live to make a second? Don't you have a heater? Promise you won't forget me. Promise me one thing. You are the father. Jacques? I'm pregnant. You've got to tell me what happened? Why? ... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like? No, I'll be fine. Can you just hand me a glass of water? It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged. Jacques...? What are you doing? ... Nothing. You'll try again tomorrow? And you? I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis. Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here. Okay. In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice. You sure? I'm being a pain, huh? It's me again. No... tell me. Then, tell me a story. Well, then, talk to me some more. So have I. ... Hello? I got fired. It's me... Johana. Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me. Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea. I'm going back home. Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud...? I feel proud and all I did was watch. Jacques, you set a world record. Can I come watch you dive tomorrow? How do you know that? How can you tell it's a female? No? Huh? Yes, of course!! I'd better get back now. Just checking up on your family. I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well... Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins... Only to help the medics, I assure you. Lucky I was there to save you. ... Especially the sneakers. You look adorable. I thought you'd be at the dinner. I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best? Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you. You're going to be very busy these days aren't you? I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here. Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great! ... Okay. I'll try. I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo. I work for an insurance company. So, I decided to take a few days off. I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous. Thank you. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything. No... in the hut. We saw each other a little while ago. Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed? I've been a jerk, right? I should have stayed! I was supposed to be in love... I was in love! I am in love, why did I act like a bitch? He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy. It was too good to be true. I know, I know! I'm a terrible person... It's... I'm so damn, damn sad. No. I'm just depressed. Way past it. Don't be a jerk. There's no such thing as love at first sight. Haven't you been listening? It's his heartbeat. Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess. What? You called the police? I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time? Again? ... Sally? But doesn't Jacques dive without anything? What's that little air bottle on the machine? ... And those? If there was a problem, they could do something right? What are they for? I'll go see how he's doing. Wait! Professor...? You've made me a happy insurance person. Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible. We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete. Okay? Will he understand Spanish? Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something? Why is he doing this? How long can he stay down? Without breathing? But... how is he going to breathe? I'll have to talk to the driver. That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake? Who... Who is that?Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya? What is it honey... the frenchy? You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been... Does that have a hidden meaning? ... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales... or are you still over your limit? ... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love. I thought you said he was Peruvian? Oh Jesus...! I'll make some coffee. They left the stove. Okay... Who'd you meet? How was your trip? Well? They're going to send detectives. Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay? ... And the new stereo. They got the new T.V. You're back! Hello. We were burgled. I changed the lock you son of a bitch!I'll think about it. Now run along darling. When - you're a big boy. I mean you know it's bad for you Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college Servants. Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us' Darling? I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night. Now you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell. As above, so below. Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter. I will! But I need help! He's no magician. Patience, Willow. Time is running out. No! I can still defeat Bavmorda! Just do it! Get down!

A magician makes magic. Any fool can use it. Did you give that acorn its power? Kill him! Kill him! What do you want! Who are you! Who are you!
