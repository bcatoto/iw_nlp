...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks. ...Office 2702. Give me his name, I will mail him. He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$. What's that man's name? ...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him. No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive. ...What? No. No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way. Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see. No? You say it just to calm me! No, no! I don't want to go! I don't want! No! I don't want to leave you!! How shall we get out now, Leon? I don't know... Five minutes. Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know? I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example... And forgetting all this... Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it? What do you do, with the money you earn? May I ask you a personal question? Yes. ...That's awful. I hope you killed, that asshole? Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you? You met anyway? Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me? I won't get shocked. I'm used to this! My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it! And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception! Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately? How many girlfriends did you have? ...Don't you like me? ...Don't you drink? Of course! I'm fine! I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up... I tried to get beautiful! Don't you like it? Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost. I love you so much, Leon. I don't grow up any more. I just get older. You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around. Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting! There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two! Risky business, isn't it? Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs! Yeah... There's a lot on TV. A little... Friends? You're crazy! In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more. That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other. ...I'd like knowing what he's listening to... It's cool departing this way... warm... music... Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks. What shall we do? OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract? ...OK. I love you anyway. When I say I love you. ...You don't believe me, don't you? Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us. ...I'm going to kiss you. And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception? If you knew, Leon...! I killed one thousand in my head... And this never disturbed my sleep. Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day? Why? ...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out! I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all. For musicals? That's part of the job! May I go to the cinema? Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now. You said I learn very quickly. Yes. ...Because I feel it. It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me... I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you! You were scared, weren't you? OK. There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it? It's incredible! How did you do it? Yes, yes... The yellow and pink. OK. Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do? The fat man down there, on the bench. Who'll I aim at? Wow! It's brilliant! Oh really? But can you miss the car? What if you can't approach the car or he changes car? What, for example? How can you say it? Huh... 500 meters? OK, I'm fine. I have no fear. Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost... It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch. ...I got lost, Mister. Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle! ...No... he's my lover... Yeah, but he's not exactly my father... ...Composer. I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music. Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise. I'm sick with practicing, that's it... Fine... Can I sit on the stairways now? ...And how much is it? Huh? Why?NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH! It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there! I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!! Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together. I certainly did. NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER! FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE! Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me! Socially... I'll have a beer. One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking". I certainly was not! No, I don't. But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER! I didn't do it! What did you just say? It's not fair!! MOTHERFUCKER!! GODDAMN YOU! Alright, I'll try... "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me. I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language. Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me! Who is this? FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!! FUCK YOU! The police are tracing your call right this minute. You bitch! Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE! Hello.This is so silly. But, Chip... Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies. Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work. CHIP!! CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word! I'm happy too and we want you to be happy. Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf! Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart? PLEEEASE? Bye, Birdie. Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you. No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home. Oh God, really! This is the limit! Chip, honey? Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that. Oh, honey! It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey. Amen to that. It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?! It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast. Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it! Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah! Ooohhhh! Oooohhhh. Oohhhh, Eugene! You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird... We can be real quiet... We have to concentrate on life, Eugene. Don't I get a kiss? I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore. Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... Chip, your ride is here. Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly. See the little birdie? Listen to his call. Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down! That's nice. Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night... ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks". ...People who don't mind their own business. Yes, I did. What a mess. I know Dottie! Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane? Let the record show I'm just standing here. So you admit you just lied? So you do drink? You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking? So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls? Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink? And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up. I'll take care of poor Rosemary! Dottie! Watch what you're doing! PUSSY-willows, Dottie! Are those pussy-willows? Just a half-a-cup. Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles... COCKSUCKER! Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore! I know it's hard but we need the exact words. What exactly does this sick individual say to you? Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls. I beg your pardon? Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face? Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you? Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way? Is this the Cocksucker residence? You got your wish. 0h, that's horrible, honey. I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!! It's just not your day, is it Rosemary? Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em! No, honey, it's the police. Hello, officers. Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know. We all have bad nights. And who may I ask is Carl? You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... That's not gum in your mouth, is it? Who wants fruit salad? Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle? And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they? That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it? Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?! Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted? Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go? Ewwww! Thank you, Rosemary. You want me to keep that under the table for you? Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling? I'm not that bad a driver. Look at her hair! Turn it off, honey. Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle? Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle? Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine. Thanks for remembering. No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins. Certainly not! He is assistant manager of a video shop... What is it, Mr. Stubbins? He's a good boy. Bon Appetit! Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins. A little something I baked. Right here! Murder, honey. From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user. Yes you are. You forgot something... I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!No... I don't have room in my kitchen... Yes... but... I didn't... Yes, but I lent it... NO! I could never hurt anyone! I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped! ...Browsing. Beverly, honey, you've got some... ...do-do on your shoe. If you wouldn't mind... It was on sale. I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced! That's like your car, Beverly, Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning. It's the least I could do. I heard shouting. Beverly, are you alright? I'll take this instead. Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! I'll give you fifty cents. Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.Keep the change, you son of a psycho! I don't feel like rewinding it! Why? There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures. Do you have the musical, "Annie"?We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one! How to send a bill!! Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you. What was that?I can't leave. I'm already there, remember? What makes you think things will be any different this time? I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time. Yes, where would you go? Why would you want to leave? Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here. Wherever he wanted to be. All of us. When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind. I am on the Enterprise. I am also here. Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind. Enjoy them, Jean-Luc. For you. This is where you wanted to be. You're in the Nexus. Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again. It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me. I knew things about people, about events, about time. I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt. That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either. Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus. Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.Like weird calls, by any chance? And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened? Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script? Yes, but... What? And I...I've got other things happening. So I don't know about horror. I don't know, Bob. I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now. You mean that was a... Can I read it? The nightmares. Which means he's having nightmares again? I thought he'd stopped doing horror. I thought you'd killed Freddy off. Don't speed, Chase. It's not... Yes. Chase. Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up? Like Freddy. He was just acting very strange. He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me. He was acting like... He's had some sort of...episode. Chase, it's Dylan! Chase, you'd better come home. Chase. Hi... Guess so. Just be careful, okay? It was nothing. We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong. Terry and Chuck were...hurt. You were almost... You were even cut. What if it isn't over? No, you don't. Maybe. Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today. Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough. More or less. Dylan, time to get dressed. I'm late. Dylan, it's breakfast. Not arts and crafts What? One of mom's cups got broken. No biggie, really. Chase... He sleepwalks, you idiot! He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital. Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home... He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet. You don't understand. If Dylan falls asleep,then... I want my kid out of here now! DO you mind... Everything is not fine! He was just here! Doctor... They are...it happened in tonight's quake. It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it. It was an earthquake and it was dark. I have no idea. Oh my God... Is he all right? Like what? Does he have to stay here over night? No... No. No. Yes. It's a story. A story for a movie. What...what is that? Dylan, where's the man? You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!? Promise. Cross my heart. But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep. That's right. So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you. Tell you what. I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now. You know home isn't far from here, right? I know he is, sweetie. We'll both go get Rex right now. You okay, champ? Home, that's right. I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby. No, I don't think so. You just have to...pray, or reach... And...what's the man doing? Your bed? You've got to sleep, Dylan, you... Dylan, you go back to sleep now. Mommy's fine, Dylan. Just had a bad dream. What're you doing out of bed? Right. He's on his way. Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight. Who? They were safe and could sleep. Tomorrow night. Time for sleep. This is going to give you nightmares. "...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire. 'We will bake cookies first,' she said. 'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough. Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside." Dylan, this is too violent. I don't know why you like these stupid old tales. Rex? Who's Rex? Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me? What? Just for a few hours. Julie'll be with you. You have a fever, sweetie? When do you think it'll be done? Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance? Yeah...how'd you know? It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares. Holding my own. You know that guy who was calling me all the time? He's started again. He's been putting stuff in my mail. In what, a romantic comedy? I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all. I'm fine. Fred Krueger did it. I know how Chase really died. Where's Dylan?! Have you seen him? John. Will you please just look for him around the hospital? I'm gonna go right to the house. Will you help me, John? Please! Dylan's run away from the hospital. I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house. But I think Freddy's after him. I know it sounds crazy! John. It's Heather. I need help! You really think Dylan's okay? Really? A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice. Freddy, for all I know. I've never mentioned it to him. It's in my family, you know. My grandmother died in an institution... That's my memory. And it seemed absolutely real. Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in... I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted. I just can't believe it's him. I mean, and not something outside, influencing him. Or is that how denial works? What...happened? I want to see for myself. I want to see the body. Yes. Yes? I just can't. I'm sorry, I can't. No. I...listen, I can't make it in today. Hi. This is Heather Langenkamp. No, I don't think that at all. How is he? No, Rex is not going to die. Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you? Thanks. Just give them the time he called. They're keeping a list, supposedly. Sorry. My nerves are so raw these days. Dunno. Just have this feeling today... Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry. I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think. Little one, but... Choice? What kind of choice? You know damn well it's more than that now! How can we stop him? Dylan. And... Chase. My God, Wes, did you know? That was Nancy, not me! Me? Why me? Isn't there anyone that can stop him? Then what is he doing? If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go? Another age? Another form? You saying Freddy's this ancient thing? Like the Genie in the bottle. Captured? How? Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses? This is still a script we're talking about, right? What's that? Robert? I... Of course he is. Freddy's dead and gone. My child? No...but... No, not really. I... I don't know if it has, really. With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it. I'm working in television now. The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy. Black's fine. Coffee'd be nice. Now? Uh...sure...when? Oh, hi. I'm fine, Sara. My God, a voice from the past! Yes?No, don't! I feel nauseous. You two better quit it. It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know? And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work. I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me. Awww. That was so cute. You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been. I'll try to manage. Such a sordid state of affair. You're kidding. Why aren't there any lights? Can I use the bathroom? God, isn't he great? So where is he? Dick. A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try. You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite. You can hold me down. What can I say? He does weird things to me. She said not to come home until graduation. You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching? You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in. Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter. Oh God... I can't believe this! I feel faint... I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick! This isn't fucking funny, Dante! Stop this. This isn't funny. We didn't just have sex in the bathroom? Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal? And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so... God! That was so great! When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything. Promise me it'll always be like that. Do you always talk weird after you violate women? How'd you get here so fast? I'm easy, but I'm not that easy. See you later, handsome. Well, me I guess. So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you. You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang. Where'd he go? I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog. I can already tell this isn't going to work. You're such an asshole. I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again. And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you. He's not invited. Sang. Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words. How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. You mean, on a date? I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. You work in a market, all right. It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it. You're serious. You want to date again. I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. Good. Stay in that frame of mind. I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? Look how full of yourself you are. You don't have anything to do with it. Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? I just told you. Stop it. He's a nice guy. I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff. I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway... I'm giving him his ring back. No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. I love a macho fa�ade. It's such a turn-on. What smells like shoe polish? Was I right? Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. No. Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones. I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby. Well... kind of, sort of? I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month... I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up. I'm not pregnant. It's not what you think. You saw it? You're just going to lock the store like that? Train. It took eight hours. I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris. Dante. You've got a customer. Just now.Did he say "making fuck?" That doesn't sound metal. What did he say? No way! He only speaks Russian? No way. He's your cousin? Scumbag. What are you doing?Does he sing in English or Russian? He really wants to play metal? Is he staying here? What part of Russia?Fuck you. And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless. Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for! I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't. You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more? You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine! The slut is yours! Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now! And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys! You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks! If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back! Good. I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne. Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee? Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class. You couldn't get these shutters open? Thank you for being rational. The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it... And that made you feel better? What did he say? You had to tell him. I'm glad you've calmed down a bit. Hi, Randal. Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne. Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch. Goodbye, Dante. I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational. I love you. Don't feel sick. Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved. ...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead! But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me! Yeah, I went down on a few guys... Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys! I'm going to class. Um. Thirty-seven. Lower your voice! Something like thirty-six. All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked. Let it go... Dante... Please calm down. I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood. Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people. We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around. That's because I never had sex with him! Yeah. How do you think I know he liked... I'm serious... Sylvan? No; I snowballed him. Why do you say that? He gets off on it. After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing. Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing. Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes. It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school. To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment. I want you to come with me on Monday. After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big. Vegetable meaning paraplegic. I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes. John Franson and Rob Stanslyk. You! I'm not the pig you are. Three including you. Three. Do you know how many different men I've had sex with? You're a pig. You've slept with twelve different girls? It better be up to and including me. We might have; I don't remember. How many? How many girls have you slept with? How many? You were making a generalization about "broads!" I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life. I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough. And I actually date you? Oh, you think so? How flattering. "Be there?" You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you? Typically male point of view. I was kidding. Ooh! Can we?! Do you think anyone can see us down here? Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish? How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take? You're trusting. How much money did you leave up there? She called you, didn't she? Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive? What were you doing? What were you doing up so late? You look bushed. What time did you get to bed? You're kidding. Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here? Why did you agree to come in then? Don't you have a hockey game at two? I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something. All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave. Then quit. You should be going to school anyway... At least they weren't lit. All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard? I'm going to have a word with that asshole. After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut! No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it! He has his friend do it for him! I'm not sad. I... I don't know what to say. And... he told you all of this? Bye That was Snowball. I will. Take it easy. I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends. No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. No, I'm just visiting my man. Dante, this is Willam Black. This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend. Willam!Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie. Now that it's done, so am I. I'm tired of living on the fringe. Ed, it's over. I need a normal life. But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance? Eddie, what's my motivation? Wood Productions. The mark of quality. Oh really? How much money did he put up? I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. Say, who's the lug? Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene. I'm going to my mother's. You're a fuckin' mess. That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend. That's moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer? I told you this was gonna happen. Like what ?! I wanted you to say, "No! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores." Who do you think's been paying the rent?! Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?! All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes! Don't get angry at me. Maybe you just need a day job. Ed, the landlord doesn't care. Ed, the landlord called again. He wants his money. Well maybe you're not studio kind of material. Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself. That's ridiculous. Ed, it's just one man's opinion! Toss us out on our ass. But Ed, we're not even married. And you don't have a job. I don't know. It's so much money... Ed, who is Daniel Davis? Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS! How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people? Oh, just like in the script! That's not the issue !! Ugh! How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?! Oh! You got nerve, buddy. And what about this so-called "Barbara" character? It's obviously ME! I'm so embarrassed! This is our life ! What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?! What kind of sick mind would operate like that? Jesus Christ! And you never told me? How long have you been doing this? Ed, I'm so proud! I'll read it as soon as I get home. So did you get his autograph? Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture. I thought he was dead. You met Basil Rathbone! Boris Karloff!? Who? Robert Taylor?! Better than not getting a job? You got the job?!! Eddie, I don't understand. Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story? Ed, you're still young. This is the part of your life when you're supposed to be struggling. Ed, it was only one review. What?But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck! Huh?! Ed, I'm so happy for you. Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere. My chiropractor! Look, it's Dr. Tom. Hey, Dr. Tom! You should feel lucky. Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people. The poor girl's out of a job. The sun. Dynamite -- Uh, atomic energy? Do you want your buttons on the left or the right? Well you tried -- Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- you're not ! What was that? Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious. STOP! Oh. Okay. Does this mean you don't like sex with girls? Huh? A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live. I thought he was much scarier in person. That is incredible! You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie. "Dracula." You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw. Your friend's. Oh. I loved those shows! "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" -- Did you find it boring? Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners. So have you always lived in L.A.? They're very nice. Let me get my coat. Oh, flowers! I didn't know you were so traditional. He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend? You look beat. Oh, it's you again. This is my thirteenth pair. Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital. Oh. My condolences. Oh. Congratulations. Hello. You're sleeping in a tuxedo.Where is Reed ? No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben. Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead -- What did he do to the uniform?! He didn't. The suit will stretch. You should try it -- We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped. I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor. We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here. Victor did. I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew. But Johnny...you can't fly . What are you doing -- No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out. As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them. Johnny, slow down. Think . You know mom didn't raise us to -- Is that what you call it? "<i>Real</i>"? Johnny? Did you see Ben? You two need a time-out. You gave us names ? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now? I'm driving. Girl ...?! That's the temperature of the sun . You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova -- Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life? I think that thing is Ben. Stop it. Johnny. Apparently I can disappear. The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to -- A gasket ? Reed, we're at a party. I'm sure I can come up with something. You need a doctor. Reed, stop, you need to rest your -- That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now. When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me. I did. I did, Reed...but I wanted you to be that man. I gave him twenty. Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you. Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous. Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up. Every variable but yourself . You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like -- Better than your life . Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are. Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake -- Reed. How close are we to a cure? And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well. But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed ...? And reverse the mutations -- What are you doing? No. There weren't. There was you . And me . No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does. I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that? Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked. Are you kidding? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- I'm sure I can come up with something. Anger. Rage. Frustration. Excuse me? What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope? If it happened to him, then it could... How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us? What...? Oh . What? It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA. What? What do you mean you -- You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics. Which was? You're happy for me and Victor. You always had a way with words. I should be getting back. Yes, thanks. Great minds think alike. Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny... It's been changed. Right. That's exactly what I meant. I was talking about us. Working together. Never better. Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready. Please don't make this personal -- If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse , maybe even kill us. He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before -- Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't -- You said it was urgent. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to -- Victor, your scar -- Victor, I'm sorry I -- Victor, are you feeling alright? You can't leave them out there. What are you doing? Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think... It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much. I understand the <i>business</i> reasons. It's just business.Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable. Bye. breaks down into heavy sobs. She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . . I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone. Is it hurting, dear? frowns at Henry. Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing. pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline. I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side. whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room. and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery. Come on! Sausage rolls. I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator. playfully shoves his hand away. looks down at the ground in front of her. Oh, no. I'm watching my figure. That's enough, Yvonne! Love, you can still write to each other. stands and walks toward the door. You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!! Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us. Open this door! All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way! You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer. is very angry. These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them? snatches up an exercise book from a large pile. You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing! I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education. She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate. It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart. steps back. whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek. My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart! grabs Pauline by the shoulders. sighs. If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect? From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you. Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet. Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital. holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it. You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't! starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline. You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill. Come on, sit up. comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast. leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room. glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand. Well? Tell us! How'd it go? I put on a lot of weight over Christmas. Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl. turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag. is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently. Oh-what a nice outfit! Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket. stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand. We don't want to tire you out, dear. looks startled at the outburst. I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health. gives her a sympathetic look. That's coming along well! It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit. hurries over. I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger! I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate. and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based. Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head. I adore anything to do with the arts. I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular! Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy." But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper! Fruit. Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper. Hello! Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul? I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued. They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health." I'm saving them for a rainy day. I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch! Thank you so much! I'm so happy to see you! Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it. Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council. And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage! Isn't it beautiful! Goodbye, Mr. Rieper. I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge! Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she? All right, then. Mummy! Yes . . . But that's not true! I've got one. Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other. Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy! Poor Mother was completely taken in. That was what we were led to believe . . . That's great! We'll have the fare in no time! This lot's got to be worth 50 quid! They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times! I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage! Hurry up! I'm freezing! You mean travel by ourselves? No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers! How do you know? Did he tell you? That idiot boarder? What?? I couldn't have done it without you, Charles. I shall call him Diello. It's so beautiful! God, yes! That. This. Him. To be known as He! James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints. I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians. Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum! Don't . . . please! Please, don't! Of course it matters! It's Mario! 0h, God . . . I'm so sorry! Somebody's got to help us! Mummy!Look, Mother! You have it. I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain! I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out. You have to let me go! I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa! The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them! I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake! I don't wanna be in bloody school! What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met! I'm educating myself! Who cares! What does old Stew want? My name is Gina! You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me! Well, I guess I take after you then! Can I go now? I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture. But she'll have no one to look after her! Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away? I just want to be on my own for a while. I'm not hungry. I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too. He's the manager! Got an A, Mum! Hello! Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy! Bye, Dad. I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . . It's a three-act story with a tragic end. Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night. Mummy! I know what to do about mother. I'm coming with you. I need my sodding parents' consent. Poor Father . . . Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws? I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill. I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office. I'm sure they'll notice things missing. Just a couple more . . . Stay still or they'll be blurry . . . Let's go overseas . . . I think I'm going crazy. Well . . . no. But it's so obvious. John has fallen in love with me! You'll never guess what's happened!! You're such an incredible woman. What??? What? He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her! That . . . This . . . Him . . . He . . . Saint Mario! But, we're all going to Heaven! I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus! I think I'm dying . . . It doesn't matter. She's terribly hurt . . . Mummy!Yes. Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance. They appear to be authentic. My name is Jennifer Hillman. I'm an archaeologist. I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you. Lieutenant? Lieutenant Bedsoe? Paul. I thought we agreed. No press. You guys are from the British museum, right? Huge. Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber. Sounds very -- normal. What now? Be careful, Conner. He's in there! Must you fight him? Where will you go now? And the other one -- he is like you? You? How did you know that? On the back it has-- Would you like to see it? Not unless they're immortal. --for three hundred years. Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't? What if they were trying to get out? Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern? They were wedged in tight. They couldn't get a grip on them. They would have had much more strength pushing on them. Let me ask you something else. At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed. The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section. What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall. Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours. No. --the Calan. Do you know who they are? Yes -- it is. A little -- yes. My interest in coming here is profession. How come you wanted to meet tonight? You're not an easy person to get to know. I'm just trying to place you. You have an interesting accent. Where are you from? You didn't answer my question. You're twenty minutes late. Why? Yes. You look like you have. Have you ever heard of the Calan? It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book. You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions. I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe. Do you always walk around with a sword? Then how did he know your name? Who was that man last night? Why do you stare at me like that? Jennifer. Then who's Russell Nash? What's going on? Why did he call you Macleod? You're hurt. It's mine. It's been in my family for years. It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother. Why? What's going on? If it's good advice. Why do I feel that you know what's going on? Bullet proof vests don't bleed. I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out? Yes. How did you know? Yes. We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland. To talk to you. No. I'm an archaeologist. I was wondering if I could talk to you? My name is Jennifer Hillman. I was at the police station earlier today-- We'll see. I like my work. I know, Paul. I was working on the cataloging. And this? I don't think it is a duplication. His head. Someone cut it off. We found him this morning. I don't know. He's fine. He swears he never left his post for a moment. He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside. Someone broke into the cavern last night. We're holding the workers down below. Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning. This could be a very important find. I want it documented. Where is the film crew from the British Museum?...Hello? I'm plenty happy! I'm happy enough. Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were -- It's hardly the same -- Well, maybe I -- Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president? That smart?! So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president. Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you? But -- who are you -- what d'you do here? Who are you? How did you know who I am? Muncie! Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger! But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile! I know they're gonna buy that stock -- On Norville Barnes! A sawbuck! I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?! Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron -- I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something -- Lumbago. And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine -- Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it! Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can -- Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance -- Oh Norville, I -- Norville! Consider this my resignation -- Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you... Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after -- Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile -- ...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me -- You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?! Your i -- You mean you know about this? They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families -- ...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing? Never mind about that... For Pete's sake, Norville! Sure, Norville, sure... Oh, Norville -- Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around. I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex. Norville, there really is something I have to tell you -- Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys -- What a beautiful thought. ...The people look like ants. Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful -- Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year. Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar. Oh yes! In Muncie! ...Huh? ...Certain people are -- Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie... I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions -- ...You do? Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary. ...I'm sorry. Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner. Let me look. ...What happened? Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance. Smitty. Oh, is that it! I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean. Confused? Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record! Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man. ...Why don't I just type this up... Well, I -- I'm sure I -- Is that all, Mr. Barnes? -- or lack thereof? Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice. Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes -- Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic! Oh, no, really, I -- Why yes, do you know it? -- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of -- No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years -- A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future -- At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world -- What a horrible little person. I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story... The couch, please. I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy... I filed it yesterday. ...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al. Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?... As a three-dollar bill. I tell ya the guy's a phony. You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him! Says who?! You can't print that! It's about a dimwitted editor who -- I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk. Muncie. I don't know... Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!Well, frankly, I... Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear? I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him? Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee! -- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!I'll put you in your coffin. Forever. Don't Louis -- Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm. No. Laudanum. Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them. Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you. I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were. You're a liar. But you upset my plans. I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us. Is that supposed to frighten me? Does it? Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!! DID YOU DO IT TO ME???? You made us what we are, didn't you? But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I! And if I cut my hair again? Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am? You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why? I have. Or there would be twice as many. Is this my birthday? You always give me the doll on the same night of the year. Why always on this night? I'm not your daughter. I want some more. More. What do you mean? But if she dies... And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone? Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis... Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me. Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer! You really believe that? Let him go, he said. Let him go. Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance... He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do. You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you. Love? No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me. I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules! I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them! Be still! Yes, and very beautiful. And no one knows but us... She's no vampire. How devilishly clever. Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink. But this can't be real. This is nonsense. Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn? Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either. They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever. Or her, or her - or any of them? But how will I ever know, Louis? You don't remember? Or you never knew. Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love? You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you? A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am? How do I look? The ship is sailing wihout us! It is! Take the back stairwell - What was that? Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you - I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died. You never talked to me like that - in all these years. Louis, look at me. I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free. He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die. In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means. The swamp... Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis? The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead. Don't mock me, Louis. Help me. But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him. You both did it? You... fed on me? And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up. Tell me why...you've got to tell me... Why not? You want me to be a doll forever? Sit still. It's not finished - Why does he call you that? Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death. But you never let me see you kill, Louis. The way I learn everything. By watching you. I want more.Rose. I guess you have. Well Enrique is great and...we are the best. What can I do for you? Hello. You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid. Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks. You're grounded 'till you're fifty! You're so clever. Don't wake up Vada. There's water in your bathroom. Nicholas! What are you doing up? What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh? Give it back Nicholas! You really think I look sexy in this smock? You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice. PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa... I think this place is just fine. I don't want anything you don't wanna give me. Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have. No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook. I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that? There's plenty of fruit. Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself. Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going? Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills. Phil for God sake. He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing... No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed. Sounds like you're very organized. Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled? Bye Niece, Vada. She'll be all right baby. Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes. Go to your room. And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he? All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye. What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut. Oh, sure okay. Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian. Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry. Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved. Well I'm sort of involved. Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't. Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia. Well maybe for you. Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started. Yes, I do. Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies? Oh, are you a hairdresser? Excuse me? I mean...with your car. So what's wrong?Maybe he's wet? I was pushing as fast as I could. Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think... Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here. You're being narrow-minded. She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of... No. And some taco chips so I can dunk. Never heard of him. Yes I know, it runs in the family. New book? Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars. Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too. I don't know if I want to. Then I'll throw up a little bit. If I eat it I'll throw up. O.K. You have no idea. I know, look at his little hands. Hey! Oh look. You leave your father to me. It would be fantastic. Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so. How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom. Why not now? Well you've gotta be prepared. Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure. No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning. Oh Vada she's so beautiful. Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental. What's this? December 8th, 1958? Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good. Oh no. I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman. Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had. No, the milk comes when the baby comes. They're enormous, I know. I bet your mom sang to you.No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you. I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating. People said she looked like me. Her name was Maggie Muldovan. My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;. Do you still teach? Umm, where do you want this? Are you writing a poem? I don't even know your name. THANK YOU. I don't think you're very polite. Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police! Gee, that is a problem. Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem. This is California, anything is possible. Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me. How did you know my name? I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns. Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life? I'm leaving Sunday. Pommeroy. His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please? Suspended from school, my mother?? Wow, you walked out with my mother? What do you remember about her. Can I see him? We have a baby? What happened to Shelly? Give my love to Shelly. Okay...bye daddy, I love you. I will. How's Shelly? Totally. Yeah. Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy. I just called to say that I'm having a really great time. Hi Dad. I'll be back in 137 hours. Bye Dad, I'll miss you. What does that mean? No nuns, got it. I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday. I already bought a ticket. I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California. You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion? Was it a nice funeral? Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic? There's still a big spot on the floor. The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer So you're saying...What are you saying?? It's just a question, it's not about anybody. Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you? Seriously. Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room. Don't do that, you've got the whole garage. Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room. No it's okay, I understand, really. I figured you did. Shelly's already told me all about sex. You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle. So, what's on your mind? Visualize a spare? Okay, no problem. You want me to move? Do what? I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing. Dad, I'm trying. The chairs, they won't scrunch. They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out. Are you saying my mother had another husband? What're you saying? His name's Harry Sultenfuss. Thanks. It's okay really, I was just a baby. Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan? oh. Well... I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me. I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out. Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me? More than anything in the world. She's beautiful. Do you have any pictures if her? And she saved it. I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me. Special effects? I told you it was a long story. Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am. We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and... and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so.... You are? Bye. She looks a little like me when I was a little girl. I'd like to, thanks. You mean, you knew about me? I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was... Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad. Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians. Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow? That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them? Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper. What's the matter? See you? He can smell you from there. What are you staring at? Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant. You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy?? It's just a corpse. Come on in! That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world. No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her. No-one invented gravity, it just exists. But I wanna write about her. It's okay with me, hi Kevin. Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy? You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you? He's writing. Hello? O.K. Thank you very much. This is really very nice of you. Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too. Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start. I never met my mother. My mother. The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on. I'll write you ten poems. Bye. An adventure? You mean...it wasn't that terrible? ...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation. And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects. This has been a real confusing day. Nick? Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger, Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something. No, but sometimes he drives a hearse. It's not his fault! Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings? Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married. Yeah I guess...sort of. Right. Hey look! Really? What's he smoking? That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws. My hands fit. My mother stood on this very spot. Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly. Jerk! You IDIOT!!! Leave me alone!! Oh no?!?!?! Owh... In the tar?? What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;??? DON'T!!! DON'T, come on!!! Just give it to me!! Give it to me! I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back. Don't force it, you'll break it. ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value. Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time. Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch. Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine. This isn't just a mood ring. Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here. And I thought I was weird. At least it gives you plenty of exercise. He is one of the great poets. May I use the phone please. You would. This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking. You ratted on my mother?? Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement. Why do you argue with everything I say? I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them. Change my name. I'd never do that. It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books. Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team. With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous. Oh my gosh, here it is! What difference does it make? Just remember the needle in the haystack. WHAT?? It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!! Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me. Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here. I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing. I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were. My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day. I don't need you to be telling me to... He said it was a gift. Thanks.... Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly. Okay. I should do this myself. Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door. A secret, I like that. Maybe. Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy? I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it. I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face. Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way. Bye. I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and.... Well then that's not exactly dating is it. So does that mean that you sleep here every night? Committed? Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil. But...are you engaged or something? She lives here too? He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars. They're great. Bye Aunt Rose. Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry. Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there. Not exactly. I'm just tired. You're Nick's mother? Let me hold him. Did it hurt a lot? He's so tiny. Shelly? But Dad'll never go for it. Yeah, it would be kinda great. But what about you and the baby? You need me. What do you mean? I'm definitely traveling some day. I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere. Is that why Uncle Phil moved there? Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there? This is one of my favorite things, her passport. I don't know, Dad doesn't either. Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all. Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house. You're telling me. Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike. When did you umm, I mean umm... Is there milk in them already? Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan. This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration... Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time. He'll remember my mother for sure. STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie? Do you know him? He's a great poet. Beidermeyer? Really?My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley. Yes. We did. You're sure... Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too. Good. You're sure... Oh, right. Dwayne. You're engaged to Dwayne? What?... But... just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves. Your hair... is perfect. Yes. There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that. About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them. And the last line of it goes, "Who knows? Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--It was late in arriving. But it's here now. You don't understand. The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane. I-- I must've misplaced it. So. How do we get to Rome? Because. No... it's just very important that I find him, okay? Nobody here has any idea which way he went? He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here. Excuse me? You ask what room he's in, okay? What is it? What? It's alright... this is our destiny. We found each other, didn't we? Don't be afraid. You can tell me. Let's find a telephone. I've never been more sure of anything in my life. It just happened. I didn't plan it. I was alone. And he was... there. But now everything's changed. I owe it to him to let him know. I need to tell him. I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember. With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun... And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis. Okay. Good idea. You first. My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it? --separate, in the evening..." Dwayne Pinsley. From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport. And, he's a friend of yours. It's Dwayne. I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days. There is one other thing you should know about me. My car bumper has never held a winning sticker. I'm a liberal! No. You don't think this is just infatuation, do you? That's it. That's it. That's all I need to know. Bless you, thank you, thank you. What's mezzaluna? Ask her if she knows how I might reach him? If she has a telephone number? Ask her if she knows where he is? What?... I'll bring it back as soon as I can. Please, Larry. I have to hurry. Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is. I know where to find him. Larry, can I borrow your car keys? Larry! What are you doing here? Mom sent you. We'll KNOW. If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that. And stop talking. You're gonna ruin the spell. Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive. Wait. I have to write this down. Hm. Non. Please. Amazing. So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts? Congratulations. No, you gave a very convincing performance. And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse. Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it. You... Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?... Where are you going? Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you. WAIT!! Where are you? Damon Bradley... I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that? I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that. Who should I tell him called? This is his fiancee. Who's this? He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message? Hello? Is anybody there? I brought you that, too. There is no us. That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to? Yes. No, it isn't. I called off my wedding all because of you. Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead. Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy? I would call it-- unforgivable. A "little white lie"? A "little white lie"? Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you. You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it. I can't believe you did that! No one had to tell me. He's starring in the local play. Who cares?! You hired an actor?? What? You want a hint? I'll give you a hint. You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine-- GET OUT!! I just need to run up and get my bathing suit. Yes. I am. Thank you. So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime. I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans. No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual. Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married. It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy. Like I was on drugs or something. No. I just came by to apologize. Hi. Are you... busy? No. Course not. No, it was more than that. It was very generous of you. It was very kind. I feel like the world's biggest idiot. Yeah. Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn. How about music? You like classical? Well, what about books? You like Hemingway? You gotta love Hemingway. So were you. Why are you doing this? I don't know if that's such a-- You were saying... What are you doing here? Thank you, Peter. Thank you so much. What? You too. Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs. Nothing fancy. Well, good. Good for you. Oh. That's nice. You found him. I don't know how to thank you. Hi, Peter. NO. Right now? Mickey Spillane? Please. I need to know. Tell me. He likes to read... Did he mention anyone in particular? Why? Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea. Where's Positano? Why not? Who says I don't love him?... Don't you see?.. We're not the ones who are meant to be. You're the man of somebody else's dreams. No, that wasn't a lie. That was... a mirage. So it wasn't real. Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie. What? Why are you asking me this? He wants to marry me, doesn't he? So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe? Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me. Yes. Yes. If it's any of your business, yes. NO. I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe. Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that? How could you do this to me? That was before I found out what it was. That's not the point. What? So, you say you've been to Italy before? Oh, hello. Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too. You like shrimp? I like shrimp. What looks good? Don't worry about it. You're my guest. Excuse me? Well, to-- new friends. Really? Sure. Oh, Faith. My name's Faith. Yes? Okay. Good. See you then, then. You would? Really? Would you be willing to have dinner with me? Any night. I was wondering... Do you have dinner plans? I just got here, too. Not yesterday. But, just now. Today. Just a few minutes ago. Yeah, we just got here... I mean, I just got here. I'm single. Been here long? Beautiful place... You're Damon Bradley? Larry, did you rent a car? I'm fine. Have you seen Peter? I don't know. I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation. Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for. And Larry?... Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding. I didn't expect you back so soon. Kate is that you? So. I guess I've got a wedding to go to. I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel. I spent my whole life waiting for a creep. He's a jerk. Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it. Maybe I can change him. No, I think maybe you've been right. I think I may have been too critical in the past. No one's perfect, Kate. Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help. My God... you're right. What if he doesn't like me? Is Damon Bradley here? He's down in someplace called Positano. Peter says we can make it there by morning. Yes. Isn't that amazing? I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend. No. No, you go ahead. What? The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind. May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour. Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter. Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be. I've got forty-eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened. It was a ouija board, remember? I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place. Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place? Children are very impressionable, you know. A little bad luck? Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase. Packing. Hi. Where've you been? But how could he know? He only just met me. Don't be silly. How's a psychiatrist gonna find him? Like a detective. I meant about my idea. And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him. Okay, here's what I think. We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and-- What? Right. Okay... It's meant to be right? This is it. Right, right... Okay.. You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive? Is he looking at us? Oh my God. Where? Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here? Sure you did. Because I'm the one who's single. I told you. If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy. I just don't want to send any confusing signals. I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first? All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous. God, I hate blind dates. Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America? I don't know. I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden-- Right. My brother. Anna, I'm Faith. You don't know how happy I am to meet you. You see, I'm trying to find someone, and-- Larry bought himself cologne? And you know what I thought then, Kate? I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much. I still hope that. 'Course he does. I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him. Sorry. You expecting somebody you know? Nothing. You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story. Right. So we should've been able to cover more of them. I told you a liter was less than a gallon. The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy. What was I gonna do? Tell him the truth? Only, it's in Italian... A phone message. Only-- We're saved! Oh. Right. Maybe there's fingerprints on it? A Butterfinger wrapper. Ah ha!... So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet. Maybe there's something in there that might help us. Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around. The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right? Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned? He fell out. Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for. I'll never meet the man of my dreams. We lost him?... I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone. Well, we're here. And more importantly, he's here. We'll cut back on everything else. Are you sure? What? I don't know... Maybe. Think of it as an adventure. It's called... the Gritty Palace. Now what do we do? Sure. I'm fine. I don't know why I never did this before. I mean, what's the big deal? You're coming with me? Maybe. How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and-- He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. Thank you so much. No, I haven't. And you forgot about the fortune teller. Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either. Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor. That's where you're wrong. I got one nine years ago. I just never had an opportunity to use it. I have vacation time coming to me. It's still the new year... It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it. The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence. It's a miracle. After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think-- Have you seen him with someone? Is that bad?... Kate, is something the matter? I understand, Kate. What do you think of this garter? I know. You're right. Yeah. I guess you're right. I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den. Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies. I know... It was. Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp. Yes you did. Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place? No. He's never asked me. He's a podiatrist or something. I don't know, Kate. So, he's not my type. Let me walk you to the elevator. I don't know. I don't think so. No. No. I wish you didn't have to go so early. Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all. But somebody wrote those songs. Is everything okay? Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer. I don't have an Amana freezer. Don't tell me, Oprah did a show-- Scientologist. Just moved in with his girlfriend. No. He smokes. I don't believe in statistics. Yeah. He's around somewhere.Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is. Of course not. No, she wasn't my sister. Yes, but... He was having an affair. No. No. Really. She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him. So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams. She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker. My friend has lost her fucking mind... He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport. What about Larry? Well... I ought to be getting home anyway. The kids'll be back from camp soon. The house is probably a mess. Oh. Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right? Uh huh. So... When you could've found one in America. Yup. Yes. He is. Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad. I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change. And he is living proof. Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless". Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway? Faith, I'm kidding. Is this how you plan to get what you want from life? When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it? It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable. Whatareyoudoing?! Joan Collins stayed here. Amazing... Peter found him? I'll be back before you leave. You sure you'll be okay? I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all. Who said I was going? What about Peter?... ...and a fortune teller. I know, but... So you're just quitting? Just like that? Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up. So, you've had a little bad luck. Why? Sightseeing... What're you doing? Hi-iii... Men have ways. Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that. No... Like a psychiatrist. I think it's time we got some professional help. That was really sweet... And then what, Faith? Well, nobody can say we didn't try. Good luck. Faith-- Faith. So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe. At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales. Nope. He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us. He's wearing a navy jacket. If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow. He's heeeeeerrre... Not if you don't count the sixth grade. I never even got to be single. Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you? So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him. You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get? You're right. At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself. Smile. What's she saying? What did you say to her? Her brother. Polo. He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day. Did I tell you that? That was a long time ago. You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to? But maybe I was wrong. Maybe sooner or later everything wears out. You think he misses me at all? So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway? Well, you don't have to get snippy with me. What's that supposed to mean?... I'm hungry. We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost. Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile. Couldn't we just have taken a train? Your brother? Only what? What is it? We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him. A rich, possibly fat, slob. What'd you find? So? I just got a dial tone-- I don't think he understood what you were saying. What's the airport number? You can't really blame him for being upset. It was an Armani suit. What are you doing? Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good. You and the other 99% of the women in the world. You gave it your best shot. You tried. Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here. "Of the Rich and Famous". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this. This is a Lifestyles hotel. "Gritty"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant? The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again? You okay? I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies. Live happily ever after. A foreign land full of millions of Italian men... speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin... You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets? My God, you have... I can't believe we did this. Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days? Does Dwayne know about this? Because you were afraid to fly. You don't have a passport. What about your job? But it's July. It's a coincidence. No... I can just tell. I think he's having an affair. Larry brought me flowers last night. I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect? Well, guess what?... It isn't. Not for you, not for anybody. People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive. It's not settling, Faith, it's life. Real life. Let me tell you something about love. There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers. Love is hard work. But one day you wake up and realize you've been had. Of course life isn't like the movies. That's why there are movies. That's the problem. When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies. Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap. Turn. But what? I think it was sweet of him to pick it out. Come on, it's not so bad. Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love. He begged me to marry him. I didn't even want to marry him. If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him? Why don't you ask him? "Thrills"? That's what you're waiting for? You know how long that lasts? Besides, how do you know? Have you ever been out with him? You don't have any idea? What's he do? So?... Is he gay? Is he married? Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry. And I did say I'd try to pick something up. No, Faith. They came out of somebody's imagination. So, what's your point? Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies. I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime. It's a metaphor. It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them. And instead wind up with nothing. So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I. But we work it out. We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other. I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome. Oh. How about that guy at the bank? How about the other one? His friend. What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name? You're an accountant for cryin' out loud. I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it... Is Larry here? That's exactly what you are. Giovanni. But I do want to. No, you don't understand. It's been wonderful meeting you. But... I have a husband. I have two kids at camp. I have a life I have to go back to. Giovanni, I want to thank you. How old are you? Oh. I'd love to. Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter. A porco? My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is. Can you tell us what she's saying? No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later. Kate. And you didn't tell her? She what?! Faith. Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley. He missed me. Larry, you've got to tell her. Went to high school with him. But... Are you saying you just made the whole thing up? The guy never even existed? What? You know him? You said it differently then. Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll. Sociologist. And because. Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners. They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money. Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation. No. Right. No, why? You miss me?... Sorry... Oh, it's you. It's only Peter. That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years? Ten billion to one. That's really romantic. Mania. Good strategy. She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid? She's not here.Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him. Don't you ever stop? You mustn't take it so badly. It's about me and David. It makes us feel a whole lot better. Oh, shut up, Alex. We were just sorting things out. Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be? As smart as you are, you'll need a little help. Alex. Everything. I'll wait there. You're frightened. It's the only way. Aren't you going to answer it? No. Forget it -- he'll come down. Where he can't get it? And the money? Forget it. Oh, good. David? Your painful groin? What are you doing here? No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem? He'll come down. Leave him alone. Leave him alone. I don't see the point in that. Don't you? Be like a weight off your shoulders. He's right. You'd feel much better about it. I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey! I hope it tastes better than the other stuff. Is this the same stuff you made last week? Yeah, you're making us all nervous. Then let's spend some money. Are you all right? Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing. Hello. Hello. Well, you certainly had a good look around. That's not him. No, I don't. Who? David, I promise we will. Keep him happy. For ever and ever. Sshh. Stop nagging. Be careful. OK. I don't want to. It's different. I don't thinkI can. Who's going to do it? Unfeasible. No, Alex. It's, it's -- Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse. No.The guy's dead.What more do you need? No. Don't. What are you doing? Alex. Did what? Yes. Yes. Open it. Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side. A blue one, OK. And it's still there. Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl. So what's wrong with that? His car's still there. David? So I gathered. Have you seen Hugo? No, Alex, we don't really love you. You're right. Yeah. The man we know and love. -- which is -- -- instead of what he is -- In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone -- Not usually this drunk. Alex. So we'll meet him, then? Who was it? He seemed like a nice guy, Alex. -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life. She hated you -- For the flat. Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful. I thought you stopped going. Just serve. OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love. Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman? I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda? Yes. Cameron. It wasn't like that. What? Eh, I don't know. Yes. So let's go. It was on the television. I should hope so. With a face like this? No one. No one. I promise. No. What? That's what it cost, David. Two hundred pounds. Two hundred. It's alright. I think he got the message anyway. Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time? Yes. They're my friends. Would you like to talk about it? Are you all right? Alex, I think it's time for you to stop. Yes. Just get on with it, Alex. It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that. Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not. Why do you want a room here? Oh, him. Well, he died. Here?. What guy that died? What guy? Hello. And that's not the same thing? You know about it? A certain weakness. No. But he needs treatment. I'm a doctor. No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week. It's an improvement. Did he sound upset? No. Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in. Do you think you could answer that? Writing seems easy. No. I see. What's it about? What do you do? Would you like to see the rest? Would you like to come in? You must be Hugo. The first one was fine. Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct. What? That sounds fine. Sorry? I suppose so. Diseases. Yes. Same as everyone else. No. I haven't seen them. I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.Will you shutup. I should never have told you about him. Can you cover me for an hour? Simon? Ohmygod. Harry only has two moods: busy... and asleep. You bitch. Yeah. You know Harry. Are you kidding? Harry had to go out of town. I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything. He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out. But he acts like he's curing cancer or something. Where are you off to young lady? Out. Dinner's in the warmer. Tell your father I may be late. That's not true, honey-- No you're not. You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake! Where are you going? Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time. And I have to get home to my family. My husband is a good man. I wasn't cheating! No! Never! I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen. I should have gone to the police, I suppose. Not yet. But we'll find him. ... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce. He looked like such a dope. Oh shit. What are you going to do? If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? As much as you used to? Do you still love me? Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again. Harry... snap out of it! What is it? Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry? Did you pork her Harry? What about Juno? My God. Have you had to... have sex with other women in the line of duty? Are we going to die? Is it working yet? It makes you tell the truth? What did he give you? Don't call me honey! You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?! You pig! Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get this? Harry, what's the matter with you? Tell them the truth. We're married, we have a daughter-- What were you doing there? Harry, be quiet. Let me handle this. He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right? I'm not wearing any. Allison is sick in bed. I have to go over there, honey. What? Oh, the flat tire? Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there. Natasha? I can do it! I think so. My husband can't know about this. What do you think? Of course yes! What's involved? Oh, gee thanks. Mmmm, let me see-- I love him. I have always loved him and I will always love him. Can I go home, please? Yes. What? Let me out of her! Right now! No. I needed to feel alive. I wanted to do something... outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed. To be trusted. To be special. I don't know. I guess I needed something... Yes. He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife. That's none of your goddamn business! What kind of questions are these? Yeah. I suppose he is. Harry? What can I say about Harry? He's a sales rep for a computer company. Well, maybe a little. No. He needed my help. Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park. I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whatever his name is... a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him. I can't, honey. I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry. Oh, sure. Fine. I'll get some more gravy. Yeah. It was a rush thing. They needed some documents down at the court house. I barely made it. They must've just missed me. My husband the hero. It sounds wild. So now you're a big hero, right? For fixing their system. What'd you do, honey? I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office? Yeah. It was great. It's okay, don't bother, Harry. Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that you'll be home at eight. I don't want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise? I need you to talk to Dana. The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon. I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks. It's not okay. It's extortion. That's fabulous Harry. How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous? Me too. Okay. Hi, honey. How was the flight? Go ahead. Uh... well, okay then. You sound terrible. I'll run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure, no problem. Bye. What? He said he was an American agent. Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary. Fuck you. Something you obviously have a hard time doing! What's going on, Harry? No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years-- Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep. I'm Helen Tasker. Harry's my husband. And you are? I just glances inside. Helen. It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I-- I don't know. I have to think... We're going to Paris? I'm married! What is it you need me to do? What's happened? You'll call me then? What is it you want me to do? And you chased one? Were they trying to kill you? Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night. You can trust me completely. Tell me what happened? That was you?! Yes. Worse than Cairo? Where were you? On a... uh, mission? I understand. I kept looking back, like you taught me. I didn't see anyone. Yes. I suppose so. Where? Yes. Go ahead.

Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE? Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white? OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair... The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE? What did you do with her? Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore? I don't know Where do you kill them... You don't know? And how many people have you killed? And how long have you been a dentist? So what do you do? Sugar? I think I will pass... Don't worry - Is that my hammer Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage... My names isn't ANGELA... What's with all the locks - and hammering What are you doing? Do you take sugar? I lost the touch Sure... I really don't know what to say No he had to - he's just - he's out... I had an accident - I fell down stairs... I'm your landlady I want you out now Yes I can... You heard me - keep away from him I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house? Well, what do you think? At 2.00... I think you had better leave Get out... At home alone - where were you? You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL? What brings the rats out of the sewers? What's this all about?
