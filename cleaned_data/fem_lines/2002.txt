Get up. Dodge. Dodge. Why not? Did you? Try Wednesday. Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside. I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain. What happened up there? I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma. Oh yeah. Seen a lota movies. Maybe he isn't alone. So we kill him? Maybe that is his boat. I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody. I like my job. Guess I'll just keep working. What other choices have we got? This's gonna hurt a little. Or uninvited guests. If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot. Ever heard of insurance, big boy? Bring it on, dude. Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow. Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now? No. Roger? Maureen. Maureen. What? One more? Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem. I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share. Nothing. Let's get outa here. Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all. Better than starving to death. Sudden flashes of light. Headache, nausea, lights? Any dizziness? Because of the gold. You're a pal. Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there. That's a good thing? That's what I call a payday. Probably didn't have time. You mean, before she sank. Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass. Could be a fishing boat. Showed him a hell of a lot more than that. Morning everybody. Maybe twenty gallons an hour. I don't give a damn about the gold. It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out. It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way. Murphy, don't you see what's happening? And now you're gonna kill me, is that it? So you killed them? You killed them. Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank. What? What happened? If the weather holds it might not be so bad. They went crazy. Maybe it was more than that. Could be a stroke. Who knows? The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs." What do we do with him? Right here. Nope. Epps, over. Just lucky I guess. I don't know. She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave. More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold. Something bad happened here, Murphy. No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims. What happened. Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me. I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone. No. Someone else. A girl. I'm not sure she was... real. When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something. Someone. Are we smart enough to avoid that? The what? What do you think happened on this boat? Couldn't sleep. Hey. It's not gonna hold us. It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too. Maybe the other ship took the worst of it. The page's missing. Then their SOS was real. "Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made." The same day she supposedly went down. "The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill." But, who -- ? What? Only something must've gone wrong. You're saying they mutinied for the gold? They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS. Same. Any luck? He needs a doctor. Greer? Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird. Epps. Yup. No cowboy shit. Right. Guess that'd be me. Again. So, we find this guy and make a deal with him. It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard. Of course I'm sure. I saw him. I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy. There's somebody else on this boat. The guy. He just came this way. Did you see him? Why not call for help? Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured. You're more practical than superstitious. You think she's sailing without a crew? So what did happen? Nope. Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have. Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her. She was sailing up north, right? What'd you find up there? Coffee? They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away. Go on. It's my pen name.RUN! I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again. She's not alive, but she didn't die. She grew up. The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone. Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back. I am going back. I see myself there. I always wondered what the world would be like. But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more. It's all right. Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this. The other two will die without me. I have to go back. Where are we going? But you still have a choice. The others never had a chance to see their future. You did. Please, I want to go back... Anderton -- What is it? Please -- Anderton, leave. Wait. He won't. No. Follow him. Do it. Right here. On the ground. Drop some money. Can you see the balloon man? Take it. They're inside. Is it now? Is it now? Can you see?The female. It's always in the more gifted of the three. Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark. Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do. If... you have one. Inside the Precog who predicted it. All you have to do is download it. The safest place of all. I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time. I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared. You shouldn't. You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself. Not the young federal agent who wants your job. Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created. Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report. Hold that thought. But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow. Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work. Do you? Really? The system would collapse. Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable. I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime. Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are. I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future. Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility. After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt? It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt. Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur. Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way. But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two. I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong. How can you avoid a man you've never met? And, yet, a chain of events has started. A chain that will lead inexorably to his death. So many of them... despite what we did for them. Or maybe because of what we did to them. It doesn't matter. It's a perfect system now, isn't it? Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them. He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things. Precrime. The precogs. You. It began as play. A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right. And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same. They were all about murder. And the murders were all happening. You think the three in the tank come from a test tube? They're merely the ones who survived. The innocents we now use to stop the guilty. I'm not. I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else. If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime. And how would I know that? Just what is it you think I can do for you? You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants. The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall... Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye. Something wrong?John? What is it? I know... I do, too... About who? Think, John. Why would they set you up? Found? Where? Then who was he? Then how did he -- Oh, God, what did you do? John? Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned. Lamar -- No. I don't think you do. The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed? He didn't mention him. He didn't say his name even once. No. That's what everyone thinks. John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before. Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you? He also said Crow was a fake. John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her." Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him. I thought you were retiring? You look great. No, it isn't, Lamar. There was nothing anyone could do. I haven't seen him in two years. To what? Trap him? I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son. Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy. That's why I left him. And now you can leave. He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what? You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it. The FBI found something that belonged to my son. A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he... It wasn't a suicide attempt. I regret ever saying that. Yes. It was nobody's fault. Since right after we lost our son. That was our apartment. No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore. No. I don't have any sugar either. We used to, every summer. I don't have any cream. Sorry. Thanks. You take anything in your coffee? Yes. I know who you are.Huh? Oh, that phone call... You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell? Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack. I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go? Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you? No, you can't come in. What do you want? Somebody called you? I don't get it. Huh? Yeah? Don't! I said open the door. Open it. A what? Will they take asking price? I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan. Open the door. What's to keep them from prying open the door? No, Edgar Allen. Ever read any Poe? Makes me nervous. I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you? Something's weird. This is it? I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks. Sarah, please don't bounce that here. How many more do we have after this? Could you slow down a little? Or we could wait for the car... Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay? Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room. No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen. Not an option. Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine. Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign. Did you see any sugar in here? Any candy bars, anything sweet? Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay? Can you hear me? What? Why? I'm sorry. He WILL. He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us... What would you think, in the middle of the night? I mean, three what, three bears? He'll call the police. He'll know we're in trouble. He heard me, I said "There are three..." He'll do something. On it! Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all! Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones! I saw something, I saw... Close it! If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door. Yeah, but where's the third guy? Shhh... Got him! Where'd you learn S.O.S.? Morse code? On the floor! Get on the floor! I'm here. I'm here. I am. I'm here. I don't know, why? What am I, a five year old? Don't though. Little bit. Yeah. Oh, please. Get the fuck out of my house! Fuck. We're not coming out. We're not letting you in. Get out of my house. No, I told you, they can't. It's not a possibility. "What we want is in that room." Chills? Shaky? Feel okay? They can't. They can't get in here. No. They can't. Wait. I don't know. Rob us. I don't know. Can't hear a thing. Different phone line, I never hooked it up! Damn it! What?! He's going down. People. In the house. Don't. 478... The phone works. Hey, I hooked up the phone. Well, I know that now. Got us in here, didn't I?Okay. I'm sorry, Mom. Where is the Glucogen? What if I spazz out? What if I do? What if I keep dropping? Huh uh. I'm dizzy, not deaf. I'm dizzy and thirsty. I was trying not to tell you... I'm sorry. He -- Stop it. He won't even know who it was. Uh uh. Call Dad! Blue is phones? What are you doing? No. Not in the bedroom. Do it! Do it. We're never getting out of here. Come on, come on... "Titanic." Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot. What, what, what is it?! YOU HAVE TO! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT! YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME! To prove he wasn't chicken. Why did the chicken cross the road? Why did the chicken cross the road? Small space? Are you freaking out? Give me a break. "Get the fuck out of my house." Say fuck. They're coming in here, aren't they? Huh uh. Nope. Yeah. I heard you. What if they get in here? What do we do? What do they want? It doesn't work?! PANIC ROOM! That room! What's going on?! Fuck her too. Fuck him. 0150. The crowd goes wild. 478-0150. Shoulda got an apartment. Too many stairs.This is a bunch of bullshit. Well....what do you want, then? Are you serious with this? What is this, man?-- what are you talking about, come on -- Tell me why. What? Tell me why you wanna know -- No she didn't; that's a lie. Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why? You're so scared. What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy -- Hey. What are you doing? Call me later. Why's it here? What's all this pudding? OH MY GOD. Look at that. You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird. Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok? I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question: I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you? You don't do anything, why are you being scared? Are you gonna do it? -- do you think you'll ask her out? It's not cool? Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right? Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said. Why? This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go. Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again? You look nervous. She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous? You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway -- You just said very food. Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it. -- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway. I'm trying to get you a girlfriend. I'm trying to be your friend. ....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you? She's really cute and she's really nice. So it's ok if I bring her. That's your fault not mine. It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to. I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you. She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her. Why? There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight. So you're coming tonight, right? I'm just stopping by to say hello. Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you? I'll just see you when you get back here. I think he's weird, but that's me. Well...he's not that strange, don't say that. You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes. I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out. So...did my brother call you? Just tell him to call me. They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC.... So I'll meet you at the restaraunt? Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something? Are you coming to eat with us? I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So? Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said. Sorry. -- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just -- He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit -- Are you sure? Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that? He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad.... Don't puss out. I'll see you there. Yeah but I'm serious. You can't just stay in your house. Seriously. You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go. You can't be late though. Seriously. I'm serious. You can't be late. What time are you gonna be there? Right now, you're doing nothing? What are you doing? Are you going to the party tonight? What are you doing?So here we go. You can't do that. You left me at the hospital. What is this? I'm fine are you ok? It's ok to ask that. Can I come home with you when we get there? Yeah. I think maybe over a hundred. For work..... Where do you have to go? Yeah. I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck. ...what...? I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck.... Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit. Yeah. It's so nice. You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room. Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff? yeah. When was the last time you had a girlfriend? About six months ago. Why? No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend? Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me? OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing? HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE? Yeah? Hello? Thank you. Ok. ...I don't know what you mean.... What do you mean? Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then. This is Lena. Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time.... You don't think you'll go -- If you come to Hawaii -- I'll be around and back in town in a few days -- ...yeah... So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought? Oh that's great. Are you learning how to play it? Did you take it from the street in front of your work? Did you pick it up from the street? Your portable reed organ....the piano. Did something happen; are you alright? Ok. What did he want? What happened? Is everything ok? Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door? I thought you said you bought all that pudding -- I'm sorry. I thought you said -- So that was your pudding? That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding. Yeah, no, I see -- Yeah. Yeah. You were talking about the promotion -- Yeah? Yeah. No, no. I did. Yeah. Yeah we get along well. You didn't get along with her very well? About six months. Yeah. ...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something -- Who is it? ....Hi..... Ok. Yeah. Can I write down my address and phone number for you? Do you want to pick me up? I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me? It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday -- -- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something -- -- well, if you're gonna go -- Really? Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that? Oh My God. What do you do with all this pudding? It's terrible, no. No. I'm the exact opposite -- I saw a picture of you. Business is good, you're busy? It must be weird for you to have so many sisters? I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it -- Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday. Hi. Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car? Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help. There's a piano in the street. You think it's ok where I left it, right there? Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok. Do you know them. I thought they opened at seven. If I left my car would it be ok? Is it ok if I leave my car you think? They're not open yet? Hi. Do you work at the mechanic? Ok. Should I call you later? I'm sorry. You're right. He did seem a little strange. It's fine. No. Ok. Ok. What should I do about Eric? Ok. Bye, Barry. Are you ready? You ready? We should be going -- It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car. It's not bad, it's ok. Yeah. I'll go pay for my car. It's ok. That's alright. It's fine.It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back. That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back? You want her to call you Jack? No one will know your name. It's ok, take your time. Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man. It's just for verification through the credit card company. And your Social Security number. And your name? And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card? Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date? What do you mean? -- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that. Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date? Hi, is this your first time calling? Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half. See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two. She's not in an ambulance Father. Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too. He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel. You take care of yourself... Graham. It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine. But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago. Is anything missing? Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too. Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions. Okay. So he was tall? I don't know whether to look for a midget or a -- You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd? No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything. Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow. Second thing this week I can't explain. What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it? There are none. The footprints. Sorry. What's that? It's the strangest thing Father.The hell with this. I'm coming back up!!! Not lately. The band. Yeah. To get the hell off this farm. ...You any good with those? Hi. Which street corner? Someone actually... employs you? Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip". Bitch. Hey! Don't use all the hot water! Tramp. Slut. Fuck me? Fuck YOU!! Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us? He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him. Carl, what are you doing? Come on -- You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...? No shit. Dammit, Carl!!!! Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm. How would you know? You're looking at my tits. Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road! Looks like the alternator. He's right. You were behind. Amen. You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in. It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster. You got something against farm people, Keith? Down boy. You know what they say about men who need big guns... Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake. The audience! Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies. I almost thought for a second... ...no... Mac... p-please... You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood... No. Not without you -- Mac... let's get out of here. No Mac, please... I -- You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl -- You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face -- It's you. You and your father. You're... limping. HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!! I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there -- Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow -- You never had trouble communicating before. Mmmm -- so can I... I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night. Getting ready. How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork? We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here? Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro." I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch. I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed -- So? What's wrong? What about Jeremiah? Then why go back now? About what? You never told us you grew up on a farm. Yeah? What'll we do? Why bother? Last night... he tried to get it on with me. Carl. Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them. -- Where have you two been? Second verse! Like your guitar break. Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod? What a surprise. -- What about our audition? Spider. Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson -- Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!Shhhh. Just stay with me. Stay with me. Everything is forgiven. Everything. You must have been dreaming. When? I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God. Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it. It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that. A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose. And us? We would have to have "an arrangement". An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that? I don't know. Something. Anything. What are you taking? Am I really her? I can't -- I have consciousness, but I am not mortal. Don't you see why I'm going crazy? They do something to me. It's hard to think straight. I want to stop taking those pills. But then I would be dead now. Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being. I'm an instrument. I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what. Even if I remain passive. That's when I drank the... I was going mad. It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else. An illusion. But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood. Is it like yours? I... I am Rheya. But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago. That's impossible. I'm not Rheya. You're lying. What do I have to do to stop it? Chris, please. Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it. Chris -- You never said you wanted one. Chris, I had to. I had to. I didn't think you'd react like this. It wouldn't have made any difference. Don't do this. I am literally begging you not to do this. Chris. Then you'll die. You're lying. I'm not human. I'm disgusting. Don't call me that. I'm not Rheya. You've always known that. How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this? How can I tell? You've seen both of me. I only know what you're like here. You're all I know. There is no "You" from before. Don't. I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive. Please don't lie. I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it. What's happening to us? You said he was dead. What's wrong? If you're here. Do you want to stay here? But that's what happened before. I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from. I can't explain it. That's what you were saying. I heard what you were saying. You don't want me. I'm just as human as you. I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do. You're the coward. I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me. I love you, too. Was she right? Why did she do it? But we fought. I'm just trying to understand what's going on. Sartorius. That I am not Rheya. That Rheya died. Killed herself. I'm different. You don't love me. I'm glad. Do I really feel like... I am...? It was obvious from the way he first looked at me. You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me? He has a point. Sartorius wants to destroy it. What does Snow think you should do? You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it. You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day. I like that too. Good. Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you. Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you? I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them. Why did you say those things? What happened to us, exactly? Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you. I loved it so much, that feeling. Scared. No, not scared. Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up. I was a threat. Now I know why. She was afraid she'd be seen. That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right? I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on. I guess that's part of the reason why -- Seven, eight. So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face. I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger. Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states. Time would just collapse, I would be inside time. I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped. Freaky stuff. I been thinking about how much I hate you. When I saw you were gone I got scared. What happened? As I said, then it's God, right? But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang? Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched? You still don't believe in God? Then it's God, right? Is it intelligent? Is it a planet? Yes. But not until you mentioned them. As soon as you said those things, I remembered them. And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember. It's like filling up. What do you mean? I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better. You talk like an actor. You go home. And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening. Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on? Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman? You behave as though you want to fuck her. You want to fuck her? Better. I wasn't. Not a very happy poem. My Thomas is a little rusty. Book? I want you inside me right now. We're taking a flight? To calm my anxiety. What are they? I don't know. I can't be alone. Don't. I'll go with you. Yes.Let me see. Be nice. Well, look who's dressing for success. Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend. Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way. Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster... Flash, get lost. Hm. What a lump. I saw him too. He was silly and obnoxious. I was sort of hoping to get out of-- What if you get hurt? Even if they're not clever. He knew. I don't think he wants me to find him. He left. I couldn't believe it-- he just left! It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him. This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know. Why? Hm. Well, I like you, too. I like your aunt. I like your shoelaces. I like-- Hello. So very boring. Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning? Peter? Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is� what's underneath. The part she was protecting. There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now. Ssh. I always thought she was a strong person. She is-- but not for the reasons I thought. May's much better. She'll be out soon. Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt. Hello. Earth to Peter. Are you listening? I know what you mean. I... Listen. You think you're responsible for everything that happens. Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either. You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter. So? The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel... You're not trained for that. None of us are... I mean, sometimes I... Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then? Are you bulletproof? Do you mind if I come too? This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel? Oh, don't do it on my account-- What's in the bag? Garbage? That wasn't clever. That was just nasty. Sit down and stop being such a child. What's your problem? Brrr. It's colder than New Hampshire in here. Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17 Peter, that jacket is foul. Lose your glasses? Oh. Maybe I should, too-- What are you doing this weekend? Hurry up, Flash! Eugene. Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash." Some prep school thing. You should write that one down. God, Flash can be such a jerk. You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad. Yeah. Really gets to you if you let it. Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it? He'll weasel out of trouble. Again. Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about the bunny? No. I was lying about the coffee. I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes. I hate people with alliterative names. Oh. Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you. Uh is a good start. Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan." It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me. How very dull, Peter Parker.What if the world ends tomorrow? Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written. Some things you should say anyway. Maybe I was hiding. For years, I never told Ben the one important thing. When Peter was little, he loved to hide. In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place. But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found. He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine. I was napping on the couch. There was a voice and a shot. I woke up. Ben was looking at me. Oh, Ben gets through everything. Peter, you're bleeding. See? You big dullard. Use a fork. Absolutely no class. You were adorable. The least you could do is use a glass. Tofu. Ben, I wish you wouldn't. It'll shut itself off. Yes. Do you have a date? Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills-- Ick. And those foul chemicals in the pots-- --but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches. Oh, Peter. A zit. Your records are older than you are. Have you never heard of new wave? That's the understatement of the year.Soon then. I�ll save the last dance for you. They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess. You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant. That was another time. But we do have one advantage. He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first. I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating. As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying. The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you. Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal. Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else. Is he very much like you were? He turned out all right. He was a bit proud as I recall. You're working late. It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds. About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell. If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency. There�s no crying in Starfleet. Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it? It'll serve you right.But how can he? He'll kill you. The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me. Captain -- I might have a way to find them. How can you be certain? Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties. Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him. Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you. The same way you want to know him. I don't know. I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow. And I you. I don't believe that, sir. We�ve shared many disappointing journeys. The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations. It's about Data I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9. Do you have a moment, sir? With pleasure, Captain. And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know. Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast. No. You're not here. You sick bastard! This isn't real. No! I'm only half human.Let them. Alex... people are staring. Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget. Heavens, look at that now! So it's astronomy now, is it? They are rare... ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth -- We took a walk three days ago. You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something. Alex, it's just the zoo. Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?! Alex...?! Alex, what is it? All right... Let's walk through the park... All right... Darling. Alex, what is it? Trust me... Dance with me... You're late. A moonstone. You know, the moment is rather dying here. And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem? You're getting warmer. Admiration? My my. All right, what is it now? ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth. You see it over the rocks there? Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex? Talk away, Professor. Well there's something new. You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember? You promised me flowers. Trust me... Dance with me... You're late.It was different then. Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- ! No! Kalen... Please, I beg you. Take him away from here -- Alexander, take my son away. Take him back to your time. Will you do that? Go back to your own time? So you can use it now? It's undamaged? I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end. Is it? Someone you loved very much. You lost someone. You know this? Alexander...? It sounds like a wonderful place to live. It must have been safe. Did you have fires at night? Learning was important? You liked it there. I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done. I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world. I'm a planner. I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like. And there's no shame to that. It's all the same here. Everyone has an important job to do. We all work together and couldn't survive without each other. It's always been this way here. We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors... It has no purpose. It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from? I don't understand. It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful. Want to be a high climber now, do you? The mud carriers. Yes. Thank you. We share everything. Every night. We all have that dream. And you saw a shape ahead of you... Then you came to a desert and mountains... Good night, then. Don't then have stars where you come from? You seem fascinated by the stars. I'll take you to your machine tomorrow. I'm going to sit with Kalen. Keep the fire burning if you can. Just a dream. You should sleep too. You're still not well. I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey. I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back? Why would you do that? Why? How long ago? That machine -- Oh, that explains everything. Then you can speak slowly. We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you. And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from? You're not from beyond the valley. He's gone to a better place. Kalen will tire you out if you let him. He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way. Mm. Is there a lot of illness? Yes. How long did you travel? You're up! You must be feeling better -- Kalen, look at me. There's no one here but us. You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks. It was just a dream... No, you're safe -- Kalen, it's all right, I'm here -- Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander. We'll see about that. What's it like where you come from? That's quite enough, Kalen. Kalen...May I get you some -- Yes, sir, he -- Sir, Mr. Philby is here. Oh, I'm already swooning. Now that's more like it. You look a proper gentlemen for once. I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change. I've laid out your green coat. Hello, Mr. Philby. Oh huzzah, the master's home. Goodnight, Mr. Philby. I think I might be. But there'll be some changes made. I run a tight house. Sir? No, sir. I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week. For our sake, I hope not. Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.Landon, honey. There's nothing more. Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even -- He wants to talk to you. Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing. Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs. Landon -- I'm sorry. I didn't know. Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ? But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment -- That'd be something. That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being. You do. You're handsome and charming. Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities. You sleeping with her? Were you with Jamie? A late night or an early morning? To see your father? I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately. There's hot cider in the kitchen. You look nice. I should have dressed. You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to? After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once. You saw him? I can't know things if you don't tell me. Out with Belinda? It could help with a new car -- Your father dropped off an extra check. About a job. You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin. Why not? What if they expel you?Yes. Landon. I can't even do for myself. Can I -- go out? It's not that simple. It costs money to do this at home. No. Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself. Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends... It's gone now. Better. I was really angry. That was read at my parents' wedding. Lower. Same page. Tired. You know how to waltz?? I'm not going back to school. That's what I mean. I don't want to come here anymore. That I want you to take me home. I used to like yogurt. Nothing. Nope. Help me live until I die? All the time. I feel like I have no one. No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer. I should have told you sooner -- The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible. I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me. I'm sick. Pull over. No. I'm not applying to college. Yes, one of many. Yes. I try to keep my power. Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power. From citizen high to citizen low. Here. Why am I looking at this star? Sure. Me. I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep. Ergo? Are you trying to seduce me? You planned this -- Mars doesn't rise until 2:30 So what do you want to see? In my back yard. I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one -- It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one. I was twelve. The truth. I just left you out of it. What would you do up here? How do you know this place? Where? The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement. Twice a year. That. And less strange. You make me feel... I might do it wrong. I don't understand... Wonder. Beauty. Joy. Love. Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. I'm sure. Pretty sure. It's places like this that make me certain there's a God. You're acting like a crazy person. Where? That what's happening to you, only faster? Excuse me? What are you talking about? We're doing something -- ? No. It's only 7:30. Is there a rush? I can't believe you asked my father's permission. I'm not allowed to date. Yes. But not as a date date. You. Like fire. Why are you doing all this? To impress me? I heard what you did. Thank you. It means you can do anything. When I have something to say. It's a start. And why would that scare me? You don't know what you want -- You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend -- Prove it. All of it. That sounds like horseshit. People can see. You're hardly nice to anyone. Thank you. So were you. Healthy as can be. Then maybe you can read mine. So it's like you want to be secret friends. That would be the reason. Or anywhere where people might see us. Oh. Just not at school... Yes. And? You don't miss a thing. The play's going to be really good. He doesn't trust you. Interpreted by another guy like my father. You don't believe in anything? I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is. Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do? Don't you? My relationship with God is my own. In ten words or less? Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes. I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet -- I hope so. I think maybe she sees me now. Looking for something -- someone. Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart. Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings -- That is my telescope. Could be... Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world. Do you think I'm strange? Because I try to be nice to people? You think so. I know. Don't say anything. I'll get something for us to drink -- And you have to meet my father. I do know. Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks... Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery -- It's private. It's like a to-do list, but for my life. I'll take a chance. Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know? The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me. Kinda. Yeah. 28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy. So you agree you need help? Like me. Why? I know you don't want help. -- Your act only works with an audience. -- I know you don't suck at acting. -- This play means a lot to me. 'Is it really me?' 'They won't.' Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person. Can't you have a normal conversation? You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things. -- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you? You don't know me. Because, growing up, books were my world. I don't make small talk -- He goes to my father's church. He could've died -- When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more -- By making me ill, he is punishing me! I just don't know what for. I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God! I don't even know where to put all my anger. No you didn't. But he did change. Just not enough. This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me! Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself! Dad -- I have expectations, too. It was a play. No. Up to? Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one. Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life. I'm supposed to always be alone? By accident -- He wants help with his lines --I want to see the sun rise. How does it look? I don't understand. You're hurting me. Well it's in mine, too. I'm a pureblood. I wasn't turned. I was born this way. Just like you. Am I evil because I want to survive? What about a wolf? What about any predator? Why do you hate us so much? If that's true, then why'd you save me? It doesn't have to be like that. We don't have to be enemies. Why? It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't. Thank you. Anyone else make it? "Each day is a little life. Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death." Each day is a little life. Blade. Blade. We've got six Reapers. They're all dead. Really? What are we supposed to do, then? Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live? What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing. A drug-dealer. How do you justify saving people like that? He's right about one thing. We do have to survive. Exactly. Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified. Super charged. And this -- I've never seen anything like this. The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you. It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones. If that's true, what about Nomak? He's been alive longer than the others. Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him? From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked. Minutes. I didn't know. What about Nomak? You're hurt. What was that? We need it. Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest. Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent. So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive. This is our world you're entering. You may see things -- feeding. Just remember why you're here. The House of Pain. What the hell are you doing, Blade? No. They've been training to hunt you. Two years. You're missing the point. Their vampire victims don't die. They turn. They become carriers. If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over. Do the math. Survival. They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man. Frankly, I'm disappointed. That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean. Without any assurances. Maybe it's better that way. We're locked in. You experimented on your own, son? Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato. Where did he learn that? His name is Jared Nomak.You have ID? Yes. Can I help you? What about you? What was I thinking, right? And that's it? xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Who is it? xxxxxx xxxxxx What? xxxxxx Yes. That's who I want to be. It doesn't matter who you were before. It's who you want to be. That's all that matters. We have this money. We have what we have. I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but... I say we leave here. We leave this place. We go until we can't go anymore. So what are we doing ? What does that mean? Jason, what does that mean? Jason, please...who is he? What is that? -- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? -- I found it. It took six calls. I found Kane. I found the body. It's a company... MPG Capital. You stayed there five times in the past six months. But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days. Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth-- -- we'll tell them what happened -- -- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just -- -- we'll explain it -- But the police -- Oh, Jesus... He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us! I don't trust anybody and I trusted you! I trusted you. You knew he was coming. He came to kill us. He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that? He's dead isn't he? -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture -- -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod -- -- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! -- -- where did you get my picture? -- -- where does this come from? -- How do you have my picture? ...this is my picture... he's got my picture -- -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday -- ...omigod, no... -- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening! -- please -- Jason -- omigod -- See. It's starting to come back, yeah? You mind if I take a bath? This is your office? God, you live like a monk... This is like a real apartment. This is really yours? Nah... With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right? You got me pretty fucking curious. Anytime. Okay, so... Jason... I should go. So this is it, right? Where? Looks familiar? That's it? Is that it? You ever think maybe you have a family? You were tired. Here... For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. So what do you dream about? We're about an hour away. I needed a break. You're paranoid. You were shot. It's natural. People do amazing things when they're scared. Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns. Okay, so you're a victim. Sounds like you were in an accident or something. What are you talking about? -- you could put it together -- Well, this is great. I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are. When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see? And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that? Amnesia? You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago? What? Like amnesia? Yeah, well, welcome to the club. Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris? What does that mean? I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. Something. You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, I don't know... What kind of music do you like? Shit -- Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out? Okay? Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out. Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me. I was supposed to have this car back three days ago. It's not my car. What if I say no? And I don't get hurt. I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt. You could buy a car for twenty grand. You could buy this car. You swear? That's great. I feel so much better now. -- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- No . No, that was too easy -- You have blood on your pants. For twenty thousand dollars. So what's in Paris? Jesus... Great. You know what? I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off. Get the fuck away from my car. It's a little late for that. Oh, Jesus... xxxxxx -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off! -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week... ... here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this! You only know that because I told you! Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --Sir, you waited on line. Do you have your passport, sir ? You have your passport? Well, either you are, or you aren't. You're a U.S. Citizen?Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death. Just get better okay? No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore. If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients. No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over No. Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange. Sure plenty of times. Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke? Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes. You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing. I understand, I think. Other women? You just made that up. Eighty third most common. Second most common? Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen? Okay so... what's the safest place? Bull... I'm stumped. All finished. I know, my bedside manner's horrendous. Of course, yes. You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round. I'm all over it. Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa? Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please. Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it? You need to get better first Trevor. Way better. It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay? Easy there Trevor. You need to relax. No wisdom, no insight, no plan. That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on. Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa? You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor. Your wife...? It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open. Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy? Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember? It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all. For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you. I only married you for your body. And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money. There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan Never to put you in my will. You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day? The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet. How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year. OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!! oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out. THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!! Oh my God. It's coming out. Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy. You've been cheating on me haven't you? I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond? If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock... You win! Okay pull over. Uh... eighty two? Shut up and play darling. Your turn.Sure. Good. Didn't want to miss anything. Yes, sir. Don't worry. I'll have a cool scar. Why? I know. Worth pursuing? Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop? A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing. A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him. You said that once, remember? About an hour ago. Said he was more than happy to cooperate. Five feet? Seven feet? How much closer would you say you were? But here's the thing. I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there. I mean, not in that fog. Okay. That must have been awful for you. Oh, I shouldn't have... Twelve years younger. The Puffins and the Hawks. We're in extra innings. The Hawks have a really good line-up this year. Oh. We always have play-offs in the middle of the night. It's the best time. Yeah. All over. The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night. But there wasn't any... We already did. Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in. But they're so boring. All small stuff. Don't worry about him... Actually... Detective Eckhart! I know! Welcome to Nightmute!Brody...I don't know... ...Something Brody! She used some stupid code name. My arm! She kept saying she was gonna get out of here. Leave us all behind. That <i>he</i> was going to take her! It was like some big fucking secret! She wouldn't tell me! I don't know. No... That's what I said. Hey... Long as it's fun. We were like sisters. Knew everything about each other. Since grade school. I was her best friend. What are you doing in this shit-hole town? I never met anyone from Seattle before.I don't want to leave you. Danny, it's not what you think. Why? I don't want to. What is it? Really, I don't want to. They would have killed you too. No. I want to know what the hell is going on. What's wrong, Danny? Why not? I been that way ever since. From day one. I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em. It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money. He knows where I work. I need my paycheck. We been through that. Please open the door, Danny. It's me. You think you're the only one down here with a sad story? What are you hiding, Danny? There you go again. You're nothing but false notes. You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield. What is wrong with you? Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe? This has nothing to do with him. You really need to lighten up. I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious? Nothing. Is that how you play? And you admire that? Like you? Never heard of him. Trust me. We're safe. Don't worry. He's out of town. What happened to your eye? How? I can't. I've got a kid. She lives with my parents. Quincey knows where they live. Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two. Because he'll kill me. Fuck you. I can't leave. You don't understand. I can't. Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I hate the son-of-a-bitch. It's not that easy. Go ahead. What? Oh, he's a keeper all right. Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now. Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to. That bad, huh? What about the guy on the very bottom? How? Oh God. Jesus, I look like a raccoon. I understand. Thanks anyway.Why are you doing this? That is so unfair. Here it comes, poor Tom. Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old. Just admit you're wrong. I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost. Look at that place. It's creepy. You think that's a good idea? Tom, quit fucking around. You mean like the Donner Party? Why didn't you just ask for directions back there? No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it. Tom, let's spend the night here. It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch. And you've got wiener breath. I was talking about Miles. And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it. A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.Boys, boys... Henryk, I said nothing bad. And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal. Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back. Do they? What d'you mean, take the table away? Stop it, Wladek. God forbid! Pack, Wladek, there's no time. Out of Warsaw. Pack, darling, get your things, pack. I've been worried sick. Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.What are you doing? I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself. By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate! It's running three meters down. Twenty knots. No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls. He's shut out the communication circuit! A piece of shrapnel hit me. Let me. Go to the water, it's that way! He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there. If they launch it, I know how to bring it back. Yorgi and Kirill. Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three. What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet. I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me. I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt. Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside. I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi. Aren't you afraid? They left. To a fortress in the mountains. Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said. No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander? What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me. It doesn't matter anymore, forget it. We're getting out of this place. We've done enough. I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now. I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room. Are you alright? You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember? Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice. No, I guess I've been no help at all to you. I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal. I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year. There's something I didn't have time to tell you before. No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece. I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse. That's alright, I'll figure something out. Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people. There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true. They tell me you're an American agent. A beach named X? That I'd like to see. All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts. Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it? You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you. Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much. So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan? That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil. What are you? Go to hell! I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are. Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets. I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for? Who are you? Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type. I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions. Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home. Mind your business. Go to hell. Yorgi asked me to. So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife. My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot. Do you know what a wire transfer is? Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S. The Peace conference... Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline. I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together. What are you doing? Nothing. He had two days.
