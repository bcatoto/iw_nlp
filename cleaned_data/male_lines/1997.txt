I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape. No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice. You know exactly where they are! The case was stolen? The case..with the stones... Where is it? What're you laughing about? At your service. Appipulai Leeloo Minai.. You are a monster, Zorg! Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another. They are robots! No thank you. ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it. Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you. ...Why on earth do the stones interest you? I remember you now..the so called art dealer. ...We're saved! That's what I'm saying. Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work. Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work! Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite? Leeloo's in trouble? You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause. What are you doing? Of course. We have to save the world. We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission.. I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston. It means, "Never without my permission". She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip. Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over! Thank you so much for your help Mr...? She's an exception.. Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins.. There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it! This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect! He's a she! The girl? Who are you? That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her? Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations. What are we going to do? Thank you, Mr. President. White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity. Yes..thank God.. And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it. We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions. Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important. Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL. Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose! It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here! Where's Leeloo? Good work, my son. Now all we need is a way to get there. Perfect. There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names... Yes. Of course.. Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know. Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves! The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!! I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part! It's a miracle!!!And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying? There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light. Don't tell me you don't know how all this works? When is she not in trouble? Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo. Trying to save your ass so you can save the world. Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks. Good luck.. What kind of mission? Is that the usual way priests go on vacation? That's what I thought. Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat? I know. I was there when she arrived. I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better? Dallas. Korben Dallas. They all like this in your family, father? So you do know her. You noticed... I brought the girl remember? She dropped in on me... holding this. She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here. Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest. I'm sorry, but... the Stones... Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again. I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time! I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are! ...So Cornelius was telling the truth! Leeloo... is... she's... Who? Leeloo.. 5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect.. Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist.. Hello? Uh... at least fifty. Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!! I don't need one. Like shit. I just found a picture of you. I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one. At least, the cat comes back. I was talking to the cat. Yeah? Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter? ...What's your name? I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured... Vito Cornelius? You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor. It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive. ...'Scuse me? ...Ma??? Hello? ...Not yet. Yeah? Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me. All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly.. I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about? Other than that... You all right? Yes ma.. Hi Ma... ...Hello? Found it? Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate? I'm sorry.. Thanks for reminding me.. I had the worst goddamn nightmare. How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I didn't. Is that all? Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!! What did you say? What did you do? Solid little jobs, aren't they? Fuck it! Hold tight! It's like a cab isn't it? I'll be right back. Not without Leeloo. We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader. Six to the left. One to the right. You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it? Yeah, very big, a giant. I don't think this is a good time... I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own. I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal? Uh... not really. ...Hi. Oh, yes you will... ...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back. I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished. She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please... It's my wife. ...Shit! One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive. I'm not going. You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet? I've had enough good news for today And the third one? Just one... why me? Where have I heard this song before? What mission? I love you... Because... Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight! Exactly. You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things... Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it! You can sleep tomorrow... come on... It's up to you now, Angel! I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones. Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work? I told you not to read all that crap! Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say? The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long. It's difficult. I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate. No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful! Where you going? You noticed.. You get that off the screen? Here we go again... Uh... Apipoussan? I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need. You learned 900 languages in five minutes?! Which one? Finished what? Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience.. Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is! Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos... Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you. It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better. Oh god! You hear that? Uh..you're welcome. I suppose that means "Hi" ? At least I won lunch. The last two messages I got? The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife. I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news. You're welcome.. You gotta push the little yellow button... You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded.. Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model? Been here long?That was me. You can't buy Wade off. Shit! What are we gonna do? Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I? Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me. Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in. Yeah. You heard the news. Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around. Deers have ears too. This way. Safety on? Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm. The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck. They said. Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk." Double A. New Britain. Drafted by the Red Sox. I used to play ball. Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow. Wonderful! I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time. Mmm. You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it. You might not kill it. If you get it? Done much shooting with that rifle yet? Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it? Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten. What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you. Open the door. We're late. Open the door, will ya? Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks. I'm fucking out of here. He sure as hell won't. Yeah. Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man. What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that. What? Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said. Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off. Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop? What blood? Yeah. The ambulance guys lugged him up. A half mile in, along the old lumber road. In the chest. Piece of fucking cake. Bastard's got his high beams on. Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him. Like you and Gordon? Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy. Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there. Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er -- Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke? No brag. Just fact. LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.We bought you. Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel. He's on to us! No, of course not. Just say it, that's all. You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment. Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right? This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade? You see it? I hear Twombley got shot. The key, Wade. Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys. Could be. Maybe. Don't light that in here. I'm allergic. What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there? Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal. Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me. So? Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little. Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch. You ever think of getting a new car, Wade? You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard? How you holding up, Wade? Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time. Something bugging you? What the fuck. My day's already ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do. Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling. That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley. You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit. I shoulda sent you instead of Jack. Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything? Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident? Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck. Huh? What's the hurry? That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody. Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left. You don't want the extra police pay? Don't go playing policeman. Huh? Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley. Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader. Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight. We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this. For what? Wade, are you alright? I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence. And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft. It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne. It may have happened, but not the way you said. I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened. I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after. I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember? Not particularly. A hunting accident is perfect. Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved. Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon? They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead? Money. Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt. That it wasn't an accident. I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one. Want to know what I think happened? Anything new about the shooting? Twombley? Well, do you still plan to get married? What about Margie? No thanks. I don't drink. What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her? Haven't you already done a bit of that? Get some sleep. Don't think about it. You're exhausted. What happened? Who? How was she? Huh? They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body. You think Jack shot him? Twombley. He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business. Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits. There was something. It happened up your way. Wade?You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks. Sun's gettin high. Yeah. What happened? Hmm. Really. Oh. You played for the Sox? Yeah? I'm okay. And you'll get your extra hundred bucks. You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck. You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine. You think so. Yeah. Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it. Damn straight! Guaranteed, eh? It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed. Twombley involved? What is the Northcountry Development Association? As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere. I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in. You don't believe me? ...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age. You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with? Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him. This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things. Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town. Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay. No. Black. You got yourself a computer, Alma. He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning. Tell me. Yeah. I know about that. Just tell me when you'll have it fixed. What are you boys up to? Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter. I'll send you the five hundred. Oh. Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost? Yes. It looks pretty hopeless, don't it? This spring. I plan to. Soon. I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father. I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow. Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad? Lawford? Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again. There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right. You musta seen him get shot. I know you did. Saw him do it? Sure you did. I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something. I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean? On your sleeve. Where'd you get the blood? You stayed away? You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb. No, I mean whereabouts. Where'd Twombley get shot? Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay? Shit. Right! Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me. How'd you get the job? Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky. Not here. You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job. I thought I told you to move that truck! Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? Where's that gun you were bragging on today? Don't mind if I do. Okay, let's go home, then. Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened. Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore. I know. You can't. I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to. Please don't cry. Please, honey. Fine. Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's. I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though. You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza? What do you want, then? C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say? How about a Big Mac? Grandpa. My father. It's his. It belongs to Pop. Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine. I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while? Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs. Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough. She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long? That's all you got to say? "Yes". She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait. Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother. C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves. Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake? Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first? Jesus, why? What? You called Mommy? Just now? Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something. You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here. No what? Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day. Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam. It's fun. What then? Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long. Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know. No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother? What are you talking about? It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change. To us it was. Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that. I guess they're stupid. Break stuff? Do what? Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ. Those are the Hoyts. Yeah. I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember. Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure. Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him. I've got to call my brother. You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that? Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right. You and Mel Gordon? I won't. You interested? Want to buy? That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew. You? Why? He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it. I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning. What do I have to do for it? On what you pay me? Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again. I'm fine, fine. Yeah. A few things. It ain't done, if that's what you mean. You want me to follow them to Littleton? Like hell. I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader. He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens. You mean Twombley? Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume. I figured you already heard. A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley. Fuck you. I'm not saying that. What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends. At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass. His son-in-law damn near killed me. Where's the plow? Tomorrow, Gordon. Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize. Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter? No problem. Look, I... Hi honey. Yeah, lots. It's just... We should talk. You ever come to your father's grave anymore? I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something? I don't want her to go, Lillian. Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake. Yeah. Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids -- Lillian! From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned. Mel Gordon. I know who it is. Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody. Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that. Going somewhere, Margie? Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit. It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it. Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry. This is nuts. I don't know for Christ's sake! Of course! I would've heard. Strange. The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started. I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long. Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents? Good. It was to the same woman. I was just a kid... It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know? I've been thinking about it, that's all. There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me. I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight. After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person. Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way. I can see what you looked like as a kid. No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know. No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age. Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia. Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that. Money. I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose. I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did. There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually. Tonight. Let's get together. The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her. Yeah. I mean that. I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know? Forget it. Said what? Yeah. Yeah. See you tomorrow, maybe. Okay. She's fine. For a while. Yes. Here's your ticket. Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just -- Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon. Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you-- I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation. Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment. How's that? Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal. Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer. Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley. I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here? He got his deer yet? His office. You mean my old office. Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich? No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting. I gotta go. Where... how'd you hear that? Jack? Not since last night. He took a guy hunting. That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different. Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong. I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too. The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something. It don't look right. You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know. I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you. Crawl! You and me. Yeah. Call it what you want. Love! What the fuck do you know about love? You don't know me. You don't know me! So fuck you. Fuck you. Pop, for Christ's sake! Listen, it's no big deal, Pop. Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed? Is there something wrong with the phone? Yeah. Where's Ma? Yeah. How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while. You remember Margie Fogg? Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma? Nothing. Just do it. Rolfe. To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on? I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it. But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office. Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another. That's what you think. Well, I never heard that one. We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him. You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that? Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it? Yeah. Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right? It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off? Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled. So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident. Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I? I don't know. You tell me. Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists. Motive. You gotta have a motive. Then who shot him? Which is? Find them everywhere. I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks. I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys. Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it. What about her? Yeah. I forgot. Anyone else want one? Rolfe? Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess. No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit. I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it. Yeah, I guess. A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill. Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me. Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home. The night before the shooting. Lillian was here. In Lawford. Well, it was an accident. No shit. Who? It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it. No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did. Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend. Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley? Rolfe.Okay, I'm slowing us down. It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay. How you doing, sweetie? Alice... I... Alice! How `bout a hug for the old man. How was... ...the ballet? Hey, you guys back already? It's cut. Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here. Got it. Sluggish... I think it's jammed too. No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding. Uh, we got a problem here. How we doing, Colonel? Got it. I'm doing what I can. He's busy being dead. You read my mind. U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One. An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in. Put together a score sheet. I'll make some calls. Thanks. Wrote it last night. Goddamn right I did. I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit. What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib? You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore. Why? Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this? Hold on, Alice. Let my daughter go or I'll take you out! One thing I've learned as Someday, you'll regret my nature. Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone. Stop. This administration does not negotiate with terrorists. She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me. Over my dead body. That isn't necessary. I'll not going without my family. Got it. Get `em ready. You... come with me. They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries. We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back. Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there? Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me. They've gotta be joking. Flying the plane. Call Petrov... I'll be back. Please... don't start with me. Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer. Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign. This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval. I'll make it up to you, I promise. I wish it were that easy... I miss you. And I miss her. You know what? And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule. What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man? She's a big girl. She understands. Rose, I don't have time for this. Can't it wait? Someone should give you a raise. White House Situation room. No good. I said they disabled the communications system. Excuse me? Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood? You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target. Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway. Did they say anything about my family? But... Where's my family? What's going on? No. no. no. Wait. Wait. Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the.... You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone. Don't cut me off. This is an emergency. This is the President. Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there? We're hooked. Hove into position. DO YOU SEE TEEM? They better. Fuel's almost gone. Twenty-five years. Shit. Iraq? Shep, you're fired. My god. I think that was a MiG. Shepherd. I never left. Where's my wife and daughter? Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right? Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation. That's my job. I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please. Did we tape the Duke game? It's bait. Don't take it. Right... Christ I'm tired. Do me a favor and keep me away from the press. This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee. Besides, Shep, I told you... I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns. I might still have a few chips left. No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say? I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.WE'RE HOOKED! IT'S OPEN! Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment. How long's it been since you flew, sir? Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq. A MiG? Where the hell are we? Sir... Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board? Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room. Yes, sir. You give me ulcers. We'll just say it was in bad taste. Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television. You can't afford to leave that hanging. Other way around, sir. We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge. The second amendment types'll love that. With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch. He and the NRA don't like the wording. You wanna knock of f? CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch.I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.' Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon? Is it about my teeth? To my health. 'Milk, milk, lemonade. Round the corner fudge is made. Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!' 'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food. It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.' Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation. Sak-i it to me! Or sometimes not at all. Groovy. I'd rather talk about Number Two. Behave! I didn't, baby, you just told me. Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills. Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta... Please? What, and watch all my earnings go... Down the toilet? You seem surprised to see me. Smashing! If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man. Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup. Hey, how are you? Yes Basil? Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all. Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington! I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition. Thanks. Yes, Basil? I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag. You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick. I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man. That's not your mother, that's a man! Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system. Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage. Carnies. Excuse me? Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war. Hello, Exposition. Thank you. Yes? Oh, yes. Thank you. Yes? Thank you, Basil. She's working on another lead right now. Right away, Exposition. Yes? Thank you, Exposition. Thanks. Yes? Thank you, Exposition. My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue? I hope I didn't say that out loud just now. You mean Mrs. Kensington? When do I begin? Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya! Nice tie. Yea capitalism! Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades? Russian Intelligence? Are you mad? Yes, I'm having trouble controlling... THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE! WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? Where am I? Thank you. Let's go, baby! Yes? Thank you. Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there. Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good. We know all that, Exposition. Good on ya, man. Well, you can't always get what you want. Hey, Mick! Why not? It's a question. Really? Let me ask you this. What is love? Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin. Man, you are one chilly square! It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil. That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility. No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same. It's freedom, man. I've got you, Dr. Evil! Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay? I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space. What's wrong with your hand? Behave! That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa. Lay it on me. I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor. Don't worry! Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail! Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs. I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I... It's not what it looks like, Vanessa. At ease, boys. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you. Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!-- Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops. We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag. You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor. Fair enough. It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong. That's not the way to get ahead in life. Not a good time to lose one's head. Smashing idea! Give it to me. All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter. First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts? Does that make you horny? Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa. Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. Just watch me. Watch me, now. No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy. Who? Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum? Out and about, doing odds and sods. Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming. Hello, luv. It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me. Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me. Only sailors use condoms, man. Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic. Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten. Of course, luv. Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands. She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed. I can't. You're drunk. Oh, yes you are. You're smashed, Vanessa. No, this is me in a nutshell. I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die. I'm sorry. Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous. Fancy a nibble? You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa. No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone... Well, you know... cows, and shagging. Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?' He's too well-protected right now. I never forget a pussy... cat. Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat. Let me see. We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment. Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear. Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with? That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog. I can't see a bloody thing. I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves. I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses. I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling. Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me! Honestly, this isn't mine. Why? What's wrong with my teeth? Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device. You've preserved my Jag! Smashing! Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing. Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest? Do I make you horny? Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest. That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right? Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews! You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro... Chigro. Have you ever made love to a Chigro? My meat and two veg. My wedding tackle. I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working. That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag? Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense? My jumbo jet? Smashing baby. OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby. If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me. God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum? Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound. I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby. I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine. That's not mine. Danger's my middle name. Actually, my name's Austin Powers. Where did you learn to shoot? I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert. No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece. Don't mind if I do. Here, have a piece of gum. Everything seems to be in order. Sure.Be careful! But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin-- Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you. Austin, I have something for you as well. Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you. Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair. Be careful. I'm leaving! Oh, and Austin? All right, Austin, I think you should go. Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother! My God, Austin, what have you done? Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development. Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it. What? What's the other thing you're scared of? What's the other? Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world. Be careful. There's one more thing, Austin. Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Oh, and Austin... Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck. Where is Vanessa, by the way? Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately. Be careful. Oh, and Austin... Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence. There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look. Well, I'm off to the chat rooms. Be careful. Oh, and Austin... Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated. She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you. Vanessa's one of our top agents. No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter. Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington. We won, Austin. A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over. You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence. The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process. You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years. Be careful. Oh, and Austin... Good luck, Austin. I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London. I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world. Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care. Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster. Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed. Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit. No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism. Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr. Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act. Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless. Right. Okay. Moving on. You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me. Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time. We've got a lot of work to do. Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure. Silence! And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth! Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak! Really? Are they ill-tempered? Right. I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have? What is it now? Right. Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads. Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph. Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal. I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it. Quite impressive. Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers. Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions? My son? Yes. The details of my life are quite inconsequential. Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive. No, the boy's right. I really am evil. Evil, actually, Doctor Evil. Scott, don't say that... I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent. What did you say? Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living? Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming? No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you? No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan. Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank. One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin. I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death. In due time. Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers. And that's how you want to live your life, is it? Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening? Scott my boy, come here. How was your day? An evil petting zoo? An evil vet? But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die? Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil. I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! Someday, Scott, this will all be yours. Oh, really? One-hundred billion dollars. OK, make it happen. Anything else? All right then... ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS! Right. Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage. Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom... ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS! People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here. OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser." Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom. Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab. Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group! Show me. Blow me. I don't want to. I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out. Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away! Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done. But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for? Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him? Yeah. What? Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax. Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'. You always do that! Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil. No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something. Not me. I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you! Hi. I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me. No, he's really evil. I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff. I don't wanna take over the family business. OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business. Well, it's kind of weird.Justin? Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you? ...do you copy? You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins. I can see why they sent you along. I heard it. I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker... Will it work? ...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before. Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark. But Justin... The containment, Second Containment... We have a man down... I'll be all over it. ...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on... From what? ...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...! You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that... Time to play Spam in the can. Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in. Solid as a rock. Hey, Smith... We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole. We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU. You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix. Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me. What? You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record? I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!" I'm telling you, I saw it... You weren't there. I saw it. It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal... Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this? Coffee. Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee? What...? I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon. I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead. Can you shut it down? How? The Bridge is gone. Let me breathe, let me breathe... What's happening? Is that an offer?It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks. You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives. On my way. I'll get him. Hold on, Coop... Coop, where are you... You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens... You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years? EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak. This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway? Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer -- Don't start with me, Cooper. Oh God... Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I... Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor. DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead. "Save yourself. From Hell." What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed? Hear what? It's not a distress call. It's a warning. Go on. What is it? I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of. And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide. Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things. I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close. We'll make it. I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers. Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared. How is he? No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers. And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why. He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ... Justin. I won't let you die. You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright? Justin. Patch me through to him. Justin, finish your sweep. Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on. Start the countdown. Thanks. Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us. That's a negative, Starck. Do it. Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan... Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers. ...you okay? Peters... Can anybody hear me... ...how's the client? Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters... Alive? The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here. What you got, Peters? The blood came from somewhere, Peters... Starck, you still showing those readings? Peters is right, no one's here. So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan? Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze. Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark. I am sorry. But now we have to go to work. I put in for a replacement for you but no one... What's the hold up? You can't have them. Go to hell. Starck... Cooper... You're lying...! Then what, what are you? Tell me... You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit! What are you? Then who the fuck are you? If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too. What are you talking about? Your eyes... Son of a bitch! Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home. Watch me. We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed. Fuck this ship. It's done. Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is. Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark. "...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us. We're leaving. That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor. The "Other Place," what is that...? Where has it been for the past seven years? To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it? You said this ship creates a gateway... That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit! I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock. Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know." Do it. We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time. We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad. We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it. What the hell is that? Dr. Weir? Explanation? It's 2041... What about it? You have something, Dr. Weir? Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men. No one goes near that thing. I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits. If it worked. It's insane. How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core? What could cause them? What's in the Core? Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?" One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him. Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock. They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward. Negative. Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep. I can see that, what're they for? Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright? -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is! I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job. Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board -- Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge. Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster. What does it say? Where has it been for the last seven years? Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way. Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why. The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks. Smith? Smith! Fuck! Get out of there now! Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock. One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark. Smith, get out of there... What is it, Smith? Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her. Now what? Thank you. Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly. That's enough! We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air. I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark? You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me? No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks? Do we have enough time for a weld? Smith, where the hell have you been?! Starck, give me a read. Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby? Starck... Where is it? I noticed. Starck, anybody home? Dr. Weir...! I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady. What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?" We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out... Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening... ...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees... What is that? I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in? He's dead... ...repeat, we're armed... We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow... No. I'll be right back. We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put... BLOW THE FUCKER UP. Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place. Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir. Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can! I'm on my way, Starck. Stay here! Don't stop working! What? What's going on in there, Starck? I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about. What I want is to survive the next ten hours. If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time? Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible. We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories... To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive? Go ahead. "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me? What is it, Starck? Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something... No. It was someone else. Do it. Dr. Weir... Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found. So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions? What's causing the readings? What about the life readings you picked up? We can take the filters from the Clark... Carbon dioxide? How much oh-two do we have? But you can breathe it. Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought. Everybody okay? Keep your eyes open. Radiation interference? Come around to three-three-four... Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go! And Cooper... Put some pants on. Starck, why aren't you on the bridge? Let's go. Justin?Roger that. It's holding... She's holding...! What about the accumulator...? You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down. You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel. I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you. Where is it, where is it... No, no, we just got her back together... Come again, Skipper? I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark. Skipper... She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere. Captain, we got a problem. Sir. ...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew... Understood. I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time. Captain Miller, you copy? But... They're gone. We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead. We don't have time to fart. We have a situation here... Captain Miller... It is now. We're locked in. Love to. Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit! 1500 meters. We're getting too close... We've got some weather. Yes, sir. Something like that, yeah. That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know... We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop. One-four degrees... Heading three-three-four... Jesus... Locked and cocked. Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out... I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked. What? The safety circuit's failed! What the hell is that? Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber... Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker... Dead ahead, 5000 meters. Hey... I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship... Get them back -- Explosive decompression. Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off... 1000 meters... Range 3000 meters and closing. Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this... You can't do that. 30 hours to Neptune orbit. I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion. I don't know what happened to Justin. Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible... No, he didn't. The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now. No, thank you. What? Thank you. A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them. It's the Event Horizon. She's come back. Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax? You wanted to see me, Admiral? That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering. Background radiation. Perfectly safe. You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side. I built it. ...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal. It's called a gravity drive. Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship. The crew? Could they still be alive? This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all! The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream. I have to go. I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle. This is Weir. NOOO! I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me. There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING. Better if I just show you. I'm not the Devil. You know. Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller? Weir is dead. What makes you think I'll miss? Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is? It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil. It's a liberating experience. I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see. I told you... She won't let you leave... You can't leave. She won't let you. You... You can't do that! What about my ship? Don't... don't do this... You're insane. You've lost your mind. You can't, your orders are specific... I DON'T KNOW! I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time. I don't know... I don't know... Yes... What do you want me to say? Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations -- Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane. I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain. Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries. The Core...! I don't know. Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible... Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened... The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead. Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years. The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034. The date. There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control. If it worked, yes. "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day... It's complicated... It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark. Yes. It beats dying, Mister Smith. No one? Any survivors? Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead. In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat. You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering. That is not acceptable -- Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship... Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure... That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there. NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message... That's what we're here to find out. It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive. And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace. Until now. I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space. Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity... Captain Miller, I just want to say... Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge? No. I saw nothing. Can you see a body? Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that? You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew? They're explosive charges. Claire... Wasn't that ship destroyed? He's been past Mars? Yes. Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith. It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support. We're losing atmosphere... That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship. Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer? She's not ugly. Where is she? Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here... ...to "point B," here. Now: what's the shortest distance between two points? It means nothing. The forward airlock. I'm alright. Please. It wants me. I have to go. No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years. Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now. Yes. Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all. That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light. What is it? Ship's log. Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan? Do they have pressure? Wrong. The shortest distance between two points... Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity... Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.Of course, but there's more -- Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator. Standing right here in my office. Your prerogative, Senator. -- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution. Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses -- Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell. Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it. Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'. I'm not sure what -- I don't see how, O'Neil. Dismissed. I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant. But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders. There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty. You should prepare yourself. I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try. Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety. Specifically, that you were... "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming." Permission to evaporate, O'Neil. "We'll all have lunch." Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS! You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant? You'll get everything you want, O'Neil. Let's see if you want what you're gonna get. Then good night. And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator? And please note I did not identify any one in particular. Straight up? Well. 'Least now we're talking the same language. So one standard. Is that what you're after? No, sir, WHAT? What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment. What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears. But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities. DOES IT? Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander? If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home. Did you just have a brain-fart? Because I was civil, now you're complaining. Oh, really. All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning. A name? Didn't take long. If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we? Take your leave. Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed. I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant. You'll have separate beds, separate heads. If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary. If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately. Questions? Don't worry about it. If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask. So. We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training. It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you. Would you care for a beverage? Tea? Yes, of course. Please, have a seat, lieutenant..."Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long." Look. It's not like you'd be completely out of reach. And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado. There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined. I'd sure like to know who. "Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is. What? Well, pardon me if I do. Now who else? Who could've leveraged a class officer like that? C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game. Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy. "John James Urgayle." The Chief. Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork. Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back? C'mon, Jordan. Do the headwork with me. The Chief? Or maybe even Turrentine? Your C.O.? Almost like someone put him up to it. Okay, who? And this class officer... "Wickwire." You think he was just trying to get even? Striking back for... Jordan. You watch your ass. That's not what I want, Jordan. I mean... it is and it isn't... I'm only trying to warn you in case -- Big symbols make big targets, Jordan. I think someone's gunning for you. I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane." You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster. Don't you know? How they're talking about you? Well, not this. I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago. Got some fresh stuff -- about you. You may be in a hostile camp. I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn. That bad? How hard they making it on you? I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages? Jordan... Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth. But I'm trying to be honest, okay? Three years is a long time. Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know. And either do you. I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan. Maybe we should just let it happen. I'll try to keep the door open. If you wash out, I make it so that -- You're such a ball-breaker sometimes. Especially at night. Well, guess I don't even need to be here... So dump on me. She's haze grey and underway... Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel. Spec-Recon. Those guys are world- class warriors. And they will not want you there, Jordan. So why're you even considering it? Are you? By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover. And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here? Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle. Probably hear back from CNN first. That was good headwork, lieutenant. You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back? Is that correct, O'Neil? Blank faces here, O'Neil. Halfway 'round the world. So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out. You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil. Analyze. Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries. Gotta situation here. Where are you? Stuck in traffic? I don't... What, someone on base? A "mole"? Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day. Know what I mean? Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall. She thinks I do, but... I don't know. Seems... Women. The first female President? Possibly. Just to spite DeHaven. The Navy? They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads. What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed? The E-Ringers? Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe. You knew about us? O'Neil, Jordan.I'm sorry, O'Neil. But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations. Okay. Well... thought I'd ask. Sure, sure. I think you look beautiful. Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four. Don't wanna come, do you? That's okay. Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why. Last time I didn't. O'Neil? Not me. You? At first. So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there? Brother said it was worth it. Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything. Nah, they were dead-ass asleep. But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette. Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted. One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline. This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense. So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone. But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts. When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother. He was Spec-Recon. And the stories he used to tell... Intagliata was out chasing breakfast. They found his tracks. Well, shit. You know, I had an apartment about this size once. Hey. Way to gut it out. You're kind of a surprise yourself. Made it to Week 10 last time. It was made clear. Anyway, stay ballsy. First week's hell, then it levels out. Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway. That's hell-and-a-half. It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all. To your face, anyway. They're more afraid of you.Course you didn't. I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car. Look, man, I know I owe you -- I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places. Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk. Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you? I ain't gittin' in that trunk. Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody. Go ahead. Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere -- Uh-huh. What's the problem? Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high -- That requires me goin' out tonight? What? What'd ya mean? Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV. That's not what they're tellin' me. Three years. If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it. I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time. You. You were there for me. What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.And you didn't tell the Police? How'd you know where he was? Why were you with him? Does he have the marked bills on him? Can I have a word with you? What time do you have to be there? We are. Don't worry about it. She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her. She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you. She wants to go back to work. She almost sounds scared. She wants to make a deal. Great, you're here. Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her. I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray? She leaves, somebody'll be on her. What's her name? Bet you're happy to be working again. How was your flight? You don't want much, do you? But now you're telling us now you do. Help us do what? Thanks. Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment? Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic. What's this? What's in it? While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind? Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away. Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker? Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking. You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs? This is your money? You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion. This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag? Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word. This one. Yeah, down the end. I'm carrying it. Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it. Goddam you. Gimme that bag, Lemme have the bag. What are you doin'? Just stay right fuckin' here, all right? We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around! We're leaving now! Uh-huh? And your point is? Uh-huh? You live with him. Does that bother you? No. So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here? I wouldn't go so far as to say that. Yeah. Yeah, that really hit the spot. Sure. That sounds like a problem. Must of made quite an impression. Who's arm is that? You lived in Japan, when? You been to Japan? I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars. Who didn't make the cut? I don't like dancing. No. We had done time together already. Detroit. No. So where did you go? Were you a disco girl? I thought you were sixteen. You're fourteen years old here? The roller disco one. No thanks. It's a diet thing? What's a Metrix? Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing. Is it ready to go? Bank robbery. Uh-huh. Two months shy of four years. Susanville. Four days ago. Sure. I'm impressed. He knows a lot. I can sit through it once. I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons. Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other? How am I supposed to know that? Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other? Max Cherry. I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend. You know who I saw in the dress department? Jesus Christ. I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds. That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right. Maybe the Feds got it. If she's got it, why didn't she take it all? It's in there. Fuck you for asking me that. That's right. We went to the parking lot. Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her. Maybe a minute. She came right out. The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to. Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I. You said five hundred and fifty! How much it there? What? In the chest and stomach. Pretty sure. Uh-huh. Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno... You know how she is. Twice. In the parking lot. I shot her. That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves. That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time -- I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag. I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you. It's Louis. Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.' Uh-huh. I still don't understand why you keep her around. What does that mean? Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust? Well, why the fuck keep her around? Yep. That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her. She believed you? What's your relationship? Can I ask you about Melanie? How much is there? I didn't look like a bum. I follow. Yeah. What did he do? Who was Beaumont? Who was that? I'm in my underwear. C'mon in. You're outside? The moon -- I dunno I dunno. Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was. Oh, I dunno. Watching TV. Okay. What do I do? Which one is for the car? I'm going to wait in the car. Then what? That's good money. Are you serious? What's your cost? Who's your partner?I won't forget. I'll call her. Then say "Yes, Max. I understand." I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries. I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem. Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand? But then you told her you were home. But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would. Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him. I found out. I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here. In his inside coat pocket. I'm just tired in general. Thank you for saying that, but no. My business. Thanks, but you have a good time. Madrid or Barcelona? Where're you going? You'll get over that. I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do. I know. I didn't say you did. Not after they're dead. That's Ordell's. Did you tell him you were leaving? What's he doing? I'm sure. I hesitated taking that much. Less ten percent. What if he hears something he's not supposed to? We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting? What do you tell Nicolet? Why? Tell him you want to see him? Set him up. So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet? It's not that simple. Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory. On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department. People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me. All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie. In a dress. You're gonna have surveillance all over you. Then you're out and you get nothing. You're takin' a helluva chance kid. What if he checks it? Where's the rest of it? But you still have to show him the money at the airport. It'll be more than that. You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit. Do you think they bought it? You're rationalizing. The feds. It's evidence. Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison... I believe I said I'd be tempted. Which one? More or less. He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it. That's my job. Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County. And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him. Got another gun and a stun gun... Uh-huh. Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home. Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman. It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday. A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it. I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones. Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business. A half-a-million dollars will always be missed. If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it? What? If I was in Nicolet's place? No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence. Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that? You know some interesting people. Has he hinted around? I see. I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money? You think he's got a thing for you? I called you last night. He was here? Will Ordell go for that? Sit down, leave the bag under the table? Make the delivery somewhere in the mall. You don't actually do it that way? Bring the money in and they follow it? You talk them into it? What're you, a bag lady? I don't care. I'm old enough to be her father. She's adorable. But I had to end it. Sandra Bullock. You know her? For now. These relationships never last too long. Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady. No... ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady. Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady. "American President" Catching a movie. I walked right past you. Well, hello. Fifteen thousand. Does something else worry you? Bigger? You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department. I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me. Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it. It's not really something I think about. You're not old. You look great. It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody. You're gonna offer to set him up? How do you get it out? No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out. Why? What?... What'd you do? He called you? How'd you find that out? Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point. What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you. Are you? It's nice. '76? Who is this? This is pretty. You never got into the whole CD revolution? It looks nice. Sure. Somebody loan it to you? You went out this morning and bought a gun. You went out this morning and bought a gun? Black's fine. You get a chance to use it? If you're having some. What'dya think? Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you? Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something. Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission. If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand? Cash poor? He's got that kinda money? How many trips did you make? 'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into? He's the one who wants you. No, you didn't. What branch? You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal. Same as you. Ten thousand. I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday. That would be Beaumont Livingston. What did they want to know? They wanted you to tell them what you know. You know who put the dope in your bag? But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. How 'bout another? I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison. What have they told you? I am, as a matter of fact. You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options. Was she helpful? What's your brand? Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on. Great. Why does it need to be dark? It's kind of a sports bar We could stop at the Hilton by the airport. I thought you might want a drink? It's okay. It's a cop hangout. Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom? In cash. You're serious? I gave you my card there. Who do you think I am? I can give you a lift home if you'd like? I think I do. Is that good enough? They don't have your winning personality. You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying? Whatever looks best and starts the soonest. I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat. I'm going out for a few hours. Yes. No. Yeah. Uh-huh. Turn left. It's the next street. She will. She's all alone. Uh-huh. If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything. I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone. It's in the safe. She can't get at it. She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened. She was afraid. She's been there since Thursday night. My office. This place stinks. In a way, yes. All I did was walk out with it. Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money. She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it. Uh-huh. That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found. Winston found you. She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now. I have a bond receipt for you to sign. I'm alone. I thought you might be asleep. You still there? They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money. The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember? Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called. I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older. Where is it? Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business? Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her? Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab. If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit. Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess. I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks. You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement -- Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand. You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out. Was she? Beaumont worked for you. What does she do for you? The stewardess. Do you know her last name? Did the police contact you? Hear what? What? Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first. It still sounds high. The bond for possession is only a thousand. Oh, yeah? What did he do? I can see that. Why? Comfortable? Yes. Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses. Now I need you to count your money. House or apartment? I need your name and address. They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon. Possession of unregistered machine guns. Do you know what he's on probation for? On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation. Beaumont Livingston. Getting there. What's his full name? He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses. Ten thousand sounds high. Who's it for? A relative? Cost you a thousand for the bond. You have cash. What do you need me for? You have it with you? So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral? Yeah. That's Winston. He works here. How can I help you?Sure. The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it. Every step of this goes in my report. I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag. She knows it's my case? What's she willing to give us? What's she want? She sound scared? What's going on? Hey, Jackie. Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston? You got a good lawyer? That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here. I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story. What about you? We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you. We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range. Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell. I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie. You'd take a polygraph on it? It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand? This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara? We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go. There was a guy with Melanie? What did you do after that? You took the time to pay the saleswoman. Where's the bag she gave you? But you didn't do that. You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after. I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you. Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende? Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now. After all, it don't belong to nobody, right? If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right? What? To put one of these in my pocket? You didn't count it? That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much. Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court. Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think? Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow? But she mentioned Beaumont by name? Was she there? She told you that? What did you say? And splittin' with her? What's her story? Who's the other one? Ever meet her, or they talk about her? ...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins. We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell. Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell? His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville. You talk to him? You two meet? The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a... I'm recording this. This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX. How can you help us? Then how do you know he sells guns? You ever see him sell guns? No shit. You know how he makes his money? Oh, so now you know him? You know what we want. We can look into that. Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you? We'll just be a minute. It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute? I know what it looks like. And what would this be, Sweet and Low? Oh, Miss Brown?But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it. Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat. Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no? You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass? Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk. Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it -- I can't believe you do me this way. You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it. We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes. What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea. Let me finish. Can I finish? I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup. Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got? Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home. Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me. A bit. I need a favor. Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga. Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me. That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate? Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you? How old is that machine gun shit? Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass. You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work. Who? Who was there for your ass? Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit? We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you. Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get. That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him. Who's paging you? I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign. So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished. She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on. She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag. No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time? I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither. No answer? She don't know shit about the money. She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'. Man, I don't like that part. Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it. Well, you weren't supposed to be there. How do you know she did that? What the hell you talkin' bout? Drink? I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise. What'd you care? Uh-huh. I can do that. I'll give ya ten. Managers get ten percent. Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner. I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself? I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this? So we need two people, two women. And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me. But you don't? Yeah, I think a woman. A woman. Who? That's a good idea. Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money. What did they say? What the fuck's that got to do with it? You told them that? Didja tell 'em anything else? Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it! You told em? You told em it's me? How the fuck they know that? You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you? I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass. Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it? The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that? Talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. I got a problem... Yeah? Baby, I didn't -- I just came here to talk. I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do. I understand woman, damn! Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back. Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you. Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much. What the hell you doin'? I think it's a gun pressing against my dick. This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him? Yeah? I knew it. You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know. And what was your answer? I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too. Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business. Who you think got your ass outta jail? Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver? Got some o.j.? How you doing, Ms. Jackie? Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more! Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses! You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell? Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county. You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there! You gonna tell me who it was? Tell me. What? Or... ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room. Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off. If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass. 'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her. Okay, so it was Jackie Brown. What'd you shoot her with? Pull the car over. You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn? Where you shot her. Then what? Louis, You tellin' me the truth? How long was she in there? Came outta where? So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million. Maybe forty, maybe not that much. Where's the rest of it? Louis? Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman. Where did you shoot her? So you're sure she's dead. You shot her twice? You couldn't just hit her? Couldn't talk to her? You shot Melanie? So what, you left her there. You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about. Hey, where's Melanie? Not now, pick me up. Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis. When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money? Did you get it? Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door. Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge. Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you. I told you, man. She my fine little surfer gal. You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie. I don't hafta trust her, I know her. 'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word. You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman. She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she? If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome." Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway. She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood. Sure. Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise. But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going. So we on the same page then? He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did. And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em. Understand what I'm sayin'? An employee I had to let go. That was Beaumont. Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you. Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here. Uh-huh. I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel. I know you don't know. I said guess. Guess where I am? Whatcha watchin'? Louis, my man. Watcha doin'? Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em. You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open. This one's for the ignition... ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door. Take the keys, man. Listen to music. Sure. We almost done, ain't we? I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending. Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million. I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece. That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in. As low as two. See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty. Thanks, Baby. You better be, motherfucker. You sure? Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car? She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it. I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'? My money's in that office, right? I know where to turn. I know where it is. I call your office, she better answer the phone. By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he? That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office. You expect me to just walk in there? Call her, tell her the combination. Have her bring the money here. That I gotta see. She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home? And where's Jackie? You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at. My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch. And you did that to protect my interest? Lift up your pant leg. You help her? I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head. Well, give it to me then. Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh? How the fuck did he find me? How'd you find me? You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her? That's all? Git your ass in here. You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever. What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot? Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back. She got off, huh? You know who this is? What's up with this shit. Is that what I think it is? Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with. Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused -- Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind. Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit. I got it. I just don't got it on me. Jackie ain't got time for all that shit -- Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand? If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything? Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears? That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money! Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out. Brown, Jackie Brown. Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure. Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out. You didn't hear? Somebody already did. She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all. They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession. She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess. I got some more business for ya. The door was opened, so I just came right in. I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies. I get my money back, don't I? Hey, Max. Beaumont ain't going nowhere. Where do I sign? House. Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222. Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition. Will they consider this a violation of his probation? Haven't a clue. You don't say. Livingston, huh? You go wait in the car. Wait a minute. Beaumont. That's the only name I know. You think you could do that? They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before. Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him. I know that. C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you. It's in my bag. Gonna have to put up cash. It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it? He's a big one. You two tight? Where would you like me to put my ash? Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new. Hope you don't mind keeping him company. Hello. Hey, Jackie... No, Jackie, I didn't get your message. Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition. We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street. We're back. Who is it? Get that for me, will ya baby? Give me his home number. He leave town? Let me speak to Max Cherry.I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid. It kept going off for some reason. False alarms. How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened. I like to remember things my own way. Yes, I thought my wife... This is our bedroom. I don't. I don't know him. But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he? Dick Laurent? Andy, who is that guy? The first night... Not the last two. Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you... No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed. That's it. But my head... Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin. The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin. No, no. I want to go in. My... My head. Where's Alice? That's absurd. What do you mean? You're where right now? No, no I don't. Are you sure? I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met? No... of course not. I thought there might be somebody inside. I told you to stay in the car! He's got some fucked up friends. What job? Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place. Let's go home. Just a minute. I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on. Where would you feel safe? No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember. What? I wish I knew. Thanks, guys. So? All right. Don't you want to watch it? What's that? Another tape? Who the hell owns that dog? You're up early. You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you. I had a dream about you last night... You were asleep when I got home, yes. From the club. You didn't answer. I called, you know. When you didn't come to the club. Same one you were reading the other night? Good book, huh? Maybe. Does it say anything on the tape? Who's it from? What's that? That's why I married you. It's nice to know I can still make you laugh. What are you going to do?FUCKIN' "A". SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME.

You know who it is. Hey, Pete... How ya doin'? I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes. Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this... ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?... I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?... How ya doin', Pete? You're my man, Pete. If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today. I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today? You will. Suit yourself, champ. Yeah. Give ya a boner. You like pornos? No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow. What'd I tell ya. At sixty? I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.

How'd you get in with these fuckin' people? Pornos. What's he do? What deal? You like it? Have you partied with him? We should stop seeing each other. So what do we do? Are you positive he knows? Okay. Hello. Me, too. Sure. Okay... Hi. Hello. Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number. Me, too. Over there. I don't know. Yeah, I remember. Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready. Sure.

What else about that night?... Did anything happen? Sure. Sure I do. Whatiya mean? I don't remember... What happened that night? What night? I don't know. Sorry... I... Sure. Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin". Yeah?...Oh no, I can't do this job by myself. Kay, you're scaring your partner. Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people. You coulda told me what you were doing. After I got the shit beat out of me! Getting eaten!? That was your plan!? Kay!? in case I need it? Wow... this one's cool. And it looks just like a shotgun. Do his job. Would you call this a code 100? All of it? Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they? For how long? Since how long? What are you doing? That's my point. For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things. He said our enemy in already here. Well maybe it is. Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here. I know you don't trust him. You don't trust anybody-- Kay. All I'm saying-- Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true. Yes. Well, in his own mind, yeah. What if, from his point of view, he is? Kay-- What if he's telling the truth? I dunno, man. Maybe we should. The Pentagon. Jesus Christ... Jesus... That's the Loch Ness Monster. And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes? You think that's what's-happening? The radio show? What's going on, Kay? Looks like a train ticket. And what's this ... ? I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?. Gee. You really think? There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia. I take it there's a reason we're going to this one. Then wouldn't we also know if he's here? Now what? A what? I guess it's simple, huh? They're either gone... or dead. what's this? I dunno. Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn. Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates? Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me. What? Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ? Um-- Kay? Why? Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun. I know I don't know you all that well, but-- Well, one thing's for sure. You could certainly lighten up. Ha ha. No, really. What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock? I think you're too used to it. If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long. I know, I know. I read the manual. No attachments. We work alone. Blah. blah. Hey, I was workin' her. I was workin' my thing. I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot. And what if I wanted to see her again? I'd have to completely re-introduce myself. I'm just saying it was cold. I think she kind of liked me. I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here.. I think she's the alien. In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room. I know, but we're on a college campus... I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing. I think it'd be a good look for you, too. I'll even help you choose a tattoo. Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa. I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh... So... lemme get this straight. We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets. We got information no one else in the world is privy to. And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect? But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect. It's a bug. I understand. Hey, it works for the Hasids, right? No one recognizes them. Oh. Right. I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way. Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it? Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space. Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity. Kay. Seriously. What if he actually means what he says? Sure. You know, there's something we never really thought of... Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet? I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it? Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of. They respond to fear, right? What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is? Okay. If you've got a bug problem-a big one. And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them? Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little... Actually... I don't know. What do we do? Lean into it. So... how did they get here? When? But it's definitely a nest, isn't it? What is it? Why not? I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort. Actually, you may have. Exactly. I very much enjoy that. Right, right-- I like that stuff. Oh, yeah, well, you know. I'm a big fan. I've read all your work. I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt. So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe. It's easy. You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after. Oh, you'll still, be guarding him. No. just peace on Earth. We have one motto: Peace on Earth. You got smeared. Kids' game a couple galaxies over. ...touch that. It's not even a fucking door. It means I know you think you got a beat on things. But trust me, you don't. You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world. And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine. Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him. So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat. And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing. Now I'm sorry. But this has been one long, bad day. Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth? Cowan-- Cowan-- Obvious? Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside. The hell were you thinking? You shot an eight year old girl. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your choice of targets. The hell happened? Dee. God damn it. I told you to go home. Dee, you've been useful for 50 years. We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest. Yup. Sure is. Don't worry about it. Grab the coffee, will ya? I told Zed I'd give him a buzz. I wasn't scared... Don't worry about it. It's been a long night. Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember? Don't worry about it. Four-Eyes'll run a track on him. We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of. Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little. Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home. What? I thought you just-- Mikey. Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me. Mikey. I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey Gimme the 140. Three, huh? Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four? Huh? No? Which do you have your money on, Dee? You heard me. You two, especially. Underground gas vein. Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns. Actually that's a very good question. The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here. This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it. This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain. More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block. I said I need you to look right here. DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH. Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go. Vayanse. You others, go on. INS, Washington. Special services. We'll take it from here. I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement. Not her. Me. They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful. There wasn't time, sport! And I almost got digested. It goes with the job. You were saying? Do IT! SHOOT HIM! In case I need it. Actually, it is a shotgun. Hold onto it-- Right. Oh, and here. I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel. You guys get to the Memorial. Keep this stuff hidden. The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to... I'd double it and add 20. It's marble. We saw it in the office. It went from this big... to big... in a day. Maybe they didn't get here. Maybe they've been here. Since as long as we've been keeping records... Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing. That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury. Did it leave when everything else left? Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now-- I know what you're saying. And I'm telling you I don't trust him-- Great. Fine. Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers. I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs. How does that help me? He's here to help!? Hang on. There's gotta be something on this guy. Did you contact the Alliance? Do they have anything? You know something? I actually never think of that. I gotta get some coffee. Oh, yeah? Fill us in, why don't you. "Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..." Where's it coming? Where's he landing? We're rising. Get back in the car! Ernie Goose? Cynthia? I think that's what's happening... No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards. I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds. Where to? What? Why did Mikey leave Nazca? Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why? Something's wrong here. There's a god damn good reason. He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is. Hold it. A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left. History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid. They use it to make our food digestible for their systems. Or someone has a nitrogenizer. Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe? It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife. All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own. Let's check am out. If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage? Something seem unusual to you about that? Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD. Jay winces. You don't know me at all. Why? It was a long time ago.- I taught kindergarten. You don't know the half of it. If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone. Believe me, you get used to it. Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot? Or is it actually being an idiot? Besides-- Such a shame, too. Cause you made such a good impression the first time. She didn't even know you. . Keep her out of here while I check it out. This is a college? I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival. It's the way we do it. The way we've always done it. So what's the problem? Right. The point is to not call attention to ourselves. We wear black. Let's go, Jeebs. Downtown. And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me-- And I'm arranging deportation papers. Your licence is revoked. Permanently. You figured what? Maybe you need a closer look. What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack. Recognize this? Goodwill... Not bad. Briliiant, actually. You come unarmed, and alone. Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150? No-- a Person is smart. People are dumb. And the more people you put together, the dumber they get. And you know that. Why don't you ask the Mosebacke? Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork. Today, they don't exist. Pardon me. I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have. How is this going to help? What are you talking about, it's coming? What's coming? Try seven. From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident. You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh? Oh yeah? Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to? You know how many rules you've just broken? I don't believe you, Mikey. And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon. Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere. Cause I think we're looking at it. Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it? Did he say where? Did our friend announce when he's making his speech? I know what this is. Zed, you in? Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years? ... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia? Yeah, I'll talk to you. So... now what? Cattle call again? This guy. Where was he? Tell us the truth. You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood. I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make. Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now. In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute. They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon. Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals-- Wait-- listen-- Which way? We need to talk to you about the alien. But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before. We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau. We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere. May I have a look? This it? We're from Scientific American. We read about your discovery. We'd like to take a look. Just a guess. But I think found a nest. Don't tell me. Insects. Yeah? What's up? Oh shit! Did it leave? Where's he making his big speech? They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS? And they're buying it? I'm getting a trajectory... Dee? What are you doing here? Keep an eye on things there. We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels. Jesus, everyone's moving. Could be an assembly. Does it look aggressive? What about the other agents? Ella? Tee? What the hell is going on? Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why? Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons. Fine. Good.No. But You'll get used to it. Welcome to the Men in Black. His physics are a little different than ours. Don't worry Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too. Dave. Hell of an assistant, isn't he? Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him. Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware. Be safe. Have a good day. Oh, uh... Cowan? From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way. Understand? Only the damn guy won't know it. Mrs. Edelson? You think we're nuts. We're the government, Cowan. For instance... It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then... What's so funny, cadet Cowan? They don't. Now, son. If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways. Here's a little piece of advice: Don't use this so much. Your supervisors have no idea why you're here. I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across. Me, too. I feel a long day coming on. Yeah. His dream and our worst nightmare. Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It? How'd you know? And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates? Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from? I got a planet check on that bug. It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system. Actually, I don't know... Well, it wasn't in the jar... They haven't announced it yet. All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history. As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed. All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public. They went right to the President. What do we have? Are we showing anything? They're gone. Hard to tell. I hope not. Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off. Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game. Shots got a lot to mop up. Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning. He's gone, too. I need you in Philadelphia. I got a code 90, in a-high school. Kay? What's your 20? So whattya say, kid? You in or out? How's Dee?Is that where you're family lives? I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now. Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him? They have less power over you if you look into my eyes. How can I help you with the particles? Tell me what's wrong. This has nothing to do with Walter. Who's controlling your mind? I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave. I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building... Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything. How are we going to get me in there? Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence. So what do you want to do? And what if you can't live with it? And what about the ones you don't save? How many have you lost? I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy. It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope. Bullshit! Would it have happened to you? You're crazy. What the fuck is going on. He's got the girl. And doing a very good job of it. There's your answer. He's smart. Police corruption. It's everywhere. Is it always like this? How long you been coming here? You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick. We won. We won! COME ON, RUSSELL! COME ON RUSSELL!... Who the fuck's Russell?! They need to run first and second? The 6 horse is still last. To run last? The 6 horse is last. You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you. I'm just practicing my lying. I don't know why she'd pick him over you. Now she's going out with Greg Barnett? Fine. I do. I have two words for you... Seek help. You're a compulsive gambler? Why did he do it? A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine. My name's McCall. I'm unarmed. To save lives. Yes. You tell me. Thou shall have no other God before me. Yes. It's against my nature. I'm not good at lying. What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off? So what do I say to this guy? I can't do that. Tell me what you need. No. I think so. I think I can handle that one. Around. Barnett's tough competition. Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett. Do you really? We see each other every couple of months. No, no, no... She's from Hoboken. She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married. She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school. Yeah, I've got a girlfriend. I don't gamble. Why? You like my ass? Well, if I have to, I have to. I don't really like to drink. Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide. We could fill it with water. Is there something wrong with that? You caught me on an "up" day. How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco? It was okay. Been to Toronto. My mother was born there. Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while. Furthest point I could find from New York. National Marksman Competition. They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement. I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be. What's the point of this? I know. I've rarely shot anyone. Like it had to be done. Only at the very end. If you say so. Sorry... Habit. I'm ready to do it. And I'm going to be here more than two weeks. Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.It was Warriors plus 6 this morning. Good. I don't want to be late. You want me to go up with you? Fuck the stereo. What's that smell? Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out. It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett. You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization. Yeah, okay. "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar. Deal. You're my hero. We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone. He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence. You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there. What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week? They're not usually graduate students. Hello, guys. You got it. Manual or automatic? You want a convertible or hardtop? You're gettin' the car. The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie. Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals. It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you. I need to get something straight first. And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents. How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits. Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration? What do you got on Korda? Anything on Korda so far? I have to go face to face. We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor? What's the suspect's name? ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes... ...a car. Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post? I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it. Yeah. It's all there. Satisfied? I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me. What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off? Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage. You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay. Is that all? Yep. Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible. Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business. Stay put. McCall, you all right? Good question. That's a chance I gotta take. He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her. You've got to decide that for yourself. You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave. I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it. That it is. Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them. It might have happened no matter who was up there. Pull up alongside. I don't know, but I've got to get on there. Damnit! He's cutting down the visibility. See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty. Occasionally you lose. About six years. My partner took me. How much you wanna bet? We lost. The jockey! Yeah, first and second. He'll be running at the quarter pole. To run late! That's okay. That's his style. Still needs work. So what do you want?... An autograph. Ronnie... Yeah, so. We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second. I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks. I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta. See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out. What do you think? You know why I like the track? Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire. Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side... What did you see? Okay, stop. So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives? Why? Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right? What's the first commandment? You know the ten commandments? Get good at it. If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie. You could say something like, "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out." Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it. Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit. I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts. It'll come. Try again. First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you." Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that? You think you can learn, McCall? Yeah, you think so, but it comes up. Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage. Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage. Where did you hear that? No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it. That's a lot of commitment. I admire that. Every couple of months, huh? Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey? She grow up in Livingtston, too? Explain how that works. You living together? You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you? You got a girlfriend? You have to. It's a tradition. Come on. Let's go for a drink. Not the ones I'm at. How are we gonna get him out of there? I'm not sure. I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was. So you're looking for "fast advancement". You're a real excitable sort, aren't you? How did you like Toronto? You'd never been out of New York? You don't like New York? With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here? Recruited you from where? So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco? I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that. A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow. Try to remember that. SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know. It rarely has to be done. How do you feel after a shooting. You ever been in a hostage situation? We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin? Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende? You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator. Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that. Is the hostage injured? Have you evacuated anyone? Which apartment? Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version. My name's Scott Roper. Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count. I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work. Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job. Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything. Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her. Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why? Let me show you something, Ray. I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay. I know how you feel, Ray. First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way. The hell I am! You crazy? With all those people around? You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?' Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word. I'm talking about... What are you talking about? I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'. Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality. A deeper level? Yeah. Hmm? Hmm? Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit. Do it! Stay here, don't move. It's all over, babe, it's all over. Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie. Use your imagination. Korda escaped. How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy. ...Let me just show you. For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff... I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about. You like this place? He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend. When? What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him? Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again. It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world. Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up. What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here. Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar. What do you think? I've been craving that stuff all week. That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much? I was going to catch the last half on TV. As a matter of fact, I do. I wanted to get this out of the way. Ronnie... You think I didn't need you? Something I guess I can't have anymore. Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work. I've proved that, didn't I? It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him. I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone. That a new picture? Can I come in? You heard. I'm not drunk. Yet. Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy. Please. I'm begging you. This Greg is really getting in my way. Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease. Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters. Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair. Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name. I worship you. This baseball player you're going out with... He's no good for you. SHIT! Where's the damn wire?! Stay up there, Girl... I'm en route. E.T.A. in five. Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl... Come on! Are these yours? What have you promised them? Any verification on numbers. What do we got? Who's running it! Who's running it? I want to be put on this case. He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said... I want to be put on this case. And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background... Repoed this morning. The car is part of the deal. You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound. And a car. Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars. The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress... Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation? Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks. Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside? Your concern is heartwarming. Define concern. Depends. What's up? What? Tell him to give me a raise.Yeah, they are but... Just that I'd talk to my superiors. We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for. 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside. Kimura and Glass will head the investigation. Roper... You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it. I can't do that. The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man. I'll provide you with transportation. What happened to your Trans Am? Impound isn't a rent-a-car company. Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own. Okay, I think I could swing that. What do you think would be in order? What kind of appreciation are we talking about? You let us worry about that. His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed. It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you. What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it? There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up. Are you going to make this hard for me? Roper. He says, "Thank you very much." I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.Ha-ha! Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition! Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to... Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it? Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me? No it isn't! You're dead! Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit! AHHHHHHH! Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight? Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that. Hope I didn't hurt him too bad. Yeah. Apparently. It's all in the tongue. Another bottle? What a coincidence, I am someone! Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too. Oh God. Shit... Okay. Be careful. These tunnels must loop around and connect. Right. Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers. Whoa... What does it say? It's making me hungry. God. I can't believe it. Really. Didn't even have to ask. Where? No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal? Shake a paw? I couldn't do it. Not to you. What...? What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh? That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it! It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me. Fuck me... Yeah. French fries... What the fuck!? You too!? Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch. Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go. I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux. Shit. What have I done? Stall them! I'll meet you out back. Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be. I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this. I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit. A cure? You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit. What?! He told you? When? I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf. I don't... I... I can't remember... No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second... Hello? Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that. Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling? Serafine... This looks familiar... That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard. Wait, I know this... A votre sante. Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing... So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with? Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick! It's okay. I can see fine. What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour? My treat? Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you! I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower! Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists. Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look. I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium. The planet earth. It's good to be back. Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit. Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence... Serafine...? So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting. Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something... Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir. Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up. In an underground club? I'd like to see that. And who's Claude? Like an underground club? Medusa... What's this? some kind of club? Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day. Hey, Sorry if I was out of line. What? Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately? Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you? Sure. I can follow that. You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita. Yeah, that's the word. And you are? Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone - Shit! No... I... There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God... It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes! GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!! FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!! Looks like he lied to you too. Ha. Some wonder drug... You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself! Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away. Sure. Don't you? Hey, I'm new here, what do you want? So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out? Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up. Claude...? Bullshit! You're bluffing! You'll never get the chance. Or else what? You'll kill me? He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin... My uncle's in a coma you moron! Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this... What about me? But... I don't remember anything, I swear... This is... it's like a sick joke, I - Oh no... no.... Oh shit... No... What?! You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much? It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper. Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something... Because Gaston was after it. Uncle Terrence. Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people. Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM? What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News... Why the fuck would I do that? Not you too - Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him. Yeah? Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off? What? Psychic awareness. Right. Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous - I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew. Claude. Uncle Terrence, you're... Where is it! Please! The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?! I went to St. Severin church. Now look - Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM? Sort of... Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence - Uncle Terrence? Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower. And what about you? Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death. Shit. I feel sick. What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise... Alright. Let me write a letter. Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell! Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me! Not that I know. Why would he pick this one? Yeah. I guess so. Did he say anything? Before the coma? I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle? Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws. What do you mean, maniacs? Legume? You mean, a vegetable? Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die? Jesus... Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What? That's McDermott, but yeah.All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power! I told him it wasn't ready... That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death. Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation. Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it... It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to. I don't believe we've been introduced. "Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed." These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper. You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too. My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon. You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild. Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate. Andy... He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time. You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep? The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness. It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known. I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy. Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha. No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting. God, well don't let him go! Catch him! Serafine? Is that you? What's going on? Allo?Nothing's happening! Why isn't it doing anything!? Cure!? Ha-ha-ha! Another step and he's dead! Do you think I'm an idiot? What's the problem? If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions? The ADM. Let's go. And you call me a moron... What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance? Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies! No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend! Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM! Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else! Before the coma! Bullshit! Your uncle told you! Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it? In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul� d'Americain.Either way works for us... Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look... Merde! I can't believe this! Tell you what, we'll jump together. Also like sex with my wife. Just like sex with my wife. Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says... An eye for an eye... Merde! Just missed! Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you. Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture? Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre! Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's - Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing. But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go. Good man. Now can I have my arms back? No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you! What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh? I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I. Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help. I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious? Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness. Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land. Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new - Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas. Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know... No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume. How well did, er, do you know him? He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better. This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues... Andrew Mc-dair-mo? You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance? Saint Severin... Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo. Double merde. Merde. Okay. So maybe you were right. Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while? He says -I'll never let go! Anya... where are we? I'm glad you found what you were looking for. No! Well, yes, but Anya, wait! Don't be You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know. Nervous? It's okay. Didn't hurt.. Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry! Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost. Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you? Sad? It's not you - it's the dress! It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over. It's the best fork of all Every Russian family has one.. You are the Princess. You must enjoy causing me pain! Come on! Now just get off the train. Trying... to... breathe... Come on up! That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs ... stretch then that way. I was all out of dynamite! I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up! Do you always punch people first thing in the morning? You never thought of the possibility? Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris. We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. Why do you want to go to Paris? Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . . You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother? What happened to your parents? People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive. That makes her an orphan too Who are you?! That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy. Ouch! That really hurt! She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too! Watch me. What do you mean? But it's not the money, Vlad. It worked in Odessa... How is our current financial status? See? The Princess is under there ... Pray he's color-blind... Yes. And I hate that in a woman. You're a princess... "Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it. Hurry up with those papers. She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . . Look! It's her. What was that? We will. We have to. Come on, Vlad - she's out there. Run, Anya - go... You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the... What do you want?! Rasputin! And tell me that she's happy. Promise me she'll have her home. I should go Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry... No. Empress, you -- What I found your was your granddaughter! I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me! Please, if you'd just listen... I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave? Fortunately, I am to be married. With your highness, permission. Yes, your highness. Yes, your highness. I shant! Come out! I can do alterations. Did I tell you that? We're just going to refresh your memory... Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean. We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie. Is everyone all right? She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . . Good day! Providing travel papers is illeagal! I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you. Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . . Who did you hear it from? So where will you go? But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down! Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner. Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her. Are you feeling all right? We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich! The "Odessa Dunk"? If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic. Ah! Let us begin! What do we do now? Well, she certainly has a mind of her own. Royalty do not help people with their luggage. What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness". Wake up, young lady, that's our train. Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster? Ew. . . the honest type. He's her? That was your dinner! I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris! It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl! Perhaps you could convince her? Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana? Are you impressed with our Anastasia? May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!I'm sorry that I'm not taking you. Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon. No, I promise... not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me. Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him. Hey, hey... Haaa... bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago... the hand will come back... they're sure... Won't worry about it. You go ahead. If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know. Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive? Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him? It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone. Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon. Hey -- you called me... I... What? It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note. She's nice. Do it. Sure -- take him to the vet. No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow. Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust... How's Verdell doing? You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow. Thanks for looking after him. You're taking him... yes... you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try... because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no." Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him. I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer. Have a nice day. Party! You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me. Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch. Simon, you've got to get dressed.I'm gonna grab you. I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you. Just let me talk. I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence... ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good... Hey, I've got a great compliment for you. I'm feeling... I've been feeling better. If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls. It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk. Maybe we could live without the wise cracks. Boyfriend? It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine. I had to see you... What a break... Were you asleep? ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try. 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy. Were you asleep? So long. I should've danced with you. Okay to say something now? Cute. The two might go together. That seems like a good choice. How you doing? Hello. I'll take you... why not? Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home. This one has a special meaning. What do you mean? You said you liked it. Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there. Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home. Sorry, didn't realize she was right there. Did you have sex with her? It was a mistake. I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake. It's one idea... There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might... Well, ah... that's a personal question. You don't owe me that. Never. Takes months to know... They work little by little. Talking like this is exhausting. Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out. Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills. One baked -- one fries. Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries? Can we order first? Okay. That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails. No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me. No... ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it. I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before. No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either. Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out. Dancing? Yes... sure. I'll take the sofa. That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good. ... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano. You like sad stories -- you want mine. Nonsense! Welcome. I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything. I was going to do that for you. Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag. Whether crabs are in season there now... Oh. We might. Yes. We can. Let's. Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next. That you might ask -- I'm not certain. Are you still coming? Is there another way to see it? Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go. What's that got to do with it? Bettes tells me he's doing fine. You take off when you have to. Two days. I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook. I want you to go on this trip. Now I want you to do something for me. Nice of you... thank you. Lovely. No... no thank you notes. Hey, what I did for you is working out? Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore. He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore. What's this? So you'll be at work? Okay!!!! Anything else?!? What needs clearing up? You waiting for me to say something? What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow. To get you back at work so you can wait on me. Note. Put it in the note. I was working... can't you just drop me a thank-you note? Carol the waitress? Yeah, yeah... any chance you'll get back to work today? How ya doing? I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!! What about your mother? Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter. I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject. This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying... I'm hungry. You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten. Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke... What's with the dark? Otherwise, you're not ugly. If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty. How old are you? It's okay -- I'll sit here. Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake. Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around. Okay. His name? No. What's wrong with your son, anyway? I see the help -- judgement call. Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend... now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe. We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will. The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee. I've got Jews at my table. I'm starving. Hey, elephant girl, call her or something... just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait. Do it!!! What are you trying to do to me? No. No. Get Carol. Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time... I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here? You changed the room around... You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease? Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in. Help! Last word freak. Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much. Like the wind but I'm not doing it. Think white and get serious. Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good. Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here. About a dog. "What?" Look at you... You sense a mark. Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.' I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days. It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off. Okay by me. It's been five weeks... another few won't kill me. He's a pain in the ass. Hey, where are you going? You can't do this. I can't take a dog. Nobody's ever been in here before. I'm not saying nothing to you. Police! Police! Fucking crooked police... doughnut-munching morons help me! Assault and battery and you're black. No touch. No touch. No touch. Hope you find him. I love that dog. What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now? No, it's all right. I'll just watch. Wait here. What? Hi. You have hard shells, right? Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here. Sure thing. Absolutely. Is he dead yet? Ask him. Just move on. No one here killed him. How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole. I forgot to lock the door. Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go. Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late. Absolutely not. Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble. It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water. I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out. Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life. No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp. I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"... ... and she doesn't want contact with me. I'm dying here. You going to come talk to me or not? Look, we both want the dog -- and... They did a nice job... Cozy, huh? I think you gotta camp it here... I told you to go on in. Does it matter? Good-bye. Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now. What are you talking about? You got real problems. ... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and... I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run... I give you that one... Nice packing. Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not... Do you ever get an erection for a woman? Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money. This stuff is pointless. Never a break. Never. Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up. Yeah... I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back... But the tiredness -- boy... Not just sleepy. I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here? I brought you Chinese soup. Stupid dog. I don't get it. Yo, yo, yo... Now we'll both call him. I carry bacon in my pocket. Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me... it's not affection. It's a trick. Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up. No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time. Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression. Where are all your queer party friends? That cleaning woman doesn't... It smells like shit in here? Maybe I'll bring him some food by. I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing. That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like... Okay, then. Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone... don't knock ... not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart? Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden? Do you realize that I work at him? Well, that's a load off. Yeeeess!!! 'Love was... ' How're you doing? Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food... I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall. What's he look like? I think of a man and take away reason and accountability. Oh God, this is like a nightmare. What's it mean?I love you... Let him take you home. You think you're kidding. I'll take care of myself -- I just love her. How're you doing? That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls... But you're beautiful... your skin glows. I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks. I've got to sketch you. Good night. How to die, mostly. Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts. Uh-huh... No!!! Can you not be violent? Was this supposed to be your room? No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along. Well... Do you want to know what happened with my parents? I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her. So am I, Frank. You are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea... How could you do that? He'll hurt him. So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell? Jackie, will you hand me the mirror? He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he? I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?... Just tell me. Well, I can't reach them. Terrify me? Sorry. What are those cards? No. Please, don't force him. I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction. What's wrong? Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard. You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down. But you know where you're lucky? Picking on me won't help. Did you like it that much? Okay... you tell me why -- "You're dying here." Because... ... you love her? What did she say? I'm coming. Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then... I love you. Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me. What are you talking about? Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause... Another place where? I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted. I'm going back with you. ... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye. You consider your life easy. Melvin... Not it at all, really. Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it. That's very thoughtful. I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died. But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain. Got any easier questions? Thanks. Would you leave now, please? Come on, sweetheart... Oh, my gosh. Get out. Rot in hell, Melvin. Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you? Get out. Please, just leave. Go away. If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well. Thank you for walking him. Verdell? Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart? By the way, thanks for saving me. Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall? Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making. No... actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d... No, I didn't. Did you... do something to him? I found Verdell, Mr. Udall. Maybe this can wait. Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please. Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that. Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall. Which color was that? My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like? Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! Have you seen Verdell? Why are you doing this? Just a second -- he has to go. Yes... well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good. No... Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching... an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity. Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it. Exactly what is your previous experience?I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down. I have a tale to tell. And not a happy one. Here, let me do that. Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch. I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard. shhh... Everything's gonna be fine. Yes. Great. Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company. Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along. Ah, well .... CUT TO: I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake. Sort of half..... Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will kill you. Hi, I know you are. Very serious ... most of the time these days. Okay. It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ... It's okay. There's no one out here. Just open the door. Trust me. Ali? What's wrong? 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know. One. I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator. Jesus. I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it. Stupid thing. I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ... Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ... Tom Jones? That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea." Yes. Yes. Sometime. Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here. I said I'd check with you. Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff. And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while. Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England... Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it .... Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later. Uh ... yes ... Goodnight Annie. Thanks, Annie. Right first time. No, Annie, no. This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us. Annie, it's me. It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito. Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints .... What happened?!!! Oh Jesus. Oh God. Oh Jesus God. Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth. What? What? Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone? Better go. Grierson hates people being late. Ah, Mr Bean ... Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ... Great - keep him out of trouble. Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to. Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this. I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that. 'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right? Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy. Isn't it? Yes, isn't he. She's ... well, she's good. Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great. Yes. I'11 mention it to him. But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know? It's very good Bernie. So, why not haul your ... nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case. We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now. Say that again, son. And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up. Maybe two cars. And a car. VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ... I'm fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen? Certainly is. Quite right, sir. Ahm.... Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Congratulations. Marvellous thing. Bravo. ... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now. Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Bean? The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift. No! You're not going to .... Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited. Ah... He certainly has something, sir. Yes, this is Doctor Bean. No. Perfect. Looking forward to it. CUT TO: on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due? Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ... Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin. Jen? Sure. You're right. Jen - you don't wanna talk about it? Honey, calm down now... it's okay... Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside. No-one's asking you to go to bed with him. Sean Connery. Richard Burton was very good-looking. What makes you say that? They're pretty. Learn it in the army? You arrange those flowers yourself? You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David? As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section. Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right? Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh? I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you. How the hell should I know? She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse. Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps! Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable. Well, there is that ... He was incredible. This guy is fearless. He has no fear. Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly. Great, good.Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset? Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius. He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century. Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself. This is Elmer, our longest serving... Right. Got it. What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. . Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team. David? So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel. Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less. A car sounds sensible. Mmmmm... Of course. I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that you do not. Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse. David, David, David ... Well, congratulations. Isn't that great, David? Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we? Don't want anything to go wrong. I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s. Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the news. I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you? No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother. Thank you David. However, flattery will get you nowhere. Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama. Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ... Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh? Er ... pray tell me why? Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning? Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you? Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player. Ah, David. Finally. And this must be our professor from across the sea. Tomorrow. You have a problem with that? I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ... I am sorry you feel that way. Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ... Why thank you sir. Not at all, Governor. Very striking. what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch. You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens. We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it. I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it. Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go. Oh yeah?. Have you seen any? Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house? Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on? No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry. Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed. Yeah. How's Dad? I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have. Oh my God. Is her son OK? Does Dorothy know her husband is dead? Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment. Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!! Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom. Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!! Yes sir. Only you. and the photo lab. No. not at all. I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and. . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this. Yeah. Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you. What color is it? What is this? What color is it? Yeah. I get it. Why do you do it? I guess you've seen some bad things. Is that why you say it's horrible? Anything you can tell me? These are beautiful. How's the case coming? Yes? It must be great. I understand. I'm just real curious like you said. Excuse me, Mrs. Williams. Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did. Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store? Are you Detective Williams? I promise, Dorothy. I promise. Don?. Where is he? Who, Dorothy? Shh. I'll tell you. It's okay. it's okay. Yeah, it's me. Oh no. You look beautiful to me. What? I'll call you. I think I better go. I guess I should go. No. not really. but also because I really want you to be alright. Yes. You called me Jeffrey. Dorothy. no! I'm glad you do. There's no disease, I can tell you. You. what? I didn't mean to hurt you. No. it's not Don. Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! Sometimes I think I do. Do you love me? Look, snap out of it, will ya? Come on Dorothy. Shut up. Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone. That wouldn't be too good, would it? Yes. No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you. . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police. What do you want? Whatiya mean? I'm doing it. Sure I do. That's good. I sure don't hate you. Frank is coming? I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy. Hello. No. I should go. Yes. I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.? No. But you're in very big trouble. Who is Don? No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble? No. Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble? There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it. Nice guy. Who's he? Frank? .can you stand up? . same here. That's not crazy. I like you too. . I. uh. Hi. can I come in? O.K. Don't say that. Then don't talk about killing. Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. No. What is happening? No. Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!! What was it? What? Yes, I like you. No. please. I won't. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's okay. It's okay. No. I'll go then. Nothing. Are you alright? No. Yes. I . I don't know. Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave. No. Come on. Never before this. Then you got undressed. Well. You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more. . I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed. I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. Nobody. I wanted to see you. Jeffrey nothing. Jeffrey. That oughta do it. Nope. it's new stuff. no smell. Pest control. gotta do your apartment. Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there? Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me? He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue. Yes. Nothing. What? Here's to Ben. Heineken. On a ride. I don't want to go. No thanks. Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here. Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me. Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now. ... Sandy?. I should go with her, Sandy. OK. Let's get her over to your father's. No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house? Yes. Dorothy! ... Dorothy! Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you. My father has a gun at home. Frank!! You want to dance? Let's wait for some slow one. Really. you want to dance with someone else? I can't dance fast. I like that idea. that's a real good idea. ... You look beautiful. I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime. Where to? Nothing. really! It's good to see you. Just some fatherly advice. Okay. Okay. great! No. Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on? Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble. You worry about me really? Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much. I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret. Yeah. Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove? That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today? You want to go talk to him? I'm really sorry. See ya tomorrow. Okay. okay. Can I give you a kiss good night? Okay, Sandy. I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay? I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera. Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl. Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.? That's what I thought. That doesn't bother you, does it? Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know. Yes. . Actually. I've been in twice. I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble. . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man. No way. I'm about to blow up. I'm sorry, I didn't. What's with Mike? Well. Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean? Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved. That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay? Okay. thanks. Are you sure? Yeah. Look. it can wait till Sunday. Oh, okay. can I call? I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went. Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit. Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay? It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car? Why not? Here's to. an interesting experience. Two. I'd like an ice-cold Heineken. Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there. First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment. Okay. You better get out before someone sees us. Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good? First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings. I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder. Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that. You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight? Pretty clever. Are you game for more? Yeah. I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh? Yes and no. Did you recognize him? Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened? Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner. Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name? Let's go. Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright? Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think? Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window. Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later. Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan? There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe. I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon. I don't want to cause any trouble. I'd like to talk to you about something. You hungry or thirsty, or both? Yeah. Good bye. Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you. I don't know. he moved away. It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father. I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world. I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice. You really do hear a lot, don't you? Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything? Did they find out anything when they questioned her? Where are they? I guess you have to get back home soon? It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in? The ear is from a missing person maybe? Were all these people questioned this afternoon? Do you know who was brought in for questioning? Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything? What do you know about the ear?. anything? I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital. What else is new?. right? How is Central these days? No. You're not bothering me. You a senior? Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something. Oh yeah? Yeah, how did you know? Good deal Dad. How ya doin' Dad? It's good to see you, Dad. Are you feeling okay? Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good. Hi Dad. Nothing. I'm fine. God. you scared me. Can I use the car tonight? No, I'm just gonna walk around. I'm going out for awhile. Thanks a lot, Mom. What? Yeah? Well. Okay. What time are visiting hours? Be right down. This is it. For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term. Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed. Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much. No. you're right. Well. No. Sandy? ...Sandy, please. Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes? That sounds great! Say "goodnight" to Sandy. Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake. Yeah. Yeah. okay. No. No thank you. Yeah, I know. Alright. I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go. Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better. Good to see you, son. uh uh. uh uh. Hey Jeff.Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you. He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby. Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs. He's comin' back?. What for? Bull. Frank gone?Look, I'm sorry -- I was only going one way. The guy came right at us! I, uh, I have some problems. I never told her. I love her so bad. She just... wrecks me. I would die for her. Aren't you listening, man? Love gives you wings. Geronimo. When you're really in love, you'll jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down. Love gives you wings. It makes you fly. I don't even call it love. I call it Geronimo. I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar. I saw you kiss. Admit it, this is the street where love lives. That's love. The sound of love. Flip. You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here. Tell me something. You think I'm crazy? Flip was a hero in Vietnam. Sorry, Flip. Got sidetracked. I gotta go, Flip. Thanks. You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis. Mississippi? Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st. Now she tells me. Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin. They changed Franklin's portrait. Top pocket... Go on. I can't promise you anything. It's up. Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here. Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me. Now . Get in. I'll pull you up to the fourth floor. I spent two years here. This used to bring the med-cart. Demerol. Phenobarb. It's Jacob's Ladder. Liza? Blue moon... Without a song in my heart. Blue moon... Blue moon... Blue moon... It's okay. You... You thought I was bad. They'll trace it. You do? Your father, he was dying. He was worried about you. He took your picture out to look at it. He called you his baby. Because he believed me. Walters was their fall guy. Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear. Don't you see? Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison. He was looking into getting him out. He didn't believe the official story. He kept it in the side table in the front hallway. He showed me. I visited a few times. Then one of Jonas's guys visited. When I arrived, your dad was dying. To Jonas. I didn't know that at the time. Didn't know who he was. But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else. So I started watching your father. I wanted to keep him safe. I don't know what it was. All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it. If that's love, it's not so bad. I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back. Can't give you the details because I can't remember. I went to court to kill him. At the Ezekiel Walters hearing. I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference. You were there. That's the first time I saw you. Yeah. I know what it's like. No...! But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA. EX-CATCHER. America works. Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works. That's the last time you rode, isn't it? Do you think it was your fault? Is that why? Where were you the day he died? He gave it to me. Is that what they told you? Liza? How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox? Just because they say so? We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it. Come on. Reagan didn't die. If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was. How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three. John Wilkes Booth. Mark David Chapman. Lee Harvey Oswald. Connecticut. After you. It's okay. I'm the one who left it here. This way. Not today. There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over. It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you. But first things first. Are you okay? I wish I hadn't told you what I did. But I can't help the way I feel. You don't hold that against me, do you? You look great. I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it? I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that. It's Geronimo. Love. It lets you see things. It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you. Yesterday you were wondering about the wall. How it was possible. You're wrong. Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore. Yeah... Would you, I mean, could you love me then? If I was normal. Maybe? What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore? If I was normal. Oh, Christ, here it comes. Look, I know you think I'm crazy. I don't think I am, but... I know that. I'm just -- I'm nervous. I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics. And I know how I feel. I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day. To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way. Everything you do is magic. I don't know what to say. I love you. You will? They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot? Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool. Call the coroner in Rhode Island! Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated! Do you watch the news? Read the paper. Last week, this whole place was underwater. I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details. Right here. In the 7th Street subway station. Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there. Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport. Right here in Manhattan. His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered. Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard of him? So now they feed us terrorists. To create fear . How much do you think an airport security system goes for? Then multiply it by every airport in the country. There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials. But they're all part of two warring factions. One: families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing. Stability. Group Two: the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex. They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business. When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one. Henry Finch. That they monitor everything. That it was only a matter of time. And now four people are dead. Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse. I should have realized. Jesus... It's my fault. They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on. I'm passing it to you, too. You haven't been bothering them, have you? I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I log on at the library so I can't be traced. Never mind. You'd think I was making it up. Did you see the van back there? Johnny Dancer, right? You don't ride him anymore, do you? Not since your dad died. You run with your back to the picture. Like you were trying to get away. Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself. He's why you punish yourself. How'd he die? Is he dead? Is this your dad? So what's the question? I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context. Know what I mean? Shoot. You gave me an hour; now give me a day. Just a guy trying to put out a fire. Never, but I've been practicing. Uh huh. Getting rid of my hub! I've never read it. I just -- Every time I see one I buy it. I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part? Never heard of him. Who? Just five. It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem? Pretty scary, huh? Absolutely not. A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy. If you can figure it out, they screwed it up. Stone is their spokesman. You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it? Stone's a disinformation flunky. The face that he's alive says it all. Here it is. Conspiracy Theory It just went out Tuesday. Third issue this year. I bet I struck a nerve. Pissed someone off. I've been reading up on it. If my universe had a hub... You want something to drink? The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. Spies . Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating. Just like James Bond. You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour? Flesh wound. No big deal. You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me. So I'm a little jumpy. Who wouldn't be? I'm not sure. I think I figured something out. It must've been in my newsletter. I have no idea. Well that's the eye right there. Money . And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world. The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off. And look here. Cease fire in Chechenia. That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons. Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado. Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive. They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind eye to the future.' More about life on Mars. From a rock they found on the South Pole. Explain that one to me. But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost? Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye. Hmm... Ahh... Ooooo... Yeah. I think so. Six months. Eleven days. Nothing is easy. I noticed. Yes. People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it? Crown Victoria. F.B.I. car. A legitimate tail. Flat, wraparound headlights? Change lanes. Then watch your rearview. Uh uh, don't want them to see me. If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle. Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone, What took so long? You were in there all day. Figure of speech. Could we go? Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here. Arf... You gotta help me. You saved my life. I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch. And thanks. Really? You switched the charts; you tell me. It's okay. The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store. He had it coming. Sure. You switched the charts, didn't you? Love. Hey... I can't control it. It's just, something that happened. Switch 'em. Or I'll be dead by morning. Don't want to be dead. Switch the charts. What's the charge? You're the boss. Just don't make me repeat myself. I hate that. It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches! You've got to listen to me. Yes! Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself! I bit the bastard's nose off. Was waiting till I knew you better. Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse. What was your horse's name? I better get going. You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy against yourself . I can't lie to me, Liza. And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on? You want to go out sometime? You think I'm crazy. You going to warn him? Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of. He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry. We're talking billions. Motive enough? The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle yesterday. So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit? Do you still ride? Not testing. Using . Nukes are passe. This is the weapon of the future. Come on! Six major earthquakes in the last three years? The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them? Then I can't be hurt anymore. You've never seen her run. Liza ! What's that? Could you be a little more specific? That's great. Good for you. Do I know you? Whatever. Then screw you. I'll rot. That's not what I mean. I want to see her. I'll do it. On one condition. I want to make sure she's okay. I'm leaning toward no. I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow. But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you. Does that seem honorable? You're here because you figured I might show up. You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel. I like that. A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay. May have a headache for a few days. Are you here with honorable intentions? Thank you.Liza Sutton is dead. You shouldn't watch, Jerry. It's a moment without hope. We've arranged for you to take the blame. Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl. Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own. Surely it must be coming back to you by now? Who have you been talking to, Jerry? Who else knows what you know? I'm a very patient man. Yes you do, Jerry. Quite well. I want this box rigged with a beacon! In Jerry's safety deposit box. Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder. I know the story. A federal judge. He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial. You do recognize it then? So you'll believe what I tell you next. Because I need to find Jerry. And I don't think I can do that without you. Belief is immaterial. What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry. I'm very much responsible for him. Jerry is dangerous. Jerry has killed -- Yes, that's right. My dog . One I intend to put to sleep. Extrapolate from there. And what did I say? It was. It was. Me? I was a minor missionary, a heretic really. But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs? Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance. As in 'resulting in death.' We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore. We experimented with hallucinogens. We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state. We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation. I am impressed. We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card. M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed. EX CATCHER. A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal. Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program. Are you familiar with it? What I'm about to tell you is partially documented. The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't. For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself. Please, sit. If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed. How's Jerry feeling this morning? Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing. We're very specialized. Only on the football field. The truth shall make you free. Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them? Why him? A charming term. Now, why him ? Why you ? Here's a fresh one. Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me. And you have no idea where he lives? So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President? It was my dog. Let me ask you a question. How long have you been acquainted with Jerry? You were going to ask about my nose. The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today. A dog bit it.Alright. You can see her. But she can't see you. I don't know... We got someone watching her 24 hours a day. She -- That's your option. Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time. In case you didn't know it, you're crazy. You made your decision yet? Well, I don't know if -- It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions? Are they honorable? That's ironic. Because we're here to protect her from you. I'm not sure what you mean. You're welcome. Where's my partner? That you come with me. Don't go home. And don't go to work. Either one could be bad. No idea. Honest. What are you going to do? Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone. He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas. I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile. What gave me away? You think we have time to fool around like this? Come on. What do you mean? Yeah, I do. Go ahead. We'll be right down. Your call. Have a good night. It's his show for now. Look, you want to get some dinner? Inter- Agency cooperation and all? Wasn't my idea. You're welcome! Spooks. So, you want to compare notes on this guy. That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan. Which way did he go? Guy's a C.I.A. shrink. Here to I.D. Fletcher. They knew each other somehow. While we walk. D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies. No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for. We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up. This guy Fletcher's something else.-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at. It's a hoax. I knew it! Hope there's a cartoon. Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations. If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements. Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor. So? Tell me. Still settling in, really. Where's Dr. Arroway? Now I remember why I went into theoretical work. Kent. For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you. Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you. Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race. That I would have told the President straight out: Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together. That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this. And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have. But that's not who I am. I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given... You do what you have to do. And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power. And it isn't fair... Right. Well. You aren't staying? They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications. ... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air... Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting. As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation. Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor. I don't understand. Actually I'm running late -- Ellie. You were right, Ellie. You were right all along. We've cracked it. Lunacharsky found it. Interesting analogy. And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa? It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly. Play ball. Really. It's good advice. I want you to listen to me, carefully. The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point. Ellie -- Apparently he's genuinely interested in science. This could be a chance to win him over. The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you. ... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders... Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation. You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already... If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it. Just one thing: Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why? It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now. Then why haven't you detected any signals? If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through? It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then. No... You're not. But the price has just gotten too high. The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession. Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines. It's not like you've given me much choice. Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt -- You know why I'm here. Ellie... Now exactly. It's... complicated. I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year. Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director. Peter sends his regards. No, thanks. I disagree. Two: There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time. And only two probabilities: One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime -- I'm not. You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense -- I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.Can't. Doctor's orders. The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive. It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G? As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time. You see my problem: I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it. So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract. Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries -- Mmm. Look closer. Hokkaido Island. Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV? Come; I want to show you something. I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us. Oh, not quite yet. At least for their sake... ... I hope it's not. Because they're running out of time. Yes. A shame. Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing. Japanese squid fleet. They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi. Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her. And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out. That's Paris, where my daughter was born. Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking. So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang. As if it never happened. If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed. A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes. That's my girl. Done. In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game. Do we have a deal? That would seem to be the question of the hour. I want to build it, Doctor. Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside. Very good, Doctor. I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something. -- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission. Heaven is the mustard seed. Not if you think like a Vegan. Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each... That's my girl... Lights. I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway. There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much. Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat. I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it? The 'primer' that will make decryption possible... I've found it. The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium. Perhaps you've noticed. Perhaps I could help deal you back in. The infamous, unfashionable bluntness. You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal. I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile. Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children... I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth. Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer. Please, sit, Doctor. I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home. Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha? That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot. At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...Meaning... Does that mean you think it doesn't exist? In other words. Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said: ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology. Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you. Please. For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth. Tell them it really happened. Have you seen what's happening out there? The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie. People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them! Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you! The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it! Ellie, you're the proof. You tell them your story. Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you. It also makes God enormous. I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away. As it will everyone else's. I do. I'm not sure it's come to that. It was quite a page turner. Hi. Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone. Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor? Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose? And then what? Then you'll be safe? I'm in love with you, Ellie. What are my other options? In fifty years? Never? What are you so afraid of? What? Ellie, what is it? What is it? What...? Maybe that's okay. You're trembling. During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there. I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so... Oh. I brought you something. So. The final countdown. Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things... What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy. A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social. The weak. The sick. The unwanted. And ever since we've been doing great.' An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don't like the answer? Ellie -- What are you so afraid of, Ellie? And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ? Do you really believe your life is meaningless? I don't follow. I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie. I'm not 'out to get' technology. I only ask the question: Does it have to have all the answers? I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science. I won't deny I was ambitious. When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible. I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises. You didn't answer my question. What'd you think? Really. You're willing to die for this. And everybody you care about would be dead and buried. If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth. Relativity. Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back -- In other words, God is one hell of an engineer. Why? Maybe you're creating a monster. Some of my best friends are scientists. They're saying the machine is alive. Some of my best friends are scientists. Prove it. Did you love him? Do you love your parents? Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent. But this experience went beyond both. For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with. I had... an experience. Of belonging. Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone. ... It's an old story. I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets. By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time. By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that. One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking. Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked. I ended up collapsing in a wheat field. There was a storm... I woke up... And that's about as far as words'll go. Now you know. Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt. So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch. And you believe this law with all your heart and soul. Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller. 'My father's house has many mansions.' How do you mean? Spoken like a true believer. And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you? ... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years. You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics. It must have taken tremendous faith. Make that two. I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet. For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive. I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position. Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.What? Pull the plug. Get her out of there. Ellie? Anything happening in there, El? What? That's one way of putting it. Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe. Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you -- What day? It's all right, the important thing is you're safe -- Thank God. When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay. We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction. Did you notice anything at all that -- Ellie -- are you okay? Like it or not. It's really happening. It's good to see you, Ellie. Ellie. That is true. But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company. Be honest, El. There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe. And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry. Ellie -- I'm getting married. Her name's Laura. She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left. Ellie -- Jesus -- Maybe that's the problem. I want... a family, Ellie. I want kids. A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid. A real life. Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want. 'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work? Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes -- This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots -- I'm going on staff at the N.S.F. To work for Drumlin. -- I'm moving to Washington. Actually -- Thirty-one linked dishes. You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here. What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico? How close are you to getting this funding put together? Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this? I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing. You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all. And? Any luck on the grant money? 'Any sufficiently advanced technology...' They can't. I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe. Keep it down, okay? Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is. Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes. Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence. Yavol. Peter Valerian. That's what they all say. It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely. Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which: How're you getting on with the old man?Childhood is over, Ellie. It's time to grow up. It's time to go home now. Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years... No more stalling, Captain. That isn't the way it works. Eventually you'll get here on your own. This was just the first step; in time you'll take another. If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse. Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible. A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet. No offense. Now... you go home. You always have been. We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie. All made of the same primordial atoms. Am I one... or many? ... life is unspeakably rare. So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message. Sometimes we can offer help. Sometimes we can't. But we always try. Life is simply too precious not to. You have your mother's hands... There are no tests, Ellie. We don't sit in judgment. Think of us more as... librarians. Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation... Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams. Some never make it this far. We don't know. Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here. Oh, we didn't build it. The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers. Many others. You contacted us. We were simply listening. We've been listening for millions of years. Small moves, Captain, small moves. Originally just another species like yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but... We thought this might make things a little easier. Am I artifact or dream? You might ask that about anything. That's my scientist. I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart. Time to sleep now, Captain. But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay? That's a beauty, Captain. Now get some sleep. Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling. Big enough radio, I don't see why not. On that old shortwave? Maybe on a clear night. Come on now, under the covers. Just be yourself, Captain. Find out where he is. Talk to him. Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding. Small moves, Captain, small moves.No. Now. You fucked him. So tell me about it. You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley? How'd you get to know so much about him? I want to know about Exley. Did you talk to Exley? That simple, huh? I used to. What I do now is strong-arm. Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it. If I could work Homicide like a real detective... Yeah. But not for long. When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother. I guess I got in the way. It's Bud. Forget I asked. It was a mistake. I don't know. Look. I want to see you again. He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake? You look better than Veronica Lake. Now, Pierce Patchett . Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today. I'm not sure. When they deserve it. Yeah. You fuck for money. Maybe I'm just fucking curious. Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears. You want some advice, Miss Bracken? Tell me about Patchett. How'd she meet Patchett? Did Lefferts have a boyfriend? Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl? Yeah I know. Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side. He doesn't want any attention. You use words like that, you might make me mad. Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland? Are you sorry she's dead? Yeah, plain scotch. Somebody hit you? That obvious, huh? Merry Christmas. Sure, boss. Sure you can. You lost me, Dudley. I don't know what you're talking about. What work? Give me one minute. How'd you get them to retract? Of course... But how? Homicide? A detective? How? I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me? Doing what? Mowing your fucking lawn? What do you want ? Him and me both. Fucking Exley . He helped me out once. That's all. What's going to happen to Stensland? He'll give himself cirrhosis over this. He's one year from his pension . Yeah, I hate them. Dudley, what do you want? Captain, what do you want? Does that paper say we've been indicted? Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off? This business, Captain? What are you talking about? What? That new mystery girl you've been seeing? Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory. Want to grab a beer? I got to write my report first. You know him? Yeah. A great big one. Easy. Tell me about the ruckus. What's through here? You said a neighbor heard a ruckus. Was it outside, inside? Look at a picture for me. Stens? Was it Stens? What was that boyfriend's name? Ma'am, I'm sure she was. Tell me about the boyfriend she had. The one you mentioned at the morgue. Five minutes. That's all. Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D. I'd like to ask a couple of questions. I spent years trying not to live down to mine. A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end. You wanted to meet here? They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers. What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room? Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two. If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow. They just won't come on the bus, that's all. What about him? Lynn . At least not anymore. He had help getting up there. Two of his fingers are broken. Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle. Which one are you and which one am I? There are no rules! Why the fuck are you doing this? The Nite Owl made you. You want to tear all that down. For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart. A detective. But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice. Let's just kill them. It all keeps coming back to Dudley. Dudley's guys. Dudley. Somebody got wind of it, killed them all. Then something goes wrong. Meeks gets killed. Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. The night he died, Stens was all mysterious. Said he had something big going down. Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot. I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other. Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve. The night I met Lynn. Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them. Lynn. It'll look like justice. That's what that fat fuck got. Justice . Get the fuck away from me. One in six. Where's the girl? What happened? Yeah, that's Stens. Where are we going? I got her address. That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ. What little studio? You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? Why were Lefferts' eyes black? That's right. No. I don't have one. Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it. How come? Thanks, but no thanks. Where's the other guy? Buzz. Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating. We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve. This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go. Officer White. How about Susan Lefferts? You know her? Richard Stensland. I'm a homicide detective. Where were you last night? Are you Pierce Patchett? I'm not asking you. He's under a tract house in San Berdoo. And he don't smell too good. What happened to the heroin, Johnny? Bullshit. Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin? How 'bout I give you your balls back? More. His file listed you as a known associate. Now spill. You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks? He works for a guy named Patchett. I ain't your paesano , you wop cocksucker. And you fuck people up for a living. That don't make me you. Capisce , shitbird? It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in... It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic. Ear plugs . But she's moving away from the door. Who was sitting at this table? If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way. What are these smears in the blood? Whose shoe? Anything off. Anything that didn't make sense. I'm tying up loose ends. Padding my report. You know how it goes. I got a few Nite Owl questions.You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine. We'll hold a clarification session soon. For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you? Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated. But don't stop there. Extrapolate. Imagine the police in control. It's big, lad. I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation. That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely. Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell. You're not your old, cruel self anymore. I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp. You've got it, Wendell. How what, Wendell? Will you work for me? I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for. You'll be working out of Homicide. Four of the defendants recanted their testimony. They're yours. Take them. Wendell, I want you to come to work for me. Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself. But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders. He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing. It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him. Why the loyalty, Wendell? And for good reason judging from what I know of your background. Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner. I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters. Do you hate them, Wendell? Call me Dudley. He made his play amd he got what he wanted. They're making him a detective. Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables. Lad, may I have a word with you? And? Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships. And? Alright. We'll drop that line for now. Next topic. Please comment on Pierce Patchett. But you were business associates? It's for your own safety. Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes? This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell. Really ? Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis? Why not, lad? Absolute justice? Absolutely. Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds. Anesthetize them. As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care. It's still a crime free city... for respectable people. A vacuum, Edmund. That's what we have in Los Angeles. Sending Mickey Cohen up created it. My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides. Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin. Through his whore girl friend. I sent him to make the buy. The rest is history. I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund. Anonymous. Probably nothing. There always are. But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically. A few loose ends don't matter. Don't get sidetracked. Stay with the Nite Owl. Ed, I want confessions. Get on it. Why? It's mine. I'll make you my second in command. Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it. You should stay away from a man when his blood is up. So be it. You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department? No, Edmund. He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time. Stensland's a disgrace. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. But White is a valuable officer. At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them. Then for God's sake, don't be a detective. Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices. Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau. Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance -- Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty? Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...? Yes or no, Edmund. Answer yes or no. Am I...? Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment? You'll make lieutenant inside a year. Patrol division? That was his favorite toast. I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam. You placed first out of twenty-three. Not even with Exley? Have you discussed this with anyone else, John? Don't start trying to do the right thing, John. You haven't had enough practice. You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund? What's this all about, lad? A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him? Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara. John Vincennes. It's three A.M., lad. I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of. John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath. Don't start now.You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father. You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway? Me? You called it. I got a message that... We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn. Bud... Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this. Ellis Loew. Patchett's dead. He sent you after me. I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends. We had one thing figured wrong. I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett. It's a suicide note. Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running. You expecting problems? Let's go see Pierce Patchett. Run a good-cop-bad-cop. With a wrecking ball. You want to help me swing it? Stay smart, Bud. We build a case. We play by the rules. What? Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett. It's Dudley for the Nite Owl. They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them. The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle. It wasn't the Negroes. The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl? The Nite Owl! Stensland was going there to sell the heroin. Stensland and Buzz Meeks . Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants. When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus. Stensland and Meeks. What were they up to? She told you? Why? You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard. How's it going to look on your report? A naked guy with a gun? You expect anyone to believe that? Officer White, put down that weapon and -- Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people. Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence. It's a surprise. You like surprises, don't you, White? Jack Vincennes. He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir. He lives for it. That's the way to get him. I know that, sir. I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective. I'll testify, sir. I'm not afraid to do what's right. The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen. Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured. Force them to retire. But someone has to swing. Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White. Secure them jail time. Feed them to the sharks, sir. Protect yourself; protect the department. Just show me where they are! Where are the police academy files? So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43. Anything? Until he gunned down six people. Clean? Where do they get their stuff? Come on. Give me one to feed the D.A. Just a little one. Were you on hop? You were passed out when you got arrested. Were you hopped up, Ray? You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes. You were seen burning them. Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good. Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator? Ray, we got the shotguns. Oh? you feel that way about people, too? I heard you like to shoot dogs. Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you? Nothing, Ray. That Larry, he's a pisser. You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you? That fucking Larry. I almost believed him. Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago. Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy -- You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight. 'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse. So you're twenty-two, right? Did one of the officers work you over a little? You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray? Something like that. No . And now you'll provide them. Why? Tell that to Jack Vincennes. To Stensland. No... Where'd the tip come from? Something's wrong. I feel it inside. Doesn't that sound crazy? There are loose ends out there, Dudley. I -- She may still be alive, whoever she is. I'll break them, sir. We got a call earlier on three Negro youths. Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe. Yes, I do, sir. Sir, I took the call. It's my case. His blood's always up. Yes, Dudley. I am. White's a mindless thug. I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did. Or my father. No. No. No. I... No. Dudley, we've been over this. You're wrong. I was thinking Detective Bureau. The youngest applicant by eight years. I'm going to Lynn Bracken's. I'll meet you at the Dining Car. What? Yeah. But first I want to brace Stompanato. What's Fleur-de-Lis? Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on? What's that for? A third. I don't think we can make a case without Bud White. I want to do it right. I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing. Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo. But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop? Rollo was a purse snatcher. My father ran into him off duty. He shot my father six times and got away clean. No one even knew who he was. I made the name up to give him some personality. It's a simple question. Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings? Listen, I think I made a mistake, too. You make a mistake? Yesterday yes, today no. What happened last night? It's not a request. I need to know what White knows. Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.' Permanently. I want you to follow Bud White. I need to speak to you. Glasses. Damnit... L.A.P.D. What about you? You're the payoff expert. I'm just doing my duty. Throwing me ? That's right. I get the idea. You got a description? Decorated? What's on the call sheet? We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl. Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops. What are you talking about? The Nite Owl. Anything bothering you about the case? Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight. Not good enough. Anything else you want to add before I talk to her? Why's she seeing Bud White? What's her name? Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores? Bud White's been here? Do you think I ever could've been in the running? Where is he? When? Where will you go? Okay. Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did. A police captain. I think he's behind all of this. Forget everything else for a second, Lynn. Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith? You, me and White, huh? You're the first person to ever call me tough. Why not? Some reality. You cut to the heart of things, don't you? What about Lynn Bracken? She going to be a hooker all her life? I don't hate White. I really don't. It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for. I'll take your word for it. I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff? How about White? You sound like you mean it. How was I? Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken. Why? Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he? He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results. But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down. Really? What did White say? Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley. What's Dudley's scheme? The proof had his throat slit. So far you're not denying it. Without what, his smearing yours first? What's he got on you, Loew? Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down? None. Call it a hunch. I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour. I don't doubt it -- Oh, God. Under the house. Officer White? Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions. When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?In my car. Blackmail shit. The trunk under the carpet. Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa -- He runs call girls. Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars. And what? Okay. Okay. Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks. From aviation, freeway construction. But the man has hobbies, too. He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on: he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer. All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o. Okay so we worked together. It was an information exchange. I got him first class collars and he got me good stories. We were friends for Chrissakes! What does that have to do -- Take it easy! I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean. Trashcan Jack. The Big V. I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios. I'm happy to cooperate. You don't need to tie me down. I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis. Jesus. Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera. You didn't get my message? It got called off. The kid chickened out at the last minute. What happened with the kid and Loew? What's wrong, Trash? Give me some Narco skinny. I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars. Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs. You like? Jackie! You got some good scoop for the Sidster? Jackie, all I know is what you know. The man is very rich. And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer. But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.' He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo. Where'd you hear that? He's queer too. Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues. On screen and off. I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks. That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career. How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund. Did you know Loew was a swish? You tight with the D.A., trash? The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm. Down around my ankles. You're back, boychick. No. No, I've heard bupkis. Jack, I'll talk to you later. Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger. For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled Not a word. Something good? Jackie, are you back on Narco? I need copy. Hush-Hush . Off the record and on the Q.T. It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them. The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere. You like it, Jackie- Boy? I like it! I like it! They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree. Jack! It's Christmas! Contract players at Metro. You pinch 'em. I do you up feature in the next issue. Plus the usual fifty cash. Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus? Beats me. Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds. He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills. It's right around the corner. We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.' Her name got mentioned. Big V Jack Vincennes! May I have this dance?You wanna buy your brother ten years...? You don't have to say anything. Just look at this list and point. Here. We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe. How'd you like to make it 1960? I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A. You got a brother up in Folsom. I know because I put him there. I saw you fight Kid Gavilan. I like your style. How's the left these days? No. It's a private investigation. I fucked something up and I want to make amends. Part of it has to do with a murder. I've been working with Ed Exley on it. Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland. They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam. Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail. Charges got dropped. Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it. You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley? Two minutes, Dudley. It's important. You think golden boy can handle it, Cap? Okay. I'll do it. Great. You get the girl, I get the coroner. What are you going to do? She is Lana Turner. She is Lana Turner. High line whores. With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else? It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett. You want to talk to him? Movie star hookers. Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again. Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all. Bud White. He sees us and we're dead. Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar. The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant. I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but I sure as hell can't see one. So what's the point? Is there more to that, or do I have to guess? You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, Lieutenant . What? I ain't a priest, Lieutenant. I can't hear your confession. Yeah. My whole life. Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone. Yesterday that might've meant something. Pull me off. You'd be doing me a big favor. Even I'm not that crazy. Damnit... What ? Give me a minute, will ya? Just don't shoot me. What? Shit . Someone beat us here. I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week. Next to you I'm clean. And smart. You're playing an angle, college boy. You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching. If they're making you a detective, watch out. Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs. Yeah, Exley. What's the payoff? I should've known. What's the Chief throwing you? You're the key witness? Loew didn't go with him. You're sure? He's dead. I was just there. Somebody slit his throat. Shut up! Sid, cut the crap. I -- Around. Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers? And Reynolds? Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke. What's he doing here, Sid? Sid, how are they hanging? What about Fleur-de-Lis? Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.' Don't know. I'm chasing picture books. Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies. It's well done stuff. I thought you might have heard something. No. But I've got something going with Ad Vice. Sid, it's Vincennes. Yeah, it's subtle. Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns. No. It's felony possession of marijuana. I need an extra fifty. Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station. You lost me, Sid. Who? Is she? Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine. Yeah. Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting. I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett. A bootleg... I just called it. This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number. Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine. It'll be our secret. I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz. Yeah. Me neither. Really? How? Yeah. Me and Patchett go way back. Fleaur-de-Lis. 'Whatever you desire.' Something like that. Yeah. Working whores with squad two. Yeah, Cap. Back in Narcotics. Gee. The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White? No, Mr. White. Pierce Morehouse Patchett. Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you. If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address? I doubt she knows anything, but -- There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner. Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake. I use girls who look like movie stars. Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon. I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio. Wait. Our deal still holds? I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket. She is -- was -- a big doubles fan. Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it. I run call girls. Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well. I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt. I sense you share this feeling. Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them? Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder? Against your code? He no longer works for me. Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. Whatever you desire . Of course... You know I do or you wouldn't be here. How did you find me? I don't know him. Mr... I was here, hosting a party. Who was killed and why do you think I can help? I am. Are you soliciting for police charities? The last time, you people called at my office. She's fine. Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen. No. Why do men and women usually see each other? Lynn Bracken. A vulgar term, but yes. For the last time. I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect. I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.What did he do? You mean if I get sick? Don't they ever let us take these boots off? Do I look wasted -- asshole? Waxy Wright. Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament? I don't care -- he's manipulating it. That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere. He's lying. Sorry, Admiral. It wasn't mentioned in the job description. ... Thanks. Yeah, real fine. Especially all the casualties. Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge. How old is he? Nice-looking kid. Perfect fit. I'm not the same person you remember. I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything. I'm glad you've stayed clean. You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous. Where am I? Drive. Yeah -- me. Or reactivated the first one. Why would he need more? And this thing can grow it? For being one helluva guy. Thanks, Pollux. Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows. Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian. That's not the worst part. And I bet I've kept that promise ... Uh -- to kill the doctors? Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General. Like ... I don't know. Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks. Do you know what it is to be in a coma? It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday! I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit. What do you mean? So? Pollux ... They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ... Hey, bro ... Would it? That's what they always say. How is he? Eve ... I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off. The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die. You can't go. You can't be anywhere near that place. He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one. Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time. Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you -- What more proof do you need? Why point it at me? I'm the real thing. An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face. He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything. But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me. -- I called, but I'm not Castor. I'm your husband. Don't hang up ... Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right? He's said and done things your husband would never do ... Never mind that! Just take Jamie and get out of that house. Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO. Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is your husband -- isn't. I can't tell you ... except only I can do it. One last time. It's important ... Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive. How come? Were you there to catch me? So you had a nightmare. Must've been after we got engaged. Something good? It's important. We need to talk. Is that what you think? Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore. Just make sure you're there. On time. Call Lazarro. Castor just came out of his coma. Don't worry. I've done my homework. I'll get Pollux to talk. She doesn't know -- and she never will. Which ear was it? He'd see that a mile away. The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother. Unfortunately, turnips can't talk. Go on. How's Loomis? I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying. One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city. I've been working night and day. I haven't had time. Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one. Jamie ... Give up, Castor. People are going to find out. I don't know. How long before it kills us? Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long. Stay away from my family! What are you going to do! What are you going to do, Castor? You killed them? It can't be. It's impossible. -- Castor? You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell. Mention my family once more and you're dead. You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent -- And how much will your "fun" net you this time? Walton, you have to let me see the warden -- Pollux is -- what? I'm going to have you fired. They're too tight.Shoot him! Not if I kill you first ... Five seconds. What -- what are you doing? Too late, your kid worships me. And your wife -- she's an animal. Even I can't keep up with her. You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible. But hell -- this is America. One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck. Excuse me -- I mean "make love to." Let's not confuse things anymore. I'm Archer. You're Castor. But if you need proof -- Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK. And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are. Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life. I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote." Who knows? Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out. Or maybe God really is on my side after all. By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here. Not anymore. Don't count on it. You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it. What're you gonna do with me gone? You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie? What's it to you? I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a month -- Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun. Castor Troy almost strangled me to death. Where the hell were you? Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial. So take a hike. I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill. We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out. Trust me, he's already here. Get going! There's my little darling. The night wouldn't be complete without you. I mean like protection. Did it look like I was siding with him? Did it? You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared. Do you have protection? What are you -- stupid? Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie. And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket. You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man. I won't tell mom if you don't. Screw your boundaries, Janie. You have something I want. Get rid of them. Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we? That's your name, isn't it? Well, I saw you -- Kim. You can't blame me for trying. Obviously someone else knows it! Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW! What? Where should I be? Where's everyone else? What the fuck do you think happened? Castor Troy just shot him! What are you waiting for? GO! Escaped? From Erewhon? I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD. What happened? A lot of people think you're a snitch. It's dangerous ... You'll need to recultivate that virus. All of them do. We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb. And we'll be rich. We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends. Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village. Your present's in here. There's fun, bro. Then there's FUN. Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small. You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit. Trust me. You're gonna love it ... -- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me. The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy. You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her? Business first. I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records. You're clean. In fact, you're now on the informant payroll. No. Most of them are in transit by now. I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security. What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here. Done. In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs. I had doubts too. I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ... What's that? Just following your example. You're the only person in this place who can see right through me. Normally, I would. But today ... Back then -- who wasn't? Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want. But I have to give you an escort. Security reasons. I'll deal with her later. Where's Jamie? Okay, I have a confession to make. But you aren't going to like it. I disagree. You think I've been acting strange. Like a completely different person. What are you doing? I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ... Oh, that Karl. Great. Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive. I'm late. Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know. What's on your mind? Call me spontaneous. So you see, I'm not going anywhere. Unless it's upstairs with you ... I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted. Can't you see I'm trying to change? I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you. I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful -- I'm not going anywhere. Gone? Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it? They say love is blind. Do you think that's true? Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold. Don't I usually kiss my wife? Have fun at work. The hospital? Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor. Ha-ha. It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to? What do you know about it?It's not <i>exactly</i> him. We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night. What more do you want? Positive saliva match. The cup was definitely used since the original sweep. Where do we start? From what budget? We don't have the manpower. He's not here. It's a blind alley. That's the last. You know their workforce. Two-thirds at least fall into the category. We'll be closing down their operation for days. At least go with a fingertip sample or urine. None of the ID photos match the enhancement. It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. You've seen their security system. They know who works there. Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals. It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window. No. But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past. The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for. We're already getting complaints about frivolous search. With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky. Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet. This <i>is</i> the most likely location-- What a pity. I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections-- Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found. This was an angry killing. Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death? According to this, he's a sick man. Congenital heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes. With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests-- I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not... ...universally loved. He was leading the cut-backs in the program. You're looking at a room full of motives. Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges... I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir. It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.You have more in common than you know. Don't be deceived, Irene. These are just the clothes. He has to wear them. Something I could never do. He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes. That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded. Again? Now <i>you're</i> here. Who are your "friends"? Hello, sweatheart. Come on up. Hello. At least you're honest. Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it. You're both going to a lot of trouble-- Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own. I'm sure you're sincere... ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself. Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it. My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off? Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him? I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>. Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight? Six one. I got the better end of the deal. I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream. I'm travelling too. In case you get back before I do. No, but you might need them when you get back. I have your samples ready. I could always walk. I've been faking it. Not bad, Jerome. I was never very good at it, remember? Hello? I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer. How long? Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself. You may as well invite her here. Where are you taking her? I'm sure you'll be very convincing. Again? Where are we going? She doesn't <i>have</i> to know. She doesn't <i>want</i> to know. You're not thinking of telling her, are you? You <i>are</i> a catch. No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up". What's wrong with her? How was your evening? If I were you I'd worry about myself. Haven't you forgotten something? I don't feel too good. I think I'm still drunk from last night. If you say so. The stripe. Is that all? So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled. I'm sure I could have. And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless? How could they recognize you? <i>I</i> don't recognize you. Anyway, you don't have a choice. You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now. No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing. This is a minor inconvenience is all it is. We've taken worse heat than this. Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered. You can't quit on me now. I've put too much into this. Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>. I had other offers, you know. I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine. You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself? We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned. Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash to you. They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years. I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life-- Could be worse. They could have found it in your eye. Where? What makes them think that? What are you talking about? Any particular reason? I'm proud of you, Vincent. --I walked right in front of it. I was never more sober in my life. You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know I'm scared of heights. I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life. How long do you stay up there before you go? What <i>is</i> that one? At least up there your piss will be worth something. You'll all be showering in it, right? I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!! You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going. Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week-- you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction. Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately. So what? You didn't kill him, did you? This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it? What an act of benevolence--a service to the community. So that's it. Now there's nothing between you and ignition. You wish. Who died? Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent. You don't know what a relief it is not to be me. Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job? God, you're serious, aren't you? God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet? You really need that much? Noone orders southpaws anymore. It needs work. Wrong color. It's silver. It's not easy living up to this. If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.Too late for that. We're closer to the other side. Now is your chance to find out. Who are you trying to convince? Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible? God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing. But <i>you</i> did, once. Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail? There are a few million miles to go yet. You almost sound like you believe that. By the way, I left some trash in your locker. I'll see what I can do. I guess I'm a slow learner. Not yet, I'm afraid. Thank you. Where are you going? Why have you done this? Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples where I'm going. How the hell did you get here. How are you, Jerome? How would you like to be yourself for the day? By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?" Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad. How are you?" We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer. Will you be okay? Everybody goes there. Michael's. She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong. I'm sorry. I've got plans. Of course not. But she's have to know eventually. You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since. Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing. Never stopped you before. And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald. Not thirsty? We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week. Good choice. I've got enough on my mind without that. You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation. You really had other offers? I'm sorry. I think I was crying. They'll recognize me. --You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. We should cut our losses. Come on--we're taking off. In a corridor. They found my eyelash. They think I offed the Director. We can't stay here. Call German. It's all right. --What car?--Go to sleep. It's okay, Eugene. Up there they wouldn't be a problem. A day or so. 11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew. And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered. Keep going!! Keep going!! Let's get out of here. You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got my final physical tomorrow. That's not the point. The place is crawling with Hoovers. He was still warm when they confirmed. They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag. The Mission Director. What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene? It's not too late to back out. Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home. <i>More</i> than that. You'll get used to it. You had to be a right-hander. What about this? I have to know where you come from. A year is a long time. We could go together one day. I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later. That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn. But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your-- --nose. How perfect does your child have to be? You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left. We'll get it later. Irene, please. Come on. It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here. Let's walk. Those checks take forever. You've never been here? Let me order for you. I guess somebody beat me to it. Of course. What exactly is wrong? You'll be next. Why would I be angry? It was beautiful. Yes...<i>yes</i>... Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene. Does it have a name? Where? It was a mercy-killing after all. Have they found our friend? We were just looking. I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you? Why don't we say we were together? So we don't know for sure about you, either. Were <i>you</i> alone? Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about <i>you?</i> Where were you last night? No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone. Last night? I was at home. No bother. Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser-- There's a problem, Lamar. What's this, Lamar? Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes. I'll tell you at the end of the week. Only every time I'm in here.No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything! Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree. Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over. I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to. Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan? Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day... Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down. No, I had to talk him down. Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left. Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years. Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have. Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you. It's a way outta here. Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank. Are they hookin' you up with a job? Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy. So, when are you done with those meetin's? Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner. Sorry, brother. I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother... What? How's the woman? Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way. What do I look like, Al Cowlins? You want to take my car, drop her off? I don't know. I didn't get on Cathy last night. Who'd you call? You're fuckin' good. What'd you get? You get leniency? When's the arraignment? Hey, thanks for comin' out. What do we got? No, and we got four of 'em. Jesus Christ. Not even close. We're not goin'. I don't even like "Kelly's." I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids. You'd prob'ly fit right in. Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime. Stop brushin' me back! Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"-- Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat-- Yeah, it is. I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way. Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that-- Well, I don't have no trousers on... You caught that, huh? Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY She'll live. If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but... What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that. Oh, right. How'd you know where to find me? How you doin'? Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit. I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people. Yah, it's not a bad school... Ah, history I think. So, you ladies ah, go to school here? Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car. Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day. Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday. Shut the fuck up. Oh, Morgan. Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you. Why don't you beat off at your house? You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car. It's a good thing no one's Irish here. The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house. So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage. Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home. I told you "no" yesterday! My uncle can probably get you on my demo team. You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch. Morgan, Let's go. Shut up. NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!! I think you should establish a good line of credit. Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away. How much money you got? What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it. Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there! All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once. Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes? What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her? You could put a pool in that backyard. And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille. And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG! --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry-- Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest. Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now. Retainer... --These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated. All right, are we gonna have a problem? To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary. Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time. Good, it was all right. History.--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times-- No, there's a limit. --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side-- Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing... Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important. No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint. Building two. Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building-- I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here. Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office? Thank you, Will. I'll do that. Yes. This job... Do it if it's what you really want. I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure. Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week. You know, you're no longer required to come here. Will. No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving. What are you smiling at? So am I. Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away. Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now. The least you can do is show me a little appreciation. I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there. Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me. Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting? That's fine, but did you ever think-- --This can't be right. This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered-- This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here-- Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting. That's enough. Get out, Will. I told you to cooperate with these people. Oh, for God's sake, Will. Shall we start the, uh... --That edge! --that?-- What's that? I happen to know so. That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will? Okay. How? This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer? Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will. I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field. I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail. That's right. That you meet with me twice a week-- Yes. Under two conditions. I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision. Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T. Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor. What's your name? Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here. What're you doing? Find out what? It's Saturday. Yes. I did. How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him? You've heard of Albert Einstein? Have you heard of Jonas Salk? Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet. Pleasure to meet you. About thirty million to one. About thirty million to one. Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery? How about one now? I got one of those too. Do you know when you'll be back? Why there? Where're you going? So I hear you're taking some time. Sean... Hello, Sean. You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself! He won't be a failure! That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault. --Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy-- Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure. --Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had. Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been-- Oh, that's nice-- Oh, come on, Sean-- He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you. What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with-- He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point-- Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here. --Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this. --And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake-- --And confuse him-- This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out-- That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you. Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine. --No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy-- Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry-- Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal. Well, you're the only one. You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They-- Who? Sean, I really don't think you understand-- Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign. Well, have you talked to him at all about his future? Seems like it's going well. You moved? You're here quite a bit, then. Not at all. Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?" Why would he do that? What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour? Tom. It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got. Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit. It's on the college. That would be fine. Just meet with the boy once a week. Five. You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston. I need someone with your kind of background. They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him. --That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England. He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers... This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him. I'm sorry, that damn conference-- You were missed. How long has it been since we've seen each other? I didn't see you at the reunion. Is there someplace we can talk? Good to see you. Hello. Sean. The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together. He was my roommate in college. There is somebody... What's the point?Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers! Watch what happens. Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens. Suck my cock! Fuck you, you fat fuck. That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him. Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo? You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in. What'd you say about me? Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before. I don't have a VCR at my house. What's up guys? Chuck, let's go. I'm Irish. Did your Uncle get arrested? Holy shit. Some other guy? What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday! Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'-- I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'. No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL So don't go. Come on, Will... Did she get my Double Burger? Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie? I told you, I just got change. Yah, all right... So why don't you give me my sandwhich? She's not stupid. Fuck her. Fuck this, let's get something to eat... Yah, that is a nice ass. WILL! Jesus. --That isn't funny-- Had one, now I'm fucked again. Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us? There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass. How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom? What happened? You got fired, huh? I don't got a crush on her. Let's hit "Kelly's." You guys are fuckin' sick.Well, I can see this is pointless... Who is "Danny Terrio?" You're getting defensive, Will. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children. That's very presumptuous. What? I might understand that. What places? Like what, Will? Will, your not getting off that easy. Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will. --you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book. Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round? I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one. Sounds good. You should come. I'll buy you a drink. I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months. Never been. I don't know. India maybe. Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit. Me too. Come in. He's not you! If you push him into something, if you ride him-- I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too! --I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on! That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal! --I don't have any anger at you-- --I'm not angry at you-- --And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him! --And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty! Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most! Why do you think he does that, Gerry? He is at a fragile point. He's got problems-- "Undermine?" I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here! Hold on! --Gerry-- Now wait a minute-- Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants. --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you. Now wait a minute, Gerry-- Maybe he doesn't care about that. Just...take it easy, Gerry. I do. Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum-- He married his cousin. What don't I understand? That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that. Jobs doing what? We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers. I think so. I been here a couple years. I live right around the corner. Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together. Gerry! Any trouble finding the place? I won't talk first. To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to. No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually. You too, Gerry. Would you excuse us? I'll be okay. I got it. Can we do it at my office? Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick? He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me? My kind of background? Why me? Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age-- And he mailed it to Hardy-- Yeah. Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan? I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule. I got your card. Since Nancy died. I've been busy. Good to see you. The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math. But it's only given out every four years. Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986. Good luck. Only if you grab my ass. No. Thank you. I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be. You're Welcome, Will. We're done. You did your time. You're a free man. Good for you. Congratulations. That's what you want? Which one did you take, Will? It's not... It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. The wrench, why? Gotta go with the belt there... Yes. Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of-- You want to read it? Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation. Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way. And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you. Look at me. What do you want to do? I been there. I played my hand. If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time. You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man. Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out. It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do? Don't give me you line of shit. That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road. But you can't give back to them, Will. They're all dead. Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate. Do you have a soul-mate? Do you think you're alone? What did you think? Gerry says the meeting went well. So you might be working for Uncle Sam. Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run. No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game. They could see that I meant it. I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl." You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room. That's right. I was havin' a drink with my future wife. October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them. Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her. What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife? Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick. Yeah. I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one. I gave that up when my wife got sick. No, I don't. Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans? I read your book last night. My wife's dead. My wife's dead. I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it. And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that. So Christ, call her up. Jesus Christ, you are an amateur. Why not? Well, are you going out again? How'd it go? Yeah? You got a lady now? You've never been on a plane. So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right? You've never been out of Boston. You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me? If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you. Watch your mouth. Maybe you should be a patient and sit down. Maybe what mea-- Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"-- Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh? What is? What does? Tell me what you really think. Crayons? Yeah. Do you paint? 285. Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench? Yes, I do. Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth. You think so? How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?" Yeah, it did take me a long time. I did. What did you think? How about the ones on that shelf? Have you read all these books, Will?You're kiddin' me. Why didn't you yoke him? You and Morgan throw? You don't know that. Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to? Chuckie, what are you talkin'... What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field. Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat. Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years. Week after I'm twenty-one. Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes. She went to Medical school in California. Gone. Thanks, Chuck. I was countin' on it. I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride. Why not? No one. I didn't have the number. Probation, counselin', few days a week. Next week. Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich. I don't know yet. Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish? She didn't do it again did she? She's sharp as a marble. Fuck you. What are we gonna do up there? Stop crowdin the plate! --or a tail-- Chuckie, what the fuck happened? Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one. Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A. Codebreaking. So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency? Down there. And I'm nervous. It's touching me. It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer. Somethin's in my room. Seven. Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call. I appreciate that. Bullshit. Thank you. I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean. Hey, how you doin'? I can come back. It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card. Well, I'm sorry. --You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke! And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up. --Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people. Then don't set up any more meetings. I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator. It's right. Take it home with you. Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me-- I'm pretty sure it's right. I don't know what it's called. No. Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week. C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work. Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun. Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes. An integer. --Half-red, half-black-- Half-red, half-black-- I think so. It's an integer proof. Of course. I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist. If I agree to this, I walk right now? What're those? Really? Fuck do you want? Hey fuck you. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house? So, you finally got a job Morgan? Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'. Hold up. Yeah, Morgan. I got fired. Well, she out did herself today... I could go for a Whopper. It's walkin' pretty slow at this point. You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free. If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau." Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that. I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller. Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump. C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true. Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay? Certain, clubs. Like, Paradise. It's not bad. I go places, I interact. No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about. You're right. I know. Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker. I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart-- That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good. See ya. Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? I'll keep in touch. I just want you to know, Sean... Thanks you. So, that's it? We're done? Yeah, I think so. Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy. I know, I know... I know. Don't fuck with me. I know. I know. I know. Oh, I know. Cause fuck him, that's why. I used to go with the wrench. It sure ain't good. --No, have you had any experience with that? No. Have you had any experience with that? You're not going to fail me are you? Do you want to talk about it? Well, I'm here. So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy. That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again! What? What? Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that. I didn't ask for this. I didn't want the job. Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this? Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no... Not to me, they're not. Yeah. Define that. What? What did I think? I guess. I don't know. Would have been nice to catch that game though. You're kiddin' me. "I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say? I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series! So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away? You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met? Where were you? When did you know she was the one? You don't regret meetin' your wife? Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife? What happened to that guy from Kentucky? Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean. All those guys were in your platoon? Is that why you didn't write anything else? Why not? Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone. Hence, the word remarried. You ever think about gettin' remarried? Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that. I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun... Haven't called her. I don't know. Fine. Yeah, I went on a date last week. I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person. You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!" No. Why thank you. No. So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about? Time's up. That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else? Maybe you married the wrong woman. --Well, maybe that means you. You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?" I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off. The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting. Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me. This is a real piece of shit. No. Oh. Nautilus? You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing. Whatever blows your hair back. You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books. "A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass. That must have taken you a long time. I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em? Yeah, I read those. Probably not. Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included? Take care. Yeah. I just wanted to call before you left. I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker. Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me! What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back? You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery No, you don't want to hear that. Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear? I'm not honest? What the fuck am I afraid of?! At least you have a mother. --some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too. --Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry-- What am I scared of? What do you mean "What am I afraid of?" I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you. One, because I have a job here and two because I live here-- I can't go out to California. 'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake." But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back. And you're sure about that? Yeah, but how do you know? How do you know that? What? No. --When it came to stuff like that I could always just play. Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano-- Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head. I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart. Do you play the piano? Like me? I guess so. Some, a little. I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number? Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor. You're rich. What do you have to worry about? Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing. C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages. Want me to take a look? How's it goin'? Not tonight. Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance. I'd say... It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up. Sometime. I don't know. Next week. All right, all right. We'll go. Aah, it's kind of a hike. They don't come over here that much. Exactly. 'Cause it's nicer than my place. Then let's go have some fun. You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you? Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth? I couldn't wait till tomorrow. Promise? Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out. I'm sorry, I been real busy. We'll do that. All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now. Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian. 'Course I do, they're my brothers. It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice. I swear to God. Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen. I have twelve big brothers. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think? Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters? You know, nothing special. Pretty boring, I guess. Not far from here, South Boston. Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels. No...I was hoping to get a kiss. I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss. No I wasn't... No I haven't... I really don't 'date' that much. No. Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear. In that case, fine. Want to see my magic trick? So you just want to use me and go? Is Harvard gettin' all that money? I bet your parents were happy to pay. You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you? Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels. Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night. It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar? The caramel thing is my pick-up line. I was trying to be smooth. But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you. Five minutes. When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee. Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels. I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe... I kind of got that impression. I'm Will. What?Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing. Okay. Repeat this after me. What else? Say more. Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel. What stuff? Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed. And how have you been feeling about your... work lately? Yes. I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens." So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families. You know where I live? You needn't be so frank with me about your work. Say more. How do you know? Tell me about your vision of the reunion. We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite. You went to school with these people. Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?Excellent. Here they come. ...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece? Don't listen to him, he's a professional. Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole. Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job... But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship. I told them to kill you and they didn't. A little misunderstanding among my associates. Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday. I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee. I'm gonna get you, kid. It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in. We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor. Like a club. Work less, make more. I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble. Did you see Blank in there? If he does our job, he's our job. I love. I kill. You're wrong. Look at his face. He's falling for her. Look at him. Yup. -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy. Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer. We can't do our job unless he does his job. It was the PLO. --Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened. Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the -- Well? Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man? Lisbon? You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce. You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those-- I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland-- It's what I do. I sell biscuits to the Southland. Yeah... In the corporate offices. Yes I do. I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Whatever I can get away with. Wonderful. Don't say that. I'm Martin Blank. Then express yourself, Bob. What do you want to do? You could've been a contender, huh? Really? Fine, Bob. How are you? Okay. See you later. It's me. Martin Blank. Bob... And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven? So you eat-- read it everyday? Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony. I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that. You don't understand... What if I come back? Will you come with me? I was leaving. A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money. Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things. Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life. I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work. Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other... ...About five years now. It's something I do... No. Yes. Could be. The physical substance of love. Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper. Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood. Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller. Wow. I have to give this some thought. --She's not dead--- Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week? --Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna-- Shoulda brought my gun. Right. Do you want to get a drink first? I'll just help myself to a cocktail. You look beautiful. As long as I get the laugh. Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in. This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship. Yes. Seven it is. Yes. I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock. That'd be good. What's that? Bad television. Bad people. Bad experiences. Well, there's not much to tell. It's always the little things. That's part of it. Are you going to the reunion? You see someone? --and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really. I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11-- Where have I been? Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back. I'm a professional killer. Not much else. I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really. Here is now there. There is here. Ten years, I think. What I miss? How long has it been? It's nice to see you again. This is me breating. ...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure. Out Loud? Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion. If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals. Morality. If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway. Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys. Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me. Mmm. So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around? We're both professionals, Oatman. Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live. They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say? "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork." I just know. Shouldn't you be taking notes? Come on. It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone? Up on the right. Okay. Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural. No. You understand the psychology of the job. I work alone. Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work. There you go. I left it blank. Okay. I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving. It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry. Nice talk, Sugarmouth. Is that right? No deal. I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends! Hard to get good help these days. No harm no foul. Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette. Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild. And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me.... Thank you, no. Like a union? What do you want? I guess. Have you seen Debi Newberry? Well... I have to take this over to Debi. Those all seem kind of related... That sounds pretty interesting... Hey, Bob. Not bad. You? Hey, Ken. How have you been? Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great. Tell them my house exploded. Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all. I've looked at it. It's fine. I'll do it tomorrow. See you next week. I have scruples. Next. Never enough. Good. What else? Anything interesting? There's nothing to be done about it. Would you describe their position as inflexible? Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time. And they want me to make up for it. He didn't. I'm not happy. I'll pay. And not show it to me. Ever again. Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail. Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living. Throw that away. Patch him through.... ...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella. I have always thought about her and missed her. Yeah... I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her. I think I'll go see Debi today. Yeah. I guess we did. No, I don't have one. You have a headache? They told me you're taking lithium, mom. I imagine that'd be rather difficult. It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing. Jim? It's a place where religious people-- That's wonderful, Mom. When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry. I have to get my head back into my work. It didn't work out. I was catching up with Bob Destephano. Mein Dealer. How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully? He sells BMW's? I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer. No. No. You drove us here. Debi's house. You too. Fair enough. So what happened to you? Paul? Wow. How did you get this job? So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me. So when are you authorized to use deadly force? I'm a professional killer. Why not? I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you? How's that? How are you? How's business? Good evening, Mr. Newberry.No... I get it. Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us. One cannot love and kill. He using her. So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys. Wait a minute-- Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here. I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job. Whatever. That's strictly B�ader-Meinhof stuff. --Nooo-- I don't think so. In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn. In Portugal, yes. Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.That's good. So what are you doing with your life now, son? Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing? I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek. Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong. Good evening, Mr. Blank.Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am. Say, where's the wife? Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey. Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh? Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan? Up the organization! Bastard. Got a meeting uptown. Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top. Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself? Paul? Yeah. You think -- Yeah. Well, we can just -- Do you think? Maybe we should call someone -- Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning? I'll drive you -- Elena. Ready to go? Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up. Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know -- Elena. I'm not. I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that -- I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home. Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already? I know, I know. I had no idea -- Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot. You've... Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean. What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here. Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after? Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say? Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again -- Elena, what are you're talking about? What do you mean? What's on your mind? Don't -- You think I -- No advice from the experts, huh? What's for dessert? Yeah, that one. Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat. I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice. In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it! ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your - You go dry off now. Stuffed and baking. What? Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday. Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got -- Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot. You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did? Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was -- You crying? You know Elena, I've been thinking-- I do. I'm -- are you...? Um, yes. You all right there? Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it? Rough day. Good night. I'm, uh, going to bed. Well, it is a neighborhood tradition. You want to go? Good night. Elena. Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and -- Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them. Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our... Why shouldn't she be? That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him. I wasn't star-- And as usual no one believed me... Gotcha. OK, OK, the defense rests. Want another? Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets? Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address? Stay out of trouble. Thanks. Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that. All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great. Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up. Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well... For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother -- You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well -- Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh? Anyone special? You know... Grades? Classes? So how's school treating you? Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should... Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon. Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right? I just can't believe you could be so -- Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband -- What? Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened? Damn right, but where the hell were you? Right. Gotcha. Huh? Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge. Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything? After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one? Gotcha. You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right. Yeah? It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department -- C'mon. Your toes cold? I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess... Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all. I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home. Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off! What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood -- What the hell are you kids doing down here? Jesus all right enough! What you been up to? I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come? Good night kiddo. If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed. Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it. That was a joke? You don't tell jokes. What? Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year. Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff -- But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena. But... -- 73 -- What advice? You never -- But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each -- Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but -- Actually it's not about work, it's advice about -- You know, dah-- I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know -- -- Well what am I supposed to call you? We don't have to always go to your club, dad. Darn it, Dave. It's what? Good shit. Thanks for the advice Dave.Pharmaceutical! You are a god. Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place. Moisture! Moisture! All will be revealed, baby. You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff. My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that -- Am I right or am I right? Aha! I could sense the vibe. Um, Libbets Casey. Do what? And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned. Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you. See ya. Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night? Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag. The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick. Arise and shine, young Hood. Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway. Groovy. Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess? Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze. Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead? Awesome sleet and rain.I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse. Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever. Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her. It was all junk! It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties. But what? -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance. That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 -- -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad? You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice -- -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought -- Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now -- Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you? That's besides the point. And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --Libbets. Libbets Casey. See you. Sure dad. Uh, dad, you know I'm 16. About? Yeah. Hnnn. Fine. Good. All right. Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments -- I'm fine dad. Hi dad. One for you and one for me. Check it out. Not for the faint of heart. And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded? Huh? Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that? Shit. You're not planning -- What do you mean? What? Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up. How can you do that man? Flame on, asshole. Where you going? No more man. I'm about to drop as it is. I gotta get to English class. Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields. I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night. Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together? You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you -- It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really -- Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off. You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you -- Maybe you should have just a half. Well, uh, I don't, it's really -- Hey, it's a sellable skill. The Idiot. If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot. Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot? Good thinking Marge. You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here? How do you know this shit? Truly? Do speak. It's beyond mere physical attraction. I'm in love with Libbets Casey. What are you doing at home on a Friday night? Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train. I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and -- What time is it? Charles, what time is it? Her name's Libbets. It's a one-on-one kind of date thing. Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night. May I operate your telephonic apparatus? I don't know. Dad seems a little weird. How are the parental units functioning these days? Hello, Charles. Watching what? Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep. Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip? That I will indeed. I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she? Ouch. Now you are being rude. You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself. If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean... My, I sound a bit -- Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization? You ask what the point is? -- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self. In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology. Forget how to ride a bike. They say you never forget. Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples -- It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers -- No need to make excuses -- Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year. Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?No! You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico. You going to tell dad? It's freezing. Where you going? Why are you so good at math but not in English? Geometry? Mikey? No one. Stupid! Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend? I don't know. How do I know? I love you. Huh? Okay. It feels warm. Vodka? We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents? Communist Viet Cong. If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up. Are you his girlfriend? Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there. What are you doing? Yeah. They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up. All my model planes. Well, you can... Mikey was looking for you. Hey Wendy.If I don't move, I can't shoot it. It's... behind... us. Why? Do you think the rex might have the infant with it? The radio rig is inside. It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem. Operations building. Far end of the street. What is that? The velociraptors. What in Christ's name is going on?! We've got to transport it seven thousand miles. Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member? Had to. To keep him still for the trip. I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me -- You are a billion dollar idea, my little f- You're kidding yourself. An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly. It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it. If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would -- Killing lessons? Heartwarming. You rally think this'll draw the parent? Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill? How close do you have to be? What kind of gun is that? Where do you think you're going?! Okay. You heard his, Dieter. Find a new spot. And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks. What? Why? Piss. InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests. People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it. We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries. You version of it. If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to-- You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw. You violated that agreement. So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you? I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11. You know how to work a radio, don't you? Don't ask me. The guy's completely out to lunch. Their what? Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?Because I didn't know! I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here. Is there an antidote? Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all? You think I'm all talk, Eddie? You are an academic. "Minimal" is too much. It has to be light, it has to be strong -- Any damage? I'm not going, John. John . . . So what? Are you out of your mind? I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that? No, no, no, no, no, no . . . I don't believe you. What are you talking about? What? They do have motives. Why did you want to see me? Your message said it was urgent. I didn't know you -- weren't well. Resentful. Come on! I'm fine... I'm fine... Are you all right?! Anything broken? Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do. Where does it say that? How could you possibly? This is nothing like Austin. Forget about it. Out of the question. You'd miss the gymnastics trials. You've been training for that for a year. That Richard. Well, is he? You know, at the bus stop. With the hair? Is that kid still bothering you? Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that? I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise. I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week. Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right. You're going to have a fantastic time. Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour. You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there. Kelly! What are you doing here? What's he got in there? It was a payoff and an insult. InGen never-- There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life. I didn't tell anything, I told the truth. You cost me my livelihood. That on which I relied to support my children. Do me a favor. Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth. You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there. Something's wrong. DAMN IT, BE SURE!! I have to find Kelly! For sixty seconds, maybe! Look at this! You could- This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack! We can't stay in here! Where's Kelly? I don't know. No. No. What do you think they want?! So do it a favor and put it out of its misery! ?! Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away. Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so. Our chance to do what? You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous. No way. She's nuts. You gentlemen feel you have to do this now? Four, counting the one in the chamber. It's called self-testing. But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction. A uniquely human characteristic. In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase. Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that- But why? I don't care about my life. But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger -- Yes. And people will live in the absence of truth. Because it exists. So that others would know about this place? Just -- flawed. Very deeply flawed. A statistical phenomenon. Says everything in the world goes in streaks. It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets. Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad. Bad things cluster. They go to hell together. You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin? We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter. No. I'm quite certain you can't. Birdshit? What? Maybe. Maybe not. They're pushing us over the cliff. Oh, God. Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back. I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now. This expedition is over. All right. I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated. John Hammond will too. Do you have enough to publish? Are you insane?! Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?! GIVE IT TO THEM! Think fast, Sarah. Can you set up? John Hammond. No! We're an independently funded expedition. I'm her father. You're going home. I'm sending a radio call for the boats. We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them. You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island! That's a scientific impossibility, you know. Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Whatever you study, you also change.Are you looking for a problem? You gotta be kidding. You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge? You couldn't get anybody else? Is that who we're really working for?! Gene splicers?! -humidity, I know. Highest lead density on the market. Oh -- Look! Sarah! I think she's with Sarah! Head for the roof! It'll hold! We're sure as hell not going back out there" She's with Sarah! Come on! What are they? Lava? No way. What do they want?! No! Get in the car before they hear us! It has a broken leg! There' no reason for name calling. I don't know these guys, but I know 'em. I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic. They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy. Then this is our chance. Do you see any family resemblance here? Oh, my God. She's gutty. Where's Kelly? JUMP! There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone. You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on. Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed. Well? Do we go on? Immediately: I'm trying! Give it more morphine! That little black line? Ruining everything, that's what they're doing. You could choke on the diesel smoke already! The kid scores with cheap sentiment. Oh, no! He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink. Oh, please. How am I supposed to keep a straight face when -- -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island? Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths. Women. 'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace. I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.You hear something? If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance. The truck -- It certainly does. Ajay. Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me. Sorry. We were saying? A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins. If it escapes. But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay. I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death. Maybe I just feel too close to it my-- Just a little bit too much, I think. Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch. You go. Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why? That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it. I'm touched. Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa? Let it go, Peter. The animal won. It's just fed. It won't attack unless it's threatened. Don't move. We took to the rock. Possible. Good. Where's the power and radio setup? Piss. What is? Isn't it obvious? You've broken its leg! What? Rex won't be any different. It'll come. I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep. All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill. Forty yards. Less, maybe. I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down. My father's .600 Nitro Express. Made in 1904. Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant. 8700 foot pound striking force. To collect my fee. Good lad. Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions. First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is. Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day. Second condition -- my fee. You can keep it. All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male. Buck only. Why and how are my business. If you don't like either of those conditions, you're on your own. Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care. But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas. Okay? Carnivores hunt near stream beds. Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar? Cancel that, Dieter. Now's the perfect time. The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food. Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry. Don't let it out of your hands again. Can the kid walk? How many rounds did you find for that weapon? You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead. And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?" And he said "I didn't. I went up there to live." Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived. And the second greatest predator must take him down. So the truth is more important to you than your life? It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it? Why should they? Why did you come here? Feeling a bit blue, are we? What's that? Look, we have two choices. We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help. Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait. Can the kid walk? You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you. MOVE IT OUT!! If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight. None of that matters. Our communications equipment's been destroyed. If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --I know. No cried? Cow. Tell me. Mama, my story.Goodbye, Kundun. Hmmm. I will buy them for you. Where will you keep them? I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness. I do, now. Are you? Of whom? No. Not the way to talk to people. I am sorry, Lhamo.We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt. I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun. The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home. They will take Lhasa next. Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not. The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes. Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished. The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight. Did you ever doubt it? Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness? The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war. It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America. Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa. In the Americas. One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador". The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead. Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area. Quite simple. Yes. Good. America, we shall see. Britain chooses not to. India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us. Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese. The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves. Ask whatever you will. You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do. I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun. When it is time. He warned about the future of Tibet. I do not know, Holiness. It is an island. American territory. In the Pacific Ocean. No. This war is almost over. No. Not very big. Roughly five thousand men. May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?What does the butter spot feel like? True. Is that a true story, or pretend? Does he have the spot?You have grown up very good. We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace. You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time. The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe. No, Holiness. Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here? These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them. The people want you made Dalai Lama. Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army. Ahh. Ahh. Yes. We have enemies. I would not know. Maybe. But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama. You cannot. You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony. As you say. It is a story, you decide. She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads. Things change, Kundun. I have smarter men. I am braver.I worry about them. Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me. Where are you from? All quiet? Yes. I am ready. A moment. No! Can I free the prisoners? Here. We'll collect them. Will you buy the sheep for me? And you have horses? You love horses. But, I am in charge. Can I do anything I want? It is alright, Father. Soon. I have. Thank you. Please sit. General Chiang. If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose? Then, we shall meet. Yes. Yes, but they say he did. Time to study. He is a capable man. I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China? With much bloodshed. So, we must face China and all her might alone. And the United Nations? Surely? All? Did you receive the letter? The Sera monks have surrendered? I need to squeeze this brain. The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering. True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings. The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering. I am him. Do you have money? Do I have money? Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die. Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders. I will not go. The people will not allow it. The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult. I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth. A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese. I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns. I had relinquished doubt. My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change. I am scared. Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have. At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war. And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all? Where is that? Has anyone died? What is the size of our army, now? I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem. Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately. And, America? Britain? Can India help us? So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself. What is the danger from the Chinese, now? I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child. What can I do? I am only a boy. Look here! Tell me. What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama? Where is Alsace? Will we ever be in war? Will we be in this war? The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too. Is that big? How big is Tibet's army? Please. Always. I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous. I leave tomorrow. For me, I think such a mix is crucial. I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay. I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation. Do you think I must? You will always! But you will always be here? He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams. Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?" Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa. You decide. What do you think? He does, a little spot where the butter had been. This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born. And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder. We have. I will miss you. Am I running away? You will not come? But, I have no experience. Then, I am lucky. I am still too young. Why is this? What is happening? Tell me! This is Tibet. And this is China. Where is Poland? This is Britain. But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing. The Chinese. Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama. I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside. I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops. I want to go down there. Pretend. Is that true or pretend? Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this. I have more men. And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger. I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men. How could I ever leave? Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people. We cannot. I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now. Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me? You, kill me? Tell me. I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him? What should I do about my doubt, Teacher? If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost. Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now? You are unharmed? Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life. Like my mother. Much too young. No. Does he treat you fairly? Hmm. Did you love your husband, before you married?And a right. Go left. Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that? Way we came. Take the first tunnel to your right... Show that to the station manager. Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten. Track bunnies. Rats. They're usually around. Funny. Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now. Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street... You all watch your step. We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here. You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up. What do you-? The kid... You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires. Think you can handle it? Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator. Third rail is dead. Get me up. There must be a manual override in the booth. How you know that? Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart... "Mistake"? What's that supposed to...? Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh? Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out... Oh, Jesus!! Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to- I only got... All right, motherfucker, that's it. Those things bring juice to the new stations. You just can't rewire that shit... Oh, man, there you go again. Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks. Ain't gonna be much use, though. Lines are dead. Oh, that's gonna work. Did you see the size of that thing?! 20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore. You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude. No, you talkin' at me. Please do. He's a lonely guy. ...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf... Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks... What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore. You don't do that, we're on the wrong track. You... The lights come up, you pull the switch. You better tell me what the hell's going on here! What are you doing down here? My God, what the hell are you...? He can imitate anything, you just watch him. No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it! Across both tracks!! Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!! He didn't do it! It would take a minute or so. You won't last that long out there. Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables... What are you putting that crap on me for?Weird shit...? Yeah...? There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster... Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place? Tell them to send flowers to the usual address. Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it. No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure. You really love flashing that thing, don't you? Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!" Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates... Go!! Just go!! The kid's with them!! Depends. You got a memo? Can we get this car there? Is there a switch? It doesn't matter, all right? It's dead. A mistake. I'm sorry. But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology. Leonard, listen. I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. Look, I'm trying to help you here... You feel anything? Its muscles are locked. Wait a minute- Just do it! For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart? What? You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...? Any luck? You got a better way up? Look what you did! You stupid sonofa- 20 minutes. Susan? We'll be back at the platform in... For Chrissakes. You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me? Excuse me, I'm talking to you. Fine. You want me to call your supervisor? The Department of Public Health... Look, I showed you my badge... We can do it! Talk to me. C'mon... I can. We can do this... You go first. I'll be right below you. Jump in. I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are... Try not to sweat? That's why we should do it now. It worked before... We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us- we Goddam mimic them! What- Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them! It's no use! They know we're in here! How?! So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or... Toss the flare down! Listen to me: we're getting you out. Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing... I know. But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed. Susan, listen to me: you handled that insect almost as much as Siri... No. You said that thing was big as your hand. I don't think I'm going to miss... Susan, we're not b- Oh, no, you were- Fuck 'em. They don't know what they're missing. Great crowd. Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus! Oh, so I'm the bad guy now? You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us? Honey, just leave it. So? Maybe they lied to you. We? Okay. So you lost a great specimen- Thought it was my week for that. Okay, meet me out front. I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight. Don't get kinky here... You know where they get this fertility stuff? They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns. Who know? We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours. Is this a Catholic guilt thing...? Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo? You did! A shame. You looked great tonight.Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her. It's what the maids are for. The place is a mess. You should have someone look after you. Be careful who sees it. What's this? She'll drop you. When she's done with you, she'll drop you. Aye. When are you gonna see it, John? She doesn't give a damn about you. Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know. Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants. And when was the last time she put herself out for you? Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant. She'll get over it. Don't be an idiot! You're in no fit state to go anywhere. You've got three broken ribs, man! What are you doing?! They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth? She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does. You want to be careful. She's got an army of people to get her up and out. John, it's not your problem what she eats. So? Someone'll send it on ahead. You work the system right, you could ask her yourself. Just be thankful you're not working for Household. The Queen never lets them out of her sight. But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy. The good-looking one. There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to. You know what I mean. Come on, man. There's love and there's ... Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving? She's hardly a full hamper herself. It's better than shovelling horse shit. That's pretty good for a ghillie. How about yourself? Seventy a year. So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting? Not down south you don't. You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel. So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.She needs me, Archie. She canna do without me, she said it to my face. How can I stop now? I'm not having some prattler going through my things. I can't move to tidy. I'm all right. I just need to rest up a wee bit. The room ... You don't have to stay. What do you take me for? It's a diary. Get out. Out! She means it. My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter. To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R. Best friend! You know nothing about her! You watch your tongue. Oh, I'm much more than that. I can't let her down now, Archie. She'll be worried about me. I've got my duties to attend to. I'm getting dressed. She'll think it's her fault for keeping me. And she sent no word down? I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway. That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs. I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out. There's no stopping me now. But I'm the only one she trusts. The woman's surrounded by fools! She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning. Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight. Aye, but will they? One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges. It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it? Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys. Aye? Then she's obviously not got enough to do. Which one of us is she flirting with? I'm not sure I do, Archie. What? She loved him. It's only grief makes her like she is. If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones. Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him? Sixty. Not bad, not bad. How much? I think he nearly ruptured his truss. I speak as I find, Archie. I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake. So? Kitchen and lower house. Louder, girl! You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary? Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary? What's your name? Are you all right, Barney? Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow? Good man. And is she all right? Yeah, there's a good girl. Have you had a look at this hoof? She was limping badly. I think there might be a stone in it. It's cold out there tonight, Barney. Hey, Barney. Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion. Whom you address. I said, are you deaf as well as stupid? Are you deaf as well as stupid? She's away to Windsor tomorrow. Talk to her there. She's busy. It's the Queen's decision. Back and upper corridors. You'll talk when I'm finished! What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised! That's a tautology lad. If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally. That's understood. My own. Not now he doesn't. This is my place. I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard. In the event of any disturbance I will ensure -- Nobody has any rights over me. This is a slur on her good name. Don't think I can't persuade her. If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked. It can wait. Anything else? That can wait till the weekend. She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt. If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before. She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early. Is that the Queen's request? Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her. What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?! No. I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse. Awaiting my orders. Do you? I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her. Aye, do. That's not good enough. I need a man who knows where I am. Who'll bring it to me? How will I know what she requires? How will I know? She'll think I betrayed her. She'll never understand it. I promised to protect her from people like you. No loyalty. Too busy looking after themselves. The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it. They don't see it. Her mind is set. She won't change now. So...? Why do you think I keep her here? I said. I serve the Queen. Aye. I do what I do. Why? Maybe, once. What I do, I do for my Queen. I wouldn't know. This is the top. I'm not married. It's nothing. I'm fine. I don't think about it. You sent for me. Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head. Then imagine it's Gladstone. If you hunt, you kill. Dare say you can be taught. Do you hunt? What do you know about the Highlands? What brings you here? Someone has to look after you. It could've been someone. It was before. Because I have to! -- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...! All I've ever thought about is you! For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe! I'm breaking no promises! Have I ever let you down before--? If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do. I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this. I leave for Deeside -- Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign. Ma'am? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am? I'll decide when it's exaggerated. Aye. But there are Fenians reported on the mainland. I ordered it. It's for your own safety. I heard something. Aye. We took a nip of whiskey. Ah, well... They're ready now. Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you. Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you. I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming. That doesn't make him an expert. What does he know about the Highlands? Who by? Are they worth reading? Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich. What? Aye, ma'am. If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two. It's a fine spot, ma'am. And I intend to be there when she's ready. Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Archie. I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters. I'm glad of it. She's well, too. I am. Aye, ma'am. Ma'am.Quite. I'm flattered you think so. A situation? I see. Of course. I take no account of gossip, Your Highness. I don't think I've had that pleasure. Your Royal Highness. What a pleasure to see you here. But others will know that you acted for the greater good. In time, she will. For once in my life, I am not the issue. No love. The greasy pole. They aren't as watchful as you. See what? She trusts you, John. The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense. Ah, but therein lies the paradox. It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents. The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that? However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here. You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism. No other aspiration? But yourself? What about John Brown? For Her Majesty. To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work. Then I envy yo. Was there never ambition? Surely -- The look on their faces when one walks into the room. Still gives one a ridiculous thrill. Oh. Still, someone must attend you. Your wife should not have let you out. You're injured. Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting. Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God. You must miss such magnificent views. I've been called back to London. My last day. I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar. Quite. To shoot perhaps, but not to kill. Occasionally. I am a blank sheet. A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen. It was remiss of me not to come earlier. Oh, several things. You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it? Not at all, Dean. Good of you to spare the time. Yes. No, ma'am. Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself. As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it. In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave. A figurehead. Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful. Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance. As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen. You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens. I was trying to imagine "rather upset." What's her excuse this time? In the press, perhaps. But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year. Time to wheel her out. Mrs Brown. Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help. Where is the old girl? We're going to lose. To know when he'll be king. I hope he got his mother's permission. We'll see which way the wind blows. Gossip counts. Lord Aberdeen was right. This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk. Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close. My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion. The question is, do we need her? The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth. We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you. In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you. I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused. She has always had a very healthy sense of humor. I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty. There are important papers from -- She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires. Yes, it most certainly is! Go inside at once. I thought I made myself perfectly clear. You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it. I beg your pardon? You will await your orders like everyone else. Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement. You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it. You know that very well. Yes. I do. In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf. There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries. No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household. Then we'll have to see what can be arranged. I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you. Her Highness' Equerry. You'll be sent a message. I'm sorry? Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it. The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever. As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five. No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock. You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires. No, indeed. Some young page was boasting about having seen it. Lucky. Quite. I think I'd best take it back. We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary? The Queen wishes to publish an account of him. Not too protracted, I hope. No, she wasn't. A fine choice, sir. Ma'am. Ma'am? They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness. From Princess Helena and other members of your family. I have a letter, ma'am. There is one other matter. Your Majesty -- I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself. I have no idea. Again? We were expecting you to return by six. He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government. Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two. The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend. He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience. Of course, at once. I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.The Princess Louisa is too ill to move. Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity. You're smiling. She's refusing to leave Balmoral. It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction. She's never been less popular. Who? You can't know that for sure. What did he want? I see the Prince of Wales is here. So? Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense-- Well, both. Should we take it seriously?Part of being a New Yorker. I honestly wish I could... What? Well, I'm close to her. I wanted to meet the one that got away. Something like that. You should look like you dressed yourself. ... trouser width, this is all classic. Which means safe, something I'd wear. Well, then, I'll take it up with her. Oh, you're more than okay. Good girl. Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning. Brevity is even more in order than usual. Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him. But there it is, and he has to choose. To belong to someone. Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing. Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it. Tell him you love him. With all your heart. Manicure... Two words. I suppose it's too late to start over. What do you suggest? I give. Elmer's Glue? Ben Gay. Neosporin? Zit cream? Jesus. You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m... Someday she'll thank you. The man you love. Impressive. It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about... And you believe that. You've been working on this, huh? Go figure you. You like her. I noticed. I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons. When I'm talking to children. Chill. We don't want your face coming off with it. I can see why. You have a real philosophy of life. No, he's ruining yours. I have a suggestion... We're about to find out. Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical? Desperate. To talk. Blood oath. I've lost interest. Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring. He's still in love with you. Kindred spirits. The wandering sportswriter. ... weeks. ... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them. Needs salt. Which is everyone you couldn't get in. I've adjusted, and thanks for asking. Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?You don't miss much. I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me. Stay, huh? I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective. Long trip. Pretty nice of you to come. And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker? I should look different. Yeah, it's in the contract. The kiss. May be hard. For you to explain. Because the only fear she really has, is... If you find her... I'm just thinking of how she's hurting. Lost. Alone. Like her life is over. Almost three. I never forgot that. This is where I proposed. I came here, looking for her. The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus. Lower. I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that? ARE YOU CRAZY? You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y... Uh. I saw that moving... Jules, what's wrong... What's up? Nellie Fox. Walter likes the past. And he likes the little guys. ... yeah, that. I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable. Thank God you were here. Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love. I asked you... Well. How come she didn't... This is her family and her fault. She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do? Look, I came down here to face everybody. I didn't want to slink away like some coward... Or we'll go somewhere. If you have the time. I just want to be alone. Is that okay? The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway. She couldn't have lived with it. I know that now. No, it's for the best, it really is. We were so wrong for each other. She denied it. Said I was crazy and paranoid. It's over. I'm just tired. Please put her on? Thanks. Isabelle? I need to talk to Kim... Mike. I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding. But I think you need and deserve to know... The fax is from Ben, too. Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone... This thing means that much to y... Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be? Tomorrow is Sunday. Nobody's doing business. Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there... I forgot how cute you look. When you get impossible. Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow. It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s... Will she like it? Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act. Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard. Takes me back. So we heard it... like, right that... that first... Where did we first hear th... Dance card filled? I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know? You forget you... chose it. I can hardly wait for your wedding. Except for that. And I was thinking this could be our last time. Alone. Together. You know? You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life. It's more than that. I've been thinking a lot the last couple days. About us, actually. Don't you throw up on boat? No. I've got you. Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her. Big weddings are so strange. You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out. Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances! No problem. A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society. Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec... Wow and wow. You have a date, after this? It's weird being the groom. All these things Kimmy has to take care of... Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah? Sure. The rhinos were fucking. You never eat when you're despondent. You're not eating. That would be a girl. I don't even know. I got the point. She would never. Never. Even think of that. What, leaving school... Hey, cabs are expensive. I'm cheap, remember? Till the gas ran out. Firenze. First girl I ever knew. Who lets me give her a bath. She finds him "personable." She admires. Tommy Lasorda. At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it! Every day. She makes the bed. My very point. Here's another one... No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down. How can you trust someone you can never mistrust? She's too genuine. Luckily. The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus. Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability. ... see, that's what I thought at first. How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability. Dance? You don't dance! You learn to dance?? Mirrors. I can't wait for you to meet her! Please come, please. I need you. Well, the Sox are at home. SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt. That's Frank... Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such. But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people... I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you. And she's all wrong for me! You don't understand. I've never felt this way about anybody! I've been calling for days! Fine. I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m... Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"? What a sweet little picture. Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch! And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love. How inconvenient. I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late! Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans! ... and you knew about this. To him. Like family, huh? He never mentioned that. Neither did y... It's not just a gag, huh? Because I could come... I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps...Yeah. She dumped me. Not one bit. Definitely Whitney. I think he's doing Dolly. Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying? I WAS A SORORITY SLUT. My documentary is due on Tuesday. How do you put up with this Greek shit? Yeah, we�re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I�m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It�s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth. Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel? Good question. You took the bait. That�s quick. Go on, untie him. Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise. I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me. I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay? It's under control. Let us decide that. I think it's out of your control. Lemme take you home. About what? I'm sorry honey. I got behind. Sid, you don't have to. I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'? How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard... We had to have financing. Oh yeah. We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It�s been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails? Just for you, Sid. Or it found us. And we didn�t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money�s worth. Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing�s been done. Hope you�re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you. We�re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned. The way I see it. We�ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II. Until now. You�d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It�s a whole world, Sid. You�re really popular amongst the demented. I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line... I find his work overwrought. I really don�t like that comparison, honey. Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life? Need some help, honey. Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless? What guy? You weren't supposed to leave her alone. Where's Sid? And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit. Two.That doesn't work, sir. What now? Can't we hold him? How's the name search going? I can do it, Captain. The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction. There's nothing. I'm coming down. No, wait here. He filmed his victims. C'mon. Let's go. Over here. Let's find out. Hallie? The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision. They're roomates. We'd break some furniture. Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am... And it's sexier in the dark. That's not the way it's done. A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that? You broke my heart. Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked. Meaning? Not good. I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled. I know that. I think you're all an act. You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate. So what made you change your mind about Sidney? No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do. How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation? Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience." No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be. Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself. Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock. Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears. I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me. Miss Weathers. Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay. Humor me, Sid. The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe. Just in case... Don't worry... Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you. As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy. They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie. They thought it was a publicity stunt.And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac... I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one. Mac, you really earned your wings this flight. On channel 10? Well you did the right thing Mac. Were you going to give it to them? And what are they doing now, Mac? You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac? Oh he did, did he? Weren't you down in the dining room? Where the hell did you come from? All too well, captain. It's a little late for you to be up. Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich. Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery. Idiot... I told you not to try anything smart! I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order! And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it? Sure you do. Sending Mac out on a little recon work. How pathetic. Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses. Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor? Taylor, you surprise me. That was a joke Taylor, lighten up! Why don't you just hold them up to the lens. I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you. Well, preferably in tens and twenties... Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco. Please proceed. Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed. Thank God for deregulation huh? I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor. You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one. Ok, I will. The bad news is the ship is history. Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe. Now do you want the good news first or the bad news? Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency! I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture. Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't. The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there? Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking. You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine. That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor. Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here. I can hardly wait. No. I'm all set. Thanks. I think I can handle it. Uh... Nah, I already ate. Why don't you just go down there? Thank you. You gotta think of your old age. It's steady, good benefits. Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work. I don't know. Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended. Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat - Trust me. Even checked 'em with my own eyes. Why don't you reset and run it again. The pods check out ok. There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands? No, I just ran it! Why are you running it again? Well I guess there's no time like the present. I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests. Over and out! Good. Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me. Is that clear? Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod! You're just gonna have to pick me up later. Let's get something straight, Chappy! I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson! Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now. I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers! This ship is going down in a blaze of glory! The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson! Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control. I know, I know. Oh you'll get it, believe me. So I'll see you in a few. I don't know. I really haven't made up my mind yet. We'll see how nicely they behave. Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember? Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there. Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon. That's me.Sheesh! Aye aye cap'n! That's clear. This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it! Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions! Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation? Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?! You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes! Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for? Damage control! What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes! So, what are we waiting for? It's time we lock coordinates. 10-4 good buddy. Well that's your call. Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me. Just as long as I get my cut. Will do. What about the distress signal? Well don't drag your ass. There won't be much of a window for us to link up. We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours. Break it down to me, what's going on? Barnes?Good help is hard to find... Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway! Why do you want to kill more innocent people! Why! Look we gave you what you asked for. It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us! I don't know what you're talking about! Mac, can you hear me? Come in? Will you transmit the distress signal? We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them? It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel! Then we've got to get to the lifepods! You better start making sense! What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 - Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline. Override the airlock sensors and hurry! We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods! What is the condition of the bridge? Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right? If anyone can hear me please respond! Bridge! Can anyone hear me?! Well, maybe I'll surprise you. Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything? What, and leave you here all by your lonesome? Man, I'm hungry. I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?. That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes. You want to go back to shuttle work? Why, didn't they say? So, are you on for the next one? Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass. All right, I'll give it a shot. You're certain of that? Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands. It's telling me fail mode confirmed. Did you see this? Well it's a good thing that I did. Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much. I don't know. Wave to them! Try not to think about it. Good. In that case, I pronounce us man and wife. It would matter to us. That's right. Will you marry me? Will you marry me? It did. It is. There's nothing we can do about that. And so far. What do you mean? What happened! What the hell are you doing? Over and out. Hopefully sooner than later. I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry. Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic. Hurry. You have to get them out of there! He's out of the equation. Talk to me. I'm in the bridge. Dawn. Come in. I will once I get past the bulkhead. Good luck. I can't! Don't worry about me. There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal. I'm going to try and buy you some time. I can get to the bridge from here. There's only room on that pod for seven. That's you and the others. I'm counting on you to get them out of there. I'm not going with you. A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right? No... Take this flare. That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket. A schematic of the ship. Looking for a lifeline to the pods. The room is filled with poison gas. The hydraulic system must have blown. It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us. Dawn! Dawn! Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening. You'll live longer. Do you want some advice? Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature. Yeah? One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us. Take this out of the equation right now... Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit. You're ready for the real thing? So we did. Are you ready? I don't know what we're facing. Simulated space walking. I can't let you do that. Everyone just stay put. If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal. Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through. Close every door behind you! You're right. And suppose you couldn't hold out? I don't know the condition of the compartments. Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake. Damn it. If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something - Great. Seen one like it before? With what? How am I going to interface with it? I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me. It depends on the condition of the ship. If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry. I don't think you know what you're talking about. Besides, what could we use for tools? A steak knife? A corkscrew? Probably come through the wall I suppose. Fat chance of that. Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge. That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch. We don't. I don't know. Really? I'm sure you'll be all right. Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening. It's usually the moon walks. Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher. Well, let me put it this way. Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless. Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime? This is my second commercial flight. I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast. Ryan Taylor, first mate. Welcome aboard. First time in space? Oh right, right you're on that research grant. Is it safe for human transport? How is it looking, Mac? Ok Mac... I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back. Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level? Can they be accessed? But the corridor outside this door is open, correct? Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck? I know but we're in a bind. Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something. I need you to actually do something for me. I need to access your CPU, directly. Right, I understand that... Yes I know all that. Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem. Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor - Mac. What's shaking?You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers ! Yes, sir ! Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers. We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot... Jeez, we musta killed a million already...! No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material. Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster. Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires... I didn't see him ! Mobile Infantery rules ! No, this hurts. I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together. You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around. Whad'ya talkin about ? Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out. Our love will grow, dear, year by year... Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead. You rich kids... are all the same ! What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ? Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me ! You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get... I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ? Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain. You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths. Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P. Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability... Please continue, Sergeant. I got Games & Theory. Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention. If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance. Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ? Your father will never let you. Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ? I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it. Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know. Don't think about it... go on instinct. You got it bad. Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss. Others are waiting. You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.Looks like rain. Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son. Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can. ...CUT OFF ! Teenagers ! A year at Harvard and you'll see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives. Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean. Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ? I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation ! You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer... Sorry. Carl's a fine boy... A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ? Oh, is that how it is ? Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it. Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station ! Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life. This came for you today. I presume on your request.Saddle up, Roughnecks ! Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way... Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet... We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know. We're the old men, Ace. Not enough, I guess. What about it, Diz ? He was our teacher... He was great. Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...? Death to all bugs ! YAAAAAAAA ! What do I want with a scar ? I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool. It's what I deserve. Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys ! Well, maybe you better look again. Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job. It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...! Something... I've got...you don't. What an honor... Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir. Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir. Sir... I guess I do, sir. Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir. Sir, no, sir. Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir. You always told me you couldn't do human... I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better. The Roughnecks are always ready, sir. Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for. Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ? Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death. I don't believe it ! All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not. Eight point... no, uh, seven... I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know. I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe. Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ? How do you make him do that ? In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts. Ace of spades. Yeah, but I want Carmen. Did you read her mind ? What's the hurry ? Up. We gotta be near A Company by now. We've gotta go get her ! See you on the bounce ! How are you, Carl ? I like it. It's kinda...you. What happened to your eye ? That was just a mix up. We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit. I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch. Should I be ? I try just to be happy I'm still alive. It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ? What happened to your hair ? Shhhh...! Do you mean it ? Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size. I love you. I'm gonna miss you. He left this morning. He couldn't say where. Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ? You're late. I'll go for that. Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo ! Did you get Starside R&D ? He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't... Naw, I made it, Carl made it. I love you, Carmen. Who cares ? I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service. I don't even know if you're my girl. I can't help it. You two have so much in common. What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot. Yeah, sure, I guess. None at all... We won. Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak. Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet. It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't... Isn't it great to be in love ? Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ? What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager ! Carl can wait. Why not ? It's all I think about anymore. Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ? Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math. 35% on the math final ! No one could be that dumb with numbers. Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal... Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug. I have good reflexes. Who ? Good for you. No, you're gonna be alright, Diz ! All bands. Diz, see what you can do. They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy. Hey, Diz... I said no. Want me to pull rank ? Nah, I don't do that anymore... I'm gonna need a squad leader. What's that, Diz ? Well, see ya. Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it. I don't stay where I'm not wanted. Cover me. What ? Man, they're defended... no way in. You saying you didn't ? You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along. No thanks, Diz. You're the best. Uh, look, Diz... Can't we just be friends, Diz ? Well, anyone who gets you is lucky. You still gonna play for Brazil ? Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen... Just throw me the ball, Diz. What ? A lot can happen in three minutes. It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home. I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it. I won't quit ! Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school ! Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there. I'm eighteen. It's my decision. No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really. Mr. Rasczak. It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years. A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service... Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared. He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile. I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach. I wouldn't mind. Seeing as how we're about all that's left of 1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement. You top kick ? Sir, yes it is, sir. Sir, yes, sir ! Sir, thank you, sir ! I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir. Courage, I guess. No, sir. Here in Buenos Aires. I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid... Hi, mom. Well, yeah, sure... Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now ! I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am ! Uh, no. Aw, don't get mushy. Don't be a hero... Alright, we're gonna carry you... How bad are you, pal ? Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole ! Can you walk ? Move out. Yeah, that's right. I'm gonna save Carmen. We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy. What's your problem now, Lieutenant ? Saddle up, boys, that's our trash ! You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down - You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant ! This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission. Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers. You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ? I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ? Don't get any ideas. She's my girl. Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy ! Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission ! SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now ! Give'em hell, sir ! We're not leaving you here, sir ! Hit your jets, sir ! Cover us, Ace ! Yes, sir ! What's going on, Diz ? Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir ! Yes, sir... Yes, sir. All dead except one, sir. Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team. Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ? I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen. I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year. Mister Rasczak ? Uh, I don't know. The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ? Keep trying, Sergeant. They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ? Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower ! We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ? My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap- Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed... I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P. This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant. Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time... I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat... AAAAAAAAAAAA ! Sergeant, secure the boat ! Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ? What's that look like to you, Rico ? Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval. Who's that with you ? Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics. Never pass up a good thing, eh ? Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ? Kill the bitch. I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better. Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ? Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico. Good for you. Go find out. Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something. What is it, Rico ? Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass. The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?Just giving you something to remember me by, baby. It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you... I do. How do you feel about him now ? That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ? Where are you going ? You're upset, that's alright. I'm sorry, Carmen. Carmen...? Hey, bugs don't take prisoners. I'm not kidding. Marriage is - Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it. So ? If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ? I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen. Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here. Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude. Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ? THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG ! Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle. She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together. Well, whad'ya know... You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said... Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ? Profile's wrong... there. Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with. They revoke our flight status. Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed. This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet. Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other... Only when I give you an order. I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate. Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ? I'm all ears. I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow. So what are you doing later ? I'm getting better. That's it, we're empty ma'am ! Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed... Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one... This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here... Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke. Been better, buddy. Not a problem. Let's go. That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico. What do you think you're doing ? Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here- The Rodger Young just burned up... Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...! I'll take the first group. This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ? On whose authority, Corporal ? You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ? Best in the Fleet ! You can never be sure.Why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me this? I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn't deal Case? Leave us alone, Stephens. Leave the people of this town alone. You can't help. Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now? Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month. Because that's what I'm about to do. Not unless you can raise the dead. No you don't. Mister, I don't want to know your name. Goodnight, Nicole. I'm not sure. And she really liked you. She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or... Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity. Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it. Why? Yeah. I'll be back around nine. They just finished supper. Hi, Nicole. Say hello for me. How is Nicole? Is she around? The children. I used to like it here. I used to care about what happened. Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away. Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary. Because I saw it. I saw it happen... I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids. That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other. This was a community. Why? You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board. We all did. We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards. We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad. The rescue squad. Because they didn't act fast enough. That's wrong, Sam. You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years. This is never going to go away... If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing. But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam. Force me to testify in court. He came by the garage this afternoon. Gave me this piece of paper. I've tried to stay out of it. But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam. You've gone and got yourself this lawyer. Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos. Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it. Why not? How? It does concern me. Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth. It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing. You think that caused the accident, Risa? That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer. Or maybe they're the same thing. Yes. Well I don't. Why? You believe that? Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it. I stopped by the station a while ago. I stared at the bus. I could almost hear the kids inside. There was a lawyer there. He told me he'd gotten you signed up. Is that true? Good night. I better get back. Sure. Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them. Behind the bus. It's natural. That's because he misses you. What are you thinking? What time's he coming home? Does this mean I can't take a shower? A while. She said she's got to be home by nine. Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight. She'll be there around six.I'll tell her that. I will. Alison. Mitchell. It was nice to see you again, Ally. Nothing. We made it to the hospital. I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to. But I was prepared to go all the way. I didn't know. I was in a panic. I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell. Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital. I finally got a doctor on the line. He sounded young, but cool. He was confident, but there was a nervousness. He have been an intern. This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this. He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was. I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing. It was laboured. I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen. I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face. I'm...so sorry. It turns to steaming piss. Yes. Do you find there's something strange about this meat? That's where I'm going. To see her. She didn't. Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units... Sunnyridge. That was a long time Which clinic? Which one? Are you still in touch? Yes...fine. We're...not together. Ally Jones. And what does he do again? I'm just fine, Ally. What about you? Ally. That's right. Yes. Alison Jones. I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel... That's my daughter. Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead. She's a drug addict. I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel. That's my daughter. Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead. She's a drug addict. The Walkers have agreed. The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents. It's important to initiate proceedings right away. Things get covered up. People lie. That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight. You can help each other. Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group. No, Mr. Ansel. I wouldn't sue you. I can help you. I understand. My name is... Why would he be frightened? That's what he said, is it? There might have been a word or two that slipped by. Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure. Yes. Excuse me? It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event. Mrs. Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect. I did. Yes. He does. Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years. That would complicate things. What's that, Dolores? Did they give him special care? Did his parents attend to that? You mentioned that he had a learning disability. Were his parents...attentive to him? And what's that? Berry-picking. Berries. You talked about it? Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures...run-ins with the law... From what? For rabbits? And they loved Bear. Do they have any reputation for drugs? Yes. What do you mean by 'hippies'? What do you mean by that, Dolores? I'll...take it straight. No. A little sugar though. How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto? How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning? A cup of tea would be nice. Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto? I want to talk to you. Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question. So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that? Yes. Dolores...and even your mom and dad. But I'll make sure you go last. I'm absolutely positive. There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this. I don't want you to lie. They work for the people we're trying to sue. Their job is to try to minimize damages. Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs. No good guys or bad guys. Just our side and their side. It would be strange if you didn't feel that way. That you didn't die? Like the other children? You hate that. I have no questions. Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'. Note my objection. She said, 'As I'm talking.' I object to that form of question. Note that. I object to the form of that question. Note that. Have they ever been busted? Crafts? What do they do? That's good. Judges like adopted Indian boys. Tell me more about the Ottos. Indian? Tell me about the Ottos. That's great, Wendell. That's the sort of thing I need to know. So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on. People who will help our cause. That's the local bar? When? What about Doreen? Hard to say. I might have...some business here. Do you have a room? Here we go. Is this it? How old is she? You always think you're prepared for these things. Need a hand? I love you, Zoe. I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you. No matter what happens. I'll take care of you. Yes. I can hear you breathing too. Of...course I do. I just thought...I could get you another Do you have the blood test? What for? What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want. Yes. Yes. That's not news, Zoe. Tell me your news, Zoe. Yes. Give me your news, Zoe. News? Yes. Yes, I'll accept the charges. I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act... Yes. The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now. Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe. Why are you calling me, Zoe? I'm in a car wash. Well, let's see what we get. If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp... Is there shrimp on it? What is it? I'm afraid this meat is overdone. If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount. If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing. It's a standard agreement. No. Listen to me, Mrs Otto. Listen very carefully. I do know what's best. Excuse me? Mrs. Otto, there is no such thing as an accident. The word doesn't mean anything to me. As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner. Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement. They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference. That's what's done, Mrs. Otto. I've seen it happen so many times before. It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years. Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal. A few million at the very most. The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus. You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto? That's why I'm here. To give your anger a voice. To be your It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger. Not their grief. Yes. The Walkers spoke very highly of you. Please. Please, let me explain. I'll only take a moment of your time. I'm a lawyer. I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand. I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk. How does the family survive? Any criminal record? In what way? No.I'm sorry. It's not enough. For hospital bills. For Nicole. No, Billy. We can't drop the lawsuit. You know how much we need the money. C'mon, you know that won't... That won't happen, Billy. Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys. The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus. I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time. That'll be the end of it. So? I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers. Okay, fine. So...stay out of it. Because it's what we have to do. Well, it being so depressing and all. But it's reality. You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea. Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits. We're hardly unique here, Billy. I mean, I can understand how you feel. I don't see how that concerns you, Billy. So what brings you out tonight? Hey, Billy! What brings you out on a night like this? C'mon in. Take a load off. Is he coming over now? Right away? Was he drinking? Could you tell? Did he say what about? There's talk of that. It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off. I don't know. Okay. Yes. Well, okay. I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning. That's okay with you? What do you mean? You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess. Hard to talk to. Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I'd take you over. Are you sleeping? Nothing good on your T.V.? What are you up to, Nicole? Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families. The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more. Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence. He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man. Partly. But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover. That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer. To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest. You're going to need special care for a long time to come. It's not going to be easy. Not for you, not for any of us. Because we love you so much. And it's going to cost money. More than we can imagine. It's because of the accident, Nicole. Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers. A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included. Well, yes. He's your lawyer too. He's a lawyer. He's our lawyer. Oh. I better get some spackle. Sure. I'll fix it right away. And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see. Do you like the colour? Pretty slick, eh? How do you like it, Nicole? Don't even try to remember. Does it fit? What's that? What took so long? What's so funny? I am. Really. It was awesome. Of course. You're going to blow everyone away. That was great.Thank you, Nicole. And what was the weather like at this time? Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior? Was the bus on time? What do you remember about the accident? You remember this? There wasn't time? Why not? Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll? You saw the speedometer? You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time? Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this? How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection? You could see the speedometer? Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole? Why were you scared? This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking? Why were you scared? Yes. I will offer that report. Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you observed at that time? You are? You remember that much? Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up? And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning? And where did you sit that morning? Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning? Was anyone waiting for the bus with you? What time in the morning was this? Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?Oh God, I'm scared. I can hear you breathing, Daddy. You don't believe me? You don't fucking believe me? You can't ask me that! Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money. I need money. Welcome to hard times, Daddy. I tested positive. Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register? No. But this is. They wouldn't take my blood. Okay. I went to sell blood yesterday. That's how it is. I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood. You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you? You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer. Don't you want to hear? I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy. Some big news. Daddy? Why can't you talk to me? DADDY!!! 'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm? Is that what you're thinking, Daddy? So what's the problem? Why am I calling you? You're my father. I'm not supposed to call you? What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy? Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window? How old was I, Daddy? Five or six? I got absolutely soaked, remember? A car wash! Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash. Make sure you've got the windows closed."Whereas once I was blind, now I can see." Night, Nick. Best of luck. You want to know what it is? What it's all about? John. Chapter nine. Verse twenty-five. Hm? No, about a year ago. I was working out of Los Angeles. Did you? Kudos.Yeah, yeah. She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane. Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that. Yeah. This... ? Oh, this is just... this is the bill. Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors. They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks. Pop-gun. I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ? Because you hate me. Because you had to be here, when mom died. Because you had to do it alone. Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too. I'd have been here... You're behind this, aren't you? You and your sick friends. Well, make it stop! No! You're one of them. Of course, it makes perfect sense! You're part of it... No. Do you? Can't be too hard, can it? I don't think we should be here out in the open like this. Really? Okay... okay. How do you know? It's them. They did this. You think I know? I paid them more to make it stop. Everything. I'm a goddamn human-pinata... It doesn't stop, Nick. I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again. They won't leave me alone... They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you. And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the real fucking begins. You dodged a bullet. C.R.S. Who do you think? Jesus H., thank your lucky charms. To think what I almost got you into. They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that. Shhhhhhh. Wait... wait... Just drive, man. It's fucking nuts! I know... Do it for YOU. It doesn't matter... I thought you'd like this. Best thing I ever did. If you don't want to do it, DON'T... Why would you say that? But, will you? Will you? Tell me you'll call. Call them. Trust me. It's a profound life experience. You've heard of it. You've seen other people having it. They're an entertainment service, but more than that. They make your life fun. Their only guarantee is you will not be bored. Trust me. Call that number. Call that number. For you. I don't need anything from you. I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday. So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order. No. Yeah. Nowhere in particular. Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore? Too bad, I liked her. So, you're all alone in the House of Pain? Elizabeth? How long's it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you? So do you. And to think I was worried... Not after I'm done with it. Actually, I've been here. In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'. They gave me a free jacket at the door. That's why it's a classic. Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ? Happy Birthday, man. Hey there, Nickie.Like, this way... sort of... It was a different floor then... I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone. You don't need me... What are you gonna do anyway? You won't get your money back. What whistle? There's no fucking whistle. This is fucking dangerous. No, I can't. I'm sorry and all, but... They own the whole building. They just move from floor to floor. Goddamnit, why do they do that? Nobody knows, pal. Nobody gets the big picture... Jason, Tommy, cut it out! Look, it was just a job. Nothing personal, ya know? I play my part, improvise a little. That's what I'm good at. Hey, everyone -- snack time! Here... here you go... That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist. It's never happened. We've never had an unsatisfied customer. One guarantee. Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction. It's all down to this... Sorry to keep you waiting. Cursory examination. Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing. You'll be out of here in no time. An hour for those... maybe another for the physical. First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing. Second, you don't have to decide today. Take the silly tests, fill out the forms. One day, the game begins. You either love it or hate it. Decide then. We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation. That was my sales pitch. May I make two suggestions... ? We provide whatever's lacking. It's different every time. Tailored specifically to each participant. Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you. Oh... it's a game. We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs... I don't write the questions. I just review them. You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T. For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like. We'll run a T.R.W.... Your brother was a client with our London branch. We do a sort of informal scoring. His numbers were outstanding. Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown... V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N... A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting... Oh, here we go... Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.Didn't I give you two? Hm? Show Mr. Van Orton to his room. Ah, Mr. Van Orton. Here you go...No. This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland. I thought you two should meet. You could. But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel. Remember Daniel Grant? Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?" He's gone sailing, Alan. He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are. I'll be done in a minute. You misspoke before. You're not "stepping down." I'm taking you out at the knees. The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore. I'm firing you. Action's taken. Confidence restored. Stock goes up. I sell my shares. It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father. Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship? Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away? What? You're talking tomorrow. Today is what counts. It probably will. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time. Why should I settle for that? My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions. But, the expectation was ten. And, in this case, expectation is everything. Admittedly... You promised you'd meet projections, Alan. A dollar sixty per share you said. So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit. I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years... I've heard good things about their London branch. You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense. Did you play recently? I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street. Underwear? Boyfriend? Single? Studied acting, I assume? Big family... small? Like... where are you from? I realize. Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself. What about dinner sometime, when you get back? Would that be... ? Where are you going in such a hurry? Claire. Pleased to meet you. I didn't know what else to call you. Hi. Didn't get a chance to say goodbye. No! Don't move, you bitch... ! Stop it! No... That's not true... No! You take another step, I'll shoot! They're trying to kill me... Shut up! Stop talking... Stop talking to them! I saw them kill him! Bullshit. They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him... Fuck you. What are you doing? Guess you missed it. It's mine... What the fuck are you... ? ... what... ? They will! You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you! Call them, tell them to get the boss up here. Tell them I'll kill you... You call them... Who's responsible?! You tell me... I want to know who's behind this. Who did this to me... how, why... ? Get us out! Get us out of here... I'm back from the dead. What... what do you mean? What do you mean? I checked them myself. I made the calls... What do we do? Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me. Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million. You ruined people's lives. Scams, con games. How many? How many times have you done this? I'm interested. It might be best if we didn't talk. Who the fuck cares? I didn't say anything. Overseas operator? Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich. What are you talking about... ? How? How could they have gotten anything? That's a lie... Then, what good are you? Who are "they?" You can talk while I drive us to the police. Get out of my car! Get out. What is this!? No! I'm sick of this... Wha... ? Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me. Take the picture out. You? I'm tired. I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance. Do you mind if I sit? I thought... Well... the red bra. It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine. You're saying it's not you? Is this you? Come here... Can we talk? Seriously? What did they say? Keep it. Goodnight, Christy. It was nice meeting you. The maitre d' called you Christine. Goodnight. I know the owner of Campton Place. I could talk to him in the morning. I don't spend much time looking out the window. I'll call you a taxi. A fresh shirt... Hm? Oh, yes. Investment banking. Moving money from place to place. That tall, bright building. Near there. I think not. Why... ? Nicholas. Nicholas Van Orton. That one did. There goes a thousand dollars. You're the one who started running. You deserted me. Yes... well... Don't panic. When security gets here, we simply explain what happened... Consumer Recreation Services. It's their building. They... This is C.R.S. It's not like anyone could actually open it. There's a ladder here. Oh. FIne. Please... It's much easier this way. Come on, step up... This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there? I'll give you a boost. "... wait for help." Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to. Read what it says: "Warning, do not attempt to open. If elevator stops, use emergency... " Don't even think about it. Long story. I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin. It was a gift... from my brother. How do you know that's the way? Where are you going? I don't understand why they're getting you involved. I'm sorry, about this... The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away... It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks. Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself. I was trying to tell you... it's a game. You've got to be kidding. Hold on... They want your driver's license number. Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner. I get a note... This is nuts. Alright... okay... This can't be real... Oh, God... ! I don't think he's breathing. I don't know... he fell. Excuse me, I need to explain... I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this? I'm not sure how this works. Do you have something for me... ? I got this note... Pardon me... Miss... ? Terrific. I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill. Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water. A bad month. You did the exact same thing to me last week. Please, don't do that... Did she? Where's Christine? The waitress. Split it? Really? What? You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean... Stop it! Stop this. It's not true... Listen to yourself. Why would I do anything like what you're describing? No, it doesn't! Those keys were put there. I didn't even know... What? Connie... How did those... ? Do you know how to change a tire? The phone's dead. We're going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself. It's a flat tire. That's all. Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid? What have they been doing to you? Slow down, take a breath... How do you mean, exactly? Yeah, almost... Who? What are you doing? What's this all about, Connie? Tell me where we're going. Okay, okay... okay? I just... you know I hate surprises. I'm going to call. I'll call them, okay? Are you still on mediction? I said I would... Okay. Like a stroke? This isn't an escort service? Fun? Why? "Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs? You shouldn't have. Really? You need anything? Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright? I redecorated. What about you? Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito. Never better. About me? You look good. Which grad-school? They'll be wanting it back. "Seymour Butts." I never get tired of that one. Conrad, what a surprise. Gesundheit. Yes, very lucky. Yes. I don't speak Spanish. All I need is to get back... just enough for that. Yes. What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran. Two men, a few blocks away. They took my wallet, money... all of it. So... Well, where to begin. It's complicated... I'll call. I really will. You're going? Well, thanks again. Good to see you, Rachel... Thanks for coming, Mel. I'll get your car back. Right now it's, uh... at the zoo. Sorry. I'll explain someday. It's just a t.v. He's just an actor. It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends. If I could have you back in my life... in some small way. It would be important. The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time. I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me. I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it. For shutting you out, for not being there. I... Anyway, I hope you can forgive me. I know, look at me, well... What happened? I don't know. I don't even really know. I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while. I need your car, Elizabeth. Guess! Where'd you pick up your checks? Where? Shut up. Cuff him to the rail. I don't want money. I'm pulling back the curtain. I'm here to meet the wizard. Drive in. Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle. They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in. How do I find them? Their offices are empty. I'm tired of dealing with peons. I need to get to whoever's in charge. Get rid of them. You mean, dis satisfied. You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay? Don't worry. It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team". Physical? How long will these take? Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing? And if nothing's lacking? Humor me with specifics. What kind of vacation? A game? No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling? What's all this for? No, thank you. What is? I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother... First they try to kill me, now you? Put your damn clothes back on. Don't take another step. I can't tell you how not interested I am. You know, these fit... perfectly. I need the police. No, you didn't... Is there a room key? The key? Have we met? Goodnight. Where was she? Did you worry about him? I'm just like him. Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me. Was he morose, or...? I mean... He came to my mind recently, that's all. I'm not sure. There's been a break in. Lock this door and stay here. Don't move a muscle. Did the alarm go off? The house... they... you didn't see... ? Ilsa... you're alright? No, thank you. Goodnight. Fine. Okay. I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult. Thank you. Goodnight. Thank you. Look, where is he?! His behavior... ? Where's my brother? What's this about? Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you. What's the trouble? Cancel lunch. Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts. "Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts. What gentleman, Maria? What? I don't like her. I know who she is. Take a message. Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it. Let me think... Hordes of men in tuxedos. Everyone's droning. Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick... The Hinchberger wedding. No. The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser. No. Nice touch. Does the game use real bullets... ? Is Alan Baer "the Game?" Is that what this is? Why are you following me? You warm my heart. Attempted murder. He hasn't called back. Sam... Thank you. It's what they do. It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of... Depraved children. Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink? Just what I told you. Find out about a company called C.R.S. Consumer Recreation Services. Someone's playing hardball. It's complicated. Can I ask a favor? It was a misunderstanding. That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable. I am now your enemy. Follow me. Don't ask. I wasn't expecting you. Nothing. Nothing at all.Hey... ! Friend... why don't you back off. Look... what I'm doing is none of your business... I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just driving... What the fuck... ?!There's some kind of animal loose in the museum. Pendergast's alone. He needs help. I want volunteers to go with me. Great. No. It better be good. I have to help Pendergast. Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me. The rest of you can go with Cuthbert! Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move. Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours -- I'll go down and speak to him. I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast. I think you should call it off. We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you. It's a little late, you son of a bitch. There's a friggin' monster loose in here! Get the FBI, the fire department. Find metal cutters, cut through. And bring a cannon. The damn thing is huge. Where the hell are you? Ippolito! Get back here! You said the system couldn't fail! What doors? That would leave one exit for hundreds of people. You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books. We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells. One more question. I see a big hole. If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails? That's great if you're stopping a burglar. Not our goal here. Are there motion detectors? The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito. Why don't you just tell me how this space station works. The sub-basement, huh? Great idea. Everybody. Get behind me. I smell it. It's here. The sub-basement? Pendergast! Help! It's right behind us! I think I should come with you. How big is the sub-basement? You've been holding out on me Pendergast. You have a suspect capable of this? I don't like animals. Never have. Dog bit me when I was little. After that I gave up on pets. Animals are irrational. Give me a psychotic killer any day. If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain. My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo. It was late August. Over ninety. The polar bear was inside his cave. Kids didn't know he was in there. All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear. By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces. The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming -- Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain? What happened to them? Oh. You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger? They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice touch. I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework". You're kidding. So the method of death is the only connection? Who didn't? Big news. Out of Brazil, wasn't it? Call me Vince. Then you won't like this one. It's a piece of shit. I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind? Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast. I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down. Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man. Been tossing his cookies for over an hour. Not a likely suspect. Careful. That mess on the ground is brains. We need light in here, stat. What's left of it. Vince D'Agosta. Am I out? Who are you? The undertaker? Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed? Pardon my French, but bull shit. Look. It's some kind of letter. This place is a maze. I'd say we're in its home. What's that doing here? What does it say? All right everybody, hold up! Not so loud. All right. Kawakita, cover the rear. How much ammo do we have to make a stand? I know. There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out. Got my hands full here. What is it?The virus itself might have positive applications. They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made. Greg isn't joining us? This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof! Did you hear that? My God. He says that Mbwun is real! May I see that? I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone. Look who's here, Margo. Remember, it has poor eyesight. It hunts with its sense of smell. So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes! Come back and get me. I'm coming with you. We can't. We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe. I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do. The building must be swarming with police by now. It won't take long for them to get through the doors. It's one of the fire doors. Good Lord, Margo. We're trapped! Don't stop now. Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a flashlight? It's like ringing the dinner bell. Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine. So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night. Quadrupedal! The other name for Mbwun. "He Who Walks on All Fours." That's not so unusual. Many plants carry viruses. Like the burls on Maple trees. Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched. Like the claw. They're eggs. Margo, these aren't seed pods. You're right. I'm not sure. As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant. Let me see the plant press. I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked. If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here. Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success. The museum is in debt. Contributions and public funding have dried up. Admissions no longer cover overhead. The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit. Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red. If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems. Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years. That's quite enough. This isn't a death sentence. Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. I'll garden. I'll write. You must. Come on. I'll walk you back to the elevator. Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art. With all due respect, dear, that's bull. You dance rings around me with your new technology. You've left me in the dust. Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed -- No, Margo. This is one problem you can't solve. You have to stay out of it. The fact is, I want to retire. Please. Don't humiliate me further. That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news. Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants? Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm. Now Margo, don't overreact. Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow. My leaving makes perfect sense. This isn't exactly early retirement. I've overstayed the party a bit. Yes. Bit of a shock. But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood. And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era -- They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta. What's that? Margo, this is too dangerous. You always think you can solve everything. This time you don't have enough information. The animal might behave in unexpected ways. Leave her here with me. Don't put her in danger. We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate. I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years. Not really. Just the sub-basement. Yes. "Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates. You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days. So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded. We've made an incredible find. I enclose a representation of Mbwun. Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate. I know because I've seen the beast." It's from John. Those two arrows were his insignia. It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions. This means there must be an animal loose in the museum! Something tried to get into this room! Yes. John made quite a study of the whole museum. He had a copy of my original plans. They fill seven floors. We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world. Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens. Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems. Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display. Happy to be useful. It's rare enough these days. According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.I understand. But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down. Yes. If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence. I've read about the Museum's financial troubles. I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches. Nice to see you, Lieutenant. Go out the north exit! There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases. Run! I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out. Vince? There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit. This door's locked. Try shooting the hinges off. We haven't got time. You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight. Apparently it's huge. This isn't an animal, Vince. I've been on this case four months, remember? I've learned a few things. Correct. If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test. No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster. I believed them. How do you explain the part about Beauregard? Unfortunately, no. If you don't mind, this could be important. No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat. Yes. That's my case. Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated. Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board. Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago? Twelve bodies on board. Lieutenant -- Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar. In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things. An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser. Amazing. I have a copy of this in my office at home. Whose footprints? Where's the head? Mind if I have a look? The body? Not at all. I think we may be working on the same case. If so, I could use your help. Special Agent Pendergast. FBI. The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps? Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa. I hope you liked it. We've met. The Hacksaw Murders. '89. Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants? Footsteps! He's right. I don't believe it. You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please? Where is that? Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide? You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum. Read it out loud. I wouldn't be so sure. And failed. These doors are solid steel. Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley? How many storage areas are there? Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock. Keep the animal quiet. Another storage room. Quiet. Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer. Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone. He's right. Follow me. Get back! Now! Stop! Shut them up! Keep the light up. I can't see. Not yet. Let's try the fork to the left. Hard to read in this light. The ink is so faded. I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display. You have to. Do it now! He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot. Call him, Margo. I have to shoot. Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it! I don't believe it. What? We're not going to make the storage room! It's coming. Run. Oh God! Help! It's deceptively simple. Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse. How? For what? Then it won't go after the others? It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean? What happened? It's scared of me. Hide quickly! No. The planetarium is in the next cell. This is one of the fire doors... Vince! That was D'Agosta. You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger. But what can we do? Our guns are useless -- But this isn't the jungle! This is New York. How did it get here? A thing like that crossed two continents. It makes no sense! I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish. Like nothing I ever saw. I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that. No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light. Gone. No. I think I'm hallucinating. We need someone to take us to the secure storage area. Genetic damage? What was it? They're all heavily armed. Dr. Green... All right. If you're positive. Where did you see it? I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up. What happened? All right. I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps. Where would we find it? Would you mind showing it to me? I don't think so. I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun. Did Whittlesley's monster have claws? Something came up in autopsy tonight. Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw. What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one? What happened? A monster? Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for? You were afraid of him, weren't you? I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley. Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times. I also found a record of your restraining order. You were going to be married. You loved him. The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten. Just like Beauregard. One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision. The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact. Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims. Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. That boat washed up in my district. Everyone on board was killed. You have time to talk? Maybe not. No. I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley. How does it work? Special Agent Pendergast. FBI. Forgive me. I guess I was snooping. What is this?I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her. We're too late. I make my own luck. Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance. Come on. We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... ...isn't letting any men in at all. This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her. It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book. She knows. All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late. Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath. It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship. Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. Mind your step. You're precious to me, Rose. What do I tell your mother? Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you -- Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat? Not the better half. Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on. That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back... ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other. Search him. You will never behave like that again! Do you understand? Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting. I had hoped you would come to me last night. It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the -- Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats. Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do? You wanted to see the propellers? An accident?! What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?! He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap. Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money. I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck. I always win, Jack. One way or another. Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning. You're a good liar. Get in... hurry up, it's almost full. There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us. Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come. Just a soupcon of lemon... ...it improves the flavor with champagne. This should be amusing. Good. Settled then. I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?Almost as good as you. I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch. No thanks. I'm heading back. No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much. Can I bum a cigarette? Sure. Count me in. We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy? How you two doin'? Of course not. That's not the point. Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you! Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!! 'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys! Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time... Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. Sorry Fabrizio. Never let go. You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise. Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me. You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me? No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it. Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized... I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything. Right. Get in the boat, Rose. We'll find out. I'll wait here. You have to go for help. So... how did you find out I didn't do it? See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one. That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't! This is horseshit. Right. Now it's worse. It's bad. It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay. Looks okay. I don't see anything. This is crazy. It's okay. I'm alright. Are you nervous? Where to, Miss? Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh! Pretty tough for a valet, this fella. He does landscapes. What is it? A sapphire? Should I be expecting him anytime soon? Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. Hey... Monet! Sssshh. Come here. You're right. Only you can do that. I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out. No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright. Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and -- That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven. Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address. You're not one of them. There's been a mistake. Just move with me. Don't think. You're still my best girl, Cora. Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin. I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it. They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely. Sure. If you like. Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff. Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing. Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece. I'm sorry. Really... I am. You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar. You wouldn'ta jumped. I see you. No, no! Just with her hands. She had beautiful hands. Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off. Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. Just some sketches. Well, I guess I will tonight. It is that simple. So don't marry him. So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella. Is he your boyfriend? That penguin last night, is he one of them? Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead. That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out. You're welcome. Rose. Well, here you are. Jack. That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down. So, you got a name by the way? Uh, yes. Of course. After you. Hello again. I've got you. I won't let go. I'm Jack Dawson. That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship. Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here. Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the -- Ever been to Wisconsin? Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold. I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you. You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand. No you won't. Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.I'd rather die alone. What about the gold? - Instant melt-down. ...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for. Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl? I'm sure they will. Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to - Briefly. ...Words to live by? Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute? ...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites. And still not a thing to watch. So why did you leave? Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives. Sightseeing. I can feel your pain. I wonder if it runs in the family. I see. Sir Elliot. I'm on my way. How did you get this number? We'll see about that. Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours? It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark. You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers. Where can I find him? I appreciate your time - Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver? I'm sorry. I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships. What - no lust for adventure? - We all want what we can't have? Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell? In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera. Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us. Tsi tien, Chien-penny. 4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here. Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue - I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement. ... 17 Beverage cup holders? - Four wheel drive? Do I have to dial '9' to get out? Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English? I'm sorry. It was a national emergency - Q! How are you? I know what I saw - Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone. ...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing: There's no gold down there. Don't you think you're overreacting? Wait a minute - Yes - One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go. Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files? Paris - Shhhhh... What about the uranium? Do you? What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts? Nothing. I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense. Is this another one of your games? I thought your specialty was good-bye. Paris?!? What are you doing here? Political considerations? Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people. If you believe what you read in the papers. Occasionally, yes. British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks. A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this? If you can't do the time, don't do the crime? I see... Does it work on cash machines? Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem? ... Shoelaces? Saunders, I've lit cigarettes - Fishing? How is old Q? It must do something. Come on. I know better than that - Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm? I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur. Sidney Winch, meet - That's reassuring. Wait a minute - I've got it. There! Off the port bow! Who knows? Fog, night... He tied one on. Can you arrange a meeting? I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong? We work in the dark. We do what we can. She married a hockey player. Natalya? Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy. Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank. Where did you get the boat? Something with an engine? Not oars? Let's take a look at the body. That's reassuring. Wade, what the hell are you doing here? Thanks. Take care - No. ... Kids? Married? Depends what number you write. Of course. They point, I shoot. Interesting presentation. And when might that be? And number two? ... Yes? ... Yes??? I didn't say when I want to die - Sleep well? We blast through. If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code. Another reason??? Did I miss something??? Here. You shoot. I'll drive. It's a lousy job, but - The only reason I stay is for the health benefits. Sometimes you just have to - Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist. Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it. Trust me. Up. Cleans dirt. Let's go. Not a lot of difference. ... How did you get into marine salvage? Wait here. The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator. Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down? He's killed closer. Blood or Dutch? Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II. And thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime. Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us. You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car. ... Do you have a gun? Why don't we just take these - Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there. If I were you - - The family jewels? I hope you'll be gentle. I hope so. No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there. You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life... ...But she won't kill us. Nice to run into you again. I'll keep that in mind. Insurance. Lloyds of London. Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity. Pity. Bring him whatever he wants. Boyfriend? Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. And another for you? This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. James Bond. - And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake. I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat. A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air. The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface. It doesn't quite add up. I have an excellent teacher. 'Make sure you wear the uniform'? Sorry I'm late - ...I'll give you a ring from Venice. Hopefully, it won't get that far. .... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism? I understand. ... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway? Of course. ... What's Harmsway done? 'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press. Only what I read in the newspapers. Of course. Minister Johnstone. Yes, M. Tsi tien, Professor Wu. Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese? Remind me. I was just getting to the interesting part! And what do you call these? The Gang of Two? Indeed they are. Deadly little things. ... And what do you call these?Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea. ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies. Chernobyl will look like a campfire. Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor... And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium - My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain. Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward. Good-bye, Mister Bond. ...And what's that, my dear? Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.' ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond? Your choice. Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing. You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK. Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but - You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you. They're merely tools to disseminate information. Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond. Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions: News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers: 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages. Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow? In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but... I turned it into this My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese. His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai... His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper. It was a city of unlimited possibility. I call this the Rogue's gallery. By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond? Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this. The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success. I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur. Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men... Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her. Come. Let's get out of the noise. - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk. Mr. Bond! Nice to see you. Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information. Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes? A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. It's deadlier than uranium. I hope you've enjoyed this little charade. I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond. Darling! Come here. I want you to meet my wife. Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects... Especially one with such distinguished friends. Excellent. Yes - No - Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write - Pencil it in for the next trip - How sweet. No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story. Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later. ...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation! ...I see. - But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond? Obviously, the British government denies all of this - I see you two have met. You come with me - You stay here. A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization. And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock. The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen. Hong Kong, Mr. Bond! Bore through. ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond. They're wrong. Revenge is the best revenge. Start the grinders. Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly. Excellent. Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss. Kill him! Finish it! What the hell is going on? No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan. Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve. - Built to withstand a nuclear blast. Are they alive? I should have hired this man. Get somebody up there! Get more men up there! Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong. Is the helicopter ready? Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane. ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves. You disappoint me, Number Three. ... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account? ...Haven't we already paid him for his services?Now. If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: We're going to have it where I want, and when I want. First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine. Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight. What do you mean, you'd rather die alone? Next time, I do the driving. If not? You insist on calling all the shots. And by the way: I am not a helpless girl. ...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship. Is this - like - a normal day for you? Don't say it. ... We have time for that? Are you listening to me? What now? And don't give me some movie clich� like 'trust me.' Down? What the hell does that do? What do you mean? My father left me the business. No. I'm going with you. This has got to be a mistake. You are seriously deranged. He was my father's best friend! Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle! That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection. What? No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them. Thank you. "Now hear this: Drop dead." - You're not. And what do you call this? Think about mom. Do I have to do everything around here? So charming! So suave! Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies. No? - Shut up! Let's not make it a habit. I see my date is here. And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave. The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance. And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond? So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond? Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London? Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date. No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro. Sidney Winch. Have we met? Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless. Bourbon. Neat. You won't get away with this! No. I was an attorney! I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck. My name is Sidney Winch, and - What's your name? Forget it. No way. I got here first. I am. What do you want? My timing always was lousy. Thank you, Uncle Elliot. He brought that up from the wreck. - I told you! He was there! - What is HE doing here?Where to now, Jimbo? Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat - I got you covered. They'd never sail this close to the shore. I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course? Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred - What happened? Hell. The CIA built that club. Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club. I envy your 'undercover' assignments. Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation. I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife. Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok. Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades. What do you want with the Harbor Master? Step into my office. I don't know if you'd call it a boat... Hey - the world is my office. I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.You know I won't be seeing you. Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. Are you a human being -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around? Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way. Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town. More or less. Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me. Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of. Ain't over yet. Night is part of day; separate, but equal. Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark. Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well. ...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm? Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."... So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy. All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy. Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir. ...And everything is nothing too. Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything. What do you want for free? Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be. Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see. See. Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me. That's where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes. He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him. I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse. He's only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can't take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you? I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you? That's 'cause he's dead. Don't forget to open it for me. I can't be opening my own bottle. Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change? Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst. Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam. Lost them fighting the commies. Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me. I ain't got no eyes. You want to see? What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself? Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that? Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop. Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy? Hey! You there!You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man. Time's up. Any last words of wisdom? You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you. No and I don't plan on sticking around either. Not this twig, friend. I got plans. So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it? You afraid of the dark? Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty. I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time. I got things to do. Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding. I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war? Who's cursed? What? You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man. I think I've heard that before. Maybe I do. That a fact? You sure seen a lot for a blind man. Hell no! What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for? Oh, Jesus. I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick. Christ! All right, old man. Christ. Yeah, sure. You got change? I said I was sorry. Christ no! I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes. I'm sorry, I didn't-- You can't do that yourself? You want something? You want something, old man? I'm leaving. You never have to see me again. Just please, give me the ticket! Give it to me! You idiot! You don't even know what you're fighting over! Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this. I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him? Oh, shit! I wasn't hitting on your girl! Christ, I don't believe this! Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away? Let's see...they're not very imaginative? What? You want to fight? Over her? I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone. Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl. Make time? Is everybody in this town on drugs? I wasn't doing anything. Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it! I'll kill her! You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior. What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with. Come on, Jake -- What are you talking about! Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteen-thousand. Give me two-hundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy. But I need the the money. I've got to have the money. Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today. Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother. It's the truth, Jake. I came for Grace. Wait a minute. Just listen to me... It's not what you think, Jake. That's my gun... That fucking Darrell! No! I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all. And tell her what? Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront? You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know. How do you want it? I'm not your boy. I don't like you. I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience. We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing. I need thirteen. How much could you get? You love her, but you hate her? The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you... You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind. Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money. You meant it. Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her. Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car. I'm not rambling. Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money. You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in. You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars. About what you said this morning. About things. About your wife. I was hoping we could talk. This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right? I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna. Would I what? Like you don't know. Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em. Hey! Wait a second-- I hope so. Listen, McKenna about your wife: If I had known she was married-- Got work. I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him. California... Darrell's a moron. An overheated car. Bobby Cooper. That's a solid name. Yeah, I know. More careful. Accident. Yeah... What the fuck do you want? You broke my nose! Grace, tell him. I swear to you that's all that happened. I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom. Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That's all. Who the hell are you? Get away from me! Will you shut up! What the hell are you talking about? No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you? How old are you? Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you. If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him. You're not going to get much better in this town. I wasn't going to fight for you. I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend. I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you. For what? You're too quick for me. Oz. I've had time to get over it. Cause she's dead. That country shit all sounds the same to me. I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful. What? Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it. All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change? Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys? That's none of your business. Get the keys. I want my car. Open up! And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you? What the fuck did you do to my trunk? Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk. Look, Harlin. No! Okay! Okay! Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car. What reputation? You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick. What sign? I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it! You can't just do unauthorized work. I didn't tell you to replace any gasket. You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty. What? Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll-- That's a good piece of advice, Darrell. You believe that? You've been there? Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit. What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car. You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down. I don't have a goddamn credit card. Listen, man. I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had. It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money. What's that got to do with the radiator hose? That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford? About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone. To replace a goddamn radiator hose!? How much!? What the hell happened to my car? Just banged my head. It was an accident. Nothing. Hey. I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you? I'm very interested in this but is there someplace... Accident. Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already. How much time? Great! Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not? If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else? I know it's busted. What did I just tell you? So? OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted. Look, Harlin, I've got places to be. You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is-- But he's dead. Then why do you call it Harlin's? You own this place? Will he be back soon? Harlin around? You Harlin? No! No police. Soda. You know. Soda. You got any soda? Got any cold soda? He can't help you now, honey! And love's a funny thing. Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you... 'Cause I love you. Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down. I busted my leg! Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace. But we all need that too. Hold him. Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three... Time to go for a walk, Jake. I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared... When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen. You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now? How come the town didn't know you was his daughter? Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again? Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own. I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else. Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds. I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it. You could give me my gun back. No Grace, my hand's bothering me. Why? Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past... Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next? He was a cop , Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop... He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ... You know I thought you'd left me back there. You already have. What the hell? Why not? Where should we go? We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go. I'm not sailing his boat. I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace. We've still got some dead weight to get rid of. I don't know about that? Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed? I can't see it. Good thinking. What's all this? I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell. No! You get it! Grace ... Grace? We don't have to kill him. Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away. It was your idea, remember? I'm doing this for you. I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird. I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want. The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out. I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that. I could if I had Jake's money. I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me. Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you? Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. What about us? I wanted to talk. I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody. If the key's on him, how do we get the key? One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of-a-bitch. In cash ? What do you mean? Where? ...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here. You don't have any money put away, do you? Honey, baby, I can't . I can't even get out of here myself . Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic... Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see. Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world. Yeah. I'm sorry... Yeah. You mean the Shaman? Nothing I understand better than a mess. Try me. Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women. You're becoming the queen of hot and cold. Don't feel like nothing. What's the matter?...Grace? You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here. Walk away. You could leave him. I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned. I'm guessing no. Is that why you're with him? Did you ever? You love him? Doesn't the isolation bother you? Are there snakes out here? Guys like me take those chances. Let's go. Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk... You know what I want. Still playing? I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade. I think I can find my own way back to into town. You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around. I have an idea. Nothing like a little liveliness. Like you. What? The same thing you do. My face tell you all that? Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You must be good. A medicine man? Where'd you learn to do that? What do you do anyway? Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house. Nice place. I guess. I've got an ego same as any man. I didn't say it bothered me. That's good. Cools you right off. I saw you watching me. I pack up and go somewhere else. If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes. Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... . I don't know. I have to make a stop in Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some action there. I guess I've got wander in my blood. All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas. Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take. Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road. I just drove in this morning. Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package? You're welcome, Grace. That's all right. I got it. Wasn't nothing. No trouble at all, really. Accident. No, I've got it. I got it. Jesus. May I carry your package, Grace? I like that about me, beautiful. Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking. I don't know your real name. My name is Bobby. Now I'm not a stranger anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful? That's right on my way. Can I give you a hand, beautiful? Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road. Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks. No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about. Harlin's. Morning, officer. Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here. A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it. Yeah, if you could send it care of... But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh... Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mister... if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know? So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see? The bus depot here has a Western Union thing. And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money. With a shotgun ! She kills both of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive. I mean, what are the odds? No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they both get nailed... get shot by the old lady. Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets robbed ! And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin... I'm sorry. It's just ... you know ... Twenty-seven, fifty. That's all I got. One way. How much? I don't care, just get me there. I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go. Out of here. I need a ticket. Sure, I'll try. I'll fuckin' take it. To go. Genuine Draft? Heineken? Beck's. You got a beer?No. I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business. Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills. And this morning you was broke. You got the money? What the hell ... oh, it's you. Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over. What do you want? We're closed. Come back when the sun comes up. What you want? When I work on a car, I work on a car. Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key. Darrell. What's the matter? The fight gone out of you? I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two. Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, who knows me . Is that an insult? Are you insulting me. The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work? What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket. Then you get in an accident and get killed. Or worse. Who they gonna blame then? They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation. Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you? Didn't you read the sign. Yeah, but it was shot. Yep. For the hose. But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty. It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars. Two-hundred. No charge. You think bad, and bad is what you get. Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out. One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started? Hey there. I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back... You don't look so good. I want my hundred and forty-five dollars. You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want. Didn't you read the sign? It says... ...got no day, got no date. Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this . Now that's too bad. I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off. Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole. You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split. Then you ain't gonna have the car. I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through." Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars. "That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang." Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy. What you expect but fancy damn prices? A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose? Hundred-fifty. Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks. Bottom hose was shot too. Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now. Another accident? You got to be more careful. Don't look like nothing. Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you? Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it. You got to be more careful. Hands is important. Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower. Ninety-two. Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot. Twenty-after-ten. Time. Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time. Yeah, I can fix it. Somewhere else? Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut... Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself? It's your radiator hose. It's busted. Darrell-- Damn. Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither. Then of course the clouds come in... So? 'Cause Harlin used to own it. Yep. Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery. He's up at the Look Out. Nope. Darrell.Two-hundred dollars? You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life. Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon... How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at? You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk. That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon. Shhh! Liar. You came to take my wife from me? ...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000... No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it! I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh? I like Darrell. He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out. Next time you'll do just fine. ...I don't know. Tell her you had to see her. Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman. A young buck like you must be good at that. Then ... maybe shift the conversation. Get her thinking about that jeep of hers. She loves that thing. Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride. Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I know you ... This is what you do: Go to the house to see her. Be quiet, boy. I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be... How the hell should I know? I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! You want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional. If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good. I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere. Don't say that. I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead... Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract. You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you. That's a bit much. Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a maybe. No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want? Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace. And what does that make you? What makes you say that? A man doesn't always mean the things he says. Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off. I don't want anybody dead. You're talking like a madman. Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on. I did? I do. Sweet Grace? What about her? Talk? About what? What can I do for you, lad? How do you know if you've never tried? Would you kill her? Would you? Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can tell you got a temper on you. "You can't shoot 'em!" I like that. I bet she led you on good, didn't she? Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face. I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you. She does at that. I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect? But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her. What are you to do, eh? Women. That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body. Don't be offended, lad. A man who's got no ethics is a free man. I envy that. Beside, how can I blame you? That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh? Ah, I can smell it on you. It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it? Not a wit. Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples. You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile. Live there? Oh? Darrell taking good care of you? "Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop? I'm a solid man. I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna. You've got to be-- Say, what happened to your hand? After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women. I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know. It ain't broke. You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole! A lot that means. Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes. Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half. I'm her husband. Who the hell is this!? Help me, Grace, help... Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things... There's someone in the house. You didn't hear something? You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone. You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl! Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best. What the hell you looking at, girl? They look nice. They look nice. I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember? You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace? Who was that on the phone?What'd you say to me! A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk: I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it . I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is. ...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed. Which you don't have. The old lady? ...And let me guess. This robber -- he gets your money. "Arkady" That's a shame, Bobby. A real shame.This means something to you? Jenny means something to me. Mexico? You going to Mexico? Now, what's this? My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie? I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. I'm stompin' your ass. Oh, that tears it, Mister. I'm gonna bust you up but good. I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around. That's what I'm gonna do. You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister. I'm crazy. I'm psycho crazy. That's right, Mister. You better be afraid. I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen. Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back. Mister! Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit. Stand up. Not before I settle with you, chickenshit! 'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off, somebody gets hurt. Mister, I'm calling you out. You expect me to believe that? That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her. You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see. I said come on! Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ... You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl? I axed you a question.Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent. We bring'em back tomorrow , the charts go up, they don't go down ... What about it? Hello . What? When you... What? I'm busy. Well, darlin' I ain't your confessor. Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing. Okay; Now : Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that. But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight. The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way... Lure him. You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President... Naw, we can't play this one catch-up. That's how long since you stopped beating the wife. We have to...

Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days. ...s'there a problem? First of all, we're locked in to it, secondly : War's over, Pal. ...those limp-dick ... turncoat ...

Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive? Sleep in the Winter. What does Moss want...? Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family. Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain. Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family. Alright, yes, they say. We would consider such an offer. Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done. Now, Look: I got the file , from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how... We're gonna do the Team Song . Due in Nashville. Yeah...what was I talking about...? I dunno....

Yes : she is saying this in Albanian, but she's doing it not to be uh...

What do you know about them? Yes. Well, I'm working on it.... Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject. You wanna change this subject, you better have a War. What do you need? It's gotta be quick , it's gotta be dramatic , you got to have an enemy . Okay? What do you need in an enemy? Somebody you fear. Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know. Shifty . Who knows anything about em... Why not , what've they ever done for us ...? Also: they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber ... ...that's the general idea. What did they find out about the Gulf War? One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of Legos . Who's gonna tell'em. The American "people"? Who would find out? What's it gonna cost? We aren't going to have a war. We're going to have the "appearance" of a war. Lookit, don't worry about it. It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will... ....we landing? Gemme a plane. Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago. O'hare, LAX 6 A.M. Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A. What is it? I'll be back within the hour. Now, Gimme twenty thousand dollars.

You gotta give me a day. I need a day. He's sick, get it out now . Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is. We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin. He's got some rare strain of... Well, yeah. Now. That's not good. Okay : Okay . We'll set up the War Room Here ... What difference does it make if it's true? It's a story , and, it breaks they're gonna have to run with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? Who's got the story? Okay. And she's alleging...? Well. Alright. What is it? What's, he, uh...? He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...? What's the thing? You people get ahead, you sure get nervous. Alright.

Would you do it again ...? In't that why you're here? I guess so . N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against? Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who? Sweden and Togo ? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against? That time has passed . It's passed . It's over . The War of the Future is Nuclear Terrorism . It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments , have blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared . You have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the future , and if you're not gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will fall. N'you're gonna be out in the street. And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you: you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life," well, Chuck, this is your way of life. Innit? And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting. And there ain't no war but ours. Would you go to War to do that? Why do they go to War? Why do people go to war? I have a question for you. Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents. But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick. And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same. Your country and your job. What are you interested in? S'only got to hold for another few days. Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you. My name is Ronald Brean. Course there's a war. I'm watching it on Television. Then show a little spunk. There Is no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing... Where'd you go to school, Kid. Wellesly? What do you think? What I need from you: I need a base of operations. Some place in the District. I need some clean money ... Well, that's what we're doing here... Earn your money. ...He's ill, the Plane is sick... ...you the Press Office? This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny. And, to hold it together, I need two days. There is no B-2 Bomber: here's what you do ahout that: whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?" "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested." "Deploy the B-2, Why ?" "In the Crisis." That's what I'm telling you. The two things: the two things: Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed. And the B-2 Bomber... Clear me a space. Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. TIMES , You're goddamn right. And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. Alright, now, here: he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow. When's he coming back...? But you always knew you couldn't take the credit.... No, the deal isn't changed. The Deal isn't changed. You can't ... what is it? Money? Money ? You want Money? Stanley. Stanley... you knew the... Stanley. You knew the deal when you signed on . No, I don't think you can do that, Stanley... No, I don't think you can do that. What're you doing? A proud tradition. No. You're right. Naw, naw, we own the airways... Hell of a show. Hell of a job, Stan. They'll be here in ten minutes. You got a dime....? No, I'm fine... I got it together.... No, I'm On Top of it... He's doped to the Gills ... He raped a Nun ... Some'b'y'll have you killed. You can't tell this story. He's supposed to be flying in from Europe. I'm tired. We have no home. We're vagrants. N'each man's hand's against us. We killed Old Shoe... We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you going ...? Uh huh...why? Y'know what else bothers me? "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..." The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY? You follow me...? Leav't alone. Wha'd television ever do to you? Ate your life , ruin'd your Culture , but... Wake up. Eh? I'm like the Rest of America. I don't care -- I'm just addicted to it ...

Speaking of which: I have a prescription here, I'm going to give you the number , I need you standing by with a crate of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?

What am I gonna do? I'm gonna "Fade Away." What are you gonna do? Ain't that the truth. Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he might , but why take a chance? Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em vote for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain. Make them pay for him. Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying home , he's here , he's there ... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is. Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks. Labor, five bucks an hour. If you watch , ten bucks an hour. If you help ... if you help , a hundred bucks an hour.

His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service. Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural. Nine A.M...? Nine? Miss the commuters, but... Hell of a Ride, Stanley... Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one... Yes, but there wasn't a War. If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness. Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?

I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver . You watched the Gulf War. What did you see? Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The truth , I was in the building when they shot that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building. Who? Why not? It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss. The Things in Trouble. Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing. You get the Actors get up there, and strut and Posture . But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing.
