Soldier

RUBRICK	Colonel Mekum has his "boys" unpacked.  I think he wants to show them off.
CHURCH	Hmmmmph.
RUBRICK	They look...impressive.
SLOAN	Well, they're...pretty.
CHURCH	What's so hot about them?
MEKUM	Very much improved.  In every way.
RUBRICK	This is Colonel Mekum from Q.  He's their commanding officer.
CHURCH	Improved...how?
MEKUM	As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
CHURCH	Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
CHURCH	...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
MEKUM	I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
CHURCH	Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They are battle-tested, aren't they?
MEKUM	That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
CHURCH	The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
MEKUM	Such as?
CHURCH	Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
RILEY	Sir!
RUBRICK	Very nice, Riley.  Fall away.
RILEY	Sir!
RUBRICK	Thirty seconds, 90 percent hits.
MEKUM	Let's make it more difficult.
MEKUM	Caine Six-Oh-Seven!
CAINE 607	Sir!
MEKUM	Assemble the weapon, load, fire on the target from various evasive positions in a thirty-second period.
MEKUM	Starting...now!
MEKUM	As you were, soldier.
RUBRICK	Ninety-nine percent...
MEKUM	While taking evasive action...
RUBRICK	That's...very good.
MEKUM	See?  Much stronger.
CHURCH	What about endurance?
CHURCH	Our man has been out there fifteen minutes now.  Shouldn't you send one?
MEKUM	In a minute. Now, see this test?  This shows what they do under sleep deprivation conditions.  Forty-eight hours awake and they can...
MEKUM	Melton, Eight Five.  Forward.
MELTON	Eight Five, sir.
MEKUM	Ten miles, Melton, on the run.
MEKUM	You've got sixty minutes.  Go.
MELTON	Sir!
MEKUM	My man left exactly twenty minutes after yours.  Make a note of that.
RUBRICK	What are we supposed to do with the old soldiers?
MEKUM	Old soldiers never die.
MEKUM	They'll serve as a labor force.  You can use them for physical stuff... loading, unloading, repairs, power lines, that kind of thing. Even cleaning...sweeping...,uh, tidying up.
MEKUM	Of course, age is a factor, but the real factor is the training program, especially the psychological.  The mind controls the body after all, and we're doing wonderful things with the mind.
TODD	Sir.
RUBRICK	At ease, soldier.
CHURCH	What's the price of all that speed? Is he tired?
MEKUM	Tired?
CHURCH	Todd here ran the pace he's been taught to run.  He's still strong. Send him up the chain, Rube.
RUBRICK	Soldier!  Up the chain!
TODD	Sir.
MEKUM	Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!
MELTON	Sir!
CHURCH	What about...spirit?
MEKUM	Spirit? Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
CHURCH	Whatever the latest jargon is.
MEKUM	Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's all aggression.
SLOAN	Real men!
CHURCH	At ease, Lieutenant. What if they fought?
MEKUM	You mean up there?
CHURCH	Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him.
MEKUM	No!
CHURCH	"No"?
MEKUM	Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.
MEKUM	Go ahead.
RUBRICK	Romero, A. -- Goines, D.L. -- up the chains.
RUBRICK	Get him, men!
MEKUM	GET DOWN HERE!  GET DOWN HERE ON THE
MELTON	COME ON, DOUBLE IT UP, DOWN, DOWN,
MELTON	Sir!
MEKUM	LOOK AT YOU, YOU BIG DUMB SHIT,
RUBRICK	They're...fantastic!
CHURCH	Mmmmmmm...
SLOAN	We could have a problem here, couldn't we?  I mean, we just lost three men...
CHURCH	Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. "Training accident."  Paperwork.
SLOAN	What about the bodies?
CHURCH	Incinerator.
MEKUM	WHAT GOOD IS THIS MAN NOW?  WITH ONE
CHURCH	They're very...impressive.
MEKUM	Yeah, well, the big moron shouldn't have lost an eye.
CHURCH	It was our best man who got his eye...  Todd, a real tough one. Survived police action in Montana, fought in the Argentine Sector, and in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing of --
MEKUM	Old news!  They're nothing at all! Wait until you get these new fellas into some real action.  I guarantee you'll be awed.  I guarantee it.
HAWKINS	Please!  Quiet, please!
SLADE	Just tell me one thing!  How many of them are there and are they armed?
HAWKINS	There in a man...one man.  He was found in the trench by several children...
HAWKINS	This man was not armed.
ELISE	How could there only be one?  How could he get here?
MACE	He was unconscious.  We couldn't ask him anything.  He --
JIMMY PIG	Nothin' out there.  We couldn't see nobody, couldn't see no ship, no vehicles, nothin'...plus the wind's up again real strong.
SLADE	They're hiding, I bet.
HAWKINS	Let's everybody calm down right now! We have an injured man among us. One man.  A traveler.  Unarmed. We all want to do the decent thing. The decent thing is to help him. Mace's wife, Sandra, is looking after him now.  Now, I'd like a vote of support on this course of action from all of you.
SLADE	You keep an eye on him, Mace!  You watch him!
SANDRA	Want to try some more of this?
SANDRA	You rest now.  I'll give you more later.
MACE	What do you mean he's survived worse?  Did he say something?
SANDRA	No, but he's covered with old wounds, all sorts of scars.  Knife scars, bullet scars, burns.
MACE	A soldier!
SANDRA	There are words on his shoulder. Tannhauser Gate, the Argentine Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai
MACE	The Tannhauser Gate was a battle...
SANDRA	We'll have to sleep on the floor.
MACE	Where's Nathan?
MACE	If there's any danger to Nathan --
SANDRA	I won't permit danger to Nathan.
SANDRA	You must be...you must be feeling better.
MACE	We're teaching the boy to walk.
SANDRA	He's late learning.  He was sick for a long time.
MACE	I got something for you.
MACE	Here.
MACE	Like this.
MACE	See?
MACE	Practice with it.  In a day or two maybe you'll be strong enough to go out to the garden with Sandra.
ELLEN	I came for Nathan.
MACE	Let's go.  Come on, Sergeant.
SANDRA	This way...
SANDRA	You have to watch out for them. They probably wouldn't kill someone your size, not if you were healthy anyway.  But they'd make you pretty sick.  Someone smaller...like me, or a child...
SANDRA	In a month this one will be as big as those.
SANDRA	Here.  You try one.
SLADE	You can't talk to a soldier no more than you can talk to a...a...bomb! Or a bullet!  They're trained, they're killing machines.  They got an objective and they go after that objective and nothing stops them but killing them.
CHESTER	Just one?  To kill us all?
SLADE	First off, if there's one, there's more.  That's how it is, soldiers travel in bunches.  Second, they don't waste soldiers on folks like us, that's for police!  Training soldiers to kill weaklings like us is not what they call "cost effective."
CHESTER	Then who do they fight?
SLADE	Other soldiers!  There's a saying, "Soldiers deserve soldiers."
ILONA	Slade, hush up.
JUDITH	You see how much he's eating?
SLADE	I don't see how you can not remember how you got here, Sergeant.
SLADE	You're not a deserter, are you... Sergeant?
TODD	No, sir.
SLADE	Then how come you're not with your unit?
JIMMY PIG	Oh, come on, Slade, let the man eat.
SLADE	It's not an unreasonable question. How about it, Sergeant?
TODD	I was...replaced.
MACE	Replaced?
TODD	By a better soldier, sir.
SANDRA	...And it got worse and worse.  My father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence...  political feelings.  My father said he'd heard it was better in the Trinity moons. A lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people...mostly families.  That's probably why it broke down...  overloaded.
SANDRA	Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with.  It just...dropped.  Maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind.  A lot of people died.  And we couldn't make any radio contact... So we were stuck here.  Nobody was happy about it.  A few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires.  But it didn't work. They must be unmanned...or they just don't care.  Maybe they think we're garbage too!
SANDRA	So there really wasn't any choice. People had to pull together and make the best of it.  We became a... community.
SANDRA	One good thing...nobody bothers us. Who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this?
SANDRA	I guess that's what you like!  The fighting, I mean.  The wars. You must...you're a soldier...
HAWKINS	You children are supposed to be doing lessons.
HAWKINS	Lessons.
MACE'S VOICE	She's down now, but she'll come up again.  Always does.
MACE	That's why we're weighing down.  And that's why we're always on the wire even when the wind's down, like now. You don't get much warning.  Here, load up, you'll want the weight, I promise.
MACE	Oh, we're not going to shoot anything.  That's not what we mean by "hunting." Jimmy Pig, you're not going to shoot anything, are you?
JIMMY PIG	What could I hit?
MACE	It's how we call for help.  Two shots.  There'll be someone on duty, listening in case we get off the wire and get lost or something.  We have flares too.  Come on.
MACE	Sandra said she told you how we wound up here.  Our parents and so on. Over here, we call these "catcher trenches."
MACE	Smaller stuff that blows across the ground, it falls in these trenches, it works sort of like a filter.  We go through the trenches sometimes and get some good stuff.
MACE	We try to work 'em when they're dry. It's lousy going in there when they're flooded.  You can see...
MACE	Whatever looks useful, if we can get a rope to it, we'll go for it.  But you can't ever go further than your safety line because it'll come up on you with sometimes maybe ten seconds or even less.
MACE	Like right now.  You hear that?
MACE	It's close when you hear that.
MACE	SHE'S GONNA BLOW, JIMMY.
MACE	GRAB ON, SERGEANT!
CHESTER
MACE	Uh, thanks, Sergeant.  Thanks a lot...
MACE	Dumpers.  They come every twenty or thirty days.
JIMMY PIG	Thanks, partner.  These no-goods woulda just let me blow away.
MEKUM	Sorry to disturb the tranquillity of outer space on Christmas Eve, but I'm off to the Caribbean in a few hours, and I wanted to make sure you'd got the transmission on the security sweep.
CHURCH	We got it all right.  This is an outpost here, not the Third Army! You've got us securing thirty-four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and --
MEKUM	Piece of cake, guys!  These are totally remote, totally uninhabited territories.  All you do is set down, send out a patrol purely as a formality, then have those veterans of yours put up an A-Type unmanned monitoring unit.  You should be on about number twenty-five by the time I get back from my vacation...
CHURCH	What if we do run into people... say squatters or refugees?
MEKUM	Well, you sure as hell don't want to get involved in evacuating people and that sort of thing. My advice would be to..."avoid paperwork."
CHURCH	Eliminate them, you mean.
MEKUM	Well, no one's out there, but officially these are "hostile zones."  Therefore you'd be within your rights to classify anyone as "hostile," I think. But I repeat, you should be worried about boredom, not action.  Any other questions before I go?
CHURCH	Down there...is it snowing?
MEKUM	Not in the Caribbean.  Have a good Christmas, guys.  See you when I get back.
SLOAN	Merry Christmas, Captain.
SLOAN	Hi, fellas.  At ease!
RUBRICK	Merry Christmas, everybody.
CHURCH	We brought you a little Christmas tree.
RUBRICK	And some good cheer.
SLOAN	How about some Christmas pussy, guys?  Anybody for a quick piece?
RUBRICK	That's "conduct unbecoming," Sloan.
SLOAN	It's Christmas!  Haven't you heard of piece on earth?  "Piece on earth," get it?
CHURCH	Christ, I wish we were on Earth.
RUBRICK	Eat, drink, and be merry, men.  For tomorrow you go on patrol in the  "hostile zone."
JIMMY PIG	HO HO HO!  HO HO HO!
SANDRA	We'll eat these.
SANDRA	It seemed like he was never going to walk.  Then all of a sudden...he's an expert.
SANDRA	Well, not quite an expert.
SANDRA	Sergeant Todd...what's it like...what's it like being a soldier?
SANDRA	What do you think about?
SANDRA	Do you think about food?  Or women? You must think about something.
SANDRA	What about feelings then?  You must have feelings.  You must feel something.
TODD	Fear.
SANDRA	Fear!  You mean...you feel afraid? That's when you're in battle... What about other times?  Now, for example?
TODD	Fear.
SANDRA	Now?
TODD	Always.
SANDRA	You don't...look afraid.  You look fearless.
TODD	Fear and...discipline.
SANDRA	Oh, my God.  But there's nothing to be afraid of here.  I can't hurt you.  I wouldn't.
TODD	Always.  It makes us...alert.
WILL	You're not supposed to do that anymore.
JOHNNY	So what?  I'm a soldier.
WILL	They're gonna kick him out.
ELLEN	They can't kick him out...
WILL	They're gonna.  My father --

JOHNNY	S-sir...sir, are you our friend? Sh-she said you were our friend.
SLADE	You!
JIMMY PIG	Thank God!
SLOAN	Well, Riley, you wanted a weapon, right?  Now you got one!  A real biggee!
RUBRICK	What good'll it do just setting it outside?  We don't know where the enemy is.
CHURCH	Doesn't matter.  For once Mekum's on the ball. This is a very dirty bomb!  That wind will churn the radioactivity around like soap in a washing machine.  This is gonna be one clean place in a very short time...
SLOAN	Okay, fellas, take it about a hundred yards, then get back on the double...unless you wanna fry.
RUBRICK	THIRTY MINUTES IS AWFUL TIGHT!  WE
CHURCH	IT'S ENOUGH.  IF WE LEAVE MORE THAN
CHURCH	Right horizontal?
RUBRICK	Roger.  Right horizontal checks green.
CHURCH	All right we're "go."  I'm allowing us three minutes to clear the atmosphere and get out of range. That means we can wait seven more minutes.
SLOAN	Fuck 'em!  Let's just go!
RUBRICK	She's right!  Four more casualties aren't gonna mean anything to anybody, especially when they're already obsolete.
CHURCH	I guess they wouldn't want to get old anyway. Go ahead, lock the hatch. Rube, punch up the port power cluster and --
SLOAN	What was that?
CHURCH	Huh?  What was what?
SLOAN	Sssshhhh!  Listen!
RUBRICK	It sounds...
SLOAN	Like a kid!
RUBRICK	Are you crazy?  You can't do this, soldier!  You're going to be in trouble.
CHURCH	I'm your superior officer, don't you understand that?
CHURCH	Don't you realize you're violating the chain of command?  I'm giving you a direct order to...to...to...
CHURCH	S-sergeant?  S-sergeant T-todd? It...  You...!  How...?  How...?
SLOAN	Sergeant Todd!
RUBRICK	Listen, you don't understand!  That bomb is triggered!  It's on a timer!
CHURCH	We have to get out of here!  All of us!  You need us!  You need us to operate the ship...
SLOAN	YOU'RE FUCKING MORONS!  CAN'T YOU
RUBRICK	NO!  NO!  NO!
CHURCH	DOWN!  LIE DOWN!  FLAT!
SLOAN	NO!  NO!  NO!  PLEASE!  NO!
SLOAN	OH, MY GOD!  OH, MY GOD!
CHURCH	THERE IT IS!  I SEE IT!
CHURCH	Twenty seconds.  Hurry.
SLOAN	Oh, my God, I can't remember if it's six-seven or seven-six...
CHURCH	Try one! Try it!
SLOAN	There!  I did it!  Did it stop?  Did it -- ?
MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE	...I need a report, Captain.  It's not just my ass, it's yours too! You've got to stand by me on this. I want you to come in right now... right now!  Do you understand me? Right now!
MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE	This is important for all of us, for our careers.  There's going to be a Board of Inquiry and --
SLADE'S VOICE	That was the boss, huh?
SLADE	Well then, I guess you fellas are all right.  I guess I misjudged you some.  Where I said you were "a buncha no good killer robots," I mighta just overspoke myself.  As of now, till it goes otherwise, you got my sincere approval and support.
RILEY	Cold.
TODD	Air?
TODD	Safe?
RILEY	But very cold.
TODD	That one.
RILEY	Aye, aye, sir.
