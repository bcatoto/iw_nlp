Silver Linings Playbook

PAT	What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays. The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative.
PAT	You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before."
PAT	I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now. I'm better now and I hope you are, too. And I'm
GONNA APPRECIATE--"
PAT	Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay?
PAT	I'll be there in a minute.
PAT	That's true love.
DANNY	Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People say I talk about my hair too much.
DANNY	And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far. He cut this side back too far trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that. I said, "Just cut it the way you cut it...."
PAT	Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible. I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.
DOLORES	I don't want him to get used to the routine here. Eight months is already long enough.
PAT	Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?
DOLORES	What? I don't understand.
PAT	Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
DANNY	I guess everybody's leaving today! Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you. Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the Birds play.
PAT	Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.
DANNY	Bad combination.
PAT	Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.
DANNY	That was when I was an X-ray technician with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it. That's when my hair was long, too. But my hair only grew when I was older. When I was younger, my hair didn't grow because my brother... Remember I told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I couldn't get a Jheri curl because my hair didn't grow long enough. I was so jealous of my brother...
PAT	He's obsessed with his hair.
DOLORES	(into cell phone) Hello?
PAT	It looks great now.
DANNY	You like it?
PAT	It's good now.
DOLORES	(into cell phone) Yes, it is.
DANNY	(as Pat touches hair) Wait, you're going the wrong way!
DOLORES	(into cell phone) What? Are you sure about that? I'll bring him back right away.
DOLORES	You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave.
PAT	All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.
PAT
PAT	Mom, just listen--
DOLORES	Don't tou-...
DOLORES	...-ch the steering...
DOLORES
DOLORES	Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.
PAT	I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?
DOLORES	I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now.
DANNY	It's my fault. Pat didn't know. Pat didn't know. He's my friend, so he was rootin' for me.
DANNY	I'm havin' a disagreement with the hospital, but we're working it out. Take me back to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me. You'll see, he's fine. It's my fault.
PAT	Mom, can we stop at the library? I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.
PAT	Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.
RANDY	Come on, tell me that one.
RANDY	You know something? It's nothing new. Your team does that all the time. They get close...
RANDY	...and then they blow it. They got an inferiority complex.
RANDY	Because we are, we're America's Team.
RANDY	What's more American than a cowboy?
RANDY	What?
RANDY	Benjamin Franklin?
RANDY	You mean the guy with the...
RANDY	...little glasses and the long scraggly hair?
RANDY	If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody...
RANDY	...would even know who he is.
RANDY	I didn't even touch `em. Why are you--, don't blame me.
RANDY	No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many. Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful!
RANDY	Hey.
PAT	(awkward, unsure) Mm-hmm.
PAT	It's right here.
PAT	You still got yours?
DOLORES	Well, he's ready. Look at him.
PAT	You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?
DOLORES	Don't worry about that.
DOLORES	The court said yes. Don't worry.
PAT	Yeah, and the court said--
THE DOCTOR--
PAT	Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go.
DOLORES	Don't worry.
PAT	Dad, I'm in there because of the court. That's the agreement that we made months ago. It was a plea bargain with the courts. The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.
DOLORES	It's all under control.
PAT	Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself?
PAT	How you gonna pay for it?
PAT
PAT
DOLORES
PAT
PAT
PAT
PAT
PAT	What are you doing, Dad? You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior.
PAT	It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining, that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit. That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth.
PAT	What the fuck?!
PAT	Stupid fucking book!
PAT	I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids. I mean the whole time -- let me just break it down for you -- the whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley...
DOLORES	It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat.
PAT	...and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive? Let's have a good ending to the story?"
DOLORES	Pat, you owe us an apology.
PAT	Mom, for what, I can't apologize. I'm not gonna apologize for this. You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here.
PAT	I was reading.
PAT	I'm gonna go run now.
PAT	I'll fix it when I get back.
DOLORES	Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy.
PAT	I don't wanna go to therapy.
DOLORES	You have to go. It's part of the deal. You can't live with us and not go.
PAT	Is that song really playing?
RECEPTIONIST	We have music sometimes.
PAT	That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off?
RECEPTIONIST	I can't.
PAT	What do you mean, you can't?
RECEPTIONIST	I don't have the controls. I'm sorry, I--
PAT
)	Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this? Is there a speaker here?
PAT	Is, is the speaker here?
PAT	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay...I'm sorry. I'll fix all this, okay?
PAT	That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's....
PAT	Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay? Why don't you write that down in your, I don't know, your little book you write stuff down in.
PAT	Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm not gonna take any meds, I should just tell you that right now.
PAT	No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy-- No, you will have to take medication.
PAT	I don't want any meds, Doctor. Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay? My father is the explosion guy. I'm not that guy. He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list. I had one incident.
PAT	But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street. She just needs to take responsibility for hers.
PAT	What's hers? Are you joking? Let's go back to the incident. I come home from work after I
PAT
PAT	...principal. I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding. The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us. That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd, `cause I should have.
PAT
PAT	...ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D-...
PAT
PAT	...panties on the ground and then-
PAT
PAT	...and I think, "Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower. What a perfect thing. I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there. We never-...
PAT
PAT	...pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history...
PAT
PAT	And you know what he says to me?
PAT
PAT	So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.
PAT	Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh...
PAT	Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.
PAT	Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which I do now. Sort of.
DOLORES
MEDICATION -
PAT	I can't, Mom. I can't.
DOLORES	I will call them. They'll come for you.
PAT	Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that. Why would you call them?
PAT	I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them, Mom. I don't feel good. I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated. I don't like the way it makes me look.
DOLORES	You've gotta take your medication.
PAT	Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out, that's what I'm doin'.
DOLORES	Why are you wearing a garbage bag?
PAT	To sweat.
PAT	I don't believe in juju, Dad.
PAT	All right, all right.
PAT	For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game.
DOLORES	He says you're good...
DOLORES	..luck, honey.
PAT	What's that in your hand?
PAT	Handkerchief?
PAT	That's OCD. That's crazy.
DOLORES	I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.
PAT	I'm the reason? I don't think so. Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes. I got your whole sheet. Yeah. No, no...
PAT	Mom. ...I'm just confirming. I'm just confirming. Okay.
RICKY	Can I do..an interview for a school project on mental illness?
PAT	Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?
DOLORES	That's him.
PAT	Is he the guy who's having the problem?
DOLORES	Yeah, that's the one.
PAT	No, you shut the door in his face. I'm going for a run.
DOLORES	Pat, don't look for Nikki!
DOLORES	Pat!
DOLORES	Don't look for Nikki!
PAT	Ms. Meckers!
NANCY	Oh, God! Oh, God!
PAT	Nance! This is my lucky day! Look at you working on a Sunday!
PAT	How are you? Hey.
NANCY	What are you doing here?
PAT	I just came by to say hi, to let you know I'm ready to come back to work.
NANCY	You shouldn't be here.
PAT	I'll work full-time, half-time. I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever you want.
PAT	Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
NANCY	I got it.
NANCY	I got it. I got it.
PAT	Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something. Does Nikki still work here?
NANCY	You know I can't tell you that. But Doug Culpepper is still here.
PAT	Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage. What, are you being, a troublemaker?
NANCY	You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight?
PAT	I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.
NANCY	Get away from me! Get away!
PAT	I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay? I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are.
PAT	I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay?
NANCY	You just have to give it some time.
PAT	Yes.
NANCY	You know, a lot went down. People will get over it. It'll be all good. It'll work out.
PAT	Yes! It will be!
PAT	I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy! A silver development! That's a silver lining!
NANCY	Good luck.
PAT	Ronnie! Pat.
RONNIE	There he is! He's back!
PAT	Hey.
RONNIE	Welcome home.
PAT	Thank you.
RONNIE	Welcome back, man.
PAT	Yeah, I'm out.
RONNIE	Yeah? You're out out?
PAT	Uh-huh.
RONNIE	Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight. I almost didn't recognize you.
PAT	Thank you.
RONNIE	I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital. You know, work's out of control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back. I missed you. I really need someone to talk to. You gotta come see the baby. She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.
PAT	Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.
RONNIE	'Cause you think Veronica still hates you?
PAT	I know Veronica still hates me.
RONNIE	That's not true.
PAT	Yes, it is. Nikki always said that "Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse."
RONNIE	That's not true.
VERONICA	Ronnie! What are you doing?
RONNIE	Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner? Hmm?
VERONICA	Did you invite him?
RONNIE	Yes.
VERONICA	Well, can he make it?
RONNIE	I don't know yet! (to Pat) Can you make it next Sunday?
PAT	Sure.
RONNIE	I'll see you next Sunday.
PAT	Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right? Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?
RONNIE	Yeah.
VERONICA	Get in here, please. I need you.
RONNIE	Okay.
PAT	I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news.
PAT	Things are looking up.
PAT	You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it.
PAT	Oh, no way!
PAT	No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper?
PAT	Wait just a minute.
PAT	What are you doing?
PAT	Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad.
DOLORES	Pat!
PAT	Don't talk to me like that.
OFFICER KEOGH
OFFICER KEOGH	...check on this house. Pat Solatano?
PAT	Yeah.
OFFICER KEOGH	Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order. And I heard you went to your old house and the school. It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor. Respect the restraining order, okay? Five hundred feet.
PAT	Yeah, Dad, I know.
OFFICER KEOGH	If you need anything...my card.
PAT	Since when do cops have cards?
PAT	Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication.
PAT	Let me say something, I gotta say something.
PAT	This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.
PAT	Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for.... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.
PAT	DeSean Jackson.
PAT	Well, that settles that.
RONNIE	Pat! What are you doin'?
PAT	I gotta go, man.
RONNIE	Why?
PAT	I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.
RONNIE	Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey. I wish I was wearing that jersey.
PAT	I feel like an idiot.
RONNIE	Are you comfortable?
PAT	Veronica's not gonna like it.
RONNIE	Get over here.
PAT	Plus you got a tie on.
RONNIE	Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor. You come however you wanna come.
PAT	Really?
RONNIE	Get over here.
RONNIE	DeSean Jackson's in the house!
VERONICA	You mean rookie of the year?
RONNIE	Yeah.
VERONICA	DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson? (noticing Pat) Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.
RONNIE	Isn't it awesome?
VERONICA	Not for dinner.
RONNIE	Look, he got us flowers.
VERONICA	Oh, that's sweet. (to Pat) That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.
RONNIE	And wine.
PAT	Hey.
VERONICA	Hey.
RONNIE	Check this out. We just redid the whole thing.
PAT	Wow!

RONNIE	You start snapping up commercial real estate -- cheap -- flip it over, you flip it over and that's when you make the money. But the pressure...it's like....
PAT	You okay?
RONNIE	I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me. I feel like I'm getting crushed and--
PAT	Crushed by what?
RONNIE	Everything. The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know, like I'm trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches for his throat, mimicking trying to breath) you know, and, and, and I'm like...suffocating.
PAT	Holy shit.
RONNIE	You can't be happy all the time.
PAT	Who told you you can't be happy?
RONNIE	It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice.
PAT	That's not true at all.
RONNIE	You just can't.
PAT	Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!
RONNIE	I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over. You okay with that?
PAT	Who?
RONNIE	Veronica's sister. Tiffany.
PAT	Tiffany and...Tommy?
RONNIE	Yeah. Just Tiffany.
PAT	What happened to Tommy?
RONNIE	He died.
PAT	Tommy died?
RONNIE	Cops die.
PAT	How'd he die?
RONNIE	Please, don't bring it up.
PAT	No, how did he die?
TIFFANY	How did who die?
RONNIE	Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.
PAT	You look nice.
TIFFANY	Thank you.
PAT	I'm not flirting with you.
TIFFANY	Oh, I didn't think you were.
PAT	I just see that you made an effort and I'm gonna be better with my wife, I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty. I never used to do that. I do that now. `Cause we're gonna be better than ever...Nikki. Just practicing. How'd Tommy die?
PAT	What about your job?
TIFFANY	I just got fired, actually.
PAT	Oh, really? How?
PAT	I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?
TIFFANY	Does it really matter?
VERONICA	Baby, how's it going?
RONNIE	Great, great.
VERONICA	Everyone having fun? We're gonna go on a tour now. We're gonna go on a tour now.
TIFFANY	Let's go see the house.
RONNIE	Come on, let's go for the tour.
RONNIE	(motions to Pat) Come on.
VERONICA	Guess what it is.
PAT	Oh, it's a television.
TIFFANY	It's a computer screen.
RONNIE	Nope.
VERONICA	Just keep going, keep going, keep going.
PAT	It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.
TIFFANY	It's a light. It's a...
VERONICA	Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.
TIFFANY	...it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.
VERONICA	Don't think so hard, don't think so hard.
PAT	Where would the dead body...where would the body go, though? `Cause the outside of the--
TIFFANY	It's a joke!
VERONICA	It's a...fireplace.
TIFFANY	In the middle of the wall?
VERONICA	We have a port in every room. Gimme an iPod. Who, who doesn't have an iPod?
PAT	Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone. They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki.
RONNIE	Don't worry about it. Don't focus on that.
PAT	I would call Nikki.
RONNIE	I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. I have an old one.
VERONICA	Gimme your iPod.
VERONICA	Give it to me. Thank you, baby, thank you.
TIFFANY	Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in, I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.
VERONICA	Look, look, look.
VERONICA	I can play music for the baby in any room.
PAT	Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica?
RONNIE	Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany. Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.
PAT	Here's a fun fact. You know where the term "OK" comes from?
VERONICA	No. No, I don't.
RONNIE	Where?
PAT	Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York...
VERONICA	Oh.
PAT	...and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK." `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.
RONNIE	Really?
PAT	Yeah. Pretty cool, right?
RONNIE	That's interesting.

TIFFANY	Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.
PAT	Right?
TIFFANY	Jesus.
PAT	It's like, "What? What day is it?" How about Trazodone?
TIFFANY	Trazodone!
PAT	Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done. It takes the light right out of your eyes.
TIFFANY	God, I bet it does.
TIFFANY	I'm tired. I wanna go.
VERONICA	No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we haven't even finished the salad yet, or the duck. I made the Fire and Ice cake.
TIFFANY	I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what?
PAT	You mean me?
TIFFANY	Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?
PAT	You have poor social skills. You have a problem.
TIFFANY	I have a problem? You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people.
PAT	I tell the truth. But you're mean.
TIFFANY	What? I'm not telling the truth?
RONNIE	Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?
VERONICA	You can drive them both home. Now.
TIFFANY	Stop talking about me in third person.
VERONICA	You can take Tiffany home first.
TIFFANY	You love it when I have problems. You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it.
VERONICA	No...
VERONICA	...I don't. I don't. I just wanted to have a nice, I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
TIFFANY	Oh, God.
VERONICA	What is your problem?!
TIFFANY	Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come on, are you ready?
VERONICA	You really, you really wanna go right now?
TIFFANY	Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.
RONNIE	Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!
TIFFANY	Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye.
RONNIE	Sorry, man.
TIFFANY	This is me.
TIFFANY	Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works.
PAT	How what works?
TIFFANY	I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?
PAT	How old are you?
TIFFANY	Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.
PAT	Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?
TIFFANY	You're married? So am I.
PAT	No, that's confusing. He's dead.
PAT	Wait, what?
PAT	What's happening?
PAT	Oh, my God. Hey.
DOLORES	Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?
PAT	I don't know, Mom.
PAT	When am I gonna get a phone?
DOLORES	Pat!
PAT	Mom!
PAT	I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up.
DOLORES	What is it?
PAT	Where's my wedding video?
PAT	I looked in here, but this is all your sewing shit up here, for your sewing and everything. Did you put it up here?
DOLORES	What about in your father's study?
PAT	(shouts O.S.) Dad, not now!
PAT	Would you put it in here? It makes no sense for you to put it in here.
PAT	He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding!
PAT	Is it here? I mean....?
DOLORES	It's probably in the attic.
PAT	It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.
DOLORES	Please stop yelling!
PAT	I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated because I should have my fucking wedding video!
DOLORES	Pat! Pat!
PAT	I looked over there! I already looked all over there!
DOLORES	Calm down, Pat.
PAT	I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck who hears, I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up! I'm not ashamed of it! I'm not ashamed of it! Let the whole neighborhood wake up! I...
DOLORES	Pat! Stop it!
PAT	...don't care!
DOLORES	Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
PAT	No, Mom!
PAT	(yelling and crying) I want it! It-... Hey!
PAT	(yelling and crying) It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!
DOLORES	Pat!
DOLORES	Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
PAT	I can't watch my wedding video, but I CAN hear the fucking song in my head, goddamn it!
PAT	Mom? What the fuck you doing?! You...
PAT	Mom?
PAT	No, no, no, no, no!
DOLORES	Stop it!
PAT	Get off me, Dad!
DOLORES	Stop hitting him!
DOLORES	Stop hitting him!
PAT	I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
OFFICER KEOGH	Police!
OFFICER KEOGH	There are a lot of reports from your neighbors, we got a lot of phone calls.
PAT	Nikki is being manipulated and controlled. You have to talk to her.
OFFICER KEOGH	Hey, sit down.
DOLORES	It's a medication problem, but he's fine now.
OFFICER KEOGH	Oh yeah? He's fine now? You wanna send him back to Baltimore? We know all about the explosion at the psychiatrist's office.
DOLORES	What?
PAT	What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true. He's not allowed to talk about that.
DOLORES	Jesus Christ, who's that?
RICKY	Is this a bipolar episode?
RICKY	Someone, help me! Help me!
PAT	You can't tell Nikki about this, Officer.
OFFICER KEOGH	Look, I gotta make out a report.
PAT	No, no! No!
OFFICER KEOGH	She can see it by law.
DOLORES	Hey!
OFFICER KEOGH	Sit down.
PAT	No, no, no, listen, sir.
RICKYY	He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me! Help me!
OFFICER KEOGH	Sit down!
PAT	I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter and you could just let me have five minutes, explaining how much better I'm doing.
OFFICER KEOGH	There's a court order against you -- five hundred feet. Listen to me! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
PAT	...this is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't...please, you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this.
OFFICER KEOGH	You need to pipe down.
DOLORES	Who was at the door?
PAT	Who was that, Dad?
OFFICER KEOGH	Good luck. I gotta write this up.
PAT	Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this!
TIFFANY	Hey!
PAT	What the hell?
TIFFANY	What happened to your face?
PAT	Weight lifting accident.
TIFFANY	That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house? Did our little conversation get you upset last night?
PAT	Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off.
TIFFANY	This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house.
PAT	I like to run by myself, okay?
TIFFANY	Me too.
PAT	(stops and turns) Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?
TIFFANY	What?
PAT	Okay? I'm running here!
TIFFANY	Me too!
PAT	Well then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do?
TIFFANY	I like this road. This is my neighborhood.
PAT	Oh, come on, please!
TIFFANY	Calm down, crazy.
TIFFANY	Hey!
PAT	What the fuck?!
PAT	I'm married!
TIFFANY	So am I!
PAT	What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead!
TIFFANY	Where is your wife?
PAT	You're crazy!
TIFFANY	I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.
PAT	I'm not the big slut!
PAT	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
TIFFANY	I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?! Can you forgive? Are you any good at that?
PAT	Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean....
PAT	Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
PAT	Yeah, but that's easier said than done.
PAT	Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay?
PAT	Why?
PAT
PAT
PAT
PAT
PAT
PAT	Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?
PAT	With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
PAT	No, not the books.
TIFFANY	Hey!
PAT	How do you know when I run?
TIFFANY	I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends. (Pat doesn't answer) Did you hear what I said? (Pat doesn't answer still) Why are you giving me such a hard time?
PAT	No, I'm not giving you a hard time.
TIFFANY	I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.
PAT	You wanna have dinner at this diner?
TIFFANY	Pick me up at seven thirty.
PAT	Happy Halloween.
TIFFANY	Hi.
WAITRESS	Here you go.
TIFFANY	Thank you.
PAT	I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.
TIFFANY	Tea.
WAITRESS	Be right back.
PAT	You look nice.
TIFFANY	Thanks.
WAITRESS	Raisin Bran. Milk.
TIFFANY	Thank you.
PAT	You want to share this?
TIFFANY	Why did you order Raisin Bran?
PAT	Why did you order tea?
TIFFANY	Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
PAT	I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.
TIFFANY	It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.
PAT	It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?
TIFFANY	It's good. How's your restraining order?
PAT	I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.
TIFFANY	And the so-called incident with the weights.
PAT	Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.
TIFFANY	I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.
PAT	It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.

TIFFANY	I heard about that.
PAT	...it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.
TIFFANY	Wow.
PAT	Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.
TIFFANY	Yeah.
PAT	So I know.
TIFFANY	You do.
PAT	I just gotta get a strategy, you know?
TIFFANY	Me too.
PAT	We'd better get back to the letter.
TIFFANY	Yeah, let's get back to the letter.
PAT	What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?
TIFFANY	Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.

TIFFANY	You think that I'm crazier than you.
PAT
	Because, well, we're different, I
MEAN--
TIFFANY	Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. `Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.
PAT	Keep your voice down.
TIFFANY	I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!
TIFFANY	Forget it!
PAT	Shut the fuck up.
TIFFANY	Fuck you!
TIFFANY	You shut the fuck up!
PAT	Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!
WAITRESS	Slow down, Raisin Bran.
PAT	Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?
TIFFANY	Yes, you do.
PAT	No, I don't.
TIFFANY	You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?
PAT	What? Hey, calm down! Hey--
TIFFANY	Just leave me alone!
PAT	Can I just explain myself, please? I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay?
TIFFANY	You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole!
TIFFANY	Get off of me! (yelling) Get off! You're harassing me!
PAT	Hey, hey!
TIFFANY	He's harassing me!
PAT	Shut up!
TIFFANY	Get off!
MAN	Take it easy. Dude, relax.
PAT	Bro, get off of me.
TIFFANY
)	He's harassing me!!
PAT	Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right?
PAT	Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up.
PAT	Stop it.
PAT	Hey, hey, hey, get off me!
OFFICER KEOGH	What are you doing? Come on. What are you doing? What are you doing to these kids?
PAT	I didn't, I didn't, I didn't--
TIFFANY	It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids.
OFFICER KEOGH	(walks crowd back) Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here.
TIFFANY	You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster.
TIFFANY	There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it.
TIFFANY	That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
PAT	I'm sorry.
TIFFANY	I took it too far.
PAT	I'm sorry.
OFFICER KEOGH	(pulls her away) Hey, is he messing with you?
TIFFANY	No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started.
OFFICER KEOGH	There's a restraining order on this guy.
TIFFANY	I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.
OFFICER KEOGH	That's not a good thing to do.
TIFFANY	Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.
OFFICER KEOGH	You're Tommy's widow, right?
TIFFANY	Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.
OFFICER KEOGH	You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime?
PAT	She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.
PAT	I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.
TIFFANY	I know. I know you didn't mean it.
PAT	I didn't mean it at all.
TIFFANY	I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.
PAT	All the time.
TIFFANY	I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry.
PAT	Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.
TIFFANY	I know you do.
PAT	You do?
TIFFANY	Yeah, sure.
PAT	I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?
RANDY	I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it. That's the only answer.
DOLORES	Maybe we should call the FBI.
PAT	Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not a
PROBLEM
DOLORES	"Do not go in my study or I will eat you!"

PAT	Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?
TIFFANY'S MOTHER	What do you want with her?
TIFFANY'S FATHER	Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it.
PAT	Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.
TIFFANY'S FATHER	Oh, great, a married creep.
PAT	I'm her friend.
PAT	We go running. Have you guys not seen us? I took her to the diner.
TIFFANY'S MOTHER	She's not here.
JORDIE	Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is Tiffany home?
TIFFANY'S MOTHER	Go away.
JORDIE	I know her. I know her, we've dated. We still date.
PAT	What are you doing here?
JORDIE	I've called her, I've texted her.
PAT	Do you know this guy?
JORDIE	I still haven't heard back. We used to work together--
TIFFANY'S FATHER	Just get the hell out of here...
JORDIE	I just wanted to give you my card to give to her.
TIFFANY'S FATHER	Another rude creep.
PAT	Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what he's saying.
JORDIE	What's he saying?
PAT	He's saying you're being rude.
JORDIE	How am I being rude?
PAT	Oh, you know. You know. Come on. Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and
SOMETIMES --
PAT	--it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target. And in this case, in this particular case, I think that wing is being fixed.
PAT	And you gotta make sure it gets mended. And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay? Because she's sensitive and she's smart, she's artistic. This is a great girl and you gotta be respectful of that. Come on.
PAT	Let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this. I can see it in your eyes.
JORDIE	She just texted me!
PAT	Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on?
TIFFANY	I can't, I can't do it.
PAT	What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what?
TIFFANY	I can't give the letter to Nikki.
PAT	Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?
TIFFANY	Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me?
PAT	You said! You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki.
TIFFANY	I know.
PAT	That was the set-up.
TIFFANY	Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!
PAT	What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. Why don't you just do things on your own?
TIFFANY	I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister.
PAT	Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?
TIFFANY	I can't do it.
PAT	Tiffany, what do you want me to do?
PAT	Think of something.
TIFFANY	There's this thing.
PAT	There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?
TIFFANY	It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.
PAT	It's a dance thing, all right.
TIFFANY	It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.
PAT	Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it.
TIFFANY	Would you please!
PAT	I don't have a filter when I talk.
TIFFANY	Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God.
PAT	Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
TIFFANY	But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year.
PAT	Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you. What are you talking about?
TIFFANY	What, your schedule is so busy? "Grapes of Wrath" and watching football with your dad?
PAT	Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.
TIFFANY	All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.
PAT	Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.
TIFFANY	Think about it.
PAT	Well, I already did do something for you, you know.
TIFFANY
PAT	I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.
TIFFANY	What? Jordie?
PAT	Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely?
PAT	That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.
TIFFANY	Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?
PAT	It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about? We're in love and we're married. It's completely different.
TIFFANY	How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.
PAT	We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.
TIFFANY	Wow.
PAT	It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me.
PAT	She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.
TIFFANY	It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing.
DANNY	I'm out.
DANNY	It's official, man. They didn't convert me to my Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out. They had to let me go.
PAT	I never understand what he's saying.
PAT	What a treat!
PAT	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad's got you sitting here?
DANNY	He calls me "Jailhouse Lawyer."
DANNY	Okay.
PAT	And now you're holding the remote?
DANNY	And it's working. Your dad's a genius.
PAT	And Danny's the good luck charm?
DANNY	Yeah, you're the one, Pat.
PAT	Superstition, Danny. I don't know.
PAT	Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend. Why would you say that?
RONNIE	Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful. She goes to a lot of therapy.
PAT	I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie. What are you trying to say?
RONNIE	I'm just saying--
PAT
 )	Am I messed up?
PAT	Why don't you stop judging people? You judge everybody. You're the one who has a messed up marriage.
RONNIE	I'm just looking out for you, I'm just looking out for you. She's unstable.
DOLORES	What's wrong with your marriage? What's wrong with your marriage?
RONNIE	Nothing's wrong!
PAT	You should have seen when I was at his house. It's like a circus over there.
RONNIE	Shh, shh.
PAT	What are you talking about? I'm not gonna hide this. You need to deal with it.
RONNIE	Stop breaking my balls.
PAT	Oh!!!!
RONNIE	I got you an iPod.
PAT	Whoa! Is this for me?
RONNIE
PAT
RONNIE

PAT
RONNIE	Yeah, but it makes me feel better. It's like my therapy, you know?
PAT	When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that...
JAKE	A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro. [Walks down to Pat]. Holy shit, look at you! You are fit! You look absolutely amazing. You feel good?
PAT	How you doing, Jake?
JAKE	Good. You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.
DOLORES	Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?
JAKE	So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital. You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding. I've been helping Pop with the restaurant `cause he needs to have a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him. And then it looks like I'm making, I'm gonna make partner at the firm.
JAKE	Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife, I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things. You lost your house, I'm getting a new house. You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm.
JAKE	You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth.
PAT	As my friend Danny would say 00
PAT	I got nothing but love for you, brother.
DANNY	That's right. That's right.
PAT	DeSean Jackson.
JAKE	Yeah. Did it fit?
PAT	I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.
RONNIE	Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.
PAT	Veronica didn't like it.
RONNIE	Veronica hates the jersey.
JAKE	Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay?
PAT	I'm not doing anything!
RONNIE	Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.
DOLORES	Pat, you're up to something, I know.
PAT	People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something because we're
MORE--
DANNY	We have a sixth sense. I mean, everybody's got it. Everybody's just not in touch with it.
DOLORES	Oh, no.
OFFICER KEOGH	How you doing, Pat?
PAT	Jesus.
OFFICER KEOGH	I'm taking him back to the hospital.
PAT	What? No, no, he passed his thing, right?
DANNY	First of all, check with the latest legal development.
OFFICER KEOGH	Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so.... Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan?
OFFICER KEOGH	I'm an Eagles fan.
OFFICER KEOGH	I don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief". And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest his case from Baltimore.
DANNY	Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct.
OFFICER KEOGH	Come on.
DANNY	You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
TIFFANY	I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers.
PAT	Wow.
TIFFANY	I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun. And the walls are good `cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.
PAT	Where do you sleep?
TIFFANY	Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.
PAT	When are you gonna give it to her?
TIFFANY	What?
PAT	The letter to Nikki.
TIFFANY	Probably tonight.
PAT	Really?
TIFFANY	Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.
PAT	Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph. I did this thing about Shakespeare and how it's very
ROMANTIC-
TIFFANY	Mm-hmm.
PAT	-and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the
TRAINING THAT--
TIFFANY	No, that's good, that's really good.
PAT	I assume you're a good teacher.
TIFFANY	Yeah. I mean, I hope so.
PAT	Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean?
PAT	And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.
TIFFANY	Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.
PAT	You know, being of service.
TIFFANY	Yeah.
PAT	To your need.
TIFFANY	Uh-huh.
TIFFANY	All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me. Walk across the room.
PAT	Can we do something else besides the dance deal?
TIFFANY	Are you fucking kidding me?
PAT	I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something?
TIFFANY	A deal is a deal.
PAT	I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.
TIFFANY	Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk.
PAT	I'm not doing it.
TIFFANY	Only walk. Do it.
PAT	No. That's stupid.
TIFFANY	No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.
PAT	(under his breath) You're not Nikki.
TIFFANY	Don't look up until you're halfway here.
TIFFANY	That's right.
TIFFANY	Not yet.
TIFFANY	Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.
PAT	I don't feel anything.
TIFFANY	Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
PAT	No.
TIFFANY	We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. (pause) That's a feeling.
TIFFANY	Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.
DOLORES	Whoa! Slow down.
PAT	What?
DOLORES	Your father wanted you to have this.
PAT	He wants me to have-
PAT	-all this Eagles information.
DOLORES	It's his living.
PAT	Um, tell Dad thanks.
DOLORES	Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.
TIFFANY	Football stays out of this place, so does "Lord of the Flies."
PAT	Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.
TIFFANY	I don't give a fuck.
PAT	What the hell are you doing?
PAT	Did you just throw that outside?
TIFFANY	What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the "Lord of the Flies." It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.
PAT	Wow. That was a great synopsis. I still need to read it, though.
PAT	Who's that?
PAT	What the....? (laughing) What are you doing here, man?
DANNY	If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, then your whole ajudication is thrown out.
PAT	How'd you know we were here?
DANNY	I went by your parents' house looking for you and they told me you was over here.
PAT	Danny, this is Tiffany. (to Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.
TIFFANY	Hello. Pat told me about you.
DANNY	So is the girl, that you wrote about?
PAT	Yeah.
TIFFANY	What? He wrote about me? I'm "the girl"?
DANNY	He wrote about you, all right.
TIFFANY	What'd he say?
DANNY	He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but--
PAT	Whoa, whoa, that's enough.
TIFFANY	No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.
PAT	Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you. It was nothing. It was just a very general letter.
TIFFANY	Cool.
DANNY	(looks at Tiffany) She's fine.
PAT	She is my friend with an "F."
DANNY	A capital "F."
PAT	For "friend."
DANNY	Hey, can I see what you guys are doing?
PAT	Yeah.
TIFFANY	Okay.
TIFFANY	And then this goes into something else.
DANNY	That's it?
PAT	Why? What is it, what is it, what is it.
DANNY	Can I say something? Do you mind?
TIFFANY	No.
DANNY	You sure?
PAT	Just say it. Say it.
TIFFANY	No, please.
DANNY	I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.
DANNY	Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what I mean. You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man.
DANNY	You should move more hips.
DANNY	Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this. And....
PAT	Okay.
DANNY	Yeah. Can you move `em a little bit more? Yeah, that's it. Move `em a bit more.
DANNY	You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. You're pretty good.
DANNY	Mm, yeah.
PAT	Okay, we got it, we got it.
DANNY	Okay. Okay.
DANNY	Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat.
PAT	"Black it up"?
DANNY	You know damn well what it means.
DANNY	Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an idea.
DANNY	Come get some, Pat. Come get some.
DANNY	Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta move your junk.
DANNY	I gotta get out of here. I gotta go see this girl, Tanya. She lives on this side of town.
PAT	Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.
DANNY	Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win!
TIFFANY	Bye!
DANNY	Excelsior, Pat!
PAT	Excelsior!
DANNY	That's my man.
PAT	I didn't realize that.
PAT	Okay.
PAT	Right.
RANDY	He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything.
RANDY	All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game.
RANDY	Because he believes in you.
PAT	Is that true?
PAT	Yeah.
PAT	You want me to go to the game with Jake?
JAKE	Does he want me to go?
PAT	He told you that?
PAT	Even with all his friends?
PAT	He's not embarrassed?
RANDY	Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.
PAT	I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.
DOLORES	Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon?
PAT	It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.
PAT	Listen, I need to ask you something.
PAT	Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?
TIFFANY	I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.
PAT	Why?
TIFFANY	These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet.
PAT	I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you.
TIFFANY	Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
PAT	No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.
TIFFANY	Guess what?
PAT	What?
TIFFANY	Nikki replied to your letter.
TIFFANY	But you can't read it until after you nail the big move. Go.
PAT	Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--, it's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right?
TIFFANY	I just hope you can handle it.
PAT	Thank you.
PAT	What was her energy when she gave it to you?
TIFFANY	She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.
PAT	She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?
TIFFANY	Try to stay positive.
PAT	I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?
TIFFANY	No.
TIFFANY	I thought you were gonna read it out loud.
PAT	Okay. Sorry.
PAT	"Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki."
PAT	I think I'm done for today, okay?
TIFFANY	(follows him to door) She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her.
PAT	(over his shoulder) Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
PAT	Can I use your phone?
PAT	Yeah, kind of.
PAT	Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time.
PAT	She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?
PAT	No, I think, it's a good thing.
PAT	Yeah. I'm solid.
JAKE	This is my little brother Pat.
PAT	Hey, how you doing?
GUY #1	So, Pat, what's this I hear about you just gettin' out?
GUY #2	(laughs) Yeah, from the looney bin!
JAKE	What the fuck?! I talked to you about that already!
JAKE	I told you guys--
PAT	It's all right.
JAKE	Huh? No.
PAT	It's alright.
GUY #2	He's a good dude! He's a good dude.
JAKE	Oh, shit! The Asian invasion!
JAKE	They're here every week!
PAT	(can't believe his eyes) No!
GUY #1	Uh, Jake you better get your brother.
GUY #2	Cuckoo bird's takin' off.
PAT	Doctor Patel!
PAT	Hey! What are you doing here?
PAT	I'm not supposed to be seeing you, right? Outside the office?
PAT	That's illegal!
PAT	Hey, Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff.
JAKE	Look, two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin' Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage.
RONNIE	Okay, you know what? I don't have her phone number. If you want, if you really want, you can call Veronica `cause she does, but I don't want to talk to Veronica.
PAT	Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?
RONNIE	Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down.
PAT	You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it.
PAT	You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.
PAT	Enough with awkwardness! I don't wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say.
RONNIE	You're right, man. You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, man.
FAN #1	Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go!
FAN #1	What the fuck? What's that smell?
FAN #1	Nasty Indian curry! This is America, baby! Go back to your country!
PAT	What, what's wrong?
INDIAN MAN	Hey!
RONNIE	Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
JAKE	Stay back, Pat. Stay back.
JAKE	Leave the fucking Indians alone.
RONNIE	Stay here, stay here!
PAT	I'm not gonna go anywhere.
RONNIE	Don't get in a fight!
PAT	I'm not gonna fight. I'm not gonna fight.
PAT	Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey!
COP	Break it up or you'll be arrested!
PAT
DAD--	What the fuck happened?
PAT	Dad.
PAT	I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid now.
PAT	No, Dad! It's all fucking ruined now! It's all fucking ruined!
PAT	No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't! It's all ruined, you little fucking shit!
PAT	No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad! You loser! You loser!
PAT	I'm not a loser.
TIFFANY	We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!
PAT	Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany,
I--
TIFFANY	Oh, really?

TIFFANY	There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
JAKE	She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts.
TIFFANY	Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."
DOLORES	Oh Pat.
TIFFANY	Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
RONNIE	Unbelievable.
PAT	Wow. How did you know all that stuff?
TIFFANY	I did my research.
TIFFANY	Thank you.

TIFFANY	Against the Cowboys.
TIFFANY	That's your team isn't it, Randy?
PAT	That's his team!
TIFFANY	I know who his team is.
RANDY	When is the game?
TIFFANY	December twenty-eight, last game of the season.
PAT	Oh, my God.
TIFFANY	Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.
DOLORES	Oh God.
TIFFANY	Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?
RANDY	Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
DOLORES	No. No, Patrizio--

TIFFANY	They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.
RANDY	Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good?
PAT	We suck.
TIFFANY	We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.
RANDY	And how are the people you're competing against?
TIFFANY	They're good. Some of them are professionals.
RANDY	They're good? Better than you?
PAT	A lot better.
RANDY	A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right?
PAT	No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away--
TIFFANY	Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!
PAT	We can't get five!

PAT	What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.
TIFFANY	You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the
SIGNS--
PAT	If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.
DOLORES	Pat!
TIFFANY	You are not a stand up guy!
DOLORES	Pat!
DOLORES	I told you not to push it.
DOLORES	You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it.
TIFFANY	There's only one way to get him to show.
DOLORES	Oh, what's that?
TIFFANY	We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there.
DOLORES	She won't come. She can't come.
TIFFANY	We have to tell him that she's coming.
DOLORES	But that's a lie!
TIFFANY	It's a white lie.
TIFFANY	There's no other way.
DOLORES	No. I don't approve. You can't do it.
TIFFANY	We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there. You gotta be part of it.
TIFFANY	We have to do it.
DOLORES	Aren't you nervous to be lying?
TIFFANY	Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best.
PAT	"...but if it was me reading the signs...."
DOLORES	Okay.
TIFFANY	Hey.
PAT	Hey, what's up? Sorry I'm late.
TIFFANY	It's fine.
TIFFANY'S MOTHER	Is everything all right?
TIFFANY	This isn't working!
TIFFANY	Stupid!
TIFFANY	This just isn't working!
PAT	Come on, it's gonna be great. Nikki's gonna be there. You know? Everything's gonna come together. It's what's meant to be. You okay?
PAT	Don't get wobbly on me.
TIFFANY	I'm not.
PAT	We have a dance to do. We have a parlay. You gotta stay focused.
TIFFANY	I'm focused.
PAT	Okay, let's go.
PAT	Look at the dancers. You see them?
TIFFANY	Shit.
JAKE	Dallas just tied with another field goal, three-three. I'm worried about the bet.
JAKE	I'm worried about the bet.
DOLORES	Well, you knew that. Maybe you should've scouted `em.
RANDY	Look at those fucking dancers! You can give me the money now, you know? Patty, Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a five. That's all. You stay here and watch the game with me.
TIFFANY	The birds are better when Pat is with me. We settled that.
PAT	Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay? I'll see you in a little bit. I'll see you up there, okay?
DANNY	Hey, Pat, Tiffany!
PAT	Hey.
DANNY	What a glorious, beautiful occasion, man.
PAT	Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy, I'll see you. Alright. Wish me luck, man.
PAT	(Notices he and Tiffany are holding hands) Wait, what's this?
TIFFANY	What? I thought you were doing it.
PAT	Oh, I thought you were doing it. We're doing a dance thing anyway, for God's sake.
PAT	You okay?
TIFFANY	I want you to remember everything. I want you to remember all of the good stuff that we have here.
PAT	Of course I do.
TIFFANY	Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica.
PAT	Hi, good evening.
MALE OFFICIAL	Evening.
PAT	Check in? How many dancers are there?
TIFFANY	What?! Nikki? Nikki. Oh, Jesus.
TIFFANY	What the fuck?
VERONICA	Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.
TIFFANY	You're killing me. You're killing me!
VERONICA	Tiffany, please. She'll see how well he's doing, maybe she'll lift the restraining order.
TIFFANY	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
RONNIE	Pat told me. He told me you should never throw a marriage out the window.
TIFFANY	Pat did not say that. He didn't say that.
RONNIE	He said it several times, Tiffany, and this is his chance. You gotta give him a chance.
TIFFANY	Bartender! Bartender, can I get a vodka, please?
TIFFANY	Sure.
TIFFANY	So what do you do?
TIFFANY	Oh, the arguing kind.
SPORTS ANNOUNCER	Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats Dallas! They are on their way to the playoffs.
DANNY	Randy, what the fuck is happening, man?!
DOLORES	Where's Tiffany?
PAT	I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her?
DOLORES	You gotta find her.
PAT	I know, Mom, I know.
PAT	Hey, WHAT are you doing?
PAT	She's fine?
PAT	Why don't you shut up, okay?
PAT	How many drinks have you had?
TIFFANY	I've had two vodkas.
PAT	Listen, I don't know what choices you've made, but you gotta deal with it right now, okay? We're in this.
TIFFANY	We're in what?
EMCEE	Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell.
TIFFANY	You know, I used to think that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, but now I think that you might maybe be the worst thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you.
PAT	Good for you.
EMCEE	And the scores for Makarov and Tretiak are: six point seven, eight point one, seven point five and six point five for an average score of seven point two.
RONNIE	They were great and they only got a seven point two. This is a tough room.
TIFFANY	Got it.
EMCEE	Up next, ladies and gentlemen please welcome Pat Solatano, Jr. and Tiffany Maxwell.
DANNY	Damn.
JAKE	Let's go, Patty!
DANNY	Come on, Pat!
RONNIE	Yeah, Pat! Yeah!
JAKE	We love you, Pat!
EMCEE	Alright, let's see the scores for Solatano and Maxwell.
EMCEE	We have a four point nine, four eight, a four nine...
FEMALE DANCER	That's really too bad, guys. That's a lot of fours.
EMCEE	...and and a five point four for an average score of..five point zero.
MALE DANCER	Sorry about that, guys.
RANDY	What?! Come on!
PAT	Dad, Dad, did the Eagles win?
RANDY	Come on!
EMCEE	Why are they so excited about a five?
EMCEE	We'll take a ten minute break.
TIFFANY	Thank you! You're amazing!
PAT	Thank you for coming.
NIKKI	Of course.
PAT	How are you? You okay?
NIKKI	Good. How are you?
PAT	I'm really good. Yeah, thanks.
NIKKI	You looked really happy out there.
PAT	Did I?
NIKKI	Yeah.
PAT	Yeah, who'd have thought, dancing?
NIKKI	You look incredible.
PAT	Thank you.
NIKKI	You lost a lot of weight.
PAT	I've been reading your books and, I have a positive attitude. I'm on medication, I'm in therapy.
PAT	Where's Tiffany?
PAT	What do you mean, she left?
PAT	Where is she?
PAT	I love you, Dad.
PAT	Hey!
TIFFANY	Would you just leave me alone?!
PAT	Wait a second!
PAT	I have one more letter for you to read, okay?
TIFFANY	What the fuck is the matter with you? Give it to her yourself!
PAT	Let me say something. You don't ever have to see me again if you just read it, alright?
TIFFANY	This is so fucked up.
PAT	Yeah, just read it.
TIFFANY	"Dear Tiffany...
TIFFANY	"...I know you wrote the letter. (long pause) The only way you could meet my crazy...."
PAT	"...was by doing something crazy yourself. Thank you. I love you. I knew it the minute I met you. I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up. I just got stuck. Pat." I wrote that a week ago.
TIFFANY	You wrote that a week ago?
PAT	Yes, I did.
TIFFANY	You let me lie to you for a week?
PAT	I was trying to be romantic.
TIFFANY	You love me?
PAT	Yeah, I do.
TIFFANY	Okay.
PAT
PAT
RANDY	I'd like to do another parlay if we make it to the next round, that's all.
RONNIE	No, that was me that did that.
JAKE	No that was me.
RONNIE	That was me. I played the Jack.
DANNY	So you put the bread crumbs, the garlic in the steak and you roll it up with the toothpicks?
DOLORES	Yeah. For, oh, maybe three hours, plus. Everything's good, everything's good, yeah. I got you, you're all down. (pause) No, Randy, he's complaining. You know he lost a lot of money. He's moaning and groaning. The restaurant's happening because of Randy, so everything's good.
