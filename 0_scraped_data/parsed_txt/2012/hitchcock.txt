Hitchcock

ED GEIN	You can't leave us, Henry. She needs both of us
HENRY GEIN	Can you stop being a momma's boy for one second? ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Good evening.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Mere Technicolor baubles. LEW WASSERMAN	This thing is going to be gigantic. I wish I had twenty percent of the take.
REPORTER ONE	Does tonight's incredible reaction surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	No, when I was planning North by Northwest I could already hear the screams and laughter. (then, to a BEAUTIFUL
BLONDE FAN)	Any questions, my dear? REPORTER TWO	Mr. Hitchcock, you've directed forty-six motion pictures. You host a hit TV show seen around the world. You're the most famous director in the history of the medium... but you're sixty years old. Shouldn't you just quit while you're ahead? ALMA	Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms gouged out with arrows.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Talking of arrows, did you read Mr. Weiler's review in the New York Times? Apparently, he found "the climax" to be -- and I quote -- "overdrawn."
ALMA	I doubt whether Mr. Weiler has had a climax in years.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	And how about this little grenade?	North by Northwest reminds us of Hitchcock's earlier, more youthfully inventive spy thrillers."	And just to drive the nail into the coffin, there's a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense.
ALMA	Don't be maudlin, you know how much it aggravates me.
ALMA	Stop reading them. You've been reading them for a week now. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Tell me, dear. Am I really too old?
ALMA	Yes. A true relic. And lest we forget, a notably corpulent one.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	You always know precisely where to plunge the dagger, don't you?
ALMA	Right between the shoulder blades. I learned it from your pictures.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Where are you off to?
ALMA	I'm seeing Whit for brunch after I drop you off at the studio. Why don't you join us?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	We've just established that I'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight.
ALMA	You'll feel better as soon as you find a project. Hasn't Peggy unearthed any decent books yet?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Sleeping pills with dust jackets.
ALMA	Well?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Very presentable. ALMA	Hurry up, darling. You're pruning.
FIRST GUARD	Mr. Hitchcock. Mrs. Hitchcock.
ALMA	There's a story out there waiting for you somewhere, Hitch. I promise.
ALMA	Don't forget your lunch.
PEGGY	Fox is offering you The Diary of Anne Frank for the third time.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	The audience would spend the entire picture waiting for Miss Frank to discover the corpse I'd hidden in the attic. Wouldn't you agree, Silvio?
SILVIO	Si.
PEGGY	MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book, Casino Royale, with Cary Grant. Definitely your style.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	(again, turning to Silvio) Doesn't she know I just made that movie? It's called North by Northwest. And "style" is merely self-plagiarism. PEGGY	I'll see what I can find.
WHITFIELD COOK	... Thank God I had a pocketful of pretzels. I was hiding in that props cupboard all night.	That'll teach me to use a bedroom set instead of the real thing.
ALMA	Serves you right.
ALMA	Hitch always said your private life was in danger of being more entertaining than any of your plots.
WHITFIELD COOK	I can't believe he let me have you all to myself for a whole afternoon. Especially looking this beautiful.
ALMA	All this relentless sycophancy is giving me indigestion.
ALMA	What are you after?
ALMA	And how is your wife?
WHITFIELD COOK	Elizabeth? (his eyes return to Alma) Over the moon since I promised her the dedication in my new novel. So what are you working on these days?
ALMA	Hitch is going out of his mind looking for his next project. You know how unbearable he is when he doesn't have something lined up.
WHITFIELD COOK	Almost as unbearable as when he does.
ALMA	Almost.
WHITFIELD COOK	I meant you. What are you working on?
ALMA	I'm satisfied spending time in my garden.
WHITFIELD COOK	That is one lucky garden.
ALMA	Ah. All is finally revealed. WHITFIELD COOK	The most fun I ever had was working with you.
ALMA	I suppose I could give it a look.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Anything. Anything at all?
PEGGY	Nothing suitable. Is that water or do I need to call Alma?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Gin. Mother's ruin. PEGGY	It sounds ghastly. Everyone in town's already passed.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	And who is everyone?
PEGGY	The story department finished the coverage this morning.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Is this the one based on Ed Gein, the serial killer?
PEGGY	You're kidding.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Peggy. This is the boy who dug up his own mother.
ALMA	Hungry?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Famished. ALMA	Whit gave me the galleys of his new book yesterday at lunch. I've already got some ideas on how you could adapt it.
ALMA	It's elegant, sophisticated, full of
INTRIGUE --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook?
ALMA	This might be the one, Alfred.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Leave it on the night stand.
ALMA	There are calories in that, you know.
ED GEIN	Aren't you cold, ma? ALMA	Oh God.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Read the bit in the motel bathroom.
ALMA	Now?
ALMA	"Mary started to scream, and then the curtains parted further and a hand appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It was the knife that, a moment later, cut off her scream... and her head." (handing him back the book) Charming. Doris Day should do it as a musical.
ALMA	This is nothing but low-budget horror movie claptrap.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	But what if someone really good made a horror movie? ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Just think of the shock value. Killing off your leading lady halfway through.
ALMA	Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.
ALMA	You shouldn't wait till halfway through... Kill her off after 30 minutes.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Peggy, I want you to summon your minions...
PEGGY	Minions. Certainly. And who might they be...?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Get them started buying copies of "Psycho."
PEGGY	How many do you need?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	All of them. I want every copy, nationwide.
PEGGY	All that celery's affecting your brain.
PEGGY	Are you sure about this? This is so unlike you.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	That's exactly the point, my dear. HITCHCOCK	That is my intention, madam. Yes.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I only wish he looked more like William Holden and less like Elmer Fudd.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I was hoping everyone would. I mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't it? PEGGY	... How she deals with a demanding boss when she's trying to relax on her weekends off?
LEW WASSERMAN	(re: the faces of the
GOSSIP COLUMNISTS)	I told you, Hitch. This thing's strictly for the drive-in crowd.
WHITFIELD COOK	Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture what would two characters like us, married to other people, be saying?
ALMA	You don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know.
WHITFIELD COOK	I'm a big boy. I can take it.
ALMA	Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it must have been to research.
WHITFIELD COOK	Certainly more fun than reading those reviews.	Do you think he really will read it?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I wonder how that could have happened.
LEW WASSERMAN	I've seen happier faces on a school bus going over a cliff.
PEGGY	I told you it would be too much.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	But they can't stop looking, can they?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Audiences want to be shocked, Barney. They want something different. And this is it.
BARNEY BALABAN	The truth is, Hitch, every time you want to do something "different" like The Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses money.
LEW WASSERMAN	So we should stop trying to give them something new?
BARNEY BALABAN	You owe Paramount one last picture, Hitch. Can't you do something like North by Northwest but for us this time instead of for MGM?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	"Psycho."
BARNEY BALABAN	No one respects the name Hitchcock more than Paramount. But even a talented man sometimes backs the wrong horse. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Are you telling me "no?"
BARNEY BALABAN	I think you know me better than that, Hitch. I would never say "no" to you.
LEW WASSERMAN	What a putz. You know what his family did before they built those movie palaces? Ran a grocery store.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	My father ran a grocery store.
LEW WASSERMAN	Exactly. That's what I'm saying. He should show some respect.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	They think I've lost my touch, Lew. My association with television has cheapened me.
LEW WASSERMAN	Are you referring to that deal I got you where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine grand an episode and you own the negative? That's my kind of cheap.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	They just want the same thing over and over. They've put me in a coffin and now they're nailing down the lid.
LEW WASSERMAN	Hitch, I will never let that happen. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Eight hundred thousand... Give or take.
LEW WASSERMAN	I have whisky in the car.
ALMA	You're back early.
ALMA	I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	What about him?
ALMA	He knows you well enough.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it for that much longer.
ALMA	Why? ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Paramount refuses to finance the movie. Imagine -- The studio that brought you Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On Earth considers Psycho distasteful.
ALMA	Why not wait?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	We're going to have to go it alone, old girl.	We'll finance the movie ourselves.
ALMA	Are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool?
ALMA	Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why this one, Hitch? It's not just because so many people are telling you 'no,' is it?
ALMA	Hitch?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time? We took risks, we experimented. We invented new ways of making pictures because we had to. LEW WASSERMAN	We finance it. Independently. Paramount only distributes it...in exchange for 40 percent of the profits.
BARNEY BALABAN	Interesting. But tell us, what exactly is Paramount distributing? Is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother's dress?
LEW WASSERMAN	What this picture is about is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock.
BARNEY BALABAN	No-one's arguing that.
LEW WASSERMAN	Barney, it's very simple. This is Mr. Hitchcock's next film. Are you in or are you out?
BARNEY BALABAN	Well, obviously you have a lot of passion for this project. Let me talk it over with a few people internally and I'll get back to you. LEW WASSERMAN	No. Now.
BARNEY BALABAN	Fine. We'll take that deal. If you can get the money...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	We've already got it, Barney.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	If this picture fails, Alma, we'll be in for a long, humiliating bout of crow- eating.
ALMA	The movie will be splendid.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Are you sure?
ALMA	Of the movie? Not in the least. But of you? Unquestionably.
JOSEPH STEFANO	Joe Stefano. Good to meet you. PEGGY	I thought only director's assistants needed psychiatrists, not writers.
JOSEPH STEFANO	Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	No.
JOSEPH STEFANO	The usual: sex. Rage. My mother.
ACCOUNTANT	There's still the federal income tax payments... the property taxes... Not to mention the absence of any salary while he's actually making the film...
ALMA	Stop waffling, Donald. Give it to me straight. ACCOUNTANT	Hitch wasn't exaggerating. If the film's a flop, you're going to have to sell the house.
ALMA	Where do you suggest we cut?
ACCOUNTANT	Anywhere you can.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I got Joe Stefano to write out the first few scenes. Why don't you take a look?
ALMA	We're about to have dinner. You don't need anything else.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Well?
ALMA	Hire him. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	The only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is one to the censor.
ALMA	Whatever you do, Alfred, don't lose your temper.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	The Code will absolutely not permit you to show a knife penetrating a woman's flesh.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are always models of taste and discretion.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	Is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a shower cap. GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	We might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window with Marion in silhouette above the shoulders -- provided the glass is frosted.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It's completely necessary. Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister. It's a clue to the girl's disappearance.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	No American movie has ever found it "necessary" to show a toilet, let alone to flush it.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead?
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you a seal, and we're certainly heading in that direction, your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country. Will you be making jokes then? ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Everyone in Hollywood resents me. I make them millions... and yet every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners, waiting for them to say, just once, "You're good."
ANALYST'S VOICE	That must hurt.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Deeply.
ANALYST'S VOICE	Take your time.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It's just that, more and more lately, I've been having these... impulses.
ANALYST'S VOICE	What kind of impulses?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Strong ones. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Send them all back to Glendale.
PEGGY	The Lazar Office tells me he's crazy to work with you. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Well, tell "Swifty" he shouldn't have overexposed his client on television.
ALMA	Unlike certain people we could mention.
ALMA	Think of the duality he could bring to Norman. The rage lurking behind that little-boy-lost grin. The winsome charm he uses to keep from being found out.
PEGGY	Why, Alma, you're not suggesting that Mr. Perkins is -- ?
ANTHONY PERKINS	I can't count how many times I've seen Strangers On a Train and Rope.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Well, Norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies. Appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not.
ANTHONY PERKINS	My only worry is that playing Norman might cut too close to home.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	How so? ANTHONY PERKINS	I was incredibly close to my mother. So close I remember wishing my father would drop dead. And then when I was five, he did just that...He keeled over from a heart attack.	You see I've been guilty my whole life, Mr. Hitchcock.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Try to remember this is all just make believe.
ANTHONY PERKINS	Not to be prudish, but how far do you plan to push Norman's relationship with his mother?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Further than you can possibly imagine.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I'm getting blisters just looking at you.
ALMA	Stop grumbling. A bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	If I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl, they'd let me get away with anything.
ALMA	Well you can't. She's a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	And all the more desirable.
ALMA	Lew suggested Deborah Kerr.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Too... Scottish.
ALMA	What about Janet Leigh? She's always the `good girl' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans' parties? ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar.
JANET LEIGH	You know, I've been so immersed in preparing to play Marion I'd almost forgotten how to laugh.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Now, you must try the banana shortcake.
JANET LEIGH	Nothing for me, thank you. I'm watching my figure.
ALMA	You're not the only one. (to the waiter) We're fine, thank you.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Bring her the banana shortcake, George. In fact make it two large portions.
JANET LEIGH	I've written a complete history for her...It seems silly, but it helps me. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It doesn't sound silly at all. Tell me one of her deepest secrets.
JANET LEIGH	She leads a double life. For instance, when she works at the Lowery office, she wears Tweed perfume. But, when she and Sam are together, she recklessly breaks out her one expensive bottle -- "My Sin" by Lanvin.
ALMA	You and the Shurlock Office.
JANET LEIGH	It's just... I mean even if you shoot me from here -- (she indicates a spot just above her bosom) -- well it's not as if my figure is boyish.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Allow me to put your mind at rest.
ALMA	If you'll excuse me.
ALMA	Oh, come off it, old girl.
ALMA	Hello Lillian. ALMA	Don't upset yourself, darling. It's only a bloody movie.
ALMA	I've made a list of places where we can tighten our belt.
ALMA	It wouldn't hurt for us all to learn the art of self restraint.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	The gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver? No. Absolutely not. We'll find other places to cut.
ALMA	There aren't any other places. And furthermore, they'll be no more shipments from Maxim's either. We can't afford it.
ALMA	The foie gras at Chasen's is more than adequate.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	But those geese are from Barstow not Marseilles. ALMA	We all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good, don't we, Alfred?
ED GEIN	Stay here. I'm going to get the knives.
DEAD WOMAN	Help me.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Ed! Ed!
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Ed... Ed...? ALMA	Oh, shut up. Just get the first take under your belt you'll be fine.
PEGGY	I still can't believe you cast Vera Miles as the sister.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I've still got her under contract. I may as well get something out of it.
PEGGY	Rather a thankless role, don't you think?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	For an utterly thankless girl. PEGGY	Shurlock's office called again. They want to know when you'll be making the changes to the script.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	The more we frustrate them the more their interest will wane. VERA MILES	Break it to me gently. Am I playing a lesbian librarian?
RITA RIGGS	(re: the fabric) He chose it himself and had it imported from Paris.
VERA MILES	If I wear that, I'm going to look like George Washington.
RITA RIGGS	Wait until you see the undergarments he picked out for you.
VERA MILES	I just have to keep telling myself, one more picture and I'm free as a bird.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Are you decent my dear?
JANET LEIGH	Am I alright? ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Perfect.
ANTHONY PERKINS	I want to thank you again for this opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It's just "Hitch", Tony. Hold the cock.
JANET LEIGH	And we're about to move to a whole new neighborhood.
VERA MILES	Morning Janet. Morning Tony.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	(already moving past her) That's hand-woven imported camel hair from Rodier. Don't you approve?
VERA MILES	You're the genius. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Everyone's is. Until Alma finishes the revisions. Now hurry along, Vera. You're just in time for the oath.
VERA MILES	The what?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I solemnly promise...
CREW	I solemnly promise...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	(ignoring Vera's sarcasm) That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho...
CREW	That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	To friends, relatives, trade reporters or columnists -- not even to outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless him. ANTHONY PERKINS	Now, Hitch, explain to me why I'm watching Marion undress?
JANET LEIGH	I feel like I should take offense at that.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I don't know...Perhaps as a boy, Norman secretly watched his mother preparing for her nightly bath.
JANET LEIGH	Maybe there was a transom over the bathroom door?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Yes -- one he could access with a chair so long as he was stealthy.
JANET LEIGH	Well, a boy's first glimpse of a naked woman is usually his mother. ANTHONY PERKINS	So...I'm reliving the past, repeating a ritual with Marion?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	You're the actor. You figure it out.
JANET LEIGH	Hitch, I have a question. Why is the hole much larger on this side?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	All the better to see you at the greatest possible angle my dear...
JANET LEIGH	Wow. You really do your research, don't you?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It's just my Jesuit work ethic.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	... and if I'm not working then I'm nothing. I'm not even a person. I'm just a collection of molecules. A useless cylinder of ugly flesh. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	My mother? Yes.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	To her, movie people were akin to thieves and prostitutes.	The Oscar is your mother.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	You're a fine one to talk. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	You will be wearing a white bra like this for the opening scene on the bed. And then after you've stolen the money...
JANET LEIGH	I switch to one of these.
RITA RIGGS	Are you sure you don't want to look at something a little more elegant?
HITCHCOCK	No. They have to look like they were bought at Sears and Roebuck. I want every woman in the audience to look up at Janet having sex with John Gavin and think, `that could be me'.
JANET	This is the brand I wear.
HITCHCOCK	We're ready for a fitting.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself...
PEGGY	Good luck getting this one past the censor.
WHITFIELD COOK	You girls go on ahead.
PEGGY	If you ask me, the credits should read "Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Alma Reville."
ALMA	The people who matter know. That's all that counts.
PEGGY	I'd hate to see Shurlock's face when he reads this.
PEGGY	Alma, you always know the answer. Is this really going to work?
WHITFIELD COOK	Hello, stranger.
ALMA	Whit.
WHITFIELD COOK	Where have you been hiding yourself?
ALMA	I've been doing the revisions on... WHITFIELD COOK	Psycho.	And how is the old boy?
ALMA	In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he's back on the set.
WHITFIELD COOK	And you? How are you?
ALMA	Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to do for Reader's Digest on what it's like to be married to a man obsessed by murder.
WHITFIELD COOK	I've got a better idea.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I'll be right there. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Was there a line at the market?
ALMA	No. Actually, I'm back sooner than I expected.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Would you like a cocktail?
ALMA	No. (he starts to head off) And you shouldn't either.
ALMA	Those haven't been washed yet.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I don't care.	I was filming all day with John Gavin -- a good-looking chap but, really, plywood is more expressive. His love scene with Janet may be most horrifying thing in the picture. ALMA	You should tell Whit that. He'd be flattered.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Maybe I was too dismissive about your friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it.
ALMA	I'll see how my day shapes up.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	... You think they can't tell... but they can. They know. It's all closing in on you. The noose is tightening...
YOU--
VERA MILES	Have you talked to him much about your personal life? JANET LEIGH	Not really...
VERA MILES	I'd keep it that way if I were you. (Off Janet's look) He starts by choosing your hairstyle and clothes and then he wants to choose your friends and decide how many children you should have.
JANET LEIGH	Compared to Orson Welles, he's a sweetheart.
VERA MILES	See? He's always watching.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	What's the hold up?
PEGGY	It's still engaged.
VERA MILES	Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene. I don't know how strongly I should confront Sam and the detective and I --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Fake it. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It's different when their pay is coming out of your own pocket.
ALMA	What would I do without you?
WHITFIELD COOK	Till then, bye.
ALMA	What did you forget now? PR FLACK	Mr. Hitchcock, every press outlet is driving us crazy for photos --
PEGGY	Are you okay? You've gone very pale.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get me something long, cool and wet.
PEGGY	It's not even three.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Give me the key!
BARNEY BALABAN	Hello, Hitch. How's the picture? I'm hearing interesting things...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It's a wonder you can hear anything over the noise coming from the Shurlock office.
BARNEY BALABAN	I shouldn't be in a position of just hearing things, Hitch. It's time you showed me some footage.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Why? BARNEY BALABAN	To see if you're making a picture Paramount can actually release.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	As you well know, Barney, my contract guarantees me final cut.
BARNEY BALABAN	Your contract also says Paramount isn't required to distribute any film that could cause us embarrassment.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis pictures you're all so proud of.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Connect me to Maxim's of Paris.	Yes, it's Alfred Hitchcock in Hollywood, California, Jean-Claude. I need three pounds of foie gras sent on the next flight out.	That's correct. Three. WHITFIELD COOK	Those steaks haven't changed at all, have they?
ALMA	It's so nice not to have to take care of someone, even if it's just for an hour or two.
ALMA	Whit, where are we going? You still haven't told me.
WHITFIELD COOK	I have a little surprise.
ALMA	A surprise. How fun.
JANET LEIGH	What happened to your driver?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I've been asking myself the same thing.
JANET LEIGH	I can give you a ride if you want.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the design for this car on Ferdinand Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin beer garden?
JANET LEIGH	I didn't.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It's only now that I truly appreciate just how diabolical Herr Hitler was.
JANET LEIGH	Help yourself. (letting him in on it) I pinched them from Tony's dressing room.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	So this is what they eat at the drive- ins...
JANET LEIGH	I thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Needs must when the devil drives, my dear. ALMA	I don't mind that he uses his obsession to fuel his art. I just don't like it when he uses it against me.
WHITFIELD COOK	He's like any great artist. Impossible to live with but worth the effort. (he throws a rock into the
SEA)	Van Gogh wasn't exactly a walk in the park either.
ALMA	Did you know when we started out I was his boss? He didn't even dare ask me out until he'd worked his way up to assistant director.
WHITFIELD COOK	What do you think of that place over there?
ALMA	Looks nice. Terrific location. Why?
WHITFIELD COOK	It's mine.
ALMA	I just saw Elizabeth. Why on earth didn't she tell me?
WHITFIELD COOK	She doesn't know about it. JANET LEIGH	So what did happen between you and Vera?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I was going to make her star. But she chose the life of a housewife.
WHITFIELD COOK	I'm just leasing it for the offseason. A place to get away from the wife and kid and write.
ALMA	Very Bohemian.
WHITFIELD COOK	You might find that room interesting.
ALMA	Whit. I hope you haven't got the wrong idea. WHITFIELD COOK	If you were serious about helping me adapt my book, I thought it would be the perfect hideaway. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	So I read your finished treatment. "Taxi to -- " Where was it?
ALMA	Dubrovnik.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	That's it. Dubrovnik. Care to hear my opinion?
ALMA	Yes. Naturally. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	There's no other way of saying it. It's stillborn. Dead in the water.
ALMA	How so?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	(with mock compassion) The plot's a muddle. Some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in The Lady Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine.
ALMA	How would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Look at this mess. SET HAND	Tell the boss we're ready.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	What's the hold-up? Call time was two hours ago.
JANET LEIGH	And you're sure this moleskin will stay put?
RITA RIGGS	Mr. Hitchcock promised. JANET LEIGH	It better. I'm going to be taking a shower all week.
ALMA	Forget what Hitch said. He's just feeling his age. He'll come around.
WHITFIELD COOK	But he's right. It does need more feeling.
ALMA	So why don't we put some in?
ALMA	All we need is a better catalyst. Some innocuous little trigger to release all that underlying desire.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Good morning.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Ah. There's our murderess.	Are you ready for our little bloodbath?
JANET LEIGH	My mother always said, "Have confidence in yourself and you can lick anything."
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	My mother used to say the same thing.	Let's go for a take. Quiet everyone.	Cut. Cut camera. CREW MEMBER	Ready, sir.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Print. We've got it.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Not now, Ed. It's really not a good time.
ED GEIN	You just can't keep this stuff bottled up.
PEGGY	Oh God... WHITFIELD COOK	What if Helen and Michael try and get into the cab at the same time?
ALMA	Even better, what if they reached for the cab door at exactly the same time?
ALMA	That way, we could start close on the hands... (tracking the movement) ... and then tilt up to the eyes.
WHITFIELD COOK	That feels better already.
ALMA	Are you going to get that? PEGGY	I know you told me only to call in an emergency, but I'm not sure how else to describe this.
MARTIN BALSAM	It's official. The inmates are running the asylum.
PEGGY	Hilton. I have Mr. Hitchcock for you.
HILTON GREEN	Hey there, Hitch. We're still working on it. (looking over at the
CONTINUING ARGUMENT)	Everyone misses you. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I've told Peggy and now I'm going to tell you. You have to get this sequence shot today. What's the hold up?
HILTON GREEN	We tried it ten different ways and it looks terrible. Why don't we use inserts?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	No. It has to be a high angle. You'll tip off the big surprise! Just get the process shot.
ALMA	No more phone calls. You're burning up.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Burning up our money. We're two days behind and I'm stuck in bed.
ALMA	Where do you think you're going?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	To the set. We can't afford to lose any more time. Two more days of this and the whole production goes under.
ALMA	You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I'd hate to take you away from your writing partner. ALMA	Under the blankets. Now.
ALMA	Don't stop work because of me. I'm only here as one of the two people paying your salaries.
ALMA	Scene?
PEGGY	One seventy three.
ALMA	Storyboards?
ALMA	Start with the overhead. We'll cut before the fall. Then we'll put Martin in a chair under the camera.
ALMA	(to the cameraman) And that lens should be a thirty-five.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	What do you mean?
ED GEIN	My mother always said if you're going to do a job, do it right.
ED GEIN	Check the floor. ALMA	Barney.
BARNEY BALABAN	Alma.
BARNEY	You know David Kirkpatrick. He's working on Jerry Lewis' next picture.
BARNEY	So he's free to help... (a sly smile) if you need it...
ALMA	That won't be necessary.
BARNEY	But you're nearly three days behind. BARNEY BALABAN	Alma. We both know what kind of film this is. (then, closer) The smart thing to do would be to help Hitch finish it.
ALMA	Thank you for your concern, Barney.
ALMA	But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only one director.
WOMAN'S VOICE	Mrs. Hitchcock?
JANET	I hope you don't mind. I heard Hitch was sick so I got him a little something.
ALMA	That's kind of you.
JANET	Well, he's been very considerate with me.	I haven't always had that from my directors.
ALMA	Janet, you've been very... professional. It hasn't gone unappreciated. ALMA	May I turn that down?
ALMA	You'll be pleased to know order has been restored.
ALMA	A thank you would be nice.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	We're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget.
ALMA	I already cancelled the wrap party. That'll save us two thousand right there. And you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Beware -- all men are potential murderers. ALMA	Alright, what's this about?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Spending a lot of time at the beach?
ALMA	That's where Whit and I are writing. He's rented a place.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions.
ALMA	Actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I already told you -- that treatment is a waste of time.
ALMA	Didn't everyone say the same thing about "Psycho"?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Are you and Whit having an affair?
ALMA	Don't be absurd. He's working on something new and needs a little help, that's all.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	What a coincidence. I'm working on something new and I could use a little help too.
ALMA	What do you think I've been doing? ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage, talentless mamma's boy?
ALMA	Because it's fun.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I am under extraordinary pressures on this picture, the least you can do is give me your full support.
ALMA	Full support? We've mortgaged our house. My house.
ALMA	Might I remind you that I have weighed-in on every aspect of this film so far, as I have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades. And the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want. I celebrate with you if the reviews are good and I cry for you if they are not. I host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies. And when you're out promoting this film around the world, I will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when I'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if I were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious "Alfred Hitchcock."
ALMA	Now, for the first time in years, I dare to work on something that isn't "an Alfred Hitchcock Production" and I'm met with accusation and criticisms. This work I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose.
ALMA	And even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma Reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh-so- specific direction.
VERA MILES	Free at last. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Well, Vera. You always make it look so easy.
VERA MILES	Oh, it was nothing, Hitch. I just faked it.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Why didn't you stay with me? I would have made you as big a star as Grace Kelly.
VERA MILES	Unlike Grace Kelly, I can pick up my dry cleaning. I've got a family, Hitch. A home. That will always mean more to me than all of this.	That blonde woman of mystery you're after? She's a fantasy. She doesn't exist.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	There was a time when I thought I understood you so completely -- understood women....
WHITFIELD COOK	Alma, I thought you were coming later tonight.
ALMA	I thought you rented this place so we could write.
WHITFIELD COOK	I did. I swear -- this just happened.
ALMA	Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.
WHITFIELD COOK	I mean to Hitch. ALMA	Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	You're going to have to cut all that nudity.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	What nudity? It was suggested.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	I definitely saw that knife jabbing her.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	We did no such shot.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	I'd stake my reputation on it. I'm recommending you cut the shower scene entirely. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I'll go over it frame by frame and set up another screening.
LEW WASSERMAN	Let's just say it was a four-letter review and it wasn't `good'.
ALMA	Is there anything else we can do? ACCOUNTANT	We'll just have to wait and see how the movie turns out.
ALMA	Well, it is only a house. ED GEIN	This is my favorite place. I just shut the doors and leave the world behind.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Don't you get lonely out here sometimes?
ED GEIN	I can always talk to my mother.
ED GEIN	They can't go in there. That's my mother's room...	That's my mother's room!!
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	An odd little movie. Of course, Colbert is wonderful.
ALMA	Cold and miserable. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Just like Barney Balaban's face.	And neither am I.	There's no other way to say it... It's stillborn.
ALMA	I don't think I can stand both of us being maudlin.
ALMA	There is one solution to all this, you know.
ALMA	We could both get to work -- together.
ALMA	That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation I've been helping Whit finish is done.
ALMA	So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping Psycho into shape tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Except for you.
ALMA	You'll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after she's supposed to be dead.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	We've seen the footage a thousand times. She doesn't blink.
ALMA	Take thirty frames off the head...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	No, no, the second take, the light is better on his hands.
ALMA	Only cut back to Janet once the car's already moving.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one person I've lost the whole audience. ALMA	You imp. You got nudity in there.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Her breasts are very large, dear. It was a challenge not to show them.
GEORGE TOMASINI	I'll be damned. She did blink.
FLACK	How's it going in there with Mr. Herrmann?
PEGGY	Swimmingly.
FLACK	Everyone's saying it's a dog with fleas.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	...I don't want music in the shower murder.
BERNARD HERRMANN	But what Alma and I talked about is really going to play.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	No. This isn't Vertigo, Bernie. This is different. The images have to work on their own. ALMA	You can't scare people just by going, "Boo!" You have to tell them what's coming, make them anticipate it --
FLACK	Thank God we've got Cinderfella for the holidays.
GEORGE TOMASINI	What do you think?
PEGGY	I think I'm never going to take a shower again.
GEORGE TOMASINI	Hitch?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	It's getting there. GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	I told you, I distinctly saw both the stabbing and the nudity. We're denying your seal, Mr. Hitchcock.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I take your opinion very seriously. But what you think you're seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion. I assure you that once you view the final version with Mr. Herrmann's lovely, lyrical score...
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	A "lyrical score" won't change my opinion. All that innuendo and half-naked groping -- really, Hitch.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Would you mind if we had a word in private, Geoffrey?
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK	My specifications?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	If only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency.
PEGGY	He's been harassing you since you announced this project, you invite him to the set, and he doesn't even show up? What did you tell him?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	That I respected him. Deeply.
JANET LEIGH	I thought we were reshooting the scene.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	No need. The charade is over.
JANET LEIGH	Not at all.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates she could have your dressing room.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	We have our seal from Shurlock's office.	Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter.
LEW WASSERMAN	The front office confirmed. They're only opening the movie in two theatres, as we suspected. And no premiere. If we don't get word of mouth we're dead.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take a memo... ALFRED HITCHCOCK	... a fire escape or through a skylight, you will be ejected by brute force.
ALMA	More playful, darling. BARNEY BALABAN	"Absolutely never, ever will I allow anything to follow Psycho -- no previews of coming attractions, no newsreel, no short subject and certainly no double- feature. Sincerely, and, emphatically, Alfred Hitchcock."
ALMA	Well, at least there are some people here.
PEGGY	We can go through the side entrance. THEATER MANAGER	Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Ready for the gallows?
LEW WASSERMAN	We've roped off some seats for you.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	You go on ahead.
ALMA	Are you sure?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I'll join you in a minute.
ALMA	Fine, darling. I'll save you a seat.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	(under his breath) But they're laughing too much. ALFRED HITCHCOCK	I promised Mother I wouldn't tell.
THEATER MANAGER	Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my wife won't take a shower after seeing your movie?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Have her dry-cleaned.
LEW WASSERMAN	I just got off the phone with Balaban. I couldn't resist telling him we're sold out for the next two weeks.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	What did he say?
LEW WASSERMAN	He said "Tell Hitch congratulations. A well deserved triumph as we always knew."
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	"As we always knew..."
PEGGY	Does this mean I can take the weekend off now?
THEATRE MANAGER	I'm sorry, Mr. Hithcock but there are photographers outside. They heard you were here. ALMA	This could be the biggest hit of your career, Alfred.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	Our career, Alma.
ALMA	You do realize I've been waiting decades to hear you say that.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	And that, madame, is why they call me "The Master of Suspense"... ORDERLY	(to the Attendant) Guess what I'm doing this weekend?
ATTENDANT	What?
ORDERLY	Claudine and I are driving to Chicago with her folks to see that Psycho movie.
CHET	I think you're the happiest guy I've ever known, Ed. How you do it?
ED GEIN	I'll tell you. You live your life, and it's unbearable sometimes but there's this secret, Chet; a big secret no one else knows or wants to tell... (he leans a little closer) ... there is a God and he's so big and powerful, he doesn't always remember you're there... ALFRED HITCHCOCK	And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say that we got to keep our house -- and the swimming pool. And the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK	But you know what they say in Hollywood: "You're only as good as your last picture." So, now, if you'll excuse me, I must toddle off to begin the exhaustive search for my next project.
