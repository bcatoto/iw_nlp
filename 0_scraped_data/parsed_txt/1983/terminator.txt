Terminator

TERMINATOR	Nice night for a walk.
SECOND PUNK	Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing clean, right?
TERMINATOR	Nothing clean.  Right.
LEADER	This guy's a couple bricks short.
TERMINATOR	Your clothes.  Give them to me.
TERMINATOR	Now.
SECOND PUNK	Fuck you, asshole.
DERELICT	Say, buddy...did you see a real bright light?
FIRST COP	Hold it, right there!
REESE	What day is it?  The date...
COP	Thursday...uh...May twelfth.
REESE	What year?
SARAH	Watch this for me, big buns.
BREEN	Sarah?
SARAH	Yes, Chuck?
BREEN	Come to the office, please.
SARAH	Mission control to Chuck, come in...
BREEN	You're late.
SARAH	Aren't I worth waiting for?
BREEN	Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
SARAH	I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
BREEN	The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
SARAH	Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
BREEN	Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
SARAH	Alright!
BREEN	Can you handle it?
SARAH	It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
BREEN	Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
SARAH	I won't let the fat kid down.
SARAH	Hi, I'm Sarah and I'll be you waitress. I'm so wholesome, I could puke.
TERMINATOR	...the Remington 1100 Autoloader...
CLERK	Anything else?
TERMINATOR	A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
CLERK	Just what you see, pal.
TERMINATOR	The Uzi 9 millimeter.
CLERK	You know your weapons, buddy.
CLERK	Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
TERMINATOR	All.
CLERK	Maybe I'll close early. Cash or charge?
CLERK	Sorry, I can't sell the ammo with the guns.  You'll have to---Hey!
CLERK	You can't to that...
TERMINATOR	Wrong.
MAN	Hey, man...
CUSTOMER	Honey, can I get that coffee now?
SARAH	Yes sir, just a second.
SARAH	Who gets the Burly Burger?
CUSTOMER TWO	I ordered Barbecue Beef.
CUSTOMER THREE	Does mine come with fires?
CUSTOMER FOUR	He's got the Barbecue Beef, I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe.
SARAH	Okay, who gets the Burly Beef?
CUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE	Miss, we're ready to order.
SARAH	Oh, sorry.  That's not real leather, is it?
NANCY	Look at it this way: in a hundred years, who's gonna care?
TERMINATOR	Sarah Connor?
WOMAN	No, she's upstairs.  Who shall I say is--
WOMAN	What do you think you're-- My God!
WOMAN	Oh my God...Sarah!
WRONG SARAH CONNOR	What is it, Mom?
TAKE-OUT CUSTOMER	Gimme a falafel with yogurt dressing and, uh, Baco-bits.
REESE	Gimme a falafel with, uh, yogurt and Baco-bits.
COUNTERMAN	That'll be one-sixty.
COUNTERMAN	Hey!  Son-of-a-bitch.
SARAH	I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
MR. MILLER	What's it to ya?
SARAH	You must have a girlfriend.
MR. MILLER	That's none of your business.
SARAH	Aha!  Is she young?
MR. MILLER	Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
SARAH	What's it to ya?
SARAH	I'm on break, Chuck.  Carla's got my station.
NANCY	Hurry up.  It's about you... I mean sort of...Come on!
WAITRESS	Hey, Sarah.  This is weird.
TV ANCHORWOMAN	...and a police spokesman at the scene refused to speculate on a motive for the execution- style slaying of the Encino housewife.  He did however say that an accurate description of the suspect has been compiled from several witnesses.  Once again, Sarah Connor, thirty-five, mother of two, brutally shot to death in her home this afternoon.
NANCY	You're dead, honey.
MARCO	Hi. I've seen you around. You're cute.  Cute I remember.
SARAH	I'm Sarah.  Ginger's roommate.
MARCO	Yeah, right.  I'm Marco.
GINGER	...and three aaand four!  And that's it ladies!  Now, didn't that feel good?
GINGER	Let's think positive or next time I'll play the FM version.
SARAH	...yeah, really?  Say some- thing in Italian.
GINGER	You're wasting your time, kiddo. Let's go.
SARAH	I don't believe you did that.
SARAH	I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
GINGER	That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
SARAH	I'll do the same for you sometime.
GINGER
GINGER	You think somebody's gonna do this for you?  Look at those shriveled bi's.  And you haven't worked lat's or ab's since Wednesday.
MATT	Hello, sweetheart.  Had a rough day?
GINGER	Come here, wimp.
SARAH	Hi, Matt.
MATT	Heeey!  It's my favorite Sarah.  Hi, babe.
GINGER	Alright, warm-ups are over. Back to work, Bunky.
MATT	'Bye beautiful.  You too, Ginger.
WEIGHTLIFTER	Bunky?
BOY	Hey, mister...?
SISTER	See, I told you he wasn't dead.  You owe me Baskin Robbins.
BOY	Come on.  Just come on.
SARAH	Hello?
VOICE	First I'm going to rip the buttons off your blouse, one by one...then run my tongue along your neck, down to your bare, gleaming breasts...
SARAH	Ginger!  It's Matt.
MATT	...and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles, further and further down... then I'll pull off your panties with my teeth...
SARAH	Who is this?
MATT	Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit. Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought you were...Can I talk to Ginger?
SARAH	Sure, Bunky.
GINGER	Hello?
MATT	First I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse...
SARAH	What do you think?
GINGER	Great.
SARAH	How about this?
GINGER	Great.
SARAH	You're a big help.
GINGER	Alright, the beige one.
SARAH	I hate the beige one.
GINGER	Don't wear the beige one.
SARAH	This guy's probably a schmuck and I don't care what I wear.
SARAH	You think the beige?
VUKOVICH	Give me the short version.
TRAXLER	Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
VUKOVICH	No shit.
TRAXLER	Come on. man.  Don't track it all over.  It's un- professional.
TRAXLER	Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
VUKOVICH	That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
TRAXLER	Here's her driver's license.
VUKOVICH	You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
TRAXLER	I hate the weird ones.
GINGER	Better than mortal man deserves.
SARAH	Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
GINGER	Not lately.  Did you check messages?
SARAH	I thought you did.
SARAH	Come here young man.  Mind your mother.
GINGER	Totally nauseating.
VOICE	Hi, Sarah...Stan Morsky. Uh, something's come up and it looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.  I'm really sorry.  Call you in a day or so. Sorry.  'Bye.
GINGER	That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
SARAH	I'll live.
GINGER	I'll break his kneecaps.
SARAH	You still love me, don't you, Pugsley?
SARAH	I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
GINGER	We will, kiddo.
REPORTER	...Lieutenant, are you aware that these two killings occurred in the same order as their listings in the phone book?
VUKOVICH	No comment.
TRAXLER	That stuff's two hours cold.
VUKOVICH	I know.
TRAXLER	I put a cigarette out in it.
VUKOVICH	Did you reach the next girl yet?
TRAXLER	No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
VUKOVICH	Send a unit.
TRAXLER	I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
VUKOVICH	Call her.
TRAXLER	I just called.
VUKOVICH	Call her again.
VUKOVICH	Got a cigarette?
GINGER'S VOICE	Hi there. Ha ha ha, fooled you. You're talking to a machine, but don't by shy, it's okay.  Machines need love too, so talk to it and Ginger, that's me, or Sarah will get back to you.  Wait for the beep.
TRAXLER	Same shit.
VUKOVICH	I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
TRAXLER	I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
VUKOVICH	To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
VUKOVICH	If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us. How do I look?
TRAXLER	Like shit, boss.
ANCHORMAN	...police had no further comment on the apparent similarity between the shooting death of an Encino woman earlier today...
ANCHORMAN	...and this almost identical killing two hours ago of a Venice resident with virtually the same name.  Sarah Ann Connor, a 24 year old legal secretary, was pronounced dead at the scene in her beachfront apartment...
CUSTOMER	Hey, can we change this and catch the ball scores.
BARTENDER	Sure.
SARAH	Leave it where it is!
ANCHORMAN	...no other connections between the two victims has been estab- lished. On a lighter note, these was cause for celebration at the L.A. Zoo today, as...
VOICE	You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department Emergency Number. All lines are busy.  If you need a police car sent out to you, please stay on the line...
DISPATCHER	...two eleven in progress at Seven-Eleven market, Third and Tamarac.  One suspect believed to be armed...
GINGER	Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a belt out of you.
MATT	Whoah!
GINGER'S VOICE	Hi there. Ha ha ha, fooled you.  You're talking to a machine...
GINGER'S VOICE	...but don't be shy, it's okay. Machines need love too...
GINGER'S VOICE	...so talk to it and Ginger, that's me, or Sarah will get back to you. Wait for the beep.
SARAH'S VOICE	Ginger, this is Sarah...
SARAH'S VOICE	...I'm in this sleazy bar called Stoker's on Pico but I'm too scared to leave.  I'm really scared, kiddo...
SARAH
SARAH	The number here is 468-9175. Call me, kiddo.  I need you. It's Stoker's on Pico. Bye.
SARAH	...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
VUKOVICH	I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you? Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
SARAH	Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
VUKOVICH	Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
VUKOVICH	Let's roll.
VUKOVICH	Let's see how this guy likes playing hard-ball.

COP	...I don't know, it looks like it might spread to this furniture warehouse across the alley, the paint on the wall's starting to blister up...
COP	Better get another truck round to this side.
SARAH	This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
REESE	No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
SARAH	I can't believe this is happen- ing.  How could than man get up after you...
REESE	Not a man.  A Terminator. Cyber Dynamics Model 101.
DISPATCHER	...Suspect vehicle sighted on Motor at Pico, southbound. Units Two-Zero-Six and Five- Seven, attempt intercept. Unit One-Four-Three, come in.
TERMINATOR	This is One-Four-Three.  West- bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
PILOT	Air-unit Two.  We're on him. Westbound Santa Monica at 405.
SARAH	A machine?  You mean, like a robot?
REESE	Not a robot.  Cyborg. Cybernetic Organism.
SARAH	But...he was bleeding.
REESE	Just a second.  Keep your head down.
PILOT	Lost him.
REESE	Good cover. Alright.  Listen. The Terminator's an infil- tration unit.  Part man, part machine.  Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, mircoprocessor-controlled, fully  armored. Very tough...
REESE	But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
SARAH	Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
REESE	Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
SARAH	Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
REESE	No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
SARAH	So, it's from the future, is that right?
REESE	One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
SARAH	And you're from the future too?
REESE	Right.
SARAH	Right...
REESE	Cyborgs don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't...do that...again.
SARAH	Just let me go.
REESE	Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
SARAH	Can you stop it?
REESE	Maybe.  With these weapons... I don't know.
DISPATCHER	Suspect vehicle located at parking lot, Cedar and Glen- haven...
SARAH	Reese...why me?  Why does it want me?
REESE	There's so much...
SARAH	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
REESE	There was a war.  A few years from now.  Nuclear war.  The whole thing.  All this--
REESE	--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it. It was the machines.
SARAH	I don't understand...
REESE	Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
REESE	Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
SARAH	The what?
REESE	Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
REESE	Burned in by laser scan. Some of us were kept alive... to work.  Loading bodies.  The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out forever...
REESE	...but there was one man...who taught us to fight.  To storm the wire of the camps.  To smash those metal mother- fuckers into junk.  He turned it around...he brought us back from the brink. His name is Connor.  John Connor... your son, Sarah.  Your unborn son.

We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
SILBERMAN	Then how are you supposed to get back?
REESE	Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
REESE	...It's just him and me.
SILBERMAN	Why didn't you bring any weapons?  Something more advanced.  Don't you have ray guns?
SILBERMAN	Show me a piece of future technology.
REESE	You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
SILBERMAN	Why?
REESE	I didn't build the fucking thing.
SILBERMAN	Okay.  Okay.  But this... cyborg...if it's metal...
REESE	Surrounded by living tissue.
SILBERMAN	Of course.
SILBERMAN	This is great stuff.  I could make a career out of this guy. You see how clever this part is...how it doesn't require a shred of proof.  Most paranoid delusions are intricate...but this is brilliant.
SILBERMAN	Why were the other two women killed?
REESE	Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
REESE	You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
SILBERMAN	I'm afraid that's not up to me.
REESE	Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
SILBERMAN	I can help you...
REESE	Who is in authority here?
REESE	You still don't get it. He'll find her.  That's what he does.  All he does...

SILBERMAN	Sorry.

SILBERMAN	In technical terminology, he's a loon.
SARAH	But...
VUKOVICH	Sarah, this is body armor. Out TAC guys wear it.  It'll stop a 12 gauge round.  This other individual must've had one under his coat.
SARAH	But what about him punching through the windshield?
TRAXLER	Probably on PCP, broke every bone in his hand and won't feel it for hours.  There was this guy once that...
VUKOVICH	Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
SARAH	I can't sleep.
VUKOVICH	Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
SARAH	Okay.
TRAXLER	What? Ed, come on...the guy's a wacko.
VUKOVICH	He'd better be.
TERMINATOR	I'm a friend of Sarah Connor. I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please?
SERGEANT	You can't see here.  She's making a statement.
TERMINATOR	Where is she?
SERGEANT	Look.  It's gonna be a while. You wanna wait.  There's a bench.
TERMINATOR	I'll come back.
VUKOVICH	Stay here.

REESE	Come here.
SARAH	Reese...you got a first name?
REESE	Kyle.
SARAH	Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
REESE	White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
SARAH	You're wet.  Oh my god.
REESE	I caught one, back there.
SARAH	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
REESE	It's not bad.
SARAH	We gotta get you to a doctor.
REESE	It's okay.  Forget it.
SARAH	Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
SARAH	Jeez.  You idiot.  Take this off.
REESE	See.  Missed everything. Passed through the meat.
SARAH	This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
REESE	What?
SARAH	Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
REESE	About my height.  He has your-- ...damn...he has your eyes.
SARAH	What's he like?
REESE	You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
SARAH	Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
REESE	John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
SARAH	Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
REESE	I volunteered.
SARAH	You volunteered?
REESE	It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
SARAH	You talk about things I haven't done yet in the past tense.  It's making me crazy.  I can't think. Are you sure you've got the right person?
REESE	I'm sure.
SARAH	Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
REESE	Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
SARAH	And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
REESE	You'll learn.
SARAH	Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
REESE	John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
REESE	Good field-dressing.
SARAH	You like it?  It's my first.
REESE	Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
SARAH	Okay.  Talk some more.
REESE	About what?
SARAH	About where you're from.
REESE	Alright. You stay down by day, but at night you can move around. The H-K's use infra-red so you still have to watch out. But they're not too bright. John taught us ways to dust them them.  That's when the infiltra- tors started to appear.  The Terminators were the newest, the worst...
SENTRY	Terminator!
SARAH	I was dreaming about dogs.
REESE	We used them to spot Terminators.
SARAH	Your world...it's pretty terrifying.
SARAH	Put that away.  I'll get one.
SARAH	This works...really.
DRIVER	...and when it breaks right off the point they get some pretty rad tubes up there. Not awesome, but I mean, worth the drive, if you're hardcore like me.
REESE	Rad tubes?
SARAH	He's a surfer.
DRIVER	You from back East of something?
SARAH	No, he's from the future.
DRIVER	Whoah.  I hear that. Listen, I had a rough night.  I gotta stop and bag some Z's.
DRIVER	You can still ride if you wanna hang out for a couple hours.
SARAH	Thanks.
REESE	Bag some Z's?
SARAH	Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
REESE	Yours is over there.
LITTLE GIRL	Can you get my balloon?
REESE	Aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this?
LITTLE GIRL	Huh?
SARAH	...I know, Mom.  This is the soonest I could...I know. Mom...Mom, I can't talk long. No, I'm okay. I was on TV?  Really? Oh no, I hate that picture... why didn't you give them my graduation picture? I'm okay, really.  Listen, I want you to pack some stuff and go up to the cabin for a few days.  Just don't...no, don't ask any questions. Just do it.  I gotta get going...gotta go.  Bye, bye.
SARAH	Thanks a lot.
REESE	What's that?
SARAH	That's where we're going.
REESE	Why?
SARAH	Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
REESE	What about it?
SARAH	Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
REESE	Molecular-memory.
SARAH	Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
REESE	That's the way it was told to me.
SARAH	Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
REESE	Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
SARAH	Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
REESE	That's not my mission.
SARAH	Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
REESE	Let's go.  Time to move out.
SARAH	Fuck you!  Let go of me!
REESE	Sarah!
SARAH	Let...go...bastard...
SARAH	Oh, that's real smart. Go on, shoot me. That's brilliant.
SARAH	Jesus Christ, Reese.  Can't you see I'm scared?
SARAH	I can't spend my life waiting for that thing to catch up with me...always looking over my shoulder, wondering if I left some tiny clue behind...
SARAH	Reese?
SARAH	Kyle?
REESE	I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
REESE	It's...like some dream. This...this...
REESE	...and you...all so...beauti- ful.  It hurts, Sarah.  More than death.
REESE	Don't you understand...it's all gone!
SARAH	We can change it, Kyle.  We have to try.
SARAH	There's no fate but what we make for ourselves. Right? Come on.  Let's go, kiddo. Whaddya say?
MAN	Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there of what?
TERMINATOR	Fuck you, asshole.
REESE	Is this enough?
SARAH	Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
SARAH	We need a room...with a kitchen.
SARAH	I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
REESE	Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
SARAH	...No, Mom, I can't tell you where I am.  I was told not to say.
SARAH'S MOM	But honey, I need to know where I can reach you or I'll be worried sick.  It turns out I can't stay up here...the electricity's off...and I don't know just where I'll be.
SARAH	Okay, here's the number.  Are you ready?
SARAH'S MOM	Go ahead.
SARAH	It's 408-972-1439.  Room 14.
SARAH'S MOM	I got it.
SARAH	Okay, I've gotta go.  I'm sorry I can't tell you very much now, Mom.  I love you.
TERMINATOR	I love you too, sweetheart.
TERMINATOR	Hello. Tell me your address there.
SARAH	Let's see.  Corn syrup. Ammonia.  Moth balls... Mmm.  What's for dinner?
REESE	Plastique.
SARAH	What's that?
REESE	Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
REESE	Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
SARAH	You must have had a fun child- hood.
REESE	That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
SARAH	I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
REESE	Hot dogs?
SARAH	I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
REESE	My whole life has been combat.
SARAH	I want it to be over for you.
REESE	Not possible.
SARAH	I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
REESE	We'll head out at 0200. That gives you four hours to sleep if you want.  I'll finish.
SARAH	He'll find us, won't he?
REESE	Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
SARAH	Don't say that.
REESE	If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
SARAH	It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
REESE	No.  I'm not.
SARAH	Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
REESE	Good fighters.
SARAH	That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
REESE	Someone?
SARAH	A girl.  You know.
REESE	No. Never.
SARAH	I'm sorry.
SARAH	So much pain.
REESE	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
SARAH	And so you feel nothing.
REESE	It's better that way.
SARAH	Oh, Kyle.
REESE	John Connor gave me a picture of you once.  I never knew why.  It was very old. Torn. Faded.  You were young, like you are now.  You weren't smiling...just a little sad... I always wondered what you were thinking at that second.
REESE	I memorized every line, every curve...
REESE	Sarah, I came across time for you.  I love you. I always have.
REESE	I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
SARAH	Kyle...
SARAH	I bet you're ticklish.
REESE	Ticklish?
REESE	What are you doing?
SARAH	You'll beg for mercy in a second.
REESE	I don't think I like this.
SARAH	You're not supposed to.
REESE	Listen to the dogs.
REESE	Light it now.
RIDER	Don't try to move, buddy.
REESE	Switch places with me.
SARAH	Kyle...oh God...
SARAH
PARTNER
DRIVER.

SARAH	What are you doing?
REESE	Cover...our footsteps...
REESE	Leave me here.
SARAH	I'm not leaving you anywhere you jerk.  Haven't you figured it out?  Kyle, John is our son.
SARAH	There isn't going to be anybody else...I don't want anybody else.  Listen to me!
SARAH	Move!  Reese! Let's go. Move you ass!
SARAH	Come on!
REESE	Run!
REESE
SARAH	You're...terminated...fucker!
COP	Look, I told you not to touch anything until we're done.  You got that?
MANAGER	Sure thing, officer.
ASSISTANT	What is it?
MANAGER	Microcomputer chassis.  But I've never seen stuff like this anywhere.
ASSISTANT	Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe?
MANAGER	Keep it out of sight and get it down to R and D Monday, first thing.
ASSISTANT	Good idea.
SARAH	...and the hardest thing is deciding what I should tell you and what not to.  Well, anyway, I've got a while yet before you're old enough to understand the tapes.  They're more for me at this point... to help get it all straight.
SARAH	Should I tell you about your father?  That's a tough one. Will it change your decision to send him here...knowing? But if you don't send Kyle, you could never be.  God, you can go crazy thinking about all this...I suppose I'll tell you...I owe him that. And maybe it'll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime's worth...
ATTENDANT	He says you are very beautiful, Senora, and he is ashamed to ask five American dollars for this picture, but if he does not, his father will beat him.
SARAH	That's a pretty good hustle, kid.  Four.  Quatro.
ATTENDANT	Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars American.
SARAH	What did he say?
ATTENDANT	There is a storm coming in.
SARAH	I know.
