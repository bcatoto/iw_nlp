MISSION CONTROL	(On radio, faint) Explorer, please verify that the P1 ATA removal on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete.
EXPLORER CAP	(On radio, faint) DMA M1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete.
MISSION CONTROL	(On radio, faint) Copy that Explorer. Dr Stone-Houston, requesting status update...
WOMAN	Installation ninety-five percent complete. Running level one diagnostics on circuits, sensors, and power. Standby.
MISSION CONTROL	Standing by. Looks like we're on schedule. Dr. Stone, Medical is concerned about your ECG readings.
WOMAN	I'm fine Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	Well, medical doesn't agree doctor. Are you feeling nauseous?
WOMAN	Not any more than usual, Houston. Diagnostics are green. Linking to communications card. Ready for data reception. If this works, when we touch down tomorrow, I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.
MISSION CONTROL	That's a date, doctor. Just remember, Houston is partial to Margaritas.
WOMAN	OK, here we go... Booting comm card now. Please confirm link. Houston, please confirm reception of data.
MISSION CONTROL	Negative. We're not seeing any data.
WOMAN	Stand by, Houston. I'm gonna reboot the comm card.
MISSION CONTROL	Standing by.
ASTRONAUT	Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
MISSION CONTROL	Please expand.
MATT	Okay, let me tell you a story. It was '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every time I passed over Texas, I'd look down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky, was looking up, thinking of me. Six weeks I'm blowing kisses to that woman. Then we land at Edwards and I find out she'd run off with a lawyer before I was off the launch pad, so I packed my car and I headed to...
MISSION CONTROL	Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack prototype.
MATT	Five hours off the reservation and I show 30% drain. My compliments to Engineering. Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.
MISSION CONTROL	Engineering says thank you.
MATT	Tell them I still prefer my '67 Corvette though. Speaking of which did I ever tell you the--
MISSION CONTROL	We know the Corvette story, Matt.
MATT	Even Engineering?
MISSION CONTROL	Especially engineering. We're going to miss you, Matt.
WOMAN	Comm card reboot in progress.
MISSION CONTROL	Thank you doctor. Shariff, what's your status?
SHARIFF	Nearly there. Replacing battery module A1 and C.
MISSION CONTROL	Could you be more specific? Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious.
SHARIFF	No... no... no Houston, don't be anxious. Anxiety is not good for the heart... The system is ready to re- activate.
MISSION CONTROL	Hubble Telescope engaged. Upgrade fully functional. That applause you hear is for you, Shariff. Congratulations. Kick back, take the rest of the day off.
SHARIFF	Woohoo... Jaise Baadal Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai Oh Jaise Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai.
MISSION CONTROL	Matt, please advise as to Mission Specialist Shariff's current activity.
MATT	He appears to be doing the Macarena of some sort. Though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part.
MISSION CONTROL	Dr. Stone. Houston. Medical now have you with a temperature drop to 35.9 and heart rate rise to 70. How are you doing?
WOMAN	Houston, I'm fine, it's just... ...Keeping your lunch down in zero G is harder than it looks.
MISSION CONTROL	Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer?
WOMAN	No, we've been here for a week Houston, let's just finish this.
MISSION CONTROL	That's a negative. I'm afraid we're getting nothing on this end, doctor.
WOMAN	Try again.
MISSION CONTROL	(a beat, then...) Still nothing.
WOMAN	Houston, could you please turn that music off?
MISSION CONTROL	Kowalsky?
MATT	Not a problem.
WOMAN	Thank you, Kowalsky.
WOMAN	Now, Houston?
MISSION CONTROL	Negative.
WOMAN	Could Houston be misinterpreting the data--?
MISSION CONTROL	We're not receiving any data. Engineering is recommending a vis- check for component damage.
WOMAN	Mmmm. Let me see what's going on.
WOMAN	What have you got here?
WOMAN	Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components. The problem must be originating in the comms panel.
MISSION CONTROL	That seems to be the case. Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen. That's as close to an apology as you're going to get from them. We should've listened to you doc.
WOMAN	I'm on it.
MISSION CONTROL	Copy that. How long do you think it'll take you?
WOMAN	An hour.
MISSION CONTROL	Outstanding. We appreciate your patience, Doctor. Installing your system in the Hubble is the main purpose of this mission.
MATT	Seventy-five minutes shy. Never crossed my mind.
MISSION CONTROL	Matt, It's been a privilege.
MATT	Right back atcha, Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	Enjoy your last walk...
MATT	Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in removing the panel?
WOMAN	Assistance appreciated.
MISSION CONTROL	Permission granted.
MATT	Thank you, Houston. Mind if I join the fun?
WOMAN	Certainly.
MATT	How are you feeling?
WOMAN	Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble dried.
MATT	It's been a rough week. If it makes you feel any better, I puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ride.
WOMAN	Whoa...! AWOL!
WOMAN	Thanks. Sorry. In my basement lab things usually fall to the floor.
MATT	Hey -- you're the genius up here. I just drive this bus.
WOMAN	Call me a genius if I can get this board initialized in the next hour.
MISSION CONTROL	Explorer, this is Houston.
EXPLORER CAP	Go ahead Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	NORAD reports a satellite has incurred a missile strike. The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour. Current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory. We'll keep you posted on any developments.
WOMAN	Should we be worried?
MATT	Let the boys down there worry for us.
WOMAN	Explorer, engage arm and pivot to cargo bay.
EXPLORER CAP	Standby for arm maneuver.
MATT	So doc, now that you work for NASA, how do you like it?
SHARIFF	Kinda like winning the lottery, isn't it?
WOMAN	I was just happy that they didn't cut the funding to my research.
MATT	How long was your training?
WOMAN	Six months.
SHARIFF	Including holidays?
MATT	So, what is this scanning system?
SHARIFF	Nothing rad, it's just a new set of eyes to scan the universe.
WOMAN	Assuming it works, it's just for hospital use. This one is a prototype.
EXPLORER CAP	Standby for marking.
MATT	Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes, even for your pretty blue eyes.
WOMAN	My eyes are brown.
MATT	Right now your eyes are blood shut.
SHARIFF	Kowalsky!
SHARIFF	Is this great or what?!
MATT	(for Ryan's benefit) And to think he went to Harvard.
MATT	You gotta admit one thing. You can't beat the view....
WOMAN	Mm-hm.
MATT	"Mmm?" So what do you like about being up here?
WOMAN	The silence. I could get used to it.
MATT	Hmmmm. Terrific.
WOMAN	Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead. Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?
MISSION CONTROL	You're the expert, doctor. It's your call.
MATT	Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
MISSION CONTROL	Please elaborate.
MATT	It's the same feeling I had at Mardi Gras in 1987...?
MISSION CONTROL	That is affirmative. Surprisingly, control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed.
MATT	Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for the sister of a friend of mine. The streets are swimming with people, I'm thinking there's no way I'm finding this girl...
WOMAN	Proceeding to over ride.
MATT	Then all of a sudden I look up and -- there she is.
MATT	I am about to yell out when I notice she's holding hands with a short hairy guy in board shorts and a Margaritaville T-shirt. Then I realize, the guy's no guy. My sister's friend is holding hands with a--
MISSION CONTROL	ISS, this is Houston. Zlotze Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	Explorer, this is Houston.
EXPLORER CAP	Go ahead Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	Mission abort. Repeat: mission abort. Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble. Begin re-entry procedure. Start Deorbit Prep for PLS at Kennedy. ISS, initiate emergency evacuation.
EXPLORER CAP	Copy all Houston, and in work. Matt, immediate return to Explorer. Repeat, immediate return to Explorer.
MATT	Roger. Explorer, prep airlock!
EXPLORER CAP	Airlock engaged--ready to receive.
MATT	Houston. Elaborate.
MISSION CONTROL	Debris from the impact has caused a chain reaction, hitting other satellites in its path and creating new debris. Norad reports that orbital and ballistic effects are driving the cloud of debris up toward your altitude. How copy?
MATT	Copy all Houston. Put a bow on it Dr. Stone.
WOMAN	I can't. If I turn it off now we'll lose the whole system.
MATT	I'm not going to ask you again.
WOMAN
ONE SECOND--
MATT	Not one second. Now! Shut it down!
WOMAN	Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done.
EXPLORER CAP	Kowalsky, initiate emergency disconnect from the Hubble.
MATT	Alright Shariff, let's do this.
SHARIFF	Roger.
MATT	Houston. Update.
MISSION CONTROL	We have a full on chain reaction. It's been confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own satellites.
SHARIFF	They shot down their own satellite?
MATT	Right of disposal. Most likely a spy sat gone bad. Now it's space junk.
MATT	Explorer, ready to disengage HST.
EXPLORER CAP	Locks releasing in three... two... one...
MISSION CONTROL	Explorer, new data coming through.
MATT	What's the blowback, Houston?
MISSION CONTROL	It's not good. Most of our systems are going down. Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding. Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling.
MATT	Define "multiple" sats.
MISSION CONTROL	Most of them. Telecomunications systems are gone. Expect a communication blackout at any moment.
WOMAN	Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine o'clock.
MATT	Half of North America just lost their Facebook.
MISSION CONTROL	You're a go for TH1138. Repeat You're a go for TH1138 procedure.
EXPLORER CAP	Copy that Houston.
MATT	Explorer, this is Kowalsky. Confirming visual contact with debris. Debris is from a BSE sat. To repeat--
SHARIFF	Heads up!
MATT	To repeat I have-
WOMAN	Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster transport.
MATT	We have to go. Go, go! Go!
MISSION CONTROL	Attention. New data suggests immediate evacuation absolu...
WOMAN	Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area. Explorer get me down.
MATT	Explorer permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.
EXPLORER CAP	You are a go, Kowalsky. Houston, this is Explorer. Copy? Houston, this is Explorer. Copy? We lost Houston!
MATT	Unstrap! You can't tune out the world up here.
WOMAN	I'm trying...
MATT	Try releasing the safety clip.
SHARIFF	Need some help there Matt?
MATT	No, don't wait for us. Get inside.
WOMAN	It's stuck!
MATT	Man down! Man down!
MATT	Disengage!!!
MATT	Explorer has been hit. Explorer do you read? Explorer, over. Explorer--
MATT	Astronaut off structure! Dr. Stone is off structure!
MATT	Dr. Stone, detach!
WOMAN	Nooooo!
MATT	You must detach!
WOMAN	No.
MATT	If you don't detach that arm is going to carry you too far!
WOMAN	I can't!
MATT	(a brief beat, then) Listen to my voice. You need to focus. I'm losing visual of you. In a few seconds I won't be able to track you.
WOMAN	(She pulls herself together) Ok. Ok.
MATT	You need to detach. I can't see you anymore.
WOMAN	I'm trying. I'm trying.
MATT	Do it. Now!
WOMAN	Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck, Hold on.
MATT	Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone... Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.
MATT	Dr. Stone! Do you copy?! Repeat! Do you copy?
WOMAN	Yes. Yes. I copy. I'm detached!
MATT	...Give me your position!
WOMAN	I don't know. I don't know! I'm spinning. I can't. I can't.
MATT	Report your position.
WOMAN	GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I can't.
MATT	Give me a visual.
WOMAN	I told you! Nothing. I see nothing!
MATT	Do you have a visual of Explorer?
WOMAN
NO--
MATT	Do you have a visual of ISS?
WOMAN
NO--
MATT	I need you to focus. Give me a visual... anything.
WOMAN	It's too fast.
WOMAN	I can't breathe. I can't...breathe...
WOMAN	Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm drifting but I have a visual of Explorer.
WOMAN	With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle is at the center of the dial.
WOMAN	I can see the Chinese station. No, no, no, it's the International Space Station.
WOMAN	ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock.
WOMAN	Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy?
WOMAN	Explorer, do you copy?
WOMAN	Houston, do you copy?
WOMAN	Houston, this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm drifting.
WOMAN	Do you copy?
WOMAN	Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy.
MATT	... Stone. Do you copy?
WOMAN	(almost to herself) Lieutenant Kowalsky?...
MATT	Repeat. Do you copy?
WOMAN	YES! YES! I copy! I'm here!
MATT	Flash your light.
WOMAN	My light?
MATT	So I can see you.
WOMAN	Here! Here!
MATT	There you are. Hang tight. Report your status.
WOMAN	I'm... I'm alright... I'm fine.
MATT	Your status! Give me your readings?
WOMAN	3.6 psi, I think.
MATT	Your O2. Give me your O2.
WOMAN	Steady at eight percent...no seven...
MATT	You're breathing too fast. You're burning oxygen. We don't want to do that. We want to relax. Copy.
WOMAN	Copy.
MATT	Nearly there.
WOMAN	Please hurry.
MATT	You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.
WOMAN	Oh. Sorry.
MATT	Gotcha.
WOMAN	Arghh!
MATT	Now, I'm going to tether you to me.
MATT	I know. You never realized how devastatingly good-looking I am.
MATT	But I need you to stop staring and help me with the tether. Okay?
WOMAN	Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it.
MATT	Ok. So far so good. Now listen. I'm going to give you a little push, just so you're clear of the jets--
WOMAN
NO--
MATT	Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.
WOMAN	No... No... No... Wait... Don't.
WOMAN	Nooooooo!!!! Dammit!!!
MATT	See? Where you go, I go.
MATT	Better. Let's get out of here.
WOMAN	Ahh Dammit!
MATT	I know what you mean.
WOMAN	Ahhh Dammit.
MATT	You're burning oxygen, we're going to go back to the shuttle. How's that for a plan. Copy?
WOMAN
FUCK
MATT	Right copy that.
MATT	Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you copy?
WOMAN	Why aren't they answering?
MATT	It seems like communications are lost.
WOMAN	Can they hear us on an alternate frequency?
MATT	We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes.
WOMAN	Why ninety?
MATT	Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. Factoring in our current orbit, I reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again.
WOMAN	02 down to six percent.
MATT	Okay. Pretty scary shit being untethered up here, isn't it?
WOMAN	Yeah. Pretty scary shit.
MATT	(after a beat) You did all right.
MATT	(to the Shuttle) Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalsky. Our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve the body of Mission Specialist Shariff and return it to Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve?
MATT	Roger that.
WOMAN	Where is he? Where is he?
WOMAN	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
MATT	Grab him!
WOMAN	I'm trying. I'm trying.
MATT	Quick. You're pulling me away.
WOMAN	I got him. I got him.
MATT	Clutch him like he's your Valentine. I can't gauge my thrust with you two yo- yoing around.
MATT	(under his breath) Jesus...
MATT	Here's hoping you've got one monster insurance policy, Houston. Damages to Explorer are... it's totaled. Will commence search for survivors.
WOMAN	02 down to five percent.
MATT	All right, here we go. Careful of the edges.
MATT	Houston, in the blind. To confirm. Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and myself, Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky, are the sole survivors of
WOMAN	I apologize for not complying. I should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to.
MATT	We were going to be hit no matter what. There was nothing you could've done to change that.
MATT	Hey.
WOMAN	Yes?
MATT	Alright... We have to get ourselves to the Space Station. There.
MATT	It's a bit of a hike, but it's our only... It's our best option. Agreed?
MATT	Dr. Stone... (as she turns) Agreed?
WOMAN	Agreed.
MATT	Alright. After you.
MATT	Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky. Dr. Stone and I have determined to proceed to ISS and use one of their Soyuz for re-entry. ISS if copy, please send rescue mission. Repeat please dispatch rescue mission.
WOMAN	02 down to two percent.
MATT	We're getting there.
MATT	Beautiful, don't you think?
WOMAN	What?
MATT	The sunrise. That's what I'm going to miss the most.
MATT	So, where's home, Dr. Stone?
MATT	Ryan. Where's home?
WOMAN	Home?
MATT	Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where do you pitch your tent?
WOMAN	Lake Zurich.
MATT	Where the hell is that?
WOMAN	Illinois.
MATT	Illinois. Central time zone. That makes it roughly... 8pm right now. What are the good people of Lake Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the evening?
WOMAN	I don't know...
MATT	What would you be doing?
MATT	Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just clocked out of the hospital after putting in your customary 18-hour shift. You're driving home...
WOMAN	The radio. I listen to the radio...
MATT	There we go. Let me guess. NPR? Classical. Top for--
WOMAN	Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as they don't talk. I just drive...
MATT	What do you miss down there?
MATT	Is there a Mr. Stone?
WOMAN	No...
MATT	Nobody special? Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you?
WOMAN	I had a daughter.
MATT	What was her name?
WOMAN	Sarah... She was four. Stupidest thing- a school trip to the swimming pool. She was playing tag- she slipped, hit her head, and that was it... She loved tag. I'm sure she was laughing.
WOMAN	When I received the call I was driving and ever since that's what I do. I wake up, I go to work and then I just drive.
WOMAN	02 down to one percent.
MATT	Well, well, what d'you know. I have good news and bad news.
WOMAN	Uhuh?
MATT	The good news is we're five minutes from the ISS and I know where the Russians stash their vodka... and that's a good thing cus I'm running out of fumes. Bad news is I'm gonna be ten minutes short of......breaking Anatoly's record.
WOMAN	Mmm...Mmmm.
MATT	What?
WOMAN	I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure is low...
MATT	The tank may be empty but there's still oxygen in your suit, so sip, Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, not beer. Sip. We'll get you there.
MATT	Let's go.
MATT	Houston in the blind we have visual of the ISS. Station must have been evacuated because first Soyuz is missing. Second Soyuz exhibits surface damage and chute has deployed. It's use as escape pod for re-entry to Earth is impossible.
WOMAN	Shouldn't we be turning? We're
DRIFTING AGAIN--
MATT	Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We want to drift. I wasn't kidding about those fumes. This can has one or two good thrusts left. If we're lucky....
MATT	Steady...
MATT	Ready... aim...
MATT	...fire.
WOMAN	Break... You have to break.
MATT	I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab onto anything you can and hold tight!
WOMAN	I got it. I got it.
WOMAN	The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm I'm detached.
MATT	Grab a hold. Grab anything.
MATT	Give me... give me five here, Ryan.
WOMAN	I've got you. I've got you--
MATT	Shit... shit...
WOMAN	No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you. Don't. Don't. NO
WOMAN	Gotcha!
MATT	You have to let me go.
WOMAN	What? No--
MATT	You have to.
WOMAN	No!
MATT	Those ropes are too loose, I'm pulling you with me. You have to let me go or we both die--
WOMAN	I'm not letting you go! We're fine.
MATT	Ryan!
WOMAN	You're not going anywhere, you're not
GOING ANYWHERE--
MATT	It's not up to you.
WOMAN	Please don't do this.
WOMAN	Please don't do this. Please don't do this.
MATT	You're going to make it Ryan.
WOMAN	I had you! I had you.
MATT	Ryan do you copy? Do you copy?
WOMAN	My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm went off.
MATT	You need to board the station. Can you see the airlock?
MAT	Do you copy? (P.O.V shot - beginning to blur)
WOMAN	Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it.
MATT	Good. That's where you want to go. You're losing focus, right?
WOMAN	Yes.
MATT	That's because you're breathing CO2 and you're losing consciousness. You need to board the Station.
MATT	Move!
WOMAN	Ok.
MATT	Now listen to me. That second Soyuz is too damaged for re-entry, but it's perfectly fine for a little Sunday drive.
WOMAN	Sunday drive...?
MATT	Look to the west... You see that dot in the distance? That is the Chinese Station. You're going to take the Soyuz and cruise over there. The Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzou.
WOMAN	I've never flown a Shenzhou--
MATT	That doesn't matter. Its re-entry protocol is identical to the Soyuz's--
WOMAN	Ok.
MATT	You've never flown a Soyuz either.
WOMAN	Only on a simulator.
MATT	So then you know.
WOMAN	I crashed it. I--
MATT	It's a Simulator. That's what it's designed for.
WOMAN	Every time. I crashed the Simulator every time.
MATT	It's not rocket science. Just point the damn thing at earth and by this time tomorrow you'll be back in Lake Zurich with one hell of a story to tell. You copy? Ryan. You copy?
WOMAN	I'm going to take the Soyuz and come get you.
MATT	No you're not. . I have too much of a head start. That ship already sailed.
WOMAN	No. I'm coming to get you.
MATT	Ryan, you're going to have to learn to let go.
WOMAN	But... I...
MATT	I want to hear you say you're going to make it.
MATT	Ryan! Say it!
WOMAN	I'm... I'm going to make it.
MATT	Alright. Keep going
MATT	What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?
WOMAN	Dad wanted a boy.
MATT	Are you close to the airlock?
WOMAN	Not yet.
MATT	Keep going.
MATT	So, now that we have some distance between us- you're attracted to me, aren't you?
WOMAN	What?
MATT	Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes.
WOMAN	You... you have beautiful... you have beautiful blue eyes.
MATT	I have brown eyes... that hurts.
MATT	You wanna know the good news?
WOMAN	What?
MATT	I'm going to break Anatoly's record, and I think mine's going to stand for a long, long time.
WOMAN	No... I'm coming to get you.
MATT	You know, Ryan is a nice name for a girl. Wow, you should see the sun on the Ganges. It's amazing.
WOMAN	(in a daze) Matt...
WOMAN	Matt!
WOMAN	Come on, come on.
WOMAN	OK. Where are you? Where are you? Comms. Comms... There you are!
WOMAN	Matt. This is Ryan. Copy?
WOMAN	Matt. This is Ryan. Copy?
WOMAN	Matt, I made it. I'm here. I'm inside the Station... Do you copy?
WOMAN	Come on Matt. Talk to me. Tell me where you are. Give me your position...
WOMAN	Where are you? Give me a visual... tell me what you see.
WOMAN	Oh, come on. You've been yammering nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral, and now you decide to shut up?
WOMAN	Come on Matt, talk to me!
WOMAN	Say something... Anything.
WOMAN	Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me about the hairy guy. What happened?
WOMAN	Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this.
WOMAN	Houston in the blind.
WOMAN	This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the ISS... All communication with Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio transmission is absent. Visual is nonexistent. To confirm, I--Ryan Stone--am the sole survivor of STS-157.
WOMAN	What now?
WOMAN	OK... where was it?... where was it?
WOMAN	Where is the power?... Here you are.
WOMAN	Good... good... just like training...
WOMAN	Undocking... undocking... Yes... red...
WOMAN	Ok... Ok... I remember this... undocking...
WOMAN	We don't have four minutes to spare. We're going manual...
WOMAN	Okay. Arming the system...
WOMAN	Firing the pyros...
WOMAN	Rezerv rasstyk!
WOMAN	I engaged manual control- R O A K and RYD are activated.
WOMAN	Oh, no. No, no, no.
WOMAN	Great. Fantastic. Perfect.
WOMAN	Clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris.
WOMAN	Okay. We detach this and we go home. Piece of cake.
WOMAN	Oh shit.
WOMAN	Shit!
WOMAN	No... no... no..
WOMAN	I hate space.
WOMAN	Shut up!
WOMAN	Ok.
WOMAN	Alright. That's good.
WOMAN	Okay, let's stabilise you.
WOMAN	Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station. Houston in the blind, Tiangong is approximately 100km... to the west and I am off it's course by about 3 degrees. I will correct trajectory.
WOMAN	Ok.
WOMAN	Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five... four... three
WOMAN	two... one...
WOMAN	One...
WOMAN	One... one...
WOMAN	Come on. Come on!
WOMAN	You gotta be kidding me.

WOMAN	But the thing is... I'm still scared. I'm really scared...
WOMAN	No one will mourn me. No one will pray for my soul. Will you mourn me, Aningang? Is it too late to say a prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I have never prayed in my life... no one ever taught me how...

WOMAN	You are singing to your baby? Is that a lullaby? That's so sweet!
WOMAN	I used to sing to my baby too.
WOMAN	I hope I see her soon.
WOMAN	(growing ever drowsier) That's nice. Keep singing, Aningang, just like that. Sing me to sleep. I'll sleep and sleep and sleep. Sing to me, Aningang... sing...sing....
WOMAN	No... no.. don't.
MATT	Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped.
MATT	Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little light?
WOMAN	How did you?
MATT	Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
WOMAN	But how did you?
MATT	That's better.
WOMAN	How?
MATT	I found a little extra battery power. I'm just happy you're still alive. To be honest, I thought your chances were slim to none. By the way, did you find the vodka?
WOMAN	You never told me where.
MATT	Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje.
WOMAN	No.
MATT	No? Right, let's get out of here.
MATT	We're `bout a hundred miles to the Chinese Station. A little Sunday drive.
WOMAN	We can't.
MATT	Course we can.
WOMAN	There's no fuel. I tried everything.
MATT	Well, there's always something we can do.
WOMAN	I tried everything.
MATT	Did you try the soft landing jets?
WOMAN	They're for landing so.
MATT	Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training?
WOMAN	I never got to land the simulator, I told you.
MATT	But you know about it.
WOMAN	And I crashed it every time.
MATT	Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? I get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody.
MATT	There's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe. Then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living?
MATT	Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride. You have to start living life, Ryan.
WOMAN	How did you get here?
MATT	Ryan, you have to learn to let go ... Hey?
WOMAN	What?
MATT	It's time to go home.
WOMAN	Landing, landing. Landing is launching.
WOMAN	Okay, landing, landing, landing is green.
WOMAN	Okay, okay landing, alright.
WOMAN	Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing. ... you're a clever son of a bitch Matt. So to land I need to get rid of the BO and Engine module, okay?
WOMAN	Listen to me Matt. You're going to see a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah, her hair is probably a mess. That's okay, she doesn't like to brush it.
WOMAN	Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She was so upset about that shoe Matt, but tell her it was right under the bed.
WOMAN	You give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell her she's my little angel and that she makes me so proud, so so so proud, and that I promise I'll try and make her proud too. You tell her that I'm not quitting, that I'm going to keep fighting. You tell her I love her Matt... I love her so much.
WOMAN	Tri module separation, go...
WOMAN	Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth.
WOMAN	Let's reset you then.
WOMAN	Okay. I only have one shot at this. One shot...
WOMAN	What's the point if we don't try?
WOMAN	Wow... you were right Matt... it's magnificent....
WOMAN	You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. But not before I get to you. You have my last ride home.
WOMAN	Okay, I'm done with just driving. Let's get go home.
WOMAN	Ahhhhhh!
WOMAN	Come on. Come on.
WOMAN	Seriously?
WOMAN	In the Soyuz the power button is erm....here!
WOMAN	Ah, ok ah undocking, undocking....eenie, meenie,...
WOMAN	Ok. That doesn't sound good....
WOMAN	Miini... moh...
WOMAN	No hablo chino.
WOMAN	Mini... moh...
WOMAN	Okay....okay...
WOMAN	Good...good...There. And this should be...
WOMAN	Okay... Houston in the blind...
WOMAN	This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the Shenzhou. I'm about to undock from the Tiangong and I have a bad feeling about this mission.
WOMAN	Reminds me of a story, Houston--
WOMAN	Okay, you know what, Houston? Never mind the story...
WOMAN	It's getting hotter in here.
WOMAN	The way I figure it, there's only two
WOMAN	I either make it down in one piece and I'll have one hell of a story to tell...
WOMAN	...Or I burn up in the next ten minutes.
WOMAN	Whichever way it goes, no harm no foul.
WOMAN	Because either way--
WOMAN	It'll be one hell of a ride.
WOMAN	I'm ready.
WOMAN	Yeehaaa!
WOMAN	Ahhhhhhhh!
WOMAN	AAAHHHHHH!
WOMAN	Thank you.
WOMAN	Ahhhhh!!!
