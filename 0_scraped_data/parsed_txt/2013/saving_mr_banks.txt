Saving Mr. Banks

DIARMUID	Mrs Travers.
DIARMUID PAMELA
DIARMUID	Excuse me?
PAMELA	The cherry blossoms	I was trying to think of what they--
DIARMUID	The car should be here, may I use--
PAMELA	I cancelled it.
DIARMUID	You--?	What? Pamela!
PAMELA	Mrs Travers.
DIARMUID	Mrs Travers, please, why-- (sugaring his tone) Why would you cancel the car?
PAMELA	I shan't be going.
DIARMUID	We've been through this--
PAMELA	I've changed my mind.
DIARMUID	You can't.
PAMELA	With all due respect Mr Russell I am on very good terms with my own faculty and exceedingly confident in its decision making capabilities.
DIARMUID	You made an agreement. Do you understand? A verbal agreement.
PAMELA	Why in the world are you speaking to me as if I am a neonate?
DIARMUID
PAMELA	He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome to every penny I don't have.
DIARMUID
LOOK--	--I've represented you for a long time. I like to think of you as a
DIARMUID	I like to think of it, believe me I know it's not reciprocated.	I would never suggest you do something that would cause you anguish but there's no more money Pamela-- Mrs Travers. Simply no more. Sales have dried up, no more royalties. You refuse to write further books so--	Do you understand? I'm frightened that you don't understand what that means.
PAMELA	I know what he's going to do to her- - she'll be cavorting and twinkling! Careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze--
DIARMUID	--We've been trying to do this deal for twenty years! He's agreed to both your stipulations. No animation, script approval-- I--
PAMELA	Use her to pay my bills? If I believed in a hell I'd be sitting in its waiting room--
DIARMUID	--script approval! He's never granted anything like that before! I don't know what else to--
DIARMUID	Where is Polly?
PAMELA	I fired her.
PAMELA	It's just as well. It seems I can't afford her anymore anyway!
PAMELA	You don't know how much she means to me.
DIARMUID	Polly?
PAMELA	Of course not Polly!
PAMELA	(it's a filthy word) Los Angeles.
DIARMUID	You have only to go there and work for two weeks. Collaborate. That's it. You haven't signed the rights over, yet.
PAMELA	Yet!
DIARMUID	You must make it work Mrs Travers--
PAMELA	Oh I must, must I?
DIARMUID	You need the money. I don't want you to see you-- (broke).
PAMELA	Stop saying money! It's a filthy, disgusting word!
DIARMUID	I am picking up the telephone Mrs
TRAVERS--
PAMELA	I have final say?
DIARMUID	You do.
PAMELA	I have final say.
PAMELA	And if I don't like what they are doing to her?
DIARMUID	You don't sign the papers. He cannot make the film unless you grant the rights.	It's an exploratory trip--
DIARMUID	What do you say?
PAMELA	I want to keep my house.
TRAVERS	Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my daughter? I was quite sure I had left her around here somewhere!
TRAVERS	Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm- - goodness! I've quite forgotten! Could it be Prunella?
GINTY	No!
TRAVERS	Pamela?
GINTY	No.
TRAVERS	You're right still doesn't sound quite-- I'm sure I have a special name for her--
GINTY	Ginty!
TRAVERS	Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is of course!	Now, have you seen her?
GINTY	It's me!
TRAVERS	Gosh! So it is! Well, thank goodness for that! I was positive I was going to be beheaded for losing Her Highness The Royal Princess Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!
GINTY	You can't lose me!
TRAVERS	Never. I promise. I will never lose you!
TRAVERS	Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The adventure is about to begin!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Can I help you?
PAMELA	I'm perfectly capable thank you.
PAMELA	They've used all the space; so greedy.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	I'll take it Madam. I can put it up here -
PAMELA	I don't want it up there. I want it here, in the corresponding holding area for my assigned seat!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	The flight's closing in just a few moments Ma'am. I'll have to take it.
WOMAN	You can put my bag up front instead.
PAMELA	Will the child be a nuisance? It's an eleven hour flight.
WOMAN	Er-- no, I--
PAMELA	Jolly good.
PAMELA	I hope we crash.
MARGARET	The carriage?
TRAVERS	Who needs a carriage my love? A stroll is a gift! (beat, excited) Everybody ready?
GINTY & BIDDY	Yes. Yep!
TRAVERS	Come along my team! We mustn't miss the train.
MARGARET	(to her staff) Thank you so much. For everything.
GINTY	See you soon Katie Nanna!
TRAVERS	Walking bus!
TRAVERS	Don't forget Andrew!
TRAVERS	Ready? And off we go!
TRAVERS	Left, right, left, right! Coming through!
GINTY
ALLORA--
PAMELA	Oh does he indeed?
RALPH	Travers? P.L. Travers?
PAMELA	Mrs.
RALPH	Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome to the City of Angels.
RALPH	Let me take those.
PAMELA	I'm perfectly capable of-- Oh, nevermind.
RALPH	Sun came out to say hello just to you.
PAMELA	Don't be preposterous.
PAMELA	It smells. Like--
RALPH	Jasmine.
PAMELA	--chlorine and sweat.
PAMELA	It's dreadful.
PAMELA	Absurd.
RALPH	You okay back there Mrs P.L. Travers?
PAMELA	It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs-- Oh, it's so hot.
RALPH	No problemo! We got a brand new air conditioning system, Missus; cool you right down in no time. Just about make you feel like you're in good old Engerland again! Things they can put in cars these days-- (he shakes his head in
AMAZEMENT)	Gosh almighty.
RALPH	(happy as a clam) No problemo.
PORTER	Would you like me to unpack for you ma'am?
PAMELA	Unpack?
PORTER	To take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe ma'am.
PAMELA	Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments I suggest you take employment in a launderette.
PAMELA	Yes?
PAMELA	Odd.
PAMELA	Oh my.
PAMELA	Oh no, no, no.
PAMELA	(muttering to the pears) This won't do.
TRAVERS	A palace! Complete with mighty steed.
GINTY	And chickens.
MARGARET
OH--
TRAVERS	We'll build beautiful memories here my angel.
MARGARET	Yes.
TRAVERS	(in the distance) --in this house you get to share a bedroom!
PAMELA	Good riddance.
PAMELA	Well, first things first.
PAMELA	Good Lord.
PAMELA	And you can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety.
PAMELA	There.
PAMELA	Yes. (answering an imaginary
QUESTION)	Well, no, I don't suppose I do mind.
PAMELA	Now, really! Flatterer! (then scolding herself) Silly girl.
PAMELA	Oh!
PAMELA	Soap for the brains.
PAMELA	Well, well-- There you are.
WALT	Don't worry! There's nothing wrong with your television set. This is a pixie bell, the sound is much too high for human ears.
WALT	Oh there you are Tink!
WALT	Hey! Get that stuff off of me!	You know, a little sprinkling of fairy dust can make you fly!
PAMELA	Off! That's how we deal with you.
RALPH	Good morning Mrs!
PAMELA	It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I bother? We're just not going to get it right are we?
RALPH	Hm?
PAMELA	Will it be the same driver every day?
RALPH	(oblivious to her tone) Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.	Sun came out again!
PAMELA	You say it like you're surprised. Like the sun is particular about whom it appears for. It seems you think that I am responsible for it's miraculous dawning every day. For goodness sake, it's California!
RALPH	It certainly is!
RALPH	(trying a British accent) Madame.
PAMELA	(as much to herself as
RALPH)	I would so much rather be accountable for the rain.
RALPH	Oh, that's sad.
PAMELA	Sad is entirely the wrong emotion. I shan't bother explaining why;
IT'LL SIMPLY	(she makes gesture for flying over his head) Zip!
RALPH	Okey dokey.
PAMELA	The rain brings life!
RALPH	So does the sun.
PAMELA	Be quiet!
RALPH	Yes ma'am.
DON	Pamela! Good morning!
PAMELA	It is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger use my first name. Mrs Travers. Please.
DON	I do apologize, Mrs Travers.	I am Don DaGradi, the script writer.
PAMELA	Co-script-writer. I shall certainly be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.
DON	Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it.
PAMELA	If indeed we ever sign off on a script.
DON	Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of your team, Dick and Bob Sherman! Music and lyrics.	Boys, this is the one and only Mrs P.L. Travers, creator of our beloved Mary.
PAMELA	Poppins.
DON	Who else?
PAMELA	Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary. (to Dick and Bob) A pleasure to meet you, though I fear we shan't be acquainted for too long.
BOB	Excuse me?
PAMELA	These books simply do not lend themselves to chirping and prancing. No. Certainly not a musical. Now, where is Mister Disney? I'd very much like to get this started and finished as briskly as is humanly possible.
BOB	Don?
DICK PAMELA	direction?
DON	Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a little tour of the studio for you
MRS TRAVERS--
PAMELA	No thank you.
DON	--Wanted to show the place off.
PAMELA	No one likes a show off.
DON	Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to--
PAMELA	I am perfectly capable of walking.
PAMELA	Shoo! Go away!
PAMELA	Ghastly.
DON	Could you let--
PAMELA	(over, to Dolly) Would you let Mister Disney know I have arrived please?
DOLLY	(whispering into phone) She's here!
DON	A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I may.
PAMELA	You may. Whether I heed it or not will be another matter entirely.
DON	Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't stand being called Mr Disney. We are all on a first name basis here.	Dolly! Is he--?
WALT	Well, there ya are at last!
WALT	Oh my dear gal!
WALT	You can't imagine how excited I am to finally meet you!
PAMELA	Oh!
PAMELA	Hum-- ah. It's an honour, Mister Disney.
WALT	Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya know. `Mister Disney' was my old man.
WALT	Come here! Come here!
WALT	Tommie, say hi to the one and only P L Travers!
TOMMIE	Hi there! It's so nice to--
WALT	Have a seat, sit down.
WALT	Ya know, I can't believe it. P.L. Travers, right here, in my office, after all these years-- almost twenty of `em. (shakes his head) Twenty. Long. Years.
WALT	Wish ya coulda' seen me then Pam! As lean as a whippet I was! A race horse!
WALT	But now, here you are. Look at you! I could eat you up!
PAMELA	That wouldn't be appropriate.
WALT	When Diane here was seven years old I-- can I get you a drink? Coffee? Soda?
PAMELA	A pot of tea would be most welc--
WALT	She was seven years old and I was walking past her bedroom and there she was on her bed reading to Sharon, and well, they were just giggling their little socks off! (he picks up the phone, presses a button) Tommie, pot of tea please dear-- You're a doll. (he puts the phone down) She's a doll. Anyways I asked them "Girls, what's so funny?" And Diane said to me, "Mary Poppins daddy!" Well, I had no idea what a Mary Poppins was! And then she gave me your book. And by gosh!
WALT	My imagination was caught on fire! And I mean ON FIRE! And those embers have burned ever since-- as you know.
PAMELA WALT
PAMELA WALT
WALT	I got old asking.
PAMELA	What a charming story.
WALT	About my getting old?
PAMELA	About your daughters.
WALT	Yeah I suppose it is. (he looks at the picture) They're both women now. Gosh! Can you believe it?
PAMELA	Children grow up.
WALT	Now Pam, a man can't break a promise to his kids. No matter how long it takes to keep. No matter how long! You might've kept me dangling all this time but now we gotcha!
PAMELA	Gotcha indeed! Mister Disney, if you have dangled then it is at the end of a rope you have fashioned for yourself.
WALT
PAMELA--
PAMELA	I was quite clear when you approached me the first time that she wasn't for sale and clear again when you approached me a year later and clear again when you approached me every annum for the subsequent 18 years. Honestly, I feel corralled, ensnared--
WALT	Pam, Pam, the last thing I want is to make you feel--
PAMELA	My name, if you please, is MRS Travers.
WALT	You see, I promised them. That's a fact. You got kids?
PAMELA
NOT--
WALT	I have never, I swear, never broken a promise to either one of my Disney girls.
PAMELA	Well, that's very honourable of you
BUT--
WALT	That's what being a daddy is all about right?
PAMELA	Is it?
WALT	This movie isn't just going to make my kids happy. It's going to make ALL kids happy! You see my guys are gonna do things with it that are, well, are revolutionary.
WALT	REVOLUTIONARY,Pam!
PAMELA
OH DEAR--
WALT	Mary Poppins will literally fly off the pages of your books!
WALT	Now imagine! This magical woman who has only lived in your head, you'll be able to meet her, speak to her, hear her sing.
PAMELA	Yes, this singing, I am glad you've come to that. (addressing his tea
MAKING)	Milk first!
PAMELA	That's right. Now the tea--
PAMELA	And a spoonful of sugar.
PAMELA	You don't mean for this film to be a musical?
WALT	I absolutely do!
PAMELA	No.
WALT	No?
PAMELA	No.
PAMELA	Not bad. No, Mister Disney, Mary Poppins does not sing.
WALT	Oh yes she does!
PAMELA	When?
WALT	In your books!
PAMELA	Those aren't songs! They're recitations. She is not a giddy woman, she does not jig! Singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary for a governess, an educatress. No. It would just ruin it.
PAMELA	I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.
WALT	Tell ya what. You just listen to what my Sherman boys have come up with and if they don't knock your socks off then I'm the King of England.
PAMELA	If you're the King of England then you shan't exist and knowing the little of you I do; I shouldn't think you would like that very much.
WALT	Bet you would.
PAMELA	I do quite like Greensleeves.
WALT	Greensleeves huh?
PAMELA	Come to think of it. That's a song I wouldn't object to.
WALT	Greensleeves.
PAMELA	Yes.
WALT	Pam, I want you to know that the last thing I would do, the very last thing, is tarnish a story I have cherished.
WALT	(gazing into her eyes) The pages are worn down to tissue, dog eared and falling out. I have poured over them gripped, tormented. Because I love Mary Poppins, you got to share her with me.
WALT	A course nothing happens without your say so. Absolutely Nothing.
PAMELA	Quite right.
WALT	It's all in the rights agreement. As approved by your agent, Dermot.
PAMELA	Diarmuid.
WALT	Darmitt.
PAMELA	(waving the agreement) A live action film. No animation.
WALT	Live action.
PAMELA	I'd like that on tape.
WALT	Hm?
PAMELA	Your promise-- and all the discussions we have here-- on tape.
WALT	Tape you say.
PAMELA	Ah there you are.	Mary Poppins and the Banks's, they're family to me.
WALT	I understand. I do.
PAMELA	Well then!
PAMELA	Shall we begin?
WALT	Let's make something wonderful.
PAMELA	Let's see if that's at all possible.
WALT	Woah.	Damn.
MARGARET	It's rather late--
MARGARET	Biddy and Moya are already asleep.
TRAVERS	Ginty.
GINTY	Good night father.	`night mother.
MARGARET	Good night dear.
TRAVERS	I'll make us a good life.	I promise.	I'll make you proud again.
MARGARET	Look at the stars.
PAMELA	(peering around a vase at
DAGRADI)	What is all this jollification?
DON	We have a whole script to get through. It's gonna be a long day Mrs T.
DON	--ravers.
PAMELA	We could save a starving country with benefaction from this room alone! Ugh, It's so vulgar.
BOB	That is a very expensive piano.
PAMELA	And these are beautiful blooms butchered for our visual and nasal enjoyment when we could have just as easily gone to the window, looked out and gazed upon them happily minding their own business and very much still alive.
PAMELA	Let us begin.
PAMELA	Hm.
DON	Exterior. It means the scene is taking place outside.
PAMELA	Ah, I see, an abbreviation.	Scene One. Exterior--	Oh, I'm sorry Mr DaGradi, did you feel you should--?
DON	No, No, Mrs Travers please go ahead.
PAMELA	Yes, I do think it's best. I've the most practise. Readings of my books you know? Anyway--	Scene one. Exterior. 17 Cherry Tree Lane, London. Day.
PAMELA	Yes. That's good, that can stay.
DICK	That's just the scene heading!
PAMELA	--Though I do think we should say number 17, instead of just 17, yes? It's proper.
BOB & DICK	No one's going to see it.
PAMELA	I will see it.
PAMELA	Write it down, write it down, chop chop.
PAMELA	Is that on the tape?
DON	Yes.
PAMELA	Good-- onwards.
DOLLY	I'm sorry to interrupt.
PAMELA	Is this a joke?
DOLLY	Excuse me?
PAMELA	Do you think you are a comedienne?
DOLLY	I'm sorry I don't understand.
PAMELA	Unbelievable.
PAMELA	Scene One. Exterior. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane. London. Day.
PAMELA	Bert, a one-man band-- (she looks up) The rumour is that this is to be your Mister Van Dyke is it?
DICK	We do hope so!
PAMELA	Hmmm, we'll see about that. He's totally wrong, totally and utterly.
BOB	Dick is one of the greats!
PAMELA	Dick Van Dyke? Robert, my dear, Olivier is one of the greats, Burton, Guinness - greats without question. (speaking loudly into the
TAPE RECORDER)	I can assure you Dick Van Dyke is not. (back to script) Bert, a one-man band plays to a small gathering outside the gates to the park.
BERT SAYS--	(she looks to Don) You can do Bert.
DON	(through gritted teeth) Thank you.	Alright Ladies and gents, comical poem, suitable for the occasion--
DON	--extemporized and thought up before your very eyes! Alright, here we go--
DICK	Room here for everyone gather around,
THE CONSTABLE'S
BOB/DICK	"responstable."
DICK	Now, how does that sound?
PAMELA	No no no no no no no.
PAMELA	Responstable is not a word.
DICK	We made it up!
PAMELA	Well, un-make it up.
PAMELA	I've a thought! I've always liked Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay. Now, that would be a wonderful song for the film! Oh! And Admiral Boom could sing it! Do you see?
PAMELA	Irresponstable.
TRAVERS	Ahhh, there's my girl.
TRAVERS	That's it Albert. Give Ginty a smooch. There's a good boy, give her a little smooch.
TRAVERS	Poor old Albert; he's your secret uncle you know? But a miserable, horrid witch turned him into a nag.
GINTY	Why did she do that?!
TRAVERS	Because she hated the sound of his laugh.
GINTY	Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix him?
TRAVERS	We have to teach the witch how to be happy again.
GINTY	How?
TRAVERS	I'm not quite sure darling.	Your mother's been calling you for a good hour. I shouldn't go if I were you, she's after little slaves for housework!	Ah, I must scrub and bake and sweep Till stars are beginning to blink
AND PEEP;	And the young lie long and dream in
THEIR BED	Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head.
TRAVERS	Do you want to know what it feels like to fly Ginty?
TRAVERS	You trust me?
TRAVERS	Gee up, Albert. Yah!
TRAVERS	Yah!
PAMELA	Nobody walks.
RALPH	Leisurely stroll's a gift.
RALPH	Beautiful ain't it?
PAMELA	(refusing him the
SATISFACTION)	If you like that sort of thing.
RALPH	I do.
DON	We do find it helps to have a visual. It's fun!
PAMELA	No, no, no. Goodness no.
DICK	No?
PAMELA	The Banks house doesn't look like that! My house is a terraced house with a pink door, white bricked with a crack in the gable. The window frames are lead-lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pink
DOOR AND--	(gesturing to the tape
RECORDER)	Did we get that? (to herself, slightly
HYSTERICAL)	Oh dear, it's all a big mistake. It's all wrong.
DON	It's all wrong?
PAMELA	It's too grand! The Banks family - they're normal, everyday sort of people. This isn't normal. It isn't everyday! They're not aristocrats!
DICK	Interesting.
PAMELA	Okay.
PAMELA	Do I even have to say it?
DON	Um-- yeah?
PAMELA	Why in the world have you made Mrs Banks a silly suffragette?
BOB	I wonder if Emmeline P would agree with that adjective--
PAMELA	Quite possibly, looking back.
DON	It does seem strange that Mrs Banks allows her children to spend all of their time with the nanny when she has no job to speak of--
PAMELA	Are you calling Mrs Banks neglectful?
BOB	Yep.
DON	No! Of course not! We just felt that if she had a job it would go some way to explaining--
PAMELA	Being a mother is a job. A very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to, that not everybody should have taken on in the first place!
PAMELA	I will NOT have her called Cynthia! Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.
PAMELA	No it should be something warm, a bit sexy.
PAMELA	How about Mavis?
DON	Sybil?
BOB	Sure.
PAMELA	Prudence?
DICK	Gwendolyn?
BOB	Great.
PAMELA	Winifred!
DON	I could go with Winifred.
PAMELA	Yes, that's because it's very good.
PAMELA	This isn't Mr Banks?
PAMELA	This isn't him.
DON	Ahm, yeah, that's him--
PAMELA	He has a set of moustaches!
DON	In the books he--
PAMELA	I told the illustrator I didn't like the facial hair but she chose to ignore me. This is MY film and this time around I shall have MY way.
DOLLY	(clearing her throat) Mrs Travers, it was a specific request, from Walt.
PAMELA	(to the boys) Why?
PAMELA	He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is clean shaven!
BOB	Does it mattterrrrrrr?!
DON	Bob, Bob, Bob--
PAMELA	You can wait outside!
PAMELA	I shan't say it again Robert.
PAMELA	What is wrong with his leg?
DICK	He got shot.
PAMELA	Hardly surprising.
PAMELA	Can I expect anymore drama from anyone else?
GINTY	Why do you do that?
TRAVERS	For you my dear! (he flicks the blade in the air like a swordsman) Swish! Which kind of kisses do you prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy ones or silky ones?
GINTY	Silky ones. A man must shave for to spare his daughter's cheeks! Swish!
PAMELA	Swish.
PAMELA	Swoosh.
DICK	It's something to say when you don't know what to say!
PAMELA	Well I always know what to say.
DISNEY	Hit me with it.
DOLLY	She has a lot of-- ideas.
DISNEY	Ya? What kind of ideas?
DOLLY	About how she, uh, sees things.
DISNEY	And just how does she `see' things?
DOLLY	The name Cynthia has been changed to Winifred.
WALT	Okay that'll work.
DOLLY	She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.
DOLLY	The sketches of the Banks house make it look too opulent, there must be no hint of romance between Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to know why Mr Banks has been given a moustache, the--
WALT	I asked for that.
DOLLY	Yes. They did tell her but she wants to know why.
WALT	Because I asked for it.
DOLLY	Right. Of course. Uh-- the tape measure Mary Poppins uses to record Jane and Micheal's height must be a roll tape, not a ruler, we must add gravi-- gravitas, she says.
DISNEY	Gahd! Anything else?
DOLLY	She only wants green vegetables and broth, I don't know what that is but she wants it in the room from now on and oh! She doesn't want the colour red in the film-- at all.
PAMELA	I've simply gone off the colour.
PAMELA	You did say I was to have final say did you not?
DISNEY	We can't make the film without the colour red! It's set in London for pete's sake.
PAMELA	And?
DISNEY	There's buses and mail boxes and guards uniforms-- heck! The British flag! Pamela, I'm not sure why
YOU'RE--
PAMELA	I understand your predicament Mr Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don't know what it is, I'm just suddenly very anti-red. I shan't be wearing it ever again.
DISNEY	Is this a test Pam? Are you requiring proof of how badly I wanna make you happy so that we can create this beautiful thing together?
PAMELA	I took you at your word Mr Disney and it seems my first stipulation has been denied. There will be many more, so-- perhaps we should just call it quits and I should hand you back these?
DISNEY	Alright. No red in the film.
DON	What?!
DICK	Walt?
BOB	He doesn't have the rights--
PAMELA	Quite.
PAMELA	Now, If you're insisting upon this musicality you feel is SO important for my film then I suggest I hear one of your ditties.
PAMELA	I shall keep an open mind!
DICK	Nanny?
DON	Yeah, do nanny.
BOB	Wanted a nanny for two adorable children.
DICK
ROSY CHEEKS--
BOB PAMELA	in?!
DICK	Love us as a son and daughter
BOB PAMELA	to do with anything?
BOB	You wrote that in your book! She wrote that in her--!
DON	Yeah, I think--
DICK PAMELA	(over) You can't say that--
DICK PAMELA
DICK PAMELA	Put toads in your bed-- Ridiculous!
DICK	Hurry, Nanny!
MANY THANKS	Sincerely, Jane and Michael Banks: Jane and Michael Banks.
PAMELA	Well I simply don't know what to say. That's the worst song I've ever heard.	Ever.
DICK	Alright.
WALT	Tommie!
TOMMIE	Scotch Mist.
WALT	What do you think?
TOMMIE	What do I think I-- what?
WALT	You're a woman.
TOMMIE	That's a canny observation Walt.
WALT	What am I missing?
TOMMIE	You think the female of the species has some kind of psychic insight when it comes to others of her kind?
TOMMIE	We don't.	You'll get yourself an ulcer with all that unriddling. Give it up.
WALT	That woman.
BARMAN	Good afternoon Ma'am. What can I fix you?
PAMELA	A pot of tea.
BARMAN	Sure thing.
PAMELA	Thank you. Tea is a balm for the soul don't you agree?
GINTY	Thank you.
BANK WORKER	Good afternoon Mr Belhatchett.
TRAVERS	Belhatchett. Bell. Hatchett. Ha! It's a ridiculous moniker!
CLERK
SIR--
TRAVERS	And Mr Belhatchett has complained that I opened his stupid bank five minutes late has he? Hahaaa! (in a comedy voice) Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's money my man!
TRAVERS	Bell Hatchett! Beautiful hatchet. That's what it means. And I suppose if the poor dumb lambs on his downs, are five minutes late with their calving, or they don't drop dead on schedule when he wants a roast, he takes to them with the business end of his beautiful hatchet.
TRAVERS	There, whack! That'll teach you for not dropping your bairns on schedule. Whack! Whack! Whack!
TRAVERS	Whack. Whoops! (through the door) Mr Belhatchett! Allow me to--
TRAVERS	Ginty!
RANDOLPH	I want you gone.
TRAVERS	Sweet thing! What are you doing here?
GINTY	You said today was--
TRAVERS	Ice cream day! Yes! I did! What kind of father am I?
GINTY	Are you fired again?
TRAVERS	Ah, yes it does seem that--
RANDOLPH	No. No sweetheart-- he isn't.
TRAVERS	Just wait in my office for a second darling.
RANDOLPH	If you can't straighten up for your own sake. Do it for your daughter. (muttering to himself) Irresponsible.
TRAVERS	Ice cream is so rare because it only comes from Siberian cows. Did you know that?!	Brrrrrrrr!
TRAVERS	We share a Celtic soul, you and I. This world is just an illusion, Ginty old girl. As long as we hold that thought dear, they can't break us. Money, money, money. Don't you buy into it Ginty! It'll bite you on the bot! How did we end up here eh? Look at it. Barren. Breathless. Get as far away from this place as possible my love. Find yourself a patch of green.	It's a chimera you know? The world, the bank, you and I, Mr Randolph- whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an illusion.
PAMELA	I loathe this place, Mr Russell. How can a place so sunny be so cold?
PAMELA	I meant heartless. I'm afraid a jumper wouldn't suffice. It's bringing up these-- it's so hot and stuffy I feel like I am being attacked. These odd dreams, like my subconscious is after me. Punishing me for entertaining the idea that I might hand her over. I am at war with myself Mr Russell.	The script is ghastly, exactly as I
EXPECTED--	Yes, a few more days and then I'll
DECIDE--	I know, I know I need the money. The money. The money.	Money. It'll bite you on the--	It's all an illusion you know Mr Russell? All an illusion.	Very well. Good morning and goodnight.
PAMELA	Serves me right. Money, money, money. Bit me on the bot.
DICK	It's gotta be like a slogan!
BOB	Her prescription for life.
DICK	Yeah! Yes! A stitch in time!
BOB	An apple a day.
DON	(from across the room) Time and tide wait for--
BOB	Sugar!
DICK	Sugar?
DICK	What? That's not--
BOB	Jeff had vaccination day at school yesterday.
DICK	Ouch.
BOB	No ouch.
DICK	No ouch?
BOB	Sugar. They put it in a cube.
DICK	Medicine in sugar?
BOB	Cube's an odd word.
BOB	Spoonful?
DON	Yeah, we have sugar.
WALT	May I walk with you?
PAMELA	I'm sure your country doesn't have any laws about sharing a pavement.
BOB	Go back to the chorus.
DICK & BOB	(singing it incorrectly) Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down!
BOB	Wait! WAIT! She always does what's unexpected. She goes UP the bannisters.
BOB	So go up.
BOB	Try B.
DICK & BOB	(singing `down' in an up
KEY)	Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.
DICK	Yes!
DON	Man is in the forest.
DON	I want you to hear this. (to the boys) Play him what you got.
DICK	It's just a chorus--
BOB	Tell us what you think. He knows dum dum Will help dum dum dum duuuum!
DICK	Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down-- the medicine go do-own, medicine go down Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down In a most de da dee daaa!
BOB	We'll work out the other lyrics.
DICK	You see how it goes up on the word down?
BOB	On the word down it goes up!
PAMELA	Up.
DON	It's ironic.
PAMELA	Is it?
WALT	Forget ironic, it's iconic.
PAMELA	Bravo.
WALT	I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks!
PAMELA	It seems enormously patronising to me. The very sort of annoying tune you would have playing in your themed park I daresay. All giddy and carefree, encouraging children to face the world unarmed. All they need is a spoon and some sugar and a brain full of fluff and they're equipped with life's tools. Wonderful!
WALT	What's your point Pam?
PAMELA	MRS Travers! My point is that, unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is the very enemy of sentiment and whimsy. She is truthful, she doesn't sugar coat the darkness in the world that these children will eventually come to know. She prepares them for it, she deals in honesty. One must clean one's room; it won't magically do it itself!
PAMELA	This whole script is flim flam! Where is its reality? Where is its heart, where is the gravitas?
PAMELA	No weight Mister Disney! See?
WALT	No whimsy or sentiment says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the children.
PAMELA	You think Mary Poppins is saving the children Mr Disney?
PAMELA	Oh dear.
PAMELA	It goes up.
MARGARET	There there. Shush shush now--
MARGARET	(to the girls) If you could just--
TRAVERS	Ahoy Goffs!
GINTY	Father!
MARGARET	What a lovely surprise! Did you finish early?
TRAVERS	I couldn't stop thinking about my beautiful girls on this beautiful day in this beautiful place and I thought to hell with it! (to Ginty and Biddy) And what do we say about beauty ladies?
MARGARET
BUT--
TRAVERS	Buts are for goats my love!
GINTY & BIDDY	Urgh!
TRAVERS	(whispering to Margaret) I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.	What are we playing?
GINTY	The hen got out and we've been trying to catch her!
TRAVERS	That's no hen! That's Aunt Ellie, your mother's horrendiferous sister!
GINTY	That's a made up word!
BIDDY	Really?!
GINTY	Not the aunt!	Quick! Catch her before she flies away on the--
TRAVERS/GINTY	East Wind!
MARGARET	Oh!
TRAVERS	I'll wash them again my love!
TRAVERS	Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast!
GINTY	Aunt Ellie!
TRAVERS	Oh she's a foul fowl!
MARGARET	--darling, it's just that um-- a
LITTLE CONCERNED--
TRAVERS	--Meg sweet, I had a throat scratch-
-
MARGARET	--the bank is getting you down again? Perhaps my sister--
TRAVERS	God no! No. I can endure. I will endure. For the girl's sake-- Just, please-- not Ellie.
MARGARET	Oh my dear--
GINTY	Foul fowl.
DICK	All around the cathedral the saints and apostles look down as she sells her wares
DICK	Although you can't see it you know they are smiling Each time someone shows that he
CARES--
DICK	Though her words are simple and few listen, listen, she's calling to
YOU--	"Feed the birds, tuppence a bag tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag."
WALT	That'll work.
WALT	She's going to say no isn't she?	Woman's a conundrum.
DICK	A man has dreams of walking with
GIANTS	To carve his niche in the edifice
OF TIME	Before the mortar of his zeal Has a chance to congeal The cup is dashed from his lips The flame is snuffed aborning He's brought to rack and ruin in
HIS PRIME--
WALT & DICK	My world was calm, well ordered,
EXEMPLARY	Then came this person, with chaos in her wake And now my life's ambitions go with one fell blow It's quite a bitter pill to take.
WALT	Inspired by someone we know?
DICK	You'd have to ask Bob.
DICK	She might surprise us all.
WALT	She won't.
DICK	You don't know that.
WALT	I do. I know it, I know it only too well.	I've fought this battle from her side. Pat Powers, he wanted the mouse and I didn't have a bean back then.
WALT	He was this big terrifying New York producer and I was just a kid from Missouri with a sketch of Mickey but-- it woulda' killed me to give him up.
WALT	Honest to god killed me. That mouse, he's family.	Go home.
TRAVERS	Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick! Pray tell me, what are you concentrating so hard on?
GINTY	I am laying eggs!
TRAVERS	Really!? Fabulous!
GINTY	Today I am a hen.
TRAVERS	Indeed! I can see the feathers sprouting as we speak!
MARGARET	Helen Goff, would you lay the table for supper please?
GINTY	I'm not Helen!
TRAVERS	She can't possibly lay a table; she's busy laying eggs!
MARGARET	I need-- (help.)
TRAVERS	She's laying!
MARGARET	(her face contorts in
PAIN)	I'm sorry!
TRAVERS	(urgent, his voice
BREAKING)	Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty my love. You can be anyone you want to be. Anyone.
GINTY	I want to be like you.
TRAVERS	Don't.	Don't leave yourself always searching for-- something--
RALPH	Ya alright Mrs?
MRS CORRY	Helen Goff? Wake up dear. You want your banner to be ready for the fair don't you?
BIDDY	Mrs Brill said Father's presenting the medals.
MARGARET	(a flutter of pride) He is indeed! On behalf of the bank.
DON	Mrs Travers?
DON	Mrs Travers?
DON	We were just saying that we'd like to play you the song in the bank.	Would that be good?
DON	(as Dawes Snr) So you have tuppence? May I be permitted to see it? (changing voice to Michael
BANKS)	No, I want it to feed the birds! (back to Dawes Snr) Fiddlesticks boy! Feed the birds and what've you got?
DICK	(singing more sotto than
USUAL)	But! If you invest your tuppence wisely in the bank
CONQUEST--
TRAVERS	(clears his throat) Mr Belhatchett.
MARGARET	Travers, Biddy's stomach--
TRAVERS	Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop whinnying like an old nag will you?
GINTY	Father-- will you ride the carousel with me!?
TRAVERS	Meet you there in a blink of an eye!
DICK	In the hands of the directors who invest as propriety demands.
MARGARET	I'll take Biddy to get ready for her dance.	Where's your father?
MARGARET	Come on Biddy.
TRAVERS	Indeed, a published poet--
GINTY	Father, come and look. Biddy's dancing.
TRAVERS	In a moment, my princess. I'm talking.	Back in Ireland, I miss her green
HILLS SO--
GINTY	But she's-- she really wants you to watch, Dad. You'll miss it.
TRAVERS	Not now Biddy!
GINTY	I'm Ginty.
TRAVERS	Ginty! Shoo!
GINTY	You said don't give up.
WAITER	Excuse me, Miss. It's gentlemen only in this section of the tent. I think you'll be more comfortable at the far end.	Are you alright sweetheart?
GINTY	I'm scared my father is--
TRAVERS	Good afternoon, distinguished guests, our biggest supporter Mr Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!
RANDOLPH	Why is he speaking for the bank?
BANK WORKER	He's the manager.
TRAVERS	I'm honoured to be here on behalf of the Belhatchett Bank of Australia. Shortly, it will be my very pleasant duty to present the awards to our young performers. But before I begin, I'd like to say a very few words to our very youngest citizens about the role of the - er, the Bank in our community.
MARGARET	He's using too many `verys'. He always says `very' too much when
HE'S--
DON	(as Dawes Snr) Very well, my boy, give me the
MONEY	No I won't I want it to feed the birds! (as Dawes Snr) Banks!	Yes sir. Now Micheal...
DICK	When you deposit tuppence in a bank account,
DICK	Soon you'll see that it blooms into credit of a generous amount
SEMIANNUALLY
TRUST DEEDS	Think of the foreclosures! Bonds! Chattels! Dividends! Shares!
TRAVERS	Bankruptcies! Debtor sales! Opportunities! All manner of private enterprise! Shipyards! The Mercantile! Collieries! Tanneries! Incorporations! Amalgamations! Banks!
DON	(as Dawes Snr) While stand the banks of England. England stands!
TRAVERS	Uhmm. Thank you kindly. Thanking you. Now-- what, what am I doing next? Oh! It's a marvellous idea to encourage children to open accounts. My daughter, the Princess Ginty-- she's-- uh. (looks at Ginty) How old are you? Come up here.
TRAVERS	Ginty has a bank account-- and that's good. Give her a drink!
TRAVERS	I mean give her a hand.
TRAVERS	I shall return in just a moment to present the awards. But right now I must-- relieve myself.
TRAVERS	Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will you? I'm busting. There's a good girl.
DON	I love it!
DICK	You think Walt's gonna like it?
PAMELA	Why did you have to make him so cruel?
PAMELA	He was not a monster!
DON	Who are we talking about? I'm confused.
PAMELA	You all have children yes?
DON	Yes.
DICK BOB
PAMELA	And do those children write you letters, make drawings for you?
DON	Of course.
DICK	Mine like to make folded paper--
PAMELA	(cutting him off) And would you tear up those gifts? In front of them?!
PAMELA	It's a dreadful thing to do! I don't understand! Why must father tear up the advertisement his children have written and throw it in the fireplace!? Why won't he mend their kite? Why have you made him so unspeakably awful?	For all the world to see, in glorious technicolor? You claim to make them live-- if that happens can't he? Can't they at least live well?
PAMELA	I can't bear it.
PLEASE DON'T--
PAMELA	Please don't-- I'll feel like I let him down again--
TRAVERS	I don't suppose there's any more you can give me for the pain?
DOCTOR	(leaving the room) When will enough be enough Travers?
GINTY	I've brought you something father.
TRAVERS	Be a darling Ginty my old pal! Help father out won't you?
TRAVERS	In my washroom-- there's a bottle of medicine that father needs--
GINTY	Mother took it away.
TRAVERS	Godammit!
GINTY	I wrote a poem for you. It - it won first prize, at school.
GINTY	Would you like me to read it to you?
TRAVERS	It's hardly Yeats, is it?
DON	Mrs Travers!
RALPH	Mrs?
RALPH	I, uh, brought you a tea.
PAMELA	It's blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup.
RALPH	Everything okay Ma'am? Would you like me to drive you home?
PAMELA	All the way to England? Yes, please.
RALPH	You got family back there Mrs?
PAMELA	You're an impertinent man you know? You ask an awful lot of questions that have no relevance to you being able to carry out your duties.
RALPH	I know! I do, do that. Yes!
PAMELA	And you have no barometer.
PAMELA	Let us say that I haven't family who'd notice whether I was halfway across the world or sitting in my living room.
RALPH
MA'AM; I--
PAMELA	Make a little furrow, there.
RALPH	I gotta kid.
PAMELA	Well, most people do.
RALPH	Jane-- she's got all kinds of troubles.
RALPH	Handicapped you know? Myelitis--  transverse.	She's in a wheelchair see? That's why I concern myself with the weather-- sunny day she can sit out in the garden. Rainy day I have to leave her cooped up inside.	Worry `bout the future, but then I stop cuz you can't do that. Only today.
PAMELA	Now look.
PAMELA	It's a band stand.
RALPH	A river!
PAMELA	Lake.
RALPH	Lake.	Hey! I wish I could take her there!
PAMELA	Wouldn't that be nice?
MARGARET	I know you gave it to him. (squeezing Ginty's hand) All the hope is in the bottom of that bottle, Helen.
GINTY	Mother?
MARGARET	I want you to take care of the children.
MARGARET	Watch over them.
MARGARET	I know you love your father more. But one day you'll understand.
GINTY	What?
GINTY	Mother!
GINTY	Mother! Mother!
BIDDY	Where's ma?
GINTY	Once upon a time there were three little girls alone in a house. They were frightened of the big wide world just outside the door.
GINTY	They were so afraid.
SEE US"
GINTY	And who do you think those sparkling messengers sent? Who was it that came flying through the starry, starry sky to carry us up to see them?
BIDDY	An elf?
GINTY	Their old Uncle Albert of course! (beat, to Biddy) Stay right here, be good--
BIDDY	Are you going to the sky?
GINTY	I'm going to find the end of the story so I can bring it back for you!
BIDDY	Is it happy?
MARGARET	Sometimes a person we love, through no fault of his own, can't see past the end of his nose.
GINTY	It's time to go home, ma.
PAMELA	Mrs Travers! Hello!
WALT	(coughs into phone) Pam!
PAMELA	Mr Disney.
WALT	Callin' to check up on you.
PAMELA	Are you a doctor?
WALT	Hm?
PAMELA	Check ups are for medical practitioners no?
WALT	Pam, are you always so battle ready? P.L. Travers in her breast plate and chain mail, sword up in the air and off with your head!
PAMELA	What can I do for you Mister Disney?
WALT	Please, I beg of you, please please call me Walt.
PAMELA	Walt-- er.
WALT	I heard things didn't go so well today.
PAMELA	They went as well as they've gone every other day that I've been here. I don't recall `special' phone calls from you on any of those other evenings.
WALT	What's this all about Pam? Really?
WALT	I'm wondering what I have to do to make you happy.
PAMELA	Ha!
WALT	Aren't you wondering that too?
WALT	(he has an idea) You know, you've never been to Disneyland! It's the happiest place on Earth! (shouting away from the
PHONE)	Tommie! Cancel my morning tomorrow. I'm taking a ride with my favorite author!	Any excuse.
PAMELA	I cannot tell you how uninterested, no, positively sickened I am at the thought of going to see your dollar printing machine Mr-- Walter.
WALT	Oh come on! When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?!
PAMELA	Disappointments are to the soul what the thunderstorm is to the air.
PAMELA	Hello? Hello? He hung up! I'm! I! I can't believe he hung up!
WALT	I'm not a violent man Tommie but if Mrs P.L. Travers were to get hit by a large truck I-- (he doesn't allow himself
TO FINISH)
WALT	Okay boys. We gotta fix this.
TRAVERS	The Aunt.
ELLIE	Now, I've brought every new fangled treatment available in Sydney.
ELLIE	Close your mouth please Biddy, we are not a codfish. (to both girls) I spy a multitude of jobs to be done!
MARGARET	They've been so worried-- I've--
ELLIE	Do stop babbling nonsense! I'm here now and I shall fix everything.	Girls!	Feverfew and camomile to lower his body temperature. Garlic, sorrel, sage. Deadly nightshade. And if those don't work-- well I shouldn't like to say.
ELLIE	--tincture of horseradish--
LAUDANUM--	(to Ginty and Biddy)
ELLIE	I thought I had made it quite clear you were to begin helping.
ELLIE	Spit spot!
PAMELA	Where are we--? This isn't the way.
RALPH	Change of venue this morning apparently.
PAMELA	(realizing where she's
BEING TAKEN)	Ugh.
RALPH	I was thinking about our-- tea party?
PAMELA	I'm sure I don't know what you're--
RALPH	Yesterday, the little park.
PAMELA	Little park? I haven't a clue what you're talking about.
RALPH
BUT--
PAMELA	Concentrate on the road. Always chitter chattering!
RALPH	Oh! Isn't that nice? Holy mackerel! Wowzers. Never met him myself but there he is! Right there. Real. Living, breathing. Oh boy!
WALT	Welcome to the Magic Kingdom!
PAMELA	Is it all like this?
WALT	Yup! Isn't it wonderful?
PAMELA	Do you always get everything you want Walter?
WALT	Pretty much!
PAMELA	With the exception to the rights to my books of course!
WALT	War ain't over yet Pam!
YOUNG WOMAN	I love you so much! Can I--?
PAMELA	Pre-signed?
WALT	You should get hers too. (gesturing to Pamela) This woman's a bona fide genius!
WALT	In Adventureland there is a tree-- this is a fun fact. A titbit.
PAMELA	Tidbit.
WALT	It has three million leaves, four million flowers.
PAMELA	Gosh.
WALT	And they said only God could make a tree!
WALT	Where did she come from?
PAMELA	Who?
WALT	I think you know who.
PAMELA	She flew in through the window one day.
WALT	Through the window huh?
WALT	It's just that easy isn't it Mrs Travers?
WALT	I know you don't wanna be here so I'm gonna take you to one ride-- my favourite amusement and then I'll set you free.
WALT	Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if you would ride Jingles. She's Mrs Disney's favourite horse.
PAMELA	No thank you. I'm happy to watch.
WALT	No greater joy than that seen through the eyes of a child.
WALT	There's a child in us all.
PAMELA	Maybe in you Mister Disney, but certainly not I.
WALT	Get on the horse Pamela!
WALT	When we first met, you said to me `they're family.'
PAMELA	I said what?
WALT	Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're family.	The boys have had an idea for your Mister Banks. I think it'll make you happy.
PAMELA	You brought me all the way out here to tell me that?
WALT	No. I brought you all the way out here for monetary gain. Had a wager with the boys that I couldn't get you on a ride. I win!
WALT	Yah!
ELLIE	Well begun, is half done!
DON	Good morning Mrs Travers!
PAMELA	What horrors have you in store for my beautiful characters today, hm?
DON	Now, Mrs Travers you sit here.
DON	We thought about what you said Mrs Travers and Mr Banks isn't cruel. He isn't. We've got a new ending for the film. Oh god, I hope you like it.
DON	Michael says, "He mended it! It's wonderful!"
DOLLY	However did you manage it?
PAMELA	He mended it?
DICK	With tuppence for paper and strings You can have your own set of wings With your feet on the ground You're a bird in flight with your fist holding tight To the string of your kite Oh oh oh oh
DICK & BOB	Let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Let's go fly a kite and send it
SOARING	Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite
DON	And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch her suffragettes ribbon.
DOLLY	(as Mrs Banks) "A proper kite needs a proper tail don't you think?!"
SOARING
DICK	When you send it flying up there All at once you're lighter than air
DICK	You can dance on the breeze over houses and trees--
DOLLY	Mr Disney! Walt!
DOLLY	I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just she-- she's dancing! Mrs Travers. She's dancing with Don!
SOARING	Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite!
PAMELA	Well.
BOB	Well?
PAMELA	Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love it!
PAMELA	Though proper English would be `Let us go and fly a kite.'
PAMELA	But I might be willing to overlook that.
BOB	Did we get that on tape?
TRAVERS	Look at you-- all ship shape.
GINTY	I re-wrote the poem father.
GINTY	The aunt gave me tuppence.
GINTY	Shall I buy you something father?
TRAVERS
PEARS--
PAMELA	Father?
PAMELA	Do you know you're quite right? It is beautiful. Exquisite.
RALPH	It's always new.
DON	So Jolly Holiday's in?
PAMELA	As you wish.
PAMELA	Now, how in the world does Mister Disney propose to train penguins to dance?!
BOB	Are you serious?
PAMELA	I've heard about his implausibly leaved trees so I assume he does have some insane penguin wrangling scheme but it does seem rather far fetched. Can you train penguins?
DON	No I don't think you can train an
ACTUAL--
DICK	They're animated.
PAMELA	Sorry?
DON	Dick.
DICK	Cartoons.
DON	Dick.
DON	Crap.
DICK	What? Are we getting real penguins?
DOLLY	Good afternoon Mrs Travers!
PAMELA	Where is Mister Disney?
DOLLY	If you'd like to take a seat--
PAMELA	I would not like to take a seat thank you. I would like to--
DOLLY	Mrs Travers, please!
PAMELA
TOMMIE	Walt, I'm so sorry.
WALT	Don't worry Tommie, please close the door.
WALT	Never let anybody see me smoking. I'd hate to encourage bad habits. Please, sit down.
PAMELA	I shall not sit in the seat of a trickster! A fraudster! A sneak!
WALT
PAMELA--
PAMELA
WALT	Mrs Travers, what in the world has upset you so?
PAMELA	Penguins!
PAMELA	Penguins have very much upset me Mister Disney! Animated, dancing penguins! Now, you have seduced me with the music Mr Disney, yes you have. Those Sherman boys have quite turned my head but I shall not be moved on the matter of cartoons. Not one inch sir!
WALT	It's a sequence--
PAMELA	You promised me. You promised me that this film would not be an animation!
WALT	And it isn't!
PAMELA	So they're real penguins?
WALT	No they're animated.
PAMELA	Oh. (to herself, smiling
RUEFULLY)	You foolish old woman.
PAMELA	Good day Mister Disney.
WALT	Pam! Pamela! Mrs Travers! Wait!
PAMELA	Please call my driver and have him pick me up.
DOLLY	Yes ma'am, when?
PAMELA
WALT	Please Mrs Travers-- You must listen.
PAMELA	You shouldn't make promises you can't keep, especially to children, they hold on to them you see? And those promises they just sit there inside of them, like little doses of poison, all those broken promises, eating away forever.
WALT	Pamela? I don't understand why this is so hard for you. Please, make me
UNDERSTAND--
PAMELA	The books weren't written for the children. They were written for the promise breakers.
WALT	The promise breakers? Mrs Travers I-
-
WALT	Mrs Travers?
RALPH	Woah! Mister Disney!
WALT	Hi.
RALPH	Hi! I'm such a huge fan. It's such an honour to--
RALPH	Excuse me.
RALPH	You ready to go Mrs?
PAMELA	Yes. Thank you.
WALT
PAMELA--
PAMELA	I'm so sorry Mister Disney. To have put everyone to so much trouble.
WALT	You must reconsider. You must.
PAMELA	I simply can't give her up. Not yet. Perhaps not ever. I don't know
WHY
DISNEY	You do know why!
PAMELA	I can't, he's--
DISNEY	He's?
PAMELA	I just-- Goodbye Mr Disney.
RALPH	The lady's ready to go now sir.
WALT	He's?
RALPH	It's been a pleasure driving you Mrs.
PAMELA	No one likes a fibber.
RALPH	I really have enjoyed it. Didn't know who you were at first and then guess what?
PAMELA	You found out?
RALPH	I was telling my daughter all about my day and how I was driving this nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for Mr Disney and--
PAMELA
AND--
RALPH
AND--	(he leans into the
PASSENGER WINDOW)	And she makes me go to her bedroom and get this! (he pulls out a Mary
POPPINS BOOK)	Can't stop reading it. I'm very slow mind you.
PAMELA	Would you like me to sign it?
RALPH	Would you?!
PAMELA	I'd be honoured.
PAMELA	Your daughters name?
RALPH	Jane.
PAMELA	Really?
RALPH	Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.
PAMELA	(reading as she writes) To Jane and her dearest father-- (she looks at him) I've just this instant realized I don't know your name.
RALPH	Ralph.
PAMELA	Pamela.
RALPH	Pamela.
PAMELA	You're the only American I have ever liked, Ralph.
RALPH	May I ask why?
PAMELA	No. Now take this--
RALPH	Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo--	What is this?
PAMELA	They all had difficulties. Jane can do anything that anyone else can do, do you understand?
PAMELA	Look at the bottom.
RALPH	Walt Disney!
PAMELA	Deficiencies in concentration and hyperactive behavior. Explains everything!
RALPH	Thank you Mrs.
WALT	She's gone?
TOMMIE	Flight left 10 minutes ago.
WALT	(expecting to read her
NAME)
PAMELA TRA--	Goff? Who's Helen Goff?
TOMMIE	Her. That's her real name.
DOLLY	Yuh, didn't you know? She's all hoity toity. British this and British that and she's really an Aussie called Helen Goff. Stuck up--
WALT	Then who's Travers?
WALT	(smiles to himself) I've been talking to the wrong person.
MARGARET
DADDY--
GINTY	I want to see my father.
MARGARET	No, you mustn't.
GINTY	I want to see him!
AUNT ELLIE	Let her go Margaret.
GINTY	I dropped the pears.
GINTY	I'm sorry daddy.
GINTY	You promised you would fix everything.
PAMELA	Hello house.
PAMELA	Oh dear god!
WALT	It was one heck of a job getting a seat on the very next flight, let me tell you.
PAMELA	But, you always get what you want eventually. Isn't that right Walter?
WALT	How about you show me how to make one of those nice English pots of tea?
PAMELA	Milk. The milk goes in first.
WALT	I remember.
PAMELA	And whiskey. I'll have whiskey in mine.
WALT	Oh.	Oh well, when in Rome!
PAMELA	You've come to change my mind. To beat me into submission.
WALT	No, I've come because you misjudge me.
PAMELA	How do I misjudge you?
WALT	You look at me and you see some kind of Hollywood King Midas.
WALT	You think I've built an empire and that I want to use your Mary Poppins as just another brick in my kingdom. You think I see her with a carpetbag full of greenbacks.
PAMELA	And don't you?
WALT	If that was all it was would I have pursued an cranky, stubborn dame like you for twenty years? I'd've have saved myself an ulcer!	No, you expected me to disappoint you and so you made sure I did. You see, I think life disappoints you, Mrs Travers. I think it's done that a lot. Maybe Mary Poppins is the only person in your life who hasn't.
PAMELA	Mary Poppins isn't real.
WALT	Oh, no, that's not true. She's real as can be to my daughter's and to thousands of other children-- adults too. She's been there as a nighttime comfort to a heck of a lot of people.
PAMELA	Well, Where is she when I need her? Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins and who should be standing there but Walt Disney!
WALT	Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped this would be a magical experience for you, for all of us. But I let you down-- and in doing so, I've broken a twenty year old promise to my girls.	I've been wracking my brains, trying to figure out why this has been so hard for you and I--	You see, I have my own Mr Banks. Mine had a moustache.
PAMELA	Ah! Not true then that Disney created man in his own image?
WALT	But it is true that you created yourself in someone else's yes?
WALT	Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs Travers? Do you know Missouri at all?
PAMELA	Can't say I do and as I have no plans to ever set foot on American soil again I'm afraid I never will.
WALT	It's mighty cold there in the winters. Bitter.
WALT	(it pours out) My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a newspaper delivery route there. Thousand papers. Twice daily. Morning and evening edition. Elias, he was a tough businessman. A save- a-penny anywhere you can type of fella so he wouldn't employ any delivery boys, he just used me and my big brother Roy. I was eight then-- eight years old.	Like I said, those winters were harsh and old Elias didn't believe in new shoes until the old ones were worn right through so--	Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow would be up to here--
WALT	You'd push through it like wading through molasses.
WALT	And the cold and the wet would be seeping through the shoes and the skin would be raw and peeling from our faces-- and sometimes I'd find myself sunk down in the snow, waking up, cuz I must've passed out for a moment-- I dunno. Then school, too cold to figure out an equation. And back into the snow so by the time we got home it'd be just getting dark, and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came back to life in the warmth. My mother would feed us dinner and then it'd be time to go out again for the evening edition.	Best be quick Walt, best be quick or poppa's gonna show you the buckle end again boy.
WALT	Now, I don't tell you all this to make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't. I love my life - it's a miracle. And I loved my daddy, boy I loved him. But, there isn't a day goes by where I don't think of that little boy in the snow and old Elias with his fist and strap and I'm just so tired-- I'm tired of remembering it that way. Aren't you tired Mrs Travers? We all have our tales but don't you want to find a way to finish the story? Let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by a past?	It's not the children she comes to save. It's their father.	It's your father--?	Travers Goff.
PAMELA	I don't know what you think you know about me Walter--
WALT	You must've loved and admired him a lot to take his name--
PAMELA
I--
WALT	Mrs. Travers. It's all about him isn't it? All of this. Everything.
WALT	Forgiveness. It's what I learned from your books.
PAMELA	I don't need to forgive my father. He was a wonderful man.
WALT	No, you need to forgive Helen Goff. Life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself.
WALT	Give her to me, Mrs Travers. Trust me with your precious Mary Poppins. I won't disappoint you. I swear that every time a person goes into a movie house - from Leicester to St Louis, they will see George Banks being saved. They will love him and his kids, they will weep for his cares, and wring their hands when he loses his job. And when he flies that kite, oh! They will rejoice, they will sing. In every movie house, all over the world, in the eyes and the hearts of my kids, and other kids and their mothers and fathers for generations to come, George Banks will be honoured. George Banks will be redeemed. George Banks and all he stands for will be saved. Maybe not in life, but in imagination. Because that's what we storytellers do. We restore order with imagination. We instill hope again and again and again. Trust me, Mrs Travers. Let me prove it to you. I give you my word.
PAMELA	Enough.
TOMMIE	Walt.
TOMMIE	Invitation list for the premiere.
WALT	Is that everyone?
TOMMIE	Not everyone.
WALT	We'll premiere in London as well. It'll be more convenient for her.
WALT	There'll be cameras, press, interviews-- I have to protect the picture.
TOMMIE	Okay.
PAMELA	I should say so too.
PAMELA	For goodness sake!
PAMELA	Please don't screech like an alleycat!
DIARMUID	I am so pleased to hear that Mrs Travers.
PAMELA	I should think you'll have a draft very soon.	Polly! Where's that tea?	It's coming along marvelously!
PAMELA	Would you pour please?
POLLY	You're perfectly capable of doing it yourself.
PAMELA	She's quite the worst maid I've ever had!
DIARMUID	So why do you keep her?
PAMELA	I don't know-- she reminds me of me.
DIARMUID	Do you have a title?
PAMELA	Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.
DIARMUID	Wonderful. Should we start talking about the film rights?
PAMELA	NEVER again.
DIARMUID	Okay.	Now, tell me, Have you got your tiara for the premiere?
PAMELA	Oh, I'm not going.
DIARMUID	Why not?
PAMELA	Hollywood premieres are not for old trout like me. Anyway, it's not
CONVENIENT--
DIARMUID	He hasn't invited you, has he?
DIARMUID	Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for that.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Can I help you?
PAMELA	I'm perfectly capable thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Suit yourself-- ma'am.
PAMELA	I shall!
WALT	Morning Dolly.
WALT	What?
PAMELA	Me again!
WALT	Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see you. What brings you to--
PAMELA	I'm here for my premiere.
WALT	Great!
PAMELA	I didn't receive my invitation, but I just assumed the American postal service had fallen down on the job as per usual.
WALT	I'll have a-- uh, replacement sent to your hotel right away.
PAMELA	That's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew you wouldn't have forgotten me.
WALT	Pam, how could I?
PAMELA	How indeed? You did, after all, assure me that I wouldn't be disappointed.
PAMELA	I thought I left you in London.
PAMELA	Would you call me a taxi please?
DOORMAN	Absolutely.
RALPH	Had a feeling a certain friend of mine might be needing me tonight.
PAMELA	Ralph!
RALPH	You look like a million bucks! Let's get you to the ball.
RALPH	(in her ear) This is your night. None of this would be possible without you.
BERT	You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father.
BERT	There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.
BERT	I don't like to see any living thing caged up.
JANE	Father in a cage?
BERT	They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.
BERT	Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.
MICHEAL	You won't ever leave us will you?
JANE	Whatever would we do without you?
MARY POPPINS	I shall stay until the wind changes.
WALT	It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's alright. Mr Banks is going to be all right. I promise.
PAMELA	No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I can't abide cartoons!	Winds in the East Mist coming in--
TRAVERS	--Like something is brewing, about to begin--
TRAVERS	Can't put me finger on what lies in
STORE--
TRAVERS	But I feel what's to happen, all
HAPPENED BEFORE--
