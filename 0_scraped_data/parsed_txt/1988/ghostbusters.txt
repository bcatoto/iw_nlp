Ghostbusters

WERECHICKEN  	(A CROWING HOWL)
WERECHICKEN 	(ANOTHER HOWL, nearer now) The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.
WERECHICKEN 	(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)
ZEKE	Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.
MAUDE	Jes' set easy, Zeke. (she rises; heads for door) I'll take a look-see.
WERECHICKEN 	(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)MAUDE	(as she goes) Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.
MAUDE	What's got you girls so durned upset? There a coyote sneakin' 'round?
WERECHICKEN 	(Low, gutteral CLU-UCK)
MAUDE	(GASP!)WERECHICKEN	(Frightening SHRIEK)
TV WEREWOLF	(eerie HOWL)
ZEKE	(without looking up) Everythin' okay out there, Maude?
MAUDE-CHICKEN	(CLUCKS)
ZEKE 	What say?
MAUDE-CHICKEN 	(more CLUCKS)
ZEKE	(SCREAMS)ZEKE 	(YELLING) Get away!' Scat!  Shoo!
MAUDE-CHICKEN 	(loud SQUAWKING)
ZEKE 	(from distance) Help!... He-elp!
PETER 	Egon, could you hold off on the weather balloon bit for a minute?
PETER 	It's Your night to take out the trash.
RAY	And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.
EGON	(preoccupied; through above) Be with you in ... (checks watch) ...one minute, fifty-three seconds.
PETER AND RAY	(AD-LIB REACTIONS as they bounce off balloon)
SLIMER 	(big muffled SQUEAL)
PETER	(pissed; sarcastic) Thanks, Slimer.  I really needed that!
SLIMER	Sorreee!
RAY	(irritated) Egon!  The phone!
EGON	(preoccupied with remote controls) In a minute, Ray.
WINSTON	(sarcastic) Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself. (picks up phone) Ghostbusters Central.
WINSTON	Calm down... Where are you?... (a BEAT as he listens) We'll be right there.
WINSTON	Ready for this one?  Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
PETER	Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores. (he drops trash bags) Let's roll!
EGON	I think I've finally perfected it.  Watch this, guys. (a BEAT, he looks around over shoulder) Guys?
RAY	It sure feels strange not having Egon with us.
PETER	(sarcastic) Why?  Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us.
WINSTON	But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be a rich man!
PETER	Good.  Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.
MAUDE-CHICKEN	(Egg-laying CLUCKS)
MAUDE-CHICKEN	(SQUAWKS and CLUCKS)
ZEKE	Had big blood-red eyes, it did.  Biggest dang chicken I ever seen.  Mebbe six feet tall.
WINSTON	Shouldn't be hard to find.
RAY	Did it have any distinguishing marks?
PETER	Ray!  It's six feet tall!
PETER 	(over shoulder as he goes) Thank you, Sir.  We'll put out a missing chicken report right away.
PETER	(as they go) This one's easy, guys.  Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn.
RAY	No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here.
WINSTON	A werechicken?
PETER	Get serious, Ray.
RAY	Then explain those!
SLIMER	(SNIFFS as he goes)
SLIMER 	Ow!
SLIMER	(amazed GASP!)
RAY	(excited) What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!
PETER	Look, if this is a werechicken egg,
PETER 	...how come there's no PKE reading?
RAY	(looking at meter in Peter's hand) I dunno... that is strange.
WINSTON	Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests.  Then maybe we'll have some answers.
RAY	Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.
PETER	(throws up his hands with heavy SIGH) I'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer.
PETER  	(shaking his head; as he goes) Werechickens.
WERECHICKEN  	(BREATHING & SLOBBERING)PETER	(through above) Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you:  How about analyzing this?
EGON	Interesting.  That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen.
PETER	I don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets.
WINSTON	(tired) Ray, it's gettin' pretty late.  Maybe there really isn't any...
RAY	(holds up one hand) Shh!
RAY	(low voice) It's in there.
WINSTON	(unclipping his blaster) Then let's get it!
WINSTON	(WHISPER)
	Man, this place is creepy.
RAY	(WHISPER)
	It's in here -- I can feel it.
WINSTON	Look out!
RAY & WINSTON	(relieved SIGHS)
WERECHICKEN 	(HEAVY BREATHING)RAY	(whisper) Something's close.  Very close.
WERECHICKEN 	(HEAVY BREATHING)WERECHICKEN	(HEAVY RASPY BREATHING)WERECHICKEN  	(HEAVY PANTING)RAY 	It is a werechicken!
WINSTON	Man, he is ugly!
WERECHICKEN	(ROARS angrily)
RAY	Bad choice of words, Winston.
WERECHICKEN	(loud SHRIEKING SQUAWK)
WERECHICKEN	(SHRIEKS)SPIRIT	(big ROAR)
RAY	Trap out!
WINSTON	Hang on!  That's it!
RAY	We've almost got him!
CHICKEN	(Normal CLUCKING)
RAY	(looking at chicken) Well, that takes care of one werechicken.
RAY 	Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's wife.
WINSTON	Ray, I just had a thought...
WINSTON 	What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's wife?
EGON	(straining) Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't have time to examine this egg tonight.  I have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning.
EGON 	(through above) But it'll be safe in here.
SLIMER	Yeah.
SLIMER	(big YAWN) G'night, Egon.
EGON	Goodnight, Slimer.
SLIMER	(SNORING)SLIMER	Fooooood.
SLIMER	(licking his lips) Yummy!
SLIMER	(SQUEALS, then GRUNTS)
SLIMER	(HUMMING through above)
SLIMER	(still HUMMING)
BABY WERECHICKEN	(SNARLING, CACKLING)SLIMER	(startled SCREAM)
PETER	(AD LIB SINGING)PETER	(startled YELL; then:) Slimer!  How 'bout some privacy??
SLIMER	(pointing, eyes wide) Monster!  Inna kitchen!
PETER	Monster?
SLIMER	(nods) Uh-huh!  Uh-huh! (imitates werechicken)EGON	(looking around) Ow!
BABY WERECHICKEN  	(CACKLING fading into distance)
EGON 	(dazed) What?
EGON-CHICKEN	(Weird CLUCK)
PETER	(CALLS)
	Egon? (to Slimer) Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster.
EGON-CHICKEN	(CHICKEN HOWL)SLIMER	(SQUEALS as he goes)
PETER	Holy cow!!
EGON-CHICKEN	(LOUD GROWL)END ACT ONE	-----------
-----------
EGON-CHICKEN	(SNARLING as he goes)
PETER	(horrified) What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!
RAY 	Peter!  Wait!
PETER	(surprised as he looks around) Hey!
EGON-CHICKEN 	(SNARLS)PETER	(irritated; through above) What's wrong with you guys?  That thing ate Egon!
RAY	Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken!
PETER	(looking at door) You're kidding! (a BEAT, then) Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance.
WINSTON	(looking toward door) What happened?  He's so quiet all of a sudden.
RAY	It's the moon!
RAY 	Tonight's the first --
RAY 	-- lunar eclipse in ten years!
PETER	Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken?
RAY	(turning to others) Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full.
RAY	(tentative) Egon?
EGON	Ray, what is going on?
EGON 	And why am I naked?
SLIMER	(as he enters) Egon!PETER	Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news.
EGON	(as he sits) Bad news first.
WINSTON	You've been turned into a werechicken!
EGON	A werechicken?
RAY	(flipping through book) Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens! (reads) "The werechicken appears during the full moon.  Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken." (he looks at Egon) That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...
EGON	(through above) I remember the bite clearly.  How long will I stay like this?
RAY	(looking in Tobin's Guide) According to this, there is an antidote. But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes!
RAY	(reading through above) "One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin..."
EGON	(weakly) I don't feel well.
PETER	(through above) Take it easy, Egon.  You're gonna be fine. (SHOUTS O.S.; worried) Hurry it up, guys!
RAY	(reading hurriedly) "And one tablespoon of chickenbane."
SLIMER	(aghast) No chickenbane!
RAY	Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon!
PETER 	(YELLS)
	Come on, Ray!!
PETER  	(YELLS o.s.) He's changing again!
RAY	(breathless) Quick, Egon, drink this!
EGON	(swallowing, GULPING sounds)
WINSTON	We're too late!
PETER	What happened?
RAY	The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane.
PETER	Well, we hafta do something!
EGON	Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter. There's a logical solution to every problem.
BABY WERECHICKEN 	(HOWL)SLIMER	(SQUEALS as he goes)
WINSTON	What was that?
RAY	The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still out there somewhere.
PETER	(to others) Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else! (to Egon) Un, no offense, Egon.
PETER	(into radio mike) All quiet on the chicken front.  How about down there?
RAY	Not a peep.
WINSTON	(gives Ray a dirty look) No pun intended.
PEOPLE	(SCREAMING as they exit)
WINSTON	That's it!
BOX BOY	(breathless) It's in there!  A big chicken!  It's gotta be ten feet tall!
WINSTON	Ten feet tall?
BOX BOY	(nods) Maybe fifteen, I dunno.  Big! (he runs o.s.) I'm outta here!
RAY	(to Winston) Let's split up.
WINSTON	How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken?
BUTCHER 	(frightened SCREAM)
RAY	We didn't!  Come on!
BUTCHER	A giant chicken just came through here -- it was thirty feet tall!
WINSTON	Thirty feet tall?
BUTCHER 	Yeah!  Look what it did to those cars!
PETER 	(into radio) It's how big?  Okay, Ray, I admit you were right about these Werechickens,...
PETER 	...but I definitely don't buy them growing to the size of buildings.
SLIMER	(covers mouth, LAUGHTER FIZZING through his closed, flapping lips. "How absurd.")
SLIMER	(SCREAMS)WERECHICKEN	(deafening HOWL)
PETER	(into mike) Ray, you were right!  The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise!
RAY	(into radio) On our way, Peter.
JANINE 	(big SCREAM)
EGON	(startled CLUCK)
JANINE	Egon!  What happened?
EGON	It's a long story, Janine.   Can you get my coat, please?  I'm due at the weather board in forty-five...
	...minutes.
JANINE	But what ...? (thinks better of asking) Nevermind.
JANINE	Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like -- this?
EGON	Trust me.  I'm of sound mind at least.
EGON	(CLUCKING as he goes)
CROWD	(panicky WALLA)
PETER	(into radio) It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building.
RAY 	Check!  We're almost there.
WERECHICKEN 	(HOWLS)PETER	Take over, Slimer!
SLIMER	Roger!
WERECHICKEN	(enraged HOWLS)
RAY	Let's reel him in!
SPIRIT	(angry HOWLS)
WINSTON	(loud) Trap's full!  Somebody forgot to empty it!
RAY	(YELLS)
	Whose job was it?
RAY AND WINSTON	EGON'S!
RAY 	It's gonna blow!
WINSTON 	(over walkie-talkie) Peter, get outa here!
WERECHICKEN	(HOWLS)PETER	So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys'
RAY	(SNAPS finger) Peter, that's not a bed idea!  Chicken freezes at very low temperatures!
WINSTON	Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August?
RAY, WINSTON & PETER	Egon's weather balloon!
EGON	Distinguished members of the Weather Board, my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu- capability --
EGON 	... of entering the upper atmosphere where clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur.
BOARD	(puzzled MUTTERING WALLA)
EGON 	There, it can electronically alter weather cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun, rain, or...snow.
BOARD MEMBERS	(excited WALLA)
EGON	(to Board members) I, er, can explain this, but --
SLIMER	(WHISPERING MUTTERS)EGON	What?
WERECHICKEN	(distant SQUAWKS)
WEATHER BOARD MEMBERS	(SCREAMING)PETER	(loud over engine) Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons
EGON	(holds up wings) Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.
PETER	(nods) Piece of cake.
WERECHICKEN	(hideous CROW)
WINSTON	What's it doing?
RAY	It looks like it's about to lay an --
WINSTON	(with dread) I don't want to hear it.
EGON	Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position. Turn the lever to the extreme left.
WERECHICKEN	(angry SQUAWKS)
RAY AND WINSTON	They did it!  All-right!!
MAUDE 	(calls) Anyone for dessert?
EGON	(raising hand) You bet, Maude.
PETER	Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!
EGON	I'm actually starting to like it.
MAUDE	No more werechicken problems for us, eh, Egon?WERECHICKEN 	(HOWL)WINSTON	Uh-oh.
RAY	It came from the lab!
WERECHICKEN 	(another HOWL)
SLIMER	(HOWLS)WINSTON	(big SIGH) It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James Brown tape.
SLIMER	(a la James Brown) I feel good! I knew that I would So good, so good, so good! (big James Brown HOWL as we --)PETER	(long-suffering) Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken outfit?
