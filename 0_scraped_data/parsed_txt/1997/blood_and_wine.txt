Blood and Wine

ALEX	There I was, passing the wine, passing the bread, I suddenly felt like the priest at Masst Or maybe Mass started out as a wine tasting, and Jesus was a salesman. what do you think? He goes into
GABRIETM	I don't want to spoil a religious experience.
ALEX	-- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf? He throws away some of the glasses.
ALEX	Duboeuf has a nose and a palate -- like a gift from God. He can taste a single grape before the harvest... and describe the beaujolais it's going to produce. She laughs.
GABRIELLA	Oh, you have competition.
ALEX	You know how many bottles I have in this store? Open any one of 'em, I'll tell you the vintage and vintner, b lindfolded. He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties. She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band. She whips them over his eyes. He laughs.
GABRIELLA	Okay. Show me.
ALEX	Victoria's Secret 95. She passes her glass under his nose.
ALEX	Gabriella, I picked these wines.
GABRIELLA	So what is it?
ALEX	All I can smell is your perfume. She laughs.
GABRIELLA	I'm not wearing any.
ALEX	I even bought it for you. She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers her breast to the glass and then to his mouth.
GABRIELLA	Tell me now. He kisses her wet breast.
ALEX	Beychevelle '83. Lot of body. Very aggressive. He pulls off the panty blindfold, kisses her on the mouth softly, then fully.
GABRIELLA	Don't think you have to say it because .1 say it, Alex.	Doesn't mean anything..
ALEX	It means something to me.
GABRIELLA	We're good together, aren't we. Alex lets out a breath.
ALEX	Oh, yeah... We're pretty good. He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting room.
ALEX	You think you're gonna steal my car, asshole? The younger man whirls around.
YOUNG MAN	You scared me, man. A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from behind the wheel.
REPO MAN	This is not your car, sir. This car belongs to the Star Leasing Company. Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a higher wattage than the security lights.
REPO MAN	I can collect either the money or the car. Given how much you owe, I figure it's the car. The younger man has almost hacked through the chain.
ALEX	Pop the. trunk.
REPO MAN	We inventory the property at the yard. He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as soon as the exit is clear.
ALEX	I just want to show you something. Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the still-running car.
YOUNG MAN	What are you doing? The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk.
ALEX	Do you drink?
REPO MAN	Not on the job. What is this, booze?
ALEX	Two cases of single malt whiskey aged in the barrel before he was born.
REPO MAN	The Caddy's overdue.
ALEX	So are you. Drink it with the kid. Teach him what smooth is. Enjoy yourselves. Isn't that worth a few days' breather...	My accountant's a fuck-up. So am I, maybe, for not firing him. The bolt cutters clip through. The chain falls.
YOUNG MAN	We're clear.
ALEX	It's late, Jason.
JASON	I'm going out tonight. Alex exhales.
ALEX	You can't'fish all night and work all day.
JASON	Working for you doesn't exactly tax my mind.
ALEX	No wonder you drop bottles.
JASON	Fire me.
ALEX	Do you do it on purpose?
JASON	Fishing bought me my bike.
ALEX	I almost knocked it over trying to get out of the car.
JASON	I wasn't sure you were coming home.
SEVERS	The TOASTER OVEN DINGS. Jason takes out a muffin, it in two with his fishing knife.
ALEX	Use a regular knife.
JASON	This has a better edge. Feel it (pointing it at Alex,
BLADE FLAT)	-- feel it. Their voices are rising.
ALEX	Pointed, it's a fucking weapon. Put it away.
JASON	Hell with you. Jason exits to the stairs.
ALEX	And keep your voice down. Your mother's asleep.
STAIRS
JASON	If you got home on time once in a while, maybe she could skip the chemical help. Alex is also on the stairs.
ALEX	You have no idea, none, zip, what goes on in a marriage.
JASON	Yeah, well, I'm learning more than I want to.
SUZANNE	is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular, like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build.
JASON	It's not an argument.
ALEX	I asked him to clean up downstairs.
SUZANNE	Maybe he hadn't finished-
ALEX	A modicum of cooperation, you know?
JASON	A modicum. What's that. Modicum my ass. He pushes past his mother toward his own room. Suzanne follows him down the hallway, leaving. Alex behind.
SUZANNE	I don't like that tone from: you.
JASON	Then go to bed.
ALEX	Hey!
JASON	What!
SUZANNE	It's too late for this.
ALEX	Jason has gone into his room. He slams the door.
CHOOSES	enters his bedroom. Suzanne, alone for a-moment, to enter Jason's room.
SUZANNE	He's my husband.
JASON	I know, Mom.
SUZANNE	-- I still love him.
JASON	Whatever. She walks out.
SUZANNE	Lie down, I'll give you a back rub. She stumbles slightly against the bed, catches a bed post for balance, flops back on the bed with a laugh.
SUZANNE	-- maybe I'd better lie down. He bends down to kiss her, then heads for the television. Suzanne props herself up on her elbows. He pops a cassette into the VCR: porno, she assumes. She does her best.
SUZANNE	I liked the twin nurses. There was kind of a story. Alex brings the remote control back to bed.
ALEX	You'll like this one better.
SUZANNE	Rio?
ALEX	I've been so busy. We could sneak away for a week.. Would you like that?
SUZANNE	If we really go. Last time I packed, we went nowhere.
ALEX	Last time was different.
SUZANNE	(watching the tape) The beaches -- I thought we had a beach. I read how the hotels keep spotters on the roof with scopes, to keep thieves away from the guests. They can look at every inch of your body through the scope. (with a low laugh) Do you mind that I like that? Alex? He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape.
JASON	:. Bite...
JASON	Henryl Fish ont The line screams out. Jason's ready. He sets the hook.
JASON	Time to go to work, man! C'mon. scratching. HENRY, 33. He wears a red Panama hat that's
HENRY	Who we got?
JASON	Let's find out. He hauls back on the rod, the line rises from the ocean, they both recognize the fish at the end.
HENRY	Fucking sharks. Miami's fished out of the good stuff. Damn. He spits over the side. Jason grins.
JASON	This one's got more to worry about than you do. He starts to reel in the fish. Henry moves to the wheel.-
HENRY	Just shoot 'Jaws' in the water. I want to know the sucker's good and dead 'fore he sets a fin in my boat. You got a barb on that hook? .
JASON	Oh, yeah. Jason braces for the fight.
HENRY	The Gulf, man, that's the place. And what makes you think fifty-fifty is right? My boat. My gas.
JASON	My skill. (slicing off the fins) ... My fins.
HENRY	You cool?
JASON	I'm cool.
HENRY	We cool. Jason guns his Ducati.
ALEX	Rob, has Jason shown up? A man's French-accented VOICE answers him from the store.
ALEX	You have his paycheck there?
ROBERT	All ready.
 CHEF	You no like my company? Fine. Who cares. Bring me more fin, you retire. You no want to retire? Good. Don't charge starving Chinese so much for these things.
JASON	You ever caught a shark?
CHEF	You ever cook one?
JASON	Lemme -- lemme show you something. Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display a fresh gash across his arm.
JASON	He was already gaffed onto the side of the boat, good as dead. Two hours dead! And I was still too close to the mouth. Revenge is the last instinct to go, did you know that? The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint.
CHEF	-- Work's a dangerous thing. (smiling with lots of
TEETH)	Nice fin, Jason. He tosses the fins in a cauldron of boiling water, slaps the CASH REGISTER on the side. It RINGS.
MIAMI SKYLINE	Jason weaves through traffic, expert enough to take chances that goose the adrenalin.
ALEX	Just get in the car.
ALEX	You stink.
JASON	I washed.
ALEX	There's Wash IN Dries in the glove compartment. Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one, rubs his hands.
ALEX	... I'm trying here, Jason -- I really am. When you didn't want to go to college, I took your side, I said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish college, and I've done all right. I gave you a job', a steady check, which is more than anybody else has done. And what do I get back? Shit. I've tried to teach you the business -- the care, the finesse... Jason laughs dismissively.
ALEX	Well, look at it this way, Jason, someday you'll have your boat and I'll have my vineyard, and the best part '11 be they're nowhere near each other.
JASON	I'll send you a Christmas card.
ALEX	Save the stamp.
ALEX	Hi, mike -- what's the score?
MIKE
(CHECKING THE
APPOINTMENT BOARD)	Dolphins down by nine, minute forty to go. It's over.
ALEX	Don't underestimate Marino. Mike ticks off the appointment, raises the gate.
MIKE	I told you, they don't have it this year. With a wave of acknowledgment for Mike, Alex.. drives onto the grounds.
ALEX	Judas! Grinning, Mike routinely writes down the license plate number.
ALEX	Wine delivery. The INTERCOM CLICKS off. They hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. The door opens. Jason's eyes focus. He's hooked. Gabriella is smiling at Alex. She has her arms full of clean burp cloths.
GABRIELLA	Oh, the boss himself!
ALEX	(with a modest chuckle) How are you? She glances politely toward Jason, not at all expecting what she sees. A circuit connects between them.
ALEX	Gabriella takes care of Baby Reese.	This is my stepson, Jason.
GABRIELLA	How do you do.
JASON	Hi.
GABRIELLA	Is the wine for the boat? Come through the house.
DINA	-- what's the point of having it, if I can't wear it, Frank?
AGENT	You can wear it anywhere you like, Mrs. Reese -- except out of the country. Gabriella leads Alex and Jason aboard. Frank likes Alex and is glad to see him. Alex can't help glancing at Dina's long legs.. She smiles.
FRANK	Alex, should we insure the wine while we're at it? His arms tired,'Alex is happy to set down the case.
ALEX	Aren't you covered on your home policy?
GABRIELLA	I'll show you, come on.
AGENT	How much wine are we talking about? Jason follows Gabriella down below, the VOICES on the deck fading.
JASON	Big boat. Gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him. They're both kids.
GABRIELLA	ugly, isn't it. He grins and relaxes, looks around.
JASON	The fittings are definitely -- yeah on the ugly side. But damn, she's solid.
GABRIELLA	Oh, a boat type.
JASON	(proud, defensive) I like.boats. Gabriella shows him the climatized, built-in wine closet next to the galley. He starts to rack the bottles while she watches. He talks to stop her from leaving.
JASON	So where you headed?
GABRIELLA	I'm not going, 'I can't go.
JASON	They don't want to take the baby.
GABRIELLA	I•don't have a green card, I can't leave the country. Baby goes with an American nurse. I house-sit. It's fine.
JASON	You don't like them. Gabriella laughs.
GABRIELLA	God. I'm obvious. I just don't like working for people, but that's life. He chafes under authority the same way she does.
JASON	Doesn't have to be.
GABRIELLA	Maybe not with a rich stepfather. He laughs.
JASON	Worst kind.
GABRIELLA	No.	You don't appreciate what you have, Jason. It's very poor where I came from.
JASON	Where's that?
GABRIELLA	Venezuela. Do I look it?
JASON	I don't know, I never been there.
GABRIELLA	Well, I don't. My mother's Indian. The India kind of Indian.	Imagine a house where the father asks 'What's for dinner' in Spanish, and the mother answers 'Curry' in Hindi. 'Que hay para cenar' she says, 'Murgee, masala, ghaal.' He says, 'No es importante.' No wonder I'm nuts.
JASON	You don't seem too nuts. She laughs.
GABRIELLA	You don't know mel
AGENT	-- so back to the safe it goes -- Dina lifts up the baby and smells its bottom.
FRANK	Dina, that's disgusting.
DINA	The alternative is using your fingers, Frank. which offends you more? Alex laughs. Frank pushes back his chair.
FRANK	Don't encourage her, Alex. Her mouth is big enough. Dina is hurt.
FRANK	(to the agent) I'll show you that painting in our stateroom. The agent follows him away.
ALEX	(kindly; to Dina) Do you want to see the label? She hides her hurt by not looking at him.
DINA	Just open the bottle, Alex. Pour us both a glass. I'm not allowed to drink alone. When she turns her head and looks at him, she's flirting.
JASON	-- when you're skimming along the water, nothing between you and the bottom of the sea but a layer of wood, your thoughts... end. All that noise inside your head? Gabriella nods, understanding exactly.
JASON	. . . Stops. Dina's VOICE booms over the INTERCOM, startling both of them. The BABY is FUSSING. Gabriella makes a gesture of apology to Jason.
GABRIELLA	Yes, Mrs. Reese.
GABRIELLA	Right there. She slides off the stool.
JASON	You should come out with me sometime. She smiles without answering and goes topside. His eyes follow her. A Deckhand comes down the ladder with the remaining case of wine for him to stock.
GABRIELLA	He.'s ready for his nap.
FRANK	You doing up to the house, Gabriella? (off her nod) Want to take this with you? He sweeps the policies into a large manila envelope, drops the 'pouch in with them, ties the string, hands it to her.
FRANK	Put it on my desk. He looks at his wife with her glass, Alex with his glass, and doesn't like it. His voice hardens slightly.
FRANK	Are we all set, Alex?
ALEX	I'm going to check the storage room, see what else'll travel. I know I put some vintage Armagnac in there, maybe some Porto? He heads down the gangplank.
FRANK	He's a vendor, Dina. It's like drinking with the help.
DINA	Did you pick the wine, sweetie? It's lovely. Frank grins, pleased. His hand curves around her shoulder. He has forgotten about the other vendor present, the agent.
AGENT	So I'll messenger over the rider for your signature -- Frank laughs out loud, in a better mood:
FRANK	-- You still here? Dina laughs, too.
ALEX	Did he ever come on to you?
GABRIELLA	Don't sneak up on me that way!
ALEX	Look how beautiful you are. He's an idiot if he didn't. Now she sees the necklace.
GABRIELLA	What are you doing? She snatches the necklace away from him and fairly runs down the hall to Frank's study.
GABRIELLA	You're going to get me fired and deported.
ALEX	Just put it on for a minute. Look at yourself. She slaps at his hands half-heartedly, but it's so tempting.
ALEX	See what you deserve.
GABRIELLA	We're both crazy.
GABRIELLA	It's vulgar.
ALEX	into her ear) Not against your skin. He starts to pleat her T-shirt loose from her jeans. She doesn't resist. They watch each other in the mirror.
ALEX	Ah... shit... He hurriedly unhooks the necklace and puts it back in the pouch, gathers up the insurance papers and Polaroids that had spilled and slides them back in the envelope with the pouch.' Gabriella is tucking in her T-shirt. She closes the closet door. Jason's VOICE is closer, more impatient, at the bottom of the stairs.
ALEX	I was in the bathroom. He walks down the stairs. A wooden case of liquor is by the terrace doors, where he left it.
ALEX	Give me a hand, will you? I'm not as young as you are.
HIS POV	Reflected in the tall entry mirror, Gabriella's back as she walks away down the hall.
RESUME SCENE	His face tightens. He follows Alex.
DAVE	I'm out, I'm home.
ALEX	You play for the possibilities, Dave. So do I. Or else why get up in the morning. VICTOR SPANSKY neatly stacks his modest winnings. He's tall, thick-shouldered, 55, with a gray crew-cut, tinted glasses, and a smoker's cough. He does nothing in a hurry.
VICTOR	You didn't lose that much.
ALEX	There's an optimist in every game.
DAVE	Alex, I don't appreciate --
ALEX	(overriding htm,
UNRUFFLING HIM)	No, I'm saying... the guy who sits down at the table with a loser's attitude... loses even if he wins -- which he won't. He's got no juice flowin'.
ALEX	He's got peepee in his veins! Life for that guy's a habit and stained pants. You know what I mean? Dave laughs, feeling better.
DAVE
NOT
ALEX	Try.
DAVE	Good night. They all AD-LIB "Good night," "See you next week," etc., as they file out. Alex and Victor are the last in the room. Alex puts on his jacket.
VICTOR	Paltry pickings tonight. Alex looks at the small amount of cash on the table.
ALEX	You want to cut for what's here. Victor chuckles..
VICTOR	Sure. Why not. He pushes his cash forward into a pot with Alex's. Alex fans the deck across the table.
ALEX	What-are you doing with your life, Victor?. Victor makes a small gesture, indicating the cards.
VICTOR	This, more or less. He pulls a card -- he has good hands -- and turns it up. A king of spades. A smile tugs at his mouth.
VICTOR	Beat that. Alex produces the Polaroid of Dina's necklace from his inside jacket pocket.
VICTOR	Very pretty. I remember when it was the cover of the auction catalogue. The Duchess of Windsor's baubles. Bought for a young wife, I remember. Who I'm sure worked just as hard as the Duchess.
ALEX	it's appraised at a million three hundred thousand dollars. a laugh. Victor tosses the photo back on the table with
VICTOR	And they say there's no inflation.
ALEX	I have access. Victor shakes his head no.
VICTOR	I'm retired.
ALEX	And broke.
VICTOR	I don't need that much.
ALEX	Bullshit. You need as much as I do. Victor's eyes blink behind his glasses.
VICTOR	What kind of access? For curiosity's sake.
ALEX	I have a friend in the house.
VICTOR	A girlfriend. How sweet.
ALEX	I�can distract her.
ALEX	She'd never know, I don't want her to know... I like her too much.
VICTOR -	I don't trust amateurs, either.. He gets up and walks to the door.
VICTOR	Don't take it personally,. Alex. I don't trust the phone company,, the jury system, or the Israeli government. So why should I trust you.
ALEX	Because I know a good thing when I see it. Alex flips over a card. It's the king of clubs.
ALEX	Victor... Victor has been distracted by Alex's proposition. Now he comes back to scoop up his money. Alex sweeps the cards back into a stack, leaving only the photo on the table.
ALEX	... But this is fifty-fifty..
ALEX	I saw the light still on. I'm glad you're up.
SUZANNE	(eyeing the champagne) What'd you do this time? He's too pumped to take offense.
ALEX	C'mon, c'mon, be nice.
SUZANNE	Whenever you open champagne -- it's such a giveaway. He pours her a glass.
ALEX	I told you I was playing poker tonight. He hands her the glass. She takes a sip.
SUZANNE	You know, I've-never actually seen you play poker -- maybe poker doesn't even exist. Maybe it's just a cover story men use. He laughs.
ALEX	I won.
SUZANNE	Hey; lightning strikes. He fills his glass.
ALEX	Let's not get into this, honey. Her voice is tired.
SUZANNE	I was charging the groceries today, and they kept the card. We'd been cancelled.
ALEX	I know -- He reaches for his wallet.
SUZANNE	I felt about as big as an ant. Alex takes out a credit card.
ALEX	I got you a new one.
FROM HIS	He holds out the card, which she slowly takes fingers.
SUZANNE	It's the third time this year.
ALEX	Everything's about to change. Suzanne has heard that too often from him.
SUZANNE	Alex, what are we doing together? We don't talk --
ALEX	all the time!
SUZANNE	-- we don't fuck -- we don't even eat dinner together anymoret
ALEX	I am making an effort heret
ALEX	Did you never have a fight with his father?
SUZANNE	(hard, flat) No.
ALEX	-- A saint. I should've guessed. Must be at the right amid of God this very minute. Suzanne doesn't bother replying. She turns off the light, pulls the sheet to her shoulders. Alex sits down on the window seat to enjoy the champagne in the dark.
ALEX "	-- the humidifier wasn't holding a steady percentage, there may be a problem with the regulator -- so I'd better check it right away.	... Sure, this afternoon's fine. Hanging up, he rocks back in his chair and squeezes his eyes shut. Then he rests his forehead against the heels of his hands for a moment, considering what he's considering.
ALEX	You want to hand me down a good cognac? I'm going out to the Reeses.
(REJECTING JASON'S
CHOICE)'	No, gimme the Pierre Ferrand. Jason starts down the ladder.
JASON	I'll deliver it for you.
ALEX	He wants to talk. He dusts off the bottle.
DINA	-- enough of an investment in there --
ALEX	-- not to want to take a chance, with a month away. That's what I thought.
DINA	A month alone with Frank. Alex chuckles as he starts to inspect the humidifier.
ALEX	Second honeymoon.
DINA	The first one was bad enough. She's standing too close to him, but he has no room to maneuver away. He fiddles with the box.
ALEX	-- It may need a part replaced.
DINA	Nice suit. You always dress well, Alex. She brushes the lint off his jacket and leaves her hand there.
ALEX	--,Dina... this is not a great idea. Used to getting her way, she's not easily dissuaded.
DINA	How can you tell? She moves up against him. Alex can't will himself to resist. His knee automatically separates her legs. He reaches out to close the door.
GABRIELLA	Mrs. Reese? The baby's ready for
YOU-	A long moment later, the door opens. Dina and Alex are reassembled, but there's a tension and a breathlessness about them Gabriella recognizes.
DINA	-- Thank you, Gabriella. Dina spies some interaction between Gabriella and Alex, and her pretty face hardens.
DINA	Did you leave him by himself?
GABRIELLA	Just to get his sheets.
DINA	That's the maid's job.
GABRIELLA	He's in his playpen. Dina sweeps out.
DINA	Baby jail. She looks over her shoulder to make sure Gabriella is behind her.
DINA	Are you coming?	Thanks, Alex. You'll walk yourself out?
ALEX	Have a good cruise. I'll take care of this.
DINA	See you in a month. Alex watches the two women move down the hall.
DINA
VICTOR	Like it?
VICTOR	I think I look younger, don't you?
ALEX	You look ridiculous.
VICTOR	Fine. I don't have an ego. (zipping up his
UNIFORM)	-- As long as I don't match my mug shots. A shadow of anxiety passes over Alex's face.
VICTOR	You want to change your mind?
ALEX	No. Victor opens the front door.-
VICTOR	After you. As Alex walks toward the door, he catches sight of a free- standing hospital respirator in the bedroom. He looks at Victor, who waits for him with an unchanging smile. They go out together.
ALEX	-- Is your makeup melting? Offended, Victor reaches over to honk the horn. Alex stops him, opens the driver's door.
VICTOR	Brilliant, Alex. We've violated the law before we even get started.
VICTOR	Tell me we're at the wrong house. Alex raises a hand to wave, Victor turns.
THEIR POV
GOLF	Mike, the guard, is rolling toward them on a security cart. He pulls over.
RESUME SCENE
ALEX	There you are, Mike.
MIKE	Don't flip the gate like that.
ALEX	I was helping you out. I checked off the appointment, didn't you see it? He rings the doorbell again.
MIKE	They sailed out this morning.
ALEX	I know., but the nanny's supposed to be here -- Victor rolls his eyes, unseen. The nanny.
MIKE	-- The Venezuelan? They fired her. (with a snigger) Don't pay to be too good-looking in these jobs. Victor interrupts the gossip. He -sounds exactly like a repairman.
VICTOR	I got a schedule to keep, Mr_ Gates. Is this gonna be another day?
ALEX	It can't wait.	He'll lose his entire wine collection if the humidifier isn't fixed.
MIKE	What's your name?
VICTOR	Harold Freeman. Mike notes the name "Harold" stitched onto his coveralls.
MIKE	Okay. Stay here. I'll get the keys. He rides away on his cart. Victor sits down in the shade to wait. He stifles a cough.
VICTOR	Dear God. A cop on the job.
ALEX	You all right?
VICTOR	(a little too sharply) Why wouldn't I be?
GABRIELLA	-- where he can reach me.
JASON
HI	She turns her head, and he sees that she has been crying. His smile goes.
GABRIELLA	Hi, Jason.
JASON	You looking for Alex? You missed him.
ROBERT	I told her. The PHONE RINGS. Robert answers it; wine business. He's out of the conversation.
GABRIELLA	I was supposed to let him into the Reeses'.
JASON	So now you're in trouble.
GABRIELLA	No, I'm not. She's walking toward the door.
JASON	Then why've you-been crying?
GABRIELLA	I just got fired, all right? She goes out.
JASON	Congratulations.
GABRIELLA	You don't know anything!
JASON	You hated it there!
GABRIELLA	I liked.the money! I liked having a.roof!
JASON	What's wrong with cats?
GABRIELLA	They shed on the couch I'll have to sleep on. You know how long it took me to find that job? Everybody thinks they're running for office. You don't have papers, they don't even want to meet you. And the only real way to get legal is to get married. Do you understand? He opens her car door for her.
JASON	So let's go get married. Gabriella looks at him. They connect.again; it scares her.
GABRIELLA	... Are you old enough to vote? She slides behind the wheel.
JASON	You're not too much older. Are you going past the wharf? You can gimme a ride. He's already walking around the car to get in the other side. Gabriella smiles in spite of herself and reaches over to unlock the door for him.
GABRIELLA	(as he climbs in) Aren't you working?
JASON	It's my lunch break..
GABRIELLA	Well, let's not tell the boss I stole you.
JASON	Did you do something? Or was it just...
GABRIELLA	Just. They said they.were -- downsizing. Jason laughs.
JASON	Like they're a factory?
GABRIELLA	The size of their staff? It is.
JASON	Hang a left.
GABRIELLA	Not for the wharf.
JASON	I know. Just turn! She whips the car through the turn, narrowly missing another car.
GABRIELLA	Idiot!
JASON	-- Cool. She laughs; she's starting to relax.
ALEX	Can you fix the thing, Harold? Or does it have to be replaced?
VICTOR	I'll tell you after I see the condition of the pipes. Coolant might be leaking. Where's the attic access?	Goddamn fiberglass -- His head drops through the hatch.
VICTOR	-- Either of, you know how to kill the water to the house?
MIRE	Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Mike starts down the stairs. Alex signals to Victor that he's going with him and follows Mike away. Victor waits until he hears the DOOR CLOSE before dropping down through the hatch and heading for Frank's office.
GUARD	What are you doing? Mike looks up, wet and muddy.
GUARD	I been waiting for you. My shift. His uniform is crisp, and his nature is alert and suspicious.
MIKE	The valve's stuck.
GUARD	That's the sprinkler valve. Mike climbs out of the bushes with injured dignity.
MIKE	Okay, you do it.
GUARD	Is he the homeowner?
ALEX	No.	Harold? Victor hears the FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. He keeps searching, but the pressure tells, and his breathing becomes a wheeze.
ALEX	Down there, wasn't it? The guard doesn't let him change direction.
GUARD	Keep going.
VICTOR	You can turn the water back on. It's not the pipes. Wearing work gloves, he repositions the hatch cover.
GUARD	Nobody's supposed to be in the house unaccompanied.
ALEX	Is that our fault?
GUARD	No.
ALEX	All right, then. The guard glances up at the hatch. In that moment victor winks at Alex; he scored.
JASON	You can learn on the fish around here, but you can't eat 'em. They're junk fish.
GABRIELLA	Will you teach me? He laughs.
JASON	Oh, you think you're ready for that kind of commitment?
GABRIELLA	I'm only investing an afternoon. She takes in the landscape, breathing in the lovely isolation.
GABRIELLA	Where are we?
JASON	My father used to bring me here. She hears something in his tone.
GABRIELLA	No more? Jason concentrates on securing the boat.
JASON	He's dead. He drowned in a storm. She shivers involuntarily.
JASON	He was a fisherman.
GABRIELLA	I don't know if I would like boats after that. He smiles.
JASON	I feel close to him when I'm on the water.
GABRIELLA	How old were you?
JASON	-- Eight. I'd just turned eight. She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this. She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek. They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse, kisses her on the lips.
VICTOR	- Beautiful. Unusual cut. Look at the fire. Hold it up to the light. He hands the necklace to Alex, who lifts it up to look at it. Victor reaches into a drawer. In itHttheeree'ss a gun and a camera. He takes out the camera. necklace. The flash jerks Alex's picture of Alex with gaze from the
ALEX	What the fuck are you doing??
VICTOR	I always take a photograph of the goods. To avoid any disagreement in the sale. The insurance photo is hopeless. You ask yourself how do they stay in business. Alex advances on him.
ALEX	You put me in the shot.
VICTOR	Speaking of insurance. Alex is closing on him. His voice is low and menacing.
ALEX	Give me the film, Victor._ victor's hand glides into the drawer. Alex sensibly stops short.
VICTOR	,(pleasantly) We'll tear it up together whet. we have the money. Honor among thieves is a myth, you know. victor's hand reappears, holding not a gun but an airline ticket, which he gives to Alex.
ALEX	What's this supposed to be?
VICTOR	I thought it over. I can't move it. I'm on parole. I'm known. You're not. So you'll fly to Newark, take a shuttle into the city, catch a cab, take a walk, find an address, I'll give you the name -- pas.de probleme, as they say in Bordeaux. He's being condescending.'
ALEX	Meaning you're too chickenshit to do it yourself.
VICTOR	Maybe I am. All right, I am.
ALEX	Fuck... He looks at the ticket.
ALEX	I don't fly economy.
JASON	You can do anything you want out here -- you can swim nude, you can Her laugh cuts him off.
GABRIELLA	I am not taking my clothes off.
JASON	(flustered, irritated) That's not what I meant.
ONTO	He reels the line out of the water. Gabriella climbs the rail. She's barefoot. The breeze blows her thin dress against her legs.
JASON
HEY	She dives into the water. He kicks off his shoes, dives in after her.
HAS HIS	together.
JASON	Hey, quit laughin'. I'm saving your life here.
ALEX	... May I speak with Gabriella? Puedo hablar con Gabriella? (making a face) No, yo no quiero dejar un mesajo, gracias. Voy a llamarla mas tarde. ...Si. Buenas tardes. He hangs up and speed-dials a number from the typed list on the wall.
ALEX	... Hey, Ted -- it's Alex Gates. I need a couple of tickets to New York for tonight, first class. (his jaw tightens) Don't sweat the account, I'll pay
CASH --
GABRIELLA	I can't. He sits up, offended.
JASON	You waited long enough to tell me. Gabriella arranges her clothes.
GABRIELLA	Because it felt good, and I'm an idiot! He fondly touches her face with the back of his hand.
JASON	No, you're not. She scrambles to her feet.
GABRIELLA	I want to go back now. Can we go back, please?
JASON	... Sure. He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with injured dignity. Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in front of her. Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does. She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion. He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to
JASON	I'm sorry. She turns her head toward him.
GABRIELLA	What?
JASON	I'm sorry!
GABRIELLA	Me, too.
GABRIETMA
HELLO --
ALEX	I got your note. Fuck the Reeses. We're taking a trip, honey. Pack a bag. I'll pick you up in an hour.
GABRIELLA	Where are we going?	Not Anywhere you are, I want to be there.
GABRIELLA	Sure.
SUZANNE	Where are you going? Alex recovers quickly.
ALEX	Napa. I got a problem with a supplier. Boutique wineries -- they're all owned by ex-lawyers.
SUZANNE	Via New York? She holds up the tickets.
ALEX	I need to see the wholesaler.
SUZANNE	You're amazing, you really are. Now how are you going to explain 'Miss Vasquez?'
ALEX	Honey, I don't have to. I will, out of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the agent.
SUZANNE	God, I could even believe you, if I wanted to.
ALEX	I don't want to fight with you on my way out the door. I don't have time for this. Yanking the tickets out of her hand before she can react, he pushes past her with his bag. She follows him down the stairs.
SUZANNE	I put Terry's life insurance money into that store -- and you spend it on your goddamn girlfriends while my checks bounce. Alex whirls around at the bottom of the stairs.
ALEX	I worked my ass off for you with that store. Eight years of twelve- hour days and one-day weekends! So don't tell me I haven't treated you well.
SUZANNE	-- You're going to talk to me!
ALEX	When I get back.
SUZANNE	With more of your fucking lies! I hate you! Wasting my (slapping at his arm with her free hand) -- life!
ALEX	Sssh, calm down -- She tries to slap him again, but he gets hold of her hand.
ALEX	-- Give me my keys, I need my keys. I don't want to hurt you.
SUZANNE	That's all you ever do! He twists her hand up behind her back, forcing her onto the sofa.
SUZANNE	Go to hell! He smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up and up. She grips his keys tighter.
ALEX	(breathless from the
STRUGGLE)	Open your hand, Suzanne. Pinning her down, he painfully pries open her fingers. She drives her elbow into his face.
SUZANNE	You sonofabitch! He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across the temple.
ALEX	hasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers.
JASON	-- Hey, hey.
SUZANNE	-- Don't go in therel We're
LEAVINGS	He sees the blood smeared all over her face, her clothe:,, and charges past her.
SUZANNE
- JA-SONII
JASON	What the hell happened in there?
SUZANNE	Is he dead?
JASON	Not enough. What'd you hit him with?
SUZANNE	-+ The ashtray.
SUZANNE	(a laugh bubbles out of
HER)	Jesus, an ashtray.	He-doesn't even smoke! On the verge of hysteria, she's laughing so hard, she can hardly drive. Tears run down her face, muddying the dried blood; she's a holy mess.
JASON	Pull over, pull over. He wrenches the wheel and steers the car to the curb.
JASON	I'm driving.
SUZANNE	Did you figure out where we're going?
JASON	We'll head for the Gulf, see what we like. He sounds like her contemporary, not her kid.
SUZANNE	. I remember your dad saying the sand was as white as the whites of God's eyes, on the Gulf.
JASON	Do you still miss him? Slowly she shakes her head no.
SUZANNE	I can't see his face anymore. I can't hear his voice.	-- But when you come home from fishing -- with the sea and the salt and the engine oil? It's like he's walking through the door. I love that smell -- I can still smell him. She watches the highway posts clack past.
VICTOR	Mugged-by your wife. How ironic.
ALEX	I'll fucking kill her.
VICTOR	When do the Reeses come home?
ALEX	Not for a month. Plenty of time. Victor sighs.
VICTOR	How long a drive is it?
ALEX	To the Gulf? Three hours. He removes the towel from his head.
VICTOR	You're going to need stitches. Do you have a sewing kit?
ALEX	I'll stop at my doctor's.
VICTOR	I darned my own socks in prison.
JASON	Order something for me, okay? I'm stiff, I need to walk around. He's already walking away. Concern and exasperation cancel each other; she goes inside.
JASON	My grandmother asked me to bring in a necklace of hers -- Jason takes the velvet pouch out of his pocket, unlaces it, spreads out the necklace on the counter. He leans forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with a loupe. When the jeweler looks up, he's angry.
JEWELER	Your grandmother lets you carry around a million dollars worth of jewelry? Go put it back where you found it. The jeweler pours the necklace back in the pouch, cinches it closed, slaps it on top of the case.
JASON	-- Those aren't real diamonds.
JEWELER	Tell your grandmother to bring it in. The jeweler BUZZES the door to release it. Jason grabs the velvet pouch, strides out.
WAITRESS	-- pan san, strawberry waffle, eggs over, side of wheat toast, ham steak, hash browns, fruit cup, two O.J.'s,, coffee, milk --
SUZANNE'	-- Extra syrup? Jason returns.
JASON	We'll starve. The waitress laughs as she strolls away.
SUZANNE	I'm hungry. He's worried about the jeweler.
JASON	Let's pack it up, picnic on the beach someplace.
SUZANNE	(with a grin) What a romantic.
JASON
MOM --	He wants to tell her he took the necklace.
SUZANNE	-- No, 1111 drive. The jeweler happens to glance in their direction. Jason ducks into the car, unnoticed.
SUZANNE	-- I feel... exhilarated.
JASON	Adrenalin does that.
SUZANNE	-- It ain't adrenalin, it's freedom. And she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it overhand as far as she can. It drops into the sea.
SUZANNE	I don't want one goddamn thing of
HISS	She eats with gusto. Jason is staring at the water.
JASON	I can't believe you did that.
SUZANNE	You're quiet. She doesn't think he's going to answer her.
JASON	I didn't even say goodbye.
SUZANNE	It'll work itself out. People manage. We're here. This is what you always wanted.
JASON	-- How much money do we have? Suzanne doesn't reply.
OWNER	There's a cash discount. Ten percent.
SUZANNE	Sounds like cash. She starts to count it out.
SUZANNE	Jase! He crumples the paper towel. She holds up the keys for him to see.
OWNER	I should have given you the king- size. Suzanne isn't offended.
SUZANNE	He's my son. The owner gives her a startled glance.
OWNER	You look great! Suzanne laughs.
SUZANNE	Jason? She sits up in bed. Jason comes in from outside.
JASON	I'm right here. Suzanne shoves her fingers through her damp hair, swallows to clear her voice.
SUZANNE	... I dreamed I was in jail. You'd come to see me, you were on the other side of the plastic -- like at the bank?. And you were talking, but I couldn't hear you. I put my ear to the holes and I couldn't hear you, but your mouth was moving.
SUZANNE	And then I realized you couldn't talk anymore. He'd cut your vocal cords, like that dog next door.
JASON	What dog? She lies down again.
SUZANNE-	When you were a kid?
JASON	-- I'm on watch. Don't worry.
VICTOR	-- eight-faceted cut... quite unique... could be the whole piece or individual stones, preference for the whole piece. Will you put out the word?...	No, I'm consulting for the insurance company, isn't life strange? -- Love and kisses. He hangs up. His cheeriness vanishes. He coughs, more like a gag, and heads for the bathroom.
VICTOR	I've called the whole network of fences from here to Tampa.
ALEX	Let's hope we'll find her before she sells.
ALEX	Hey! What's wrong?
VICTOR	This is not a water-view suite in Marbella! Did you notice? There's no fruit and champagne from the management. I don't see Swiss chocolate on the pillows. My masseuse is not at the door. And I am fucking dying, Alex!
ALEX	Jesus. Victor.
VICTOR	I don't intend to cough to death in a county clinic because you screwed up!
ALEX	That's not fair. The plan was for you to move the necklace. I wouldn't have had the goddamn thing. Come on... sit down... try to relax. He reaches for victor's cigarettes and crumples the package in his fist. Victor looks at his ruined smokes.
VICTOR	I'm not good at giving up things.
SUZANNE	her hair a better, brighter color under her chef's hat, is cooking on the grill behind the counter, kidding the customers, enjoying herself. The greasy-aproned OWNER pats her rump as he goes by, not for the first time.
SUZANNE	Long arms, short dick, they always say. One of the Fishermen guffaws. The owner looks pissed. So does Jason who witnessed it all.
OWNER	(aside; to Suzanne) Can I see you in the office after lunch, please?
SUZANNE	About what?
SUZANNE	I was not-fired, you jerk. I quit.
JASON	(concentrating on the
WORK)	You did the right thing.
JASON	Do you buy estate diamonds?
JEWELER	Sure. Jason takes out a zip-lock bag and lays it on the counter, one of the diamonds inside. The jeweler takes it out with respect and holds it under his loupe. If Jason's nervous, it doesn't show.
JASON	It belonged to my mother. The jeweler's heard every version. He doesn't care.
JEWELER -	.Price is the same. I can give you eighty-five hundred.
SUZANNE	Hey, sailor... She puts on her hat to cut the glare. From under the brim she admires his approach.
SUZANNE	(as he reaches her) ... Look at you. What's the occasion? Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds.
JASON	You don't need another grab-ass job. I been out talking to peoplel
JASON	There's charter outfits a coupla towns up the coast. (NAMES OF TOWNS). They need skippers, they need crews. She stands up, brushes off the sand, rolls up her towel.
SUZANNE	So we're packing. They start walking together. From the water a MAN calls out to Suzanne.
MAN	Hey, I thought you were coming back in. She smiles and waves goodbye.
SUZANNE	... Too bad. I kinda liked that
GUY-	She and Jason keep walking. He no longer looks like a boy.
VICTOR	Seen them, by any chance?
BARTENDER	Why are you asking?
VICTOR	My wife and son. He's been selling fish around these parts. He's totally believable. The bartender feels for his pain and takes another look at the photo, shakes his head no.
BARTENDER	She's a little classier than our usual clientele, y'know?
VICTOR	Maybe you could pass it down anyway.
BARTENDER	Sure, man.
VICTOR	joins Alex in the booth. Victor raises his hand. Alex instinctively pulls his head back.
VICTOR	Don't move. He leans across the table and plucks the last stitch out of Alex's wound. Alex winces.
VICTOR	It's been irritating me all day. Did I hurt you? Threat implied. Alex stares him down.
HENRY	Hunches a catch like a depth finder. Victor is already out of the booth.
HENRY	Who are you?
VICTOR	His father.
HENRY	I thought his father was dead. (shaking his head) Well, you look bad all right, but not dead.
VICTOR	Hungover, that's all. I'm his stepfather.
HENRY	(with a chuckle) Oh, man, now I see why he blew town. victor's insulted enough to lose his patience and his poise.
VICTOR	The question before us is where did he go. Henry says nothing. He wants to be paid. Victor whips out a fifty-dollar bill from his top pocket. Henry reaches for it, but victor holds it back, wanting an answer first.
HENRY	He wouldn't be on the Gulf. He hated the Gulf. Alex has moved up to the bar to listen behind him, unnoticed. He shakes his head at victor.
HENRY	He's down in the Keys somewhere. Victor puts the fifty back in his own pocket. Henry stands aggressively.
HENRY	That ain't cool in my book! In a swift, unexpected move, victor jams Henry back down on his bar stool. The bartender starts toward them. Alex slips out the door. The stool and Henry are toppling over. Victor catches them both, sets Henry upright.
VICTOR	Now sit there,. and calm down. Victor is ill, but not weak. Henry looks away, the classic signal of submission.
VICTOR	Thank you.
ALEX	They can't be too far. Victor stares at him.
VICTOR	I never understand your optimism.
ALEX	Or he wouldn't have lied.
ALEX	I think you made a friend. Victor turns around, Alex keeps walking.
HENRY	is in the doorway to the bar.
HENRY	What's it to you if I see the kid? Victor smiles.
JASON	(just to be sure) Mom? The cabin is silent. He uses his fishing knife to pop loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically starts to jam the paneling back in place. It won't hold.
SUZANNE	They'll think you stole it. He looks up at her, caught. She's walking toward the kitchen sink to wash the nursery dirt off her hands. She looks out the window at the boat again.
SUZANNE	Nice boat. (over her shoulder) Are you allowed just to run around with it? 'His tension ebbs. He picks up his tackle box.
JASON	I forgot my tackle box.
SUZANNE	-- Don't take advantage, Jason. They trusted you with the job.
 JASON
GABRIELLA	Hello? She's greedily grateful to hear Alex's voice.
GABRIELLA	-- Hi! I saw on the news there's rain in San Francisco. Are you wet and miserable?
ALEX	Napa's farther north. Victor comes out of the bathroom. He's waiting for news.
GABRIELLA	Tell me you love me.
GABRIELLA	Who just laughed?
ALEX	She wants to talk to you.
VICTOR	Oh, please. Why?
ALEX	Just fucking say hello, okay? Victor takes the phone.
VICTOR	Hello, dear. Alex snatches the phone back from him.
ALEX	Happy? Satisfied? I'm working.
GABRIELLA	I miss you.
GABRIELLA	It's lonely here. There's no return address. She slits it open with her thumbnail. A trickle of sand falls out.
GABRIELLA	I'm looking! Instead, she opens the letter.
GABRIELLA	Here it is. Mr. Raines called from (NAME OF TOWN). He said you-Id know what it was about. Do you,- need the number?
ALEX	Thanks, honey. I'll call-you tomorrow. G'd'night . He hangs up, excited. Victor has already started to pack.
ALEX	And you had no faith..
VICTOR	I'll save the party hats until it's in our hands.
NEAR THE	Modest, nondescript. Victor parallel parks jewelry store with his usual careful manner.
ALEX -	I miss the Cadillac. Top down. Air on.
VICTOR	You have pimp's tastes, Alex. At least my car's inconspicuous. Alex starts to get out. Victor doesn't.
ALEX	You all right?
VICTOR	A lot of these jewelers might know my face. It's risky.
ALEX	How about for me? Victor takes out the photo of Alex with the necklace and holds it up for him.
VICTOR	Nobody's seen this yet.
ALEX	You're sick. I'll do it. Alex throws open the door and barrels out of the car.
�
JEWELER	(with a shrug) Said it was his mother's.
ALEX	A seventeen-year-old kid waltzes in with a diamond as big as your toenail, and you don't wonder?? You shouldn't have touched iti You know that! All right, okay. When we recover the rest of the necklace, I'll be back. Do not, do not sell it. I'll see what I can do for you, Raines.
JEWELER	i appreciate that.
ALEX	Smart lady. She lets Jason make the sale. They get caught, he's underage, and she don't know a thing. I gotta give her credit.
VICTOR	You have interesting taste in women. Alex's gaze wanders to the game, but he can't get interested.
JASON	Jesus, Henry... What the hell you doing?... How'd you know this was my boat??
HENRY	I saw you cast off. Good little sport boat you got, too. Oh, whoa -- hear that?
JASON	Where -- what?? Henry rubs his stomach.
HENRY	Right here, man. I ain't been eating my share since my fishing partner ran off. Without so much as goodbye/good luck. Jason blows out a breath.
JASON	It's complicated.
HENRY	Always is. The boat is rockirg now. The WIND has picked up. They hear the CLANKING and RUBBING of the other boats. Jason starts checking all the hasps and latches while Henry eats the sandwich he made.
JASON	So why are you on the Gulf?
HENRY	My baby finally sank on me. Right at the dock. I thought I'd work charter for awhile. (moving to help Jason with the latches) -- Need a crew?
JASON	I don't know. Maybe.
HENRY	That's not why I came looking for you. Jason is checking the engine. Out of Henry's sight, he surreptitiously reaches inside a hidden compartment.
HIS HAND	wraps around the concealed pouch and withdraws, reassured.
JASON	secures the engine hatch.
HENRY	A guy offered me fifty bucks to tell him where you were. Sick old motherfucker. Big as God. Tried to say he was your stepfather.
JASON	Maybe it was.
HENRY	No, no, no, no -- this guy was not any kind of family man, if you know what I mean. So you're in some deep shit, because he wasn't a cop neither.
JASON	-- What'd you tell him? Henry chuckles.
HENRY	Lots of ways to make fifty bucks. Misunderstanding, Jason shoves him up against the counter.
JASON	You gonna lean on me, Henry?? Is that the plan? Henry is hurt and offended.
HENRY	No, man, I wouldn't stoop that low. And if I'd taken the fifty, I wouldn't have to be eating your shitbag sandwich neither. Jason steps back, ashamed of himself. He sits down to recover. Henry looks at him with a friend's concern.
HENRY	You -- um -- you moving contraband, Jason? Jason shakes his head no.
HENRY	This guy struck me as a serious problem. A few raindrops spatter the windows. Jason makes for the cabin door.
JASON	Take care of the boat?
HENRY	(with a grateful smile) Not likely to sink two of 'em.
JASON	-- Mom, come on. He catches her hand and tows her toward the back door.
SUZANNE	What's wrong, what's happened?
JASON	We"gotta go... She anxiously follows him out the door.
THE CUSTOMER	leans back to see around the snack rack that blocked our view of him. It's Victor. A paper bag under his arm, he goes out the front door.
VICTOR
SUZANNE	... I should have gone through his pockets myself. It didn't occur to me. I was in such a panic. If I'd found the necklace, Jason? I'd have taken it, too.
ALEX	There.
JASON	-- I'm sorry. She glances in the rear view mirror. Headlights.
SUZANNE	It's okay. I'm the one who hit the bastard.
HER POV	A small bridge ahead is almost ready to pivot to let a boat pass. She stamps down on the gas pedal. The car rockets forward.
VICTOR	What a thrill.
THEIR POV	Jason's white face is turned toward them in Suzanne's car.
ALEX	Easy, easy -- he'll see us.
VICTOR	It's raining too hard.
JASON	Still with us.
SUZANNE	Maybe it's just a tourist cruising around with his head up his butt. Neither of them believes that.
SUZANNE	... How about Mexico? The Sea of Cortez? Your father fished for marlin there. The biggest catch he ever had.
ALEX
TURNVICTOR	Relax. She's not going anywhere. He brakes and calmly reverses in the rain.
ALEX	I just need to talk to her.
VICTOR	Last time you talked, she almost crushed your skull.
 SUZANNE	Anything?
JASON	Not a_car in sight.
SUZANNE	You sure?
HIS POV	The headlights turn onto the road.
SUZANNE	forward.
JASON	Mom! Face the road! You're drifting! She looks back as now bright headlights light them up. A truck HORN BLASTS.
SUZANNE	-- Shit! She 'spins the wheel to avoid a head-on, but in so doing she clips the curb and loses control. She throws an arm across Jason to protect him.
VICTOR	We don't have much time. Through the window they can see Suzanne and Jason, both unconscious, limbs entangled, covered in glass. Suzanne is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side. Her leg twitches in spasm. Car headlights pass by on the road.
ALEX	We need to get some help!
VICTOR	Already on the way, I'm afraid.
VICTOR	Open the trunk, please.
ALEX	-- Oh, Christ... He lifts her shirt to see how badly she's cut and presses the heel of his hand against the gash to try to stop the bleeding. Her blood spurts through his fingers. With his other hand he pats down her body.
SUZANNE	Jase... Alex checks Jason for her, searching his limp body at the, same time.
ALEX	I think he's okay, Suzanne. Just' tell me where it is. She can't answer. He opens the glove compartment and feels inside. He goes through her purse.
ALEX	Goddammit! Leaning over the seat, he fumbles with her clothes. He's trying to make her comfortable.
SUZANNE	Don't...
ALEX	Sssh, I have to. Don't be scared. I'm not going to hurt you.
VICTOR	Alex, c'mon, get out of there.
ALEX	She's dying, for chrissake!	Hear the sirens? Help's coming. Just tell me where it is and let me get out of your lives. She whispers something. He leans in close.
ALEX	• She mumbles something indecipherable. He puts his ear close to her mouth. The SIRENS are bearing down.
SUZANNE	(only a breath) ... Fuck you.
ALEX
HELP MET	Victor grabs his ankles and pulls. Alex starts to reemerge.
ALEX	... I didn't mean for this to happen.
VICTOR	As soon as they see her license they'll call you in Miami. Alex nods. He can't look away from the scene.
JASON	what are you... He swallows painfully. Alex smiles and gets up from the chair. He dreads what he has to tell him.
ALEX	Hey, there... how do you feel?
JASON	Where's my mother?
ALEX	(dodging the question) I flew straight back from Napa when I heard. You hit your head pretty hard. Jason struggles to sit up, his equilibrium not fully restored.
JASON	Where's Mom? -- How's Mom? Alex sits down on the bed with him to break the news.
ALEX	I'm sorry, Jason... I'm so sorry. Jason stares at him. He hasn't absorbed the fact.
ALEX	She didn't make it as far as the hospital. Horror and rage flood Jason's face.
JASON
JASON	-- You killed her, you fuckl Alex tries to hold him, eventually in a forced bear-hug.
ALEX	-- Don't, don't --	I need someone in here!
JASON	Let go of me! Alex holds him close. He collapses in Alex's arms. An ORDERLY hurries in, followed by a Nurse.
ORDERLY	We'll take care of him.
 VICTOR	It'd be nice to have some help. C) Victor unscrews the trap under the kitchen sink. D) Et cetera.
ALEX	Where's my son??
DOCTOR	I released him this morning.
ALEX	You let an underage boy with a head injury walk out of here by himself??
DOCTOR	It was only a concussion. He's fine. He said you were in the lobby.
JASON	Wake up, Alex. I want to see your face. The sheets stir. Jason raises his knife to strike. But it isn't Alex in the bed, it's Gabriella. She lets out a strangled scream. He whips the sheet off her with his other hand. She's naked.
GABRIELLA	Jason! (her eyes on his knife) -- Don't hurt me. Please.
JASON	Where is he?
GABRIELLA	He went to get you! He's not coming back until tomorrow. She timidly pulls the sheet over her body. Jason yanks it off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade • flat to her skin. She freezes.
JASON	His car's here.
GABRIELLA	It's been here since he went to Napa.
JASON	I keep hearing about Napa. Did you ever call him there? She shakes her head.
JASON	You don't know where he was.
JASON	You didn't waste any time,. did you. You moved right in.
JASON	I'm going to wait for him, and. I'm going to kill him. His hand drifts along her body. She doesn't resist.
GABRIELLA	They'll lock you up.
JASON	Yeah.
GABRIELLA	'Away from the sky and the air and the sea and the current running against the wind?' That was a very beautiful letter. Jason moves onto the bed, on his knees. beside her.
JASON	Did you show it to him? You two have a laugh about it?
GABRIELLA	I never mentioned itl Jason's hand curves around her throat,. a, caress, a threat.
JASON	Did you tell him how to find: us-? Gabriella knocks his hand away from her throat.
GABRIELLA	Not He wasn't interested, he didn't care.
JASON	Sure, he did.
GABRIELLA	He was glad she left. Jason lies down alongside her.
JASON	He had us followed.
GABRIELLA	W-why? He shrugs; he doesn't trust her.
GABRIELLA	How do you know? She thinks grief has driven him crazy, and he sees that.
JASON	I'm not crazy. Gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed, to comfort him.
GABRIELLA	... I'm so very sorry about what happened to your mother. His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs.
JASON	Her loss, your gain. Furious, Gabriella forgets her caution. She slaps him hard enough to throw his head sideways. Jason rolls on top of her and pins her down.
JASON	Her home, her bed -- her life. He lowers his mouth to Gabriella's neck. His kiss is surprisingly gentle. His knee works her legs apart.
GABRIELLA	. Don't do this for revenge.
JASON	Let's finish what we started. Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances. His fingers scissor her nipple.
JASON	Just don't tell me that you love me. He peels off his T-shirt.
GABRIELLA	(in a whisper) I love you. He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're both naked. They begin to make love.
GABRIELLA	Wait. Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back.
GABRIELLA	This way. She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her. Jason moves now rapidly.
GABRIELLA	Slowly. Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a young man in a long time.
GABRIELLA	What are you doing to me?	Don't come, not yet. They move as one, their passion enveloping them. He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie side.by side.
GABRIELLA	Will you get me a towel? With warm water.
GABRIELLA	(after a moment) Are you going to kill me, too?
JASON	No!
GABRIELLA	You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be a witness. I'll know you planned it.
JASON	-- Would you do that?
GABRIELLA	I like-you too much to let you kill him. Jasonstarts to put on his clothes:
GABRIELLA	I need him, Jason.
JASON	You don't -- you don't!
GABRIELLA	I'm not going back to Caracas! You don't know how we live there. She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away.
GABRIELLA	You have to leave now, Jason.
JASON	What are you talking about? This is my home. I'm home. She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade him. Jason thinks of his next step, a plan.
GABRIELLA	This is not your room, though, is it. Jason starts toward the door.
JASON	You're never going to marry him, Gabriella.
GABRIELLA	Watch me. He closes the door with a solid CLICK. She starts to cry, and still crying, she pulls the sheets off the bed, she has to change the sheets.
  ALEX
ALEX	I've been looking for you for two days! Jason relishes this.
JASON	You should've called home. Alex advances.
ALEX	How'd you get here?
JASON	Hitchhiked.
GABRIELLA	(too bright and
NERVOUS)	Are you-hungry? Have you had lunch? Alex doesn't even hear her.
ALEX	Why didn't you wait for me? Jason eats without answering.
ALEX	And what about all your stuff, and your mother's? Jason swallows, wipes his mouth.
JASON	She doesn't need it anymore, and I don't want it. Gabriella brings Alex a cup of coffee.
GABRIELLA	How about a sandwich?
ALEX	I'm not hungry. Jesus.
JASON	You haven't even said hello to her.
ALEX	(with great control), Hello, Gabby.
JASON	'Did you miss me, honey?,
ALEX	What are you doing. Jason gets up from the table. He's wearing workout clothes.
JASON	Nothing. He walks out of the condo. Alex and Gabriella are left alone together. She jumps in before he can say anything.
GABRIELLA	He just lost his mother, Alex. You can't expect him to act normal. He steps up beside her and moves her hair off her shoulders.
ALEX	Did you try to make him feel better?
GABRIELLA	(right back at him) Yes. I gave him sonlething to eat. She walks out and up the stairs to the bedroom.
GABRIELLA	... I feel like I made her die. Alex sits down beside her and takes her hand.
GABRIELLA	I wanted her to go away so bad... I used to wish she'd die. And then she did. He lets go of her hand.
ALEX	Oh,. please. I don't need two children in the house. (noticing her mouth) -- What happened to your mouth? Gabriella's hand jumps to her lip.
GABRIELLA	Oh. -I bit my lip. He takes her lip between his and nuzzles it.
ALEX	Where? Here?... Better? She tries to laugh and nods. He holds her close.
ALEX	where'd Jason go?
ALEX	You have something that belongs to .me, Jason -- and I want it back.
JASON	It's not yours.
ALEX	Either way. Jason continues to lift. Finally:
JASON	Did you know the thing's worth over a million dollars? What a fucking stupid way to spend money.
ALEX	I was holding it for someone. These are dangerous people.
ALEX	Don't screw around with me, Jason. He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face, his expression hidden.
JASON	I don't know where it is anymore. You killed the only person who did.
ALEX	It was an accident! What did I have to do with it? Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex.
JASON	There was a car following us!
ALEX	Did you see who was in it? Jason shakes his head no.
ALEX	I met one of these guys. Tall, weird-looking fucker with.a gray crew-cut. (letting out a breath) These people you don't steal from. Whoever was following Suzanne is going to come after you, too. Haven't you figured that out? For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead.
JASON	Who are they? Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper.
ALEX	Doesn't matter. Give the necklace back to me, and we'll split the handling commission. His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust Alex. He shakes his head.
JASON	She never told me where she kept it. Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away.
VICTOR	Nice boy like that, the money means diddlyshit. And, personally, I suspect he'd rather die than tell you. So get a blowtorch, and use it on the girl until he cooperates.
ALEX	He's gonna make a move.
ALEX	Okay. He hangs up and rocks back in his chair.
ALEX	(muffled against her
SKIN)	I'm never leaving you again. He starts to caress her.
GABRIELLA	-- I'm already asleep, honey.
ALEX	Wake up. She realizes he isn't going away. She rolls onto her back. Her arms go around him.- Alex kisses her, long and deep.
GABRIELLA	Can he hear us? Alex's tone turns. Jason is causing him another problem.
ALEX	I think he's probably figured out why we sleep in the same bed, Gabby.
� GABRIELLA	He misses his mother.
ALEX	... So do I. Gabriella props herself up on her elbow.
GABRIELLA	What?
ALEX	We need to go somewhere, just us.
GABRIELLA	Where?
ALEX	I'm buying a vineyard in France. Have you ever been to Paris?
GABRIELLA	No. Alex scoots down next to her, his hand takes possession of her ass.
ALEX	We'll stay at the Ritz, we'll eat our way through every three-star restaurant in town -- a new dress every night -- would you like that? Gabriella laughs in wonder and turns onto her side to face him. They fit themselves together like an old married couple.
ALEX	(getting caught up in his own fantasy) -- We'll drive down through Burgundy -- follow the Rhone into Provence, wind up on the Riviera -- Monte Carlo --
GABRIELLA	-- Princess Stephanie. He gives a rueful laugh; she's younger than he easily remembers.
ALEX	They have tables at the casino where you play baccarat and the bets start at a hundred bucks.
GABRIELLA	(with a chuckle) You won't be able to afford it. You'll have spent all your money on my clothes and my jewelry. (slipping her leg
BETWEEN HIS)	Ohl Remember Dina's necklace? Alex's eyes go cold and watchful, although she doesn't notice.
ALEX	Sure.
GABRIELLA	I'll wear something like that and then if you lose you can throw it on the table to cover your bet, like James Bond.
ALEX	James had an expense account. He rolls onto his back, she lays her cheek on his graying chest. He no longer wants to make love.
ALEX	What made you think of the necklace? She's drifting toward sleep.
GABRIELLA	I looked good in it, didn't I? He pats her shoulder without answering. He won't sleep for a while.
GABRIELLA
HELLO --
JASON	(into the phone) -- Come meet me, I gotta talk to you. I'm at the Haitian marketplace. You know where it is?
JASON	An thing you want. Don't drive, take a cab -- (as she laughs at what sounds like silliness) -- I'll wait for you. Jason hangs up. He looks around. He doesn't see Victor watching from the trinket stand. Be walks to the counter where he has already ordered coffee and pie. He picks up his fork. He can't eat. There's a folded newspaper left behind by another customer. He pulls it over.
WAITRESS	Refill, hon?
 HIS POV	Gabriella waves to him.
GABRIELLA	Okay. Here I am. What is it? Do you know how much a cab costs?
JASON	I saw a guy following me... I thought you weren't safe. I was going to tell you to go stay at your
COUSIN'S --	hand.
JASON
	-- Hey!
GABRIELLA	I'm so sick of this. You'd say anything! He hands her the newspaper.
GABRIELLA
WHAT --
JASON	Read it.
GABRIELLA	reads the headline and starts to laugh.
GABRIELLA	There is such a thing as justicel Dina's necklace. Couldn't happen to a better person.
JASON	Alex stole it.
GABRIELLA	You really hate him.
JASON	The reason I know is because I stole it from him. Her eyes widen.
VICTOR	his face concealed among the candles is trying to figure out what drama is going on between Jason and Gabriella. He can read their faces, but not their lips.
GABRIELLA	... The sonofabitch. That's why he went out with me. He was trying to use me! (the thought hits her) They'll think I'm part of it! The maid who got fired??
JASON	You weren't a maid.
GABRIELLA	What difference does it make??
JASON	We're going to the Gulf.
 JASON	accelerates. Gabriella nuzzles his neck.
JASON	looks back.
ALEX	A man with your breeding usually rings the doorbell.
VICTOR	There was, is, no time.
ALEX	You heard the news. Victor pulls one of Alex's golf clubs out of the bag as though to admire it.
VICTOR	I know you keep money here somewhere.	Your stash. Give it to me. Alex spreads out his hands.
AALEX	Vic, Vic -- The golf club catches him in the midsection. Alex cries out. The blow folds him forward onto his knees.
VICTOR	The. cops are about to drive up your street. He brings the club down on Alex's bare foot.
ALEX	(through teeth clenched
WITH PAIN)	There's nothing here to.give you.
VICTOR	Where is it? He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away. The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club.
ALEX "	Believe me -- I swear to God, I
DON'T --	Victor raises the club over Alex's head, and brings it down on the coffee table instead. The glass-explodes. He has to push the words out through a•coughing spasm.
VICTOR	I refuse to die in a fucking prison clinic! Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for breath. Alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses it on the floor.
ALEX	Come on, this is pitiful. Victor drops onto the sofa. He gags on the blood in his throat and desperately draws in air.
ALEX	What a mess. He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor. Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances. He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours a glass.
ALEX	At least you got to die in your own clothes, Vic. That's something.
GABRIELLA	(into the phone) I'm with him.
ALEX	What took you so long.
GABRIELLA	He has a boat, Alex! It's on the boat. The dumb shit wants to turn it over to the cops. You know what'll happen to me. Alex is taking his passport out of his desk.
ALEX	Just tell me how to find you.
GABRIELLA
JASON
HENRY --	Henry emerges from the cabin. He eyes Gabriella.
HENRY	Oh, my.
JASON	This is Gabriella. She's my contraband. She looks quickly at Jason, who smiles. Henry reaches out to shake her hand.
HENRY	Kid's a sucker for dark skin.
HIS POV	Alex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him.
ALEX	Good morning! I brought donuts. Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the boat, his arms around his ribs.
ALEX	Oh, it's not as bad as all that.
JASON	She fucking called you.
ALEX	She has some residual loyalty, yeah.	Which I didn't expect either. Jason moves to the helm, switches on the engine. Alex quickly finishes his donut. He brushes off his fingers.
ALEX	Where are we going?
JASON	I'm going fishing. Get off if you want.
ALEX	No, it's a beautiful day for a boat ride. Give us a chance to talk. He makes himself comfortable.
JASON	Then make yourself useful and cast off the stern line. Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow line.
ALEX	This one?
JASON	There's not a lot of choice. Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him.
ALEX	-- If we could manage to ignore the personal history here, I think we could work something out between us. Jason turns the boat toward the open sea.
ALEX	You want Gabriella? This is the way to have her. Life costs, Jason. Love costs. And you love her more than I do.
ALEX	(as Jason glances at
HIM)	So stake yourself to a life together. Give her what she needs --
(SEEING GABRIELLA	before Jason does) -- Hi, honey. Gabriella comes up onto deck. She glances bewildered at the ocean around them.
GABRIELLA	Why are we --
JASON	-- Shut up! Just shut up! She sits on the bench, her face tight and angry.
ALEX	He's feeling like you let him down. .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for another donut. The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL hitting the waves substitute for conversation.
JASON	-- Okay. I'm ready to listen. He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella, who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.
JASON	Alex wants to make me an offer. She gives no sign of having heard him.
ALEX	We're giving you a hard choice, Gabby. Two rich men. Gabriella swivels her head slowly.
GABRIELLA	I don't want either one of you. A line quivers. Jason reels in a little.
JASON
ABOUT --	And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it. Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in a little, making the line taut, testing the weight. He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to the surface a big, dark green fish. _
ALEX	Jesus! What the hell is that?
JASON	Hammerhead. Young. Male. Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.
GABRIELLA	Help him, Alex.
ALEX	I'd just get in his way. His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared without either of them noticing.
JASON	Is this your backup plan?
ALEX	No.
JASON	You want it so bad, it's yours. He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.
ALEX	You little prick.
ALEX	scrambles toward the necklace.
GABRIELLA	Don't let him have it! He'll kill
USL	Jason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled, warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark continues to tear at him.
ALEX	Help me, help.mel! Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges. forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.
ALEX	You knew it wasn't dead. Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.
JASON	Mom didn't take the necklace. did.
ALEX	Then you killed her yourself. Jason slowly nods.
JASON	And you were in the car behind us. Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying slightly.
GABRIELLA	We were supposed to turn him ini I didn't think you were going to kill him!
JASON	Well, I didn't. Alex manages to laugh.
ALEX	Jesus. You set me up. You had her call me.	Shit... I believed you. Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit.
JASON	I'll get on the radio. Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace. They look at each other.
JASON	has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course. Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses the radio.
JASON	This is Hercules II, calling the Harbormaster...
CLOSER ANGLE
HENRY	You cool?
JASON	I will be.
HENRY	See ya. He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is left with Alex.
ALEX	(weakly; to Henry) What's your name?
HENRY	No way --
ALEX	(still the salesman) -- No, listen, listen -- this is worth a fortune. (thrusting the necklace
TOWARD HIM)	Play the possibilities.
HENRY	Yeah. Good advice. And he walks away fast.
ALEX	Wait, don't go! Come back here. Come on back! Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to give up hope in a hopeless situation.
