Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

GANDALF	You cannot pass!
FRODO	Gandalf!
GANDALF	I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder  of the Flame of Anor!
GANDALF	Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark  Fire will not avail you, Flame of Ud�n!  [Camera zooms in through the mountain  and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog  on the bridge of Khazad-d�m. The Balrog  strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming  sword. Gandalf parries the blow with  Glamdring, shattering the Balrog�s sword.]
GANDALF	Argh! [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains  him.]
BOROMIR	No! No!
FRODO	Gandalf!
GANDALF	Fly, you fools! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into  the chasm]
FRODO	Noooooooooooooooo!!!! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into  the chasm]
FRODO	[Calls after Gandalf as he falls into  the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
FRODO	Gandalf!
SAM	What is it, Mr. Frodo?
FRODO	Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
SAM	Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth  we don�t want to see any closer, and  the one place we�re trying to get to.  It�s just where we can�t get. Let�s  face it, Mr. Frodo, we�re lost. I don�t  think Gandalf meant for us to come this  way.
FRODO	He didn�t mean for a lot of things to  happen, Sam... but they did.
SAM	Mr. Frodo? It�s the Ring, isn�t it?
FRODO	It�s getting heavier. [Clutches the  Ring by his chest and sits down, still  panting. He then fumbles for his water  bottle and takes a sip.]
FRODO	What food have we got left?
SAM	Well, let me see. [He takes out a package  of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes,  lovely � Lembas bread. And look! [He  digs deeper into his pack] More lembas  bread.
SAM	I don't usually hold with foreign food,  but this Elvish stuff, it�s not bad.
FRODO	[smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits,  does it Sam?
SAM	Those rain clouds might. [They continue trekking through difficult  terrain, often huddling underneath their  cloaks.]
SAM	[Looks around] This looks strangely  familiar.
FRODO	[Exasperated] It�s because we�ve been  here before! We�re going in circles.
SAM	Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant  there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you  smell it?
FRODO	Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper]  We�re not alone.
[NIGHTTIME	Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape  appears on top of the cliff. The creature  Gollum has appeared and is making his  way down to the hobbits.]
GOLLUM	The thieves! The thieves! The filthy  little thieves! Where is it? Where isss  it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.  [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse  them! We hates them! It�s ours, it is...  and we wantssss it!
FRODO	[menacingly] This is Sting. You�ve seen  it before, haven�t you... Gollum! Release  him or I�ll cut your throat!
GOLLUM	It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty  Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
SAM	Quiet you! [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum  cries some more and collapses onto his  back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
SAM	It�s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor�s  going to hear this racket! Let�s just  tie him up and leave him.
GOLLUM	No! That would kill us! Kill us!
SAM	It�s no more than you deserve!
FRODO	Maybe he does deserve to die, but now  that I see him, I do pity him.
GOLLUM	[Begging] We be nice to them if they  be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears  to do what you wants. We swears.
FRODO	There�s no promise you can make that  I can trust.
GOLLUM	We swears to serve the master of the  preciousss. We swears on... on the precious.  *Gollum. Gollum.*
FRODO	The Ring is treacherous. It will hold  you to your word.
GOLLUM	Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.
SAM	I don�t believe you! [Gollum backs away,  frightened, and climbs onto a boulder]  Get down! I said, down!
FRODO	Sam!
SAM	He�s trying to trick us! We let him  go he�ll throttle us in our sleep!
FRODO	You know the way to Mordor?
GOLLUM	[nods warily] Yes...
FRODO	You�ve been there before?
GOLLUM	[nods again] Yes... [Frodo reaches out and takes the rope  noose off Gollum�s neck. Gollum seems  surprised and relieved.]
FRODO	You will lead us to the Black Gate.
PIPPIN	Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]
UGL�K	What is it? What do you smell?
MAN-FLESH URUK	[sniffs the air] Man-flesh.
PIPPIN	[quietly to himself] Aragorn!
UGL�K	They've picked up our trail! Let's move!
ARAGORN	Their pace has quickened. [He looks  up.] They must have caught our scent.  Hurry! [He runs off.]
LEGOLAS	Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli  and then runs after Aragorn]
GIMLI	[pauses in his steps and huffs] Three  days� and nights� pursuit. No food.  No rest. And no sign of our quarry but  what bare rock can tell. [Runs after  his companions.]
ARAGORN	Not idly do the leaves of L�rien fall.
LEGOLAS	[stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may  yet be alive.
ARAGORN	Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs  off again]
LEGOLAS	Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!
GIMLI	[Panting] I am wasted on cross-country!  We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very  dangerous over short distances!
ARAGORN	Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There  is something strange at work here. Some  evil gives speed to these creatures,  sets its will against us.
ARAGORN	Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?
LEGOLAS	The Uruks turn northeast. They�re taking  the hobbits to Isengard!
ARAGORN	Saruman. [The tower of Orthanc stands amidst  the smoking caverns of Isengard. Saruman  stands in his chamber, communicating  with the Dark Lord through the Palant�r.]
SARUMAN	The world is changing. [View changes  to the tower of Barad-d�r, with its  huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now  has the strength to stand against the  armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand  against the might of Sauron and Saruman  and the union of the two towers?
SARUMAN	Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule  this Middle-earth.
SARUMAN	The old world will burn in the fires  of industry. The forests will fall.  A new order will rise. We will drive  the machine of war with the sword and  the spear and the iron fists of the  Orc. We have only to remove those who  oppose us.
SARUMAN	The horsemen took your land. They drove  your people into the hills to scratch  a living off rocks.
DUNLAND MAN	Murderers!
SARUMAN	Take back the lands they stole from  you! Burn every village!
CROWD	[Roars with approval] Argh!! [They stomp off to destroy the villages  of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still  among the stampede. A Rohan village  is in pandemonium as people try to escape  the on-coming pillage.]
SARUMAN	It will begin in Rohan. Too long have  these peasants stood against you. But  no more.
MORWEN	�othain! �othain! You take your sister.  You�ll go faster with just two.
FREDA	[As Morwen puts her onto the horse in  front of her brother] Papa says �othain  must not ride Garulf, he is too big  for him!
MORWEN	Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras  and raise the alarm. Do you understand  me?
�OTHAIN	Yes, Ma!
FREDA	[starts to cry] I don�t wanna leave!  I don't wanna go, Mama!
MORWEN	Freda, I will find you there. [A woman screams]
MORWEN	Quickly! [The children ride off.]
MORWEN	[Looks after them] Go child! [Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village,  burning everything in sights as the  Rohirrim scream and run in all directions.  �othain and Freda weep as they look  back from a distance.]
SARUMAN	Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall. [A group of horsemen ride to Edoras.  �omer is in the lead, carrying a gravely  wounded Th�odred.]
�OWYN	Th�odred! [Th�odred seems to hear her call but  is unable to respond. He has a bloody  gash on the side of his head. �omer  nods to �owyn in the direction of Th�odred�s  torso. �owyn draws back the covers and  upon seeing Th�odred�s fatal wound,  her lips tighten and eyes close. She  looks up to catch �omer�s eye.]
�OWYN	Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
�OMER	He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don�t  defend our country, Saruman will take  it by force.
GR�MA	That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.]  Saruman the White has ever been our  friend and ally.
TH�ODEN	[mumbles feebly] Gr�ma� Gr�ma� [Gr�ma  leans down close to the King.]My son...?  Gr�ma...?
�OMER	Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.  Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at  will. Orcs bearing the white hand of  Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the  ground, which topples over to reveal  the white hand of Saruman.]
GR�MA	Why do you lay these troubles on an  already troubled mind. Can you not see?  Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent,  your war-mongering.
�OMER	War-mongering? [�omer grabs Gr�ma and pins him against  a pillar.]
�OMER	How long is it since Saruman bought  you? What was the promised price, Gr�ma?  When all the men are dead you will take  your share of the treasure?
�OMER	Too long have you watched my sister,  too long have you haunted her steps.
GR�MA	You see much �omer, Son of �omund. Too  much. [The thugs punch �omer n the stomach]  You are banished forthwith from the  kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!
�OMER	[Being dragged away] Argh!! [Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march  across the plains with their hobbit  captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and  Gimli hot on their pursuits.]
GIMLI	Keep breathing! That�s the key! Breathe!  Ho!
LEGOLAS	They�ve run as if the very whips of  their masters were behind them.
MORDOR ORC	We�re not going no further till we�ve  had a breather!
UGL�K	Get a fire going! [As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take their  rest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]
PIPPIN	Merry! Merry!
MERRY	[opens his eyes] I think... we might  have made a mistake leaving the Shire,  Pippin.
PIPPIN	What�s making that noise?
MERRY	[looks towards the forest] It�s the  trees.
PIPPIN	What?
MERRY	Do you remember the Old Forest? On the  borders of Buckland? Folk used to say  that there was something in the water  that made the trees grow tall... and  come alive.
PIPPIN	Alive?
MERRY	Trees that could whisper. Talk to each  other. Even move.
MA�HUR	I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but  maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
SNAGA	Yeah. Why can�t we have some meat? [His  eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about  them? They�re fresh.
UGL�K	They are not for eating!
GRISHN�KH	What about their legs? They don't need  those. Ooh� They look tasty!
UGL�K	[Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!
MORDOR ORC	Carve them up!
SNAGA	[Moves towards the hobbits with his  blade drawn] Just a mouth full.
UGL�K	No! [Pippin and Merry recoil in fright.  Ugl�k jumps on the Orc and cuts off  his head, which bounces off the hobbit's  shoulders.]
UGL�K	Looks like meat�s back on the menu,  boys!!
MERRY	Pippin, let�s go. [Their hands still bound, the hobbits  try to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comes  down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto  his back.]
GRISHN�KH	[Brandishing a blade in front of Pippin�s  face] Go on, call for help. Squeal!  No one�s gonna save you now!
MERRY	Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their  escape.]
PIPPIN	ARGH!!!
LEGOLAS	[Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises.  Blood has been spilled this night.
ARAGORN	Riders of Rohan, what news from the  Mark?
�OMER	What business does an Elf, a man and  a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak  quickly!
GIMLI	Give me your name, Horsemaster, and  I shall give you mine.
�OMER	I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if  it stood but a little higher from the  ground.
LEGOLAS	You would die before your stroke fell!
ARAGORN	I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This  is Gimli, son of Gl�in and Legolas of  the Woodland realm. We are friends of  Rohan and of Th�oden, your king.
�OMER	Th�oden no longer recognizes friend  from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even  his own kin.
�OMER	Saruman has poisoned the mind of the  king and claimed lordship over these  lands. My company are those loyal to  Rohan. And for that, we are banished.  The White Wizard is cunning. He walks  here and there, they say, as an old  man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere  his spies slip past our nets.
ARAGORN	We are not spies. We track a party of  Uruk-hai westward across the plain.  They�ve taken two of our friends captive.
�OMER	The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered  them during the night.
GIMLI	But there were two hobbits. Did you  see two hobbits with them?
ARAGORN	They would be small � only children  to your eyes.
�OMER	We left none alive. We piled the carcasses  and burned them. [Points to a smoking  pile in the distance.]
GIMLI	Dead?
�OMER	[nods] I am sorry. [Legolas puts a hand on Gimli�s shoulder  in grief. �omer turns and whistles.]
�OMER	Hasufel! Arod! [Two horses move up.]  May these horses bear you to better  fortune than their former masters. Farewell.
�OMER	Look for your friends. But do not trust  to hope, it has forsaken these lands.  [To the riders] We ride north!
GIMLI	It�s one of their wee belts.
LEGOLAS	[with his head bowed and eyes closed]  Hiro �th� ab 'wanath... (May they find  peace in death)
ARAGORN	[Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!!  [He falls to his knees.]
GIMLI	We failed them. [Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks  catch his attention.]
ARAGORN	A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback:  Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair  of thrashing hooves bearing down on  him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.]  They crawled.
[ARAGORN STARTS TO FOLLOW THE TRACKS, WITH LEGOLAS AND GIMLI BEHIND HIM. FLASHBACK	Merry and Pippin crawl frantically away  from the battle.]
ARAGORN	Their hands were bound. [Flashback:  Merry rubs his bonds furiously against  the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds  were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken  length of thick rope.]
ARAGORN	They ran over here. They were followed.
[FLASHBACK	Their hands freed, the hobbits run away  from the battle scene, dodging under  a horse and trying to stay out of harms  way. As they flee, Grishn�kh grabs Pippin  by his belt and clings on.]
MERRY	The belt! [Pippin undoes his belt and Grishn�kh  is left holding it.]
MERRY	Run!
ARAGORN	The tracks lead away from the battle...  [They break into a run and then stop]  into Fangorn Forest.
GIMLI	Fangorn. What madness drove them in  there?
PIPPIN	Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think  we lost him.
GRISHN�KH	I�m gonna rip out your filthy little  innards! Come here!
MERRY	Trees! Climb a tree! [Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up  a tree each.]
MERRY	[Looks around and then sighs in relief.]  He's gone.
PIPPIN	Merry! [Pippin looks down in horror but as  he turns his head, he spots a pair of  gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the  tree he�s clinging to. The tree starts  to move and groan.]
TREEBEARD	Hooooo...
PIPPIN	Argh!! [Pippin loses his grip in fright and  grabs at the air futilely as he falls.  The tree catches him before he hits  the ground.]
GRISHN�KH	Let�s put a maggot-hole in your belly.  [Suddenly he senses something behind  him and as he looks up, the tree stomps  and squashes him onto the forest floor.]
PIPPIN	Run, Merry! [Merry tries to run away but is scooped  by the tree.]
TREEBEARD	[Looks at the creatures in his hands]  Little Orcs! Bur�rum...
PIPPIN	It�s talking, Merry. The tree is talking!
TREEBEARD	Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps  slowly through the forest.]
MERRY	A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.
PIPPIN	Don�t talk to it, Merry. Don�t encourage  it.
TREEBEARD	Treebeard, some call me.
PIPPIN	And whose side are you on?
TREEBEARD	Side? I am on nobody�s side because  nobody�s on my side, little Orc. Nobody  cares for the woods anymore.
MERRY	We�re not Orcs. We�re Hobbits!
TREEBEARD	Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.  Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens  his hold on the hobbits and squeezes  them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain]  They come with fire, they come with  axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking,  burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse  them!
MERRY	No, you don�t understand. We�re Hobbits...  Halflings! Shirefolk!
TREEBEARD	Maybe you are and maybe you aren�t.  The White Wizard will know.
PIPPIN	The White Wizard?
MERRY	Saruman. [Treebeard drops them on the ground  and the hobbits look up at the White  Wizard.]
GOLLUM	See, see, we have led you out! Hurry  hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find  you.
GOLLUM	Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting  a wide berth between him and Sam.]
SAM	Whoa, it�s a bog! He�s led us into a  swamp!
GOLLUM	A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We  will take you on safe paths through  the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go  quickly.
GOLLUM	I found it, I did. The way through the  marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't  know it. They go round for miles and  miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick  as shadows we must be.
SAM	There are dead things! Dead faces in  the water!
GOLLUM	All dead. All rotten. Elves and men  and orcses. A great battle long ago.  [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead  Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name.  This way. Don�t follow the lights.
SAM	Ohh!
GOLLUM	Careful now, or hobbits go down to join  the dead ones and light little candles  of their own.
SAM	Frodo! [Frodo is in the water and sees many  faces of the dead, no longer still but  screaming and grasping, their rotten  robes and hair flowing about their gruesome  faces. Their hands are reaching for  him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind.  Frodo sputters and gasps for air as  Gollum pulls him out of the water.]
FRODO	[Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude  and disbelief.] Gollum...
GOLLUM	Don�t follow the lights! [Crawls away]
SAM	[Runs to Frodo�s side.] Mr. Frodo! Are  you alright?
[NIGHTFALL	Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake.  He is holding the Ring in the palm of  his hand and stroking it, mesmerized.  Suddenly he hears Gollum.]
GOLLUM	Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo  quickly puts the Ring back inside his  shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching  away from him, stroking the centre of  his palm] our preciousss...
FRODO	What did you say?
GOLLUM	Master should be resting. Master needs  to keep up his strength.
FRODO	[Moves over and crouches in front of  Gollum] Who are you?
GOLLUM	Mustn�t ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,  Gollum*
FRODO	Gandalf told me you were one of the  River Folk.
GOLLUM	Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold  be travellers far from home.
FRODO	He said your life was a sad story.
GOLLUM	They do not see what lies ahead, when  sun has failed and moon is dead.
FRODO	You were not so very different from  a hobbit once, were you... Sm�agol?
GOLLUM	[Looks up slowly.] What did you call  me?
FRODO	That was your name once, wasn�t it?  A long time ago.
GOLLUM	My name... My name... S... S...Sm�agol�
GOLLUM	Argh!!
SAM	Black Riders!
GOLLUM	Hide! Hide!
FRODO	Argh! [Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the  Nazg�l's sword piercing him and the  call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths  come to him in flashes.]
FRODO	Argh!!
SAM	C�mon Frodo! C'mon! [Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring  on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags  Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble  bushes. The Nazg�l appears, tightening  his hold on the reins. Camera then shows  him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down  across the marsh lands. Chilling screams  of the Nazg�l fill the air.]
GOLLUM	Quick! They will see us! They will see  us!
SAM	I thought they were dead!
GOLLUM	Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
GOLLUM	[cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!  They are calling for it. They are calling  for the preciousss.
SAM	Mr. Frodo! It�s alright. I�m here.
GOLLUM	Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very  close.
GIMLI	[Spits] Ptui! Orc blood.
ARAGORN	These are strange tracks.
GIMLI	The air is so close in here.
LEGOLAS	This forest is old. Very old. Full of  memory... and anger.
LEGOLAS	The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN	[Whispers] Gimli!
GIMLI	Huh?
ARAGORN	[Gestures] Lower your axe.
GIMLI	[Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.
LEGOLAS	Aragorn, nad n� ennas! (Something is  out there.)
ARAGORN	Man cenich? (What do you see?) [Close-up of Legolas� eyes]
LEGOLAS	The White Wizard approaches.
ARAGORN	Do not let him speak. He will put a  spell on us.
ARAGORN	We must be quick. [With a yell, the three swing round  to attack. Gimli�s axe and Legolas�  arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his  sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp.  They shield their eyes with their hands  from the bright light emanating from  the White Wizard.]
WHITE WIZARD	You are tracking the footsteps of two  young hobbits.
ARAGORN	Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD	They passed this way the day before  yesterday. They met someone they did  not expect. Does that comfort you?
ARAGORN	Who are you? Show yourself! [The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf,  all dressed in white. The three are  astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.]
ARAGORN	It cannot be. You fell.
GANDALF	Through fire and water. [Flashback:  Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop  D�rin�s Tower.] From the lowest dungeon  to the highest peak, I fought with the  Balrog of Morgoth.
GANDALF	Until at last, I threw down my enemy  and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
GANDALF	Darkness took me. And I strayed out  of thought and time. [Camera zooms in  Gandalf�s eye and enters an amorphous  realm of stars and galaxies, ending  in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled  overhead and everyday was as long as  a life-age of the earth. But it was  not the end. I felt life in me again.
GANDALF	I've been sent back until my task is  done.
ARAGORN	Gandalf!
GANDALF	Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used  to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was  my name. [He smiles]
GIMLI	Gandalf!
GANDALF	[With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf  the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come  back to you now at the turn of the tide.
GANDALF	One stage of your journey is over, another  begins. War has come to Rohan. We must  ride to Edoras with all speed.
LEGOLAS	That is one of the Mearas, unless my  eyes are cheated by some spell.
GANDALF	Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.]  He's the lord of all horses and he's  been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD	My home lies deep in the forest near  the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf  I would keep you safe and safe is where  I�ll keep you. The trees have grown  wild and dangerous. Anger festers in  their hearts. They will harm you if  they can. There are too few of us now.  Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
GOLLUM	The Black Gate of Mordor. [The enormous Black Gate comes into  view with Orcs patrolling and standing  guard on the towers and atop the walls.  From the right, an army of Easterling  soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]
SAM	Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing  or two to say if he could see us now.
GOLLUM	Master says to show him the way into  Mordor, so good Sm�agol does. Master  says so.
FRODO	I did. [Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]
SAM	That�s it then. We cannot get past that.
SAM	Look! The gate, it's opening! I can  see a way down.
FRODO	Sam, no!
SAM	Argh!! [Frodo goes after Sam.]
GOLLUM	Master! [Two Easterling soldiers see streams  of dust coming down the cliff made by  Sam and Frodo. They move away from the  troop to investigate. Frodo reaches  Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the  Easterlings move closer and closer,  Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself  and Sam. The soldiers are now directly  in front of Sam, but their eyes see  nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer  from underneath the cloak. The soldiers  soon leave and after a moment, Frodo  throws back the cloak and pulls Sam  out.]
FRODO	I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
SAM	I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these  Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
FRODO	Now! [Gollum pulls them back.]
GOLLUM	No! No, no master! They catch you! They  catch you! Don�t take it to him! He  wants the preciousss. Always he�s looking  for it! And the preciousss is wanting  to go back to him. But we mustn�t let  him have it.
GOLLUM	No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] There�s  another way. More secret. A dark way.
SAM	Why haven�t you spoken of this before?!
GOLLUM	Because Master did not ask!
SAM	He�s up to something.
FRODO	Are you saying there�s another way into  Mordor?
GOLLUM	Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,  and then� a tunnel. closes. Gollum is stroking Frodo�s arm  and burying his face in his cloak.]
FRODO	He�s led us this far, Sam.
SAM	Mr. Frodo, no.
FRODO	He�s been true to his word.
SAM	[Whispers] No!
FRODO	Lead the way, Sm�agol.
GOLLUM	Good Sm�agol always helps. [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares  after him in disbelief.]
GANDALF	Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.  There dwells Th�oden, King of Rohan,  whose mind is overthrown. Saruman�s  hold over King Th�oden is now very strong.
�OWYN	My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?  Uncle?
�OWYN	Will you not go to him? [She weeps.]  Will you do nothing?
GANDALF	Be careful what you say. Do not look  for welcome here.
GR�MA	Oh, he� he must have died sometime in  the night. What a tragedy for the king  to lose his only son and heir.
GR�MA	I understand his passing is hard to  accept, especially now that your brother  has deserted you.
�OWYN	[jumps back and throws off Gr�ma�s hand]  Leave me alone, snake!
GR�MA	[Rises from the bed and moves ever closer  to �owyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who  knows what you have spoken to the darkness.  In bitter watches of the night, when  all your life seems to shrink, the walls  of your bower closing in about you,  like a hutch to trammel some wild thing  in.
GR�MA	So fair, so cold, like a morning of  pale spring still clinging to winter's  chill.
�OWYN	Your words are poison! [�owyn runs out of the hall. Weeping,  she looks away into the distance. A  flag comes off its pole and is carried  by the breeze. �owyn sees riders coming  towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the  entrance to Edoras, the flag floats  down to land near him. Edoras is silent  and somber. Everyone is dressed in black  and staring at the newcomers in wary  silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall  and sees a lady in white standing on  the steps. He looks around at more somber  people.]
GIMLI	You�ll find more cheer in a graveyard.
GANDALF	[sees H�ma] Ah.
H�MA	I cannot allow you before Th�oden-King  so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order  of Gr�ma Wormtongue.
H�MA	[gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.
GANDALF	Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You  would not part an old man from his walking  stick? [Looks at H�ma innocently.]
GR�MA	[Leaning down and whispering to Th�oden.]  My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.  He�s a herald of woe.
GANDALF	The courtesy of your hall is somewhat  lessened of late, Th�oden King.
GR�MA	[Whispering to Th�oden.] He�s not welcome.
TH�ODEN	Why should I� welcome you, Gandalf�  Stormcrow? [Looks to Gr�ma for affirmation.]
GR�MA	A just question, my liege. [He walks  towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in  which this conjurer chooses to appear.  Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news  is an ill guest.
GANDALF	Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind  you teeth. I have not passed through  fire and death to bandy crooked words  with a witless worm! [Raises his staff  against Gr�ma.]
GR�MA	His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf  while addressing the guards] I told  you to take the wizard�s staff!
GANDALF	Th�oden, son of Thengel, too long have  you sat in the shadows.
GIMLI	[Growls] I would stay still, if I were  you.
GANDALF	Hearken to me! I release you from the  spell. [Gestures with his hand]
TH�ODEN	[Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf  opens his eyes in surprise.] You have  no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
TH�ODEN	Argh!
GANDALF	[Points his staff towards Th�oden.]  I will draw you, Saruman, as poison  is drawn from a wound.
ARAGORN	Wait.
TH�ODEN	[In Saruman�s voice.] If I go. . . Th�oden  dies.
GANDALF	You did not kill me, you will not kill  him!
TH�ODEN	[in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
GANDALF	Be gone!! [Gandalf smites Th�oden as he lunges  at him. Th�oden is thrown back into  the chair and the shot changes to Saruman  flying backwards from the Palant�r which  he used to manipulate Th�oden. He lands  landing hard on the floor of Orthanc,  bleeding from a gash in his forehead.  In the hall, Th�oden lets out a moan  and slumps forward in the chair. �owyn  runs to her uncle�s side as he falls.  Th�oden�s head rises again and his face  begins to change gradually into that  of a much younger-looking man. Clarity  and recognition returns to his eyes.]
TH�ODEN	[Looks closely at �owyn] I know your  face. �owyn� �owyn.
TH�ODEN	Gandalf?
GANDALF	Breathe the free air again, my friend.
TH�ODEN	[Standing up and looking around him.]  Dark have been my dreams of late. [He  looks down at his trembling hands.]
GANDALF	Your fingers would remember their old  strength better... if they grasped your  sword.
GR�MA	Argh! [Beseechingly to Th�oden] I've  only ever served you, my lord!
TH�ODEN	[Advancing towards Gr�ma, holding the  sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft  would have had me crawling on all fours  like a beast!
GR�MA	[Grovelling] Send me not from your side.
ARAGORN	No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.  Enough blood has been spilled on his  account.
GR�MA	Get out of my way!
H�MA	Hail, Th�oden king! [The crowd kneels in homage before Th�oden.  Aragorn kneels also. Gr�ma rides out  of Edoras. As Th�oden turns to go back  into the hall, he looks up.]
TH�ODEN	Where is Th�odred? Where is my son?
TH�ODEN	Simbelmyn�. Ever has it grown on the  tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf]  Now it shall cover the grave of my son.  Alas, that these evil days should be  mine. The young perish and the old linger.  That I should live to see the last days  of my house.
GANDALF	Th�odred�s death was not of your making.
TH�ODEN	No parent should have to bury their  child.
GANDALF	He was strong in life. His spirit will  find its way to the halls of your fathers.  Westu h�l. Fer�u, Th�odred, Fer�u. (Be-thou  well. Go-thou, Th�odred, go-thou.)
�OWYN	They had no warning. They were unarmed.  Now the wildmen are moving through the  Westfold, burning as they go. Rick,  cot and tree.
FREDA	Where�s mama?
�OWYN	Shh...
GANDALF	This is but a taste of the terror that  Saruman will unleash. All the more potent  for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.  Ride out and meet him head on. Draw  him away from your women and children.  [Leans forward and puts a hand on Th�oden�s  chair. Th�oden looks at his hand warily.]  You must fight.
ARAGORN	You have two thousand good men riding  north as we speak. �omer is loyal to  you. His men will return and fight for  their king.
TH�ODEN	They will be three hundred leagues from  here by now. �omer cannot help us. I  know what it is that you want of me.  But I will not bring further death to  my people. I will not risk open war.
ARAGORN	Open war is upon you. Whether you would  risk it or not.
TH�ODEN	When last I looked, Th�oden, not Aragorn,  was king of Rohan.
GANDALF	Then what is the king�s decision? [Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]
H�MA	By order of the king, the city must  empty. We make for the refuge of Helm�s  Deep. Do not burden yourselves with  treasures. Take only what provisions  you need.
GIMLI	Helm�s Deep! They flee to the mountains  when they should stand and fight. Who  will defend them if not their king.
ARAGORN	He�s only doing what he thinks is best  for his people. Helm�s Deep has saved  them in the past.
GANDALF	There is no way out of that ravine.  Th�oden is walking into a trap. He thinks  he�s leading them to safety. What they  will get is a massacre. Th�oden has  a strong will but I fear for him. I  fear for the survival of Rohan. He will  need you before the end, Aragorn. The  people of Rohan will need you. The defences  HAVE to hold.
ARAGORN	They will hold.
GANDALF	[Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him]  The Grey Pilgrim... that�s what they  used to call me. Three hundred lives  of men I�ve walked this earth and now  I have no time. With luck, my search  will not be in vain. Look to my coming  at first light on the fifth day. At  dawn, look to the East.
ARAGORN	[Opens the stall gates] Go. [Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides  out of the stable and over the plains  of Rohan.]
ARAGORN	You have some skill with a blade. [With a swift move, �owyn swings her  sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable,  gaining the upper hand.]
�OWYN	[Stepping back and sheathing her sword.]  Women of this country learned long ago:  Those without swords may still die upon  them. I fear neither death nor pain.
ARAGORN	What do you fear, my lady?
�OWYN	A cage. To stay behind bars until use  and old age accept them and all chance  of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
ARAGORN	You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden  of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I  do not think that would be your fate.
GR�MA	Th�oden will not stay at Edoras. It�s  vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect  an attack on the city. They will flee  to Helm�s Deep, the great fortress of  Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take  through the mountains. They will be  slow. They will have women and children  with them.
SARUMAN	Send out your warg riders. [The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him,  ferocious growls are heard and shadows  dances.]
SAM	Hey Stinker! Don�t go getting too far  ahead!
FRODO	Why do you do that?
SAM	What?
FRODO	Call him names; run him down all the  time.
SAM	Because� because that's what he is,  Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im  but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he  wants. It's all he cares about.
FRODO	[Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what  it did to him. What it�s still doing  to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.]  I want to help him, Sam...
SAM	Why?
FRODO	Because I have to believe he can come  back.
SAM	You can�t save him, Mr. Frodo.
FRODO	[Snapping at Sam]What do you know about  it? Nothing!
FRODO	[With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't  know why I said that.
SAM	[Looks back at Frodo with tears in his  eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't  take your eyes off it. I've seen you.  You're not eating. You barely sleep.  It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.  You have to fight it!
FRODO	[Grows angry again] I know what I have  to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to  me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He  walks away]
SAM	Can�t you hear yourself? Don�t you know  who you sound like?
GOLLUM	We wants it. We needs it. Must have  the precioussss. They stole it from  us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,  trickssssy, falssse!
SM�AGOL	No! Not Master.
GOLLUM	Yes, precious. False. They will cheat  you, hurt you, lie.
SM�AGOL	Master�s my friend.
GOLLUM	[Tauntingly] You don�t have any friends.  Nobody likes YOU...
SM�AGOL	[Covers his ears] Not listening. I�m  not listening.
GOLLUM	You�re a liar and a thief.
SM�AGOL	[Shaking his head] Nope.
GOLLUM	Mur�derer�!
SM�AGOL	[Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.
GOLLUM	Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!!
SM�AGOL	[Weeping and in a small voice] I hate  you. I hate you!
GOLLUM	[Fiercely] Where would you be without  me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It  was me. We survived because of me!
SM�AGOL	[Resolute] Not anymore.
GOLLUM	[Startled] What did you say?
SM�AGOL	Master looks after us now. We don�t  need you.
GOLLUM	What?
SM�AGOL	Leave now and never come back.
GOLLUM	No!!
SM�AGOL	[Louder] Leave now and never come back!
GOLLUM	[Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!!
SM�AGOL	LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!
SM�AGOL	We... we told him to go away! And away  he goes, preciousss. [He hops around  in joy and does a little dance.] Gone,  gone, gone! Sm�agol is free!
SM�AGOL	Look! Look! See what Sm�agol finds!  Hehehe! Hahaha!
SM�AGOL	They are young. They are tender. They  are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat  them!
SAM	You�ll make him sick, you will, behaving  like that! [Holding up the two rabbits]  There�s only one way to eat a brace  of coneys.
SM�AGOL	[Looking into the pot] Argh!! What�s  it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins  it!
SAM	What�s to ruin? There�s hardly any meat  on �em.
SAM	What we need is a few good taters.
GOLLUM	What�s taters, preciousss? What�s taters  uh?
SAM	PO-TAY-TOES! Boil �em. Mash �em. Stick  �em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips  with a nice piece of fried fish....
SM�AGOL	[Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!
SAM	Even you couldn�t say no to that. [He  takes a sip of the stew]
SM�AGOL	Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish...  [scrambles up close to Sam] Give it  to usss rrraw... and wrrriggling! [Makes  sickeningly happy face.] You keep nasty  chips. [Hops away]
SAM	You�re hopeless. [Frodo follows the source of the sound.  Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is no  longer in his sight.]
SAM	Mr. Frodo? [He goes in search of Frodo and finds  him lying down near some bushes looking  at a Haradrim army marching across the  land. He moves to lie low beside Frodo.  Sm�agol also moves in beside Frodo.]
SAM	Who are they?
GOLLUM	Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They  are called to Mordor. The Dark One is  gathering all armies to him. It won�t  be long now. He will soon be ready.
SAM	Ready to do what?
GOLLUM	To make his war. The last war that will  cover all the world in shadow.
FRODO	We�ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
SAM	[Suddenly grabs Frodo�s arm] Mr Frodo!  Look! It�s an Oliphaunt!
SAM	No one at home will believe this...
FRODO	[Looking around] Sm�agol? [Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out from  below; the soldiers are being ambushed.  Cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrows  at the soldiers and Oliphaunts from  behind bushes. One of the Oliphaunts  starts trumpeting and stomping towards  Frodo and Sam, swinging his huge trunk  and tusks. Faramir takes aim and shoots  a soldier. He falls from the Oliphaunt  and lands right behind Frodo and Sam,  dead.]
FRODO	We�ve lingered here too long. Come on,  Sam!
SAM	Ah! [He charges at Faramir but is grabbed  by another ranger and thrown down. A  sword appears at his throat. Faramir  appears.]
FARAMIR	Bind their hands. [Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are  heading towards Helm�s Deep. Gimli is  on a horse, chatting with �owyn who  is leading it by the reins.]
GIMLI	It�s true you don�t see many Dwarf women.  And in fact, they are so alike in voice  and appearance, haha that they�re often  mistaken for Dwarf men.
ARAGORN	[Gestures and whispers] It�s the beards....
GIMLI	And this, in turn, has given rise to  the belief that there are no Dwarf women.  And that dwarves just spring out of  holes in the ground!
�OWYN	[Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!
GIMLI	Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous�  Whoa!!
�OWYN	Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli]
GIMLI	[Struggling to get up] It�s alright,  it�s alright. Nobody panic. That was  deliberate. It was deliberate.
ARWEN	The light of the Evenstar does not wax  and wane� It is mine to give to whom  I will... Like my heart� Go to sleep...
[FLASHBACK	Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell.  He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before  him, smiling down at him.]
ARAGORN	I am asleep. This is a dream.
ARWEN	[Bends down to kiss him] Then it is  a good dream. Sleep�
ARAGORN	Min l� pennich nin i aur hen telitha.  (You told me once that this day would  come.)
ARWEN	[Turns to look at Aragorn] � i vethed...  n� i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han  b�d l�n. (This is not the end... it  is the beginning. You must go with Frodo.  That is your path.)
ARAGORN	[Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i v�d o  nin. (My path is hidden from me.)
ARWEN	Si peliannen i v�d na dail l�n. Si boe  �-dhannathach. (It is already laid before  your feet. You cannot falter now.)
ARAGORN	Arwen� [Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers  on his lips. As her hands moves down  to rest on the Evenstar pendant around  Aragorn�s neck, he clasps her hand in  his and they gaze into each other�s  eyes.]
ARWEN	Ae �-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio  ammen. (If you trust nothing else...  trust this. Trust us.)
�OWYN	Where is she? The woman who gave you  that jewel.
[ARAGORN SMILES AND SAYS NOTHING. FLASHBACK	Elrond is speaking to Aragorn in Rivendell,  before he sets out with the Fellowship.]
ELROND	Our time here is ending. Arwen�s time  is ending. Let her go. Let her take  the ship into the west. Let her bear  away her love for you to the Undying  Lands. There it will be evergreen.
ARAGORN	But never more than a memory.
ELROND	I will not leave my daughter here to  die.
ARAGORN	She stays because she still has hope.
ELROND	She stays for YOU! She belongs with  her people!
ARAGORN	Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o  auth a n�r a naeth. (You have a chance  for another life. Away from war... grief...  despair.)
ARWEN	Why are you saying this?
ARAGORN	I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was  a dream, Arwen, nothing more.
ARAGORN	This belongs to you.
ARWEN	[Closes Aragorn�s hand over the Evenstar]  It was a gift. Keep it.
�OWYN	My lord?
ARAGORN	She is sailing to the Undying Lands,  with all that is left of her kin.
GAMLING	What is it? H�ma? [Their horses become restless.]
H�MA	[Looking around] I�m not sure. [A warg scout appears on a slope above  and charges at them. The warg attacks  H�ma and kills him.]
GAMLING	Wargs! [Just as it starts to turn on Gamling,  Legolas runs over and kills the warg  with an arrow. He then draws his knife  and kills the Orc.]
LEGOLAS	Argh! [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout!
TH�ODEN	What is it? What do you see?
ARAGORN	[Running back to Th�oden] Wargs! We  are under attack!
ARAGORN	Get them out of here!
TH�ODEN	All riders to the head of the column!
GIMLI	[Trying to mount Arod] Come on, get  me up here, I�m a rider! Argh!
TH�ODEN	[To �owyn] You must lead the people  to Helm�s Deep. And make haste!
�OWYN	I can fight!
TH�ODEN	No! You must do this... for me. [�owyn holds Th�oden�s gaze for a moment  and then turn to attend to the villagers.]
TH�ODEN	[To his men] Follow me! Yah!
GIMLI	[Tries to get Arod to move] Forward.  I mean, charge forward! March forward!  [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather  unsteadily.] That�s it! Go on!
�OWYN	[To the villagers] Make for the lower  ground! Stick together!
WARG-RIDERS	Argh!!
TH�ODEN	CHARGE!!
GIMLI	Bring your pretty face to my axe! [Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas  kills it with one shot.]
GIMLI	[Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged]  Argh! That one counts as mine!
GIMLI	Argh! Stinking creature. Argh! [As he tries to lift the warg off him,  an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills  him quickly, twisting his neck, and  it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at  the Orc and makes a face. He tries to  lift both the warg and Orc off him.  Just then, another warg comes upon him  and bares its teeth, ready to strike.
GIMLI	[Eyes widening] Ooh..! [Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes  on horseback and throws it at the warg.  It dies, landing on Gimli and adding  to the pile on top of him.]
GIMLI	[As the warg lands on him] Oooh!! [Th�oden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn  is knocked off Hasufel and attacked  by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the  warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt  and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while  the latter is half-dragged by the warg.  In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off  and he rips the Evenstar pendant from  Aragorn�s neck as he falls. Aragorn  tries to let go of the warg but finds  his wrist tangled with the saddle straps.  He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle  himself and is dragged closer and closer  to the edge of a cliff at great speed.  The warg runs right off the cliff and  they both disappear over the edge. The  battle is winding down as the Rohirrim  finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]
LEGOLAS	[Looking around] Aragorn!
GIMLI	Aragorn? [They come near to the cliff and hear  Sharku wheezing and laughing]
GIMLI	[Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me  what happened and I will ease your passing.
SHARKU	He�s [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took  a little tumble off the cliff.
LEGOLAS	[Looks towards the edge of the cliff,  and grabs Sharku] You lie!
TH�ODEN	[To his men] Get the wounded on horses.  The wolves of Isengard will return.  Leave the dead.
TH�ODEN	[Puts a hand on Legolas' shoulder] Come.
REFUGEES	Helm�s Deep! At last! There it is!
OLD WOMAN	[To �owyn] We�re safe, my lady! Thank  you!
FREDA	Mama!
MORWEN	�othain! Freda! [The three hug and cry with joy. Th�oden  and company returns from the battle  with warg riders]
GAMLING	Make way for Th�oden!
SOLDIERS	Sire!
GAMLING	Make way for the king! [�owyn rushes down to meet them]
�OWYN	[Looking about] So few. So few of you  have returned.
TH�ODEN	[Dismounting] Our people are safe. We  have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI	[Going up to �owyn] My lady...
�OWYN	Lord Aragorn, where is he?
GIMLI	He fell... [�owyn is shaken and raises teary eyes  to Th�oden. The latter looks down and  then walks away, confirming her unasked  question.]
TH�ODEN	Draw all our forces behind the wall.  Bar the gate, and set a watch on the  surround.
GAMLING	What of those who cannot fight, my lord?  The women and children?
TH�ODEN	Get them into the caves. [Walks down  the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's  arm would have grown long indeed if  he thinks he can reach us here.
GR�MA	Helm�s Deep has one weakness. Its outer  wall is solid rock but for a small culvert  at its base which is little more than  a drain.
GR�MA	How? How can fire undo stone? What kind  of device could bring down the wall?
SARUMAN	If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep  will fall.
GR�MA	[Following Saruman] Even if it is breached,  it would take a number beyond reckoning,  thousands to storm the keep.
SARUMAN	Tens of thousands.
GR�MA	But, my lord, there is no such force.
SARUMAN	A new power is rising. Its victory is  at hand!
SARUMAN	This night, the land will be stained  with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms  Deep! Leave none alive!
SARUMAN	To war!! [The army cheers and roars even louder.]
SARUMAN	[Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men.
PIPPIN	Look! There�s smoke to the south!
TREEBEARD	There is always smoke rising from Isengard  these days.
MERRY	Isengard? [The two hobbits climb higher up onto  Treebeard for a better view.]
TREEBEARD	There was a time when Saruman would  walk in my woods. But now he has a mind  of metal and wheels. He no longer cares  for growing things.
PIPPIN	What is it?
MERRY	It�s Saruman�s army! The war has started.
ARWEN	[Kissing him on the lips] May the grace  of the Valar protect you.
ARAGORN	[Mumbles] Brego� [He grabs hold of Brego�s  mane, pulls himself onto the horse and  rides slowly to Helms Deep.]
ELROND	[Coming into her room] Arwen. [Arwen hears him and sits up.]
ELROND	Tollen i l�. I chair gwannar na Valannor.  Si bado, no c�rar. (Arwen, it is time.  The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go  now... before it is too late.)
ARWEN	I have made my choice.
ELROND	He is not coming back. Why do you linger  here when there is no hope?
ARWEN	There is still hope.
ELROND	[Walks towards window and looks out]  If Aragorn survives this war, you will  still be parted. If Sauron is defeated,  and Aragorn made king and all that you  hope for comes true, you will still  have to taste the bitterness of mortality.  Whether by the sword or the slow decay  of time, Aragorn will die.
ELROND	And there will be no comfort for you.  No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.  He will come to death, an image of the  splendor of the kings of men in glory  undimmed before the breaking of the  world.
ELROND	But you, my daughter, you will linger  on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall  in winter that comes without a star.  Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,  under the fading trees, until all the  world is changed and the long years  of your life are utterly spent.
ELROND	[Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there is  nothing for you here, only death.
ELROND	A im, �-'erin veleth l�n? (Do I not  also have your love?)
ARWEN	[Crying and moving into her father�s  embrace] Gerich meleth n�n, ada. (You  have my love, father)
GALADRIEL	I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne  nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan  ned gwilith. (The world has changed...  I feel it in the water, I feel it in  the earth, I smell it in the air.) The  power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman  is communicating with Sauron via the  Palant�r.] Sauron will use his puppet  Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.  Isengard has been unleashed. [View of  Saruman's marching army] The eye of  Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last  free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath]  His war on this country will come swiftly.  He senses the Ring is close. The strength  of the Ringbearer is failing. In his  heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up  of Galadriel] The quest will claim his  life. You know this. You have foreseen  it. It is the risk we all took.
GALADRIEL	In the gathering dark, the will of the  Ring grows strong. It works hard now  to find its way back into the hands  of men.
GALADRIEL	Men, who are so easily seduced by its  power. The young captain of Gondor has  but to extend his hands, take the Ring  for his own and the world will fall.  It is close now, so close to achieving  its goal.
GALADRIEL	For Sauron will have dominion of all  life on this Earth, even unto the ending  of the world. The time of the Elves  is over.
GALADRIEL	Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?  Do we let them stand alone?
FARAMIR	What news?
MADRIL	Our scouts report Saruman has attacked  Rohan. Th�oden�s people have fled to  Helm�s Deep. [Points at the map] But  we must look to our own borders. Faramir,  Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling  an army. Easterlings and Southrons are  passing through the Black Gate.
FARAMIR	How many?
MADRIL	Some thousands. More come every day.
FARAMIR	Who�s covering the river to the north?
MADRIL	We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but  if the city is attacked, we won�t hold  it.
FARAMIR	[Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks  from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The  fight will come to men on both fronts.  Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us  soon. And he will strike hard. He knows  now we do not have the strength to repel  him.
FARAMIR	My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
SAM	Spies?! Now wait just a minute!
FARAMIR	Well if you�re not spies, then who are  you?
FARAMIR	Speak.
FRODO	We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins  is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
FARAMIR	Your bodyguard?
SAM	His gardener.
FARAMIR	And where is your skulking friend? That  gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured  look.
FRODO	[The merest hesitation.] There was no  other.
FRODO	We set out from Rivendell with seven  companions. One we lost in M�ria. Two  were my kin. A Dwarf there was also,  and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son  of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
FARAMIR	[Intently] You�re a friend of Boromir?
FRODO	Yes... for my part.
FARAMIR	It will grieve you then to learn that  he is dead.
FRODO	[Shocked] Dead? How? When?
FARAMIR	As one of his companions, I�d hoped  you would tell me. [Pause] He was my  brother.
GONDORIAN RANGER	Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found  the third one.
FARAMIR	You must come with me. Now. [Frodo gets up and follow. They come  to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking  the Forbidden Pool.]
FARAMIR	[Pointing down] Down there. [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving  into the water.]
FARAMIR	To enter the forbidden pool bears the  penalty of death. [He gestures to archers  hidden in the bushes.] They wait for  my command.
FARAMIR	Shall I shoot? [Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges  from the pool onto a rock. He holds  a fish in his hand and starts singing,  slapping the fish on the rock as he  goes.]
GOLLUM	[singing] The rock and pool is nice  and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish  [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch  a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The  fish almost wriggles out of his grasp  and he whacks it some more.]
FRODO	Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature  is bound to me. And I to him. He is  our guide. Please, let me go down to  him.
FRODO	Sm�agol. [Gollum turns round at Frodo�s  voice.] Master is here. Come, Sm�agol.  Trust master. Come!
GOLLUM	We must go now?
FRODO	Sm�agol, you must trust master. Follow  me, come on. Come. Come, Sm�agol. Nice  Sm�agol. That�s it. Come on.
FRODO	Don�t hurt him! Sm�agol don�t struggle!  Sm�agol listen to me!
GOLLUM	[wails] Master!! [A black cloth is brought over Gollum's  head. Frodo stares after them with a  stricken expression as Faramir leads  Gollum and his men away. Back in the  cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground.  Crying, he crawls into a corner and  curls up into ball.]
GOLLUM	No! No!
FARAMIR	Where are you leading them? Answer me!
GOLLUM	[Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder]  Sm�a�gol... Why does it cry, Sm�agol?
SM�AGOL	[Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Master  trickst us.
GOLLUM	Of course he did. I told you he was  tricksy. I told you he was false.
SM�AGOL	[Sobbing] Master is our friend... our  friend.
GOLLUM	Master betrayed us.
SM�AGOL	No, not its business. Leave us alone!
GOLLUM	[Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy  little hobbitses. They stole it from  us.
SM�AGOL	[Whimpers] No... No!
FARAMIR	What did they steal?
GOLLUM	[Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression]  Myyy� PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth  and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
SAM	We have to get out of here. You go.  Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,  Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.  Disappear.
FRODO	I can�t. You were right, Sam. You tried  to tell me, but� I�m sorry. The Ring�s  taking me Sam. If I put it on, he�ll  find me. He�ll see.
SAM	Mr. Frodo... [They both stand as Faramir enters.]
FARAMIR	[Unsheathes his sword] So... this is  the answer to all the riddles. Here  in the wild I have you. Two halflings  and a host of men at my call. The Ring  of power within my grasp.
FARAMIR	A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,  to show his quality.
FRODO	No!! [He runs away from Faramir]
SAM	Stop it! Leave him alone! Don�t you  understand? He�s got to destroy it.  That�s where we�re going. Into Mordor.  To the mountain of fire.
DAMROD	Osgiliath is under attack. They call  for reinforcements.
SAM	Please. It�s such a burden. Will you  not help him?
DAMROD	Captain?
FARAMIR	Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to  Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
ARAGORN	[Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen,  Brego, mellon n�n. (Well done, Brego,  my friend)
REFUGEES	He�s alive!
GIMLI	[Pushing his way through the crowd.]  Where is he? Where is he? Get out of  the way. I�m gonna kill him! [He sees  Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the  canniest and the most reckless man I  ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless  you, laddie!
ARAGORN	Gimli, where is the king? [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn  makes his way in, he runs into Legolas  who stands waiting.]
LEGOLAS	Le ab-dollen. (You�re late.) [They smile.  Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorn�s  wounds.] You look terrible.
ARAGORN	Hannon le. (Thank you.) [�owyn looks on and smiles even as tears  fill her eyes.]
TH�ODEN	A great host, you say?
ARAGORN	All Isengard is emptied
TH�ODEN	How many?
ARAGORN	Ten thousand strong at least.
TH�ODEN	Ten thousand?!
ARAGORN	It is an army bred for a single purpose:  to destroy the world of men. They will  be here by nightfall.
TH�ODEN	Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
TH�ODEN	[to Gamling] I want every man and strong  lad able to bear arms to be ready for  battle by nightfall.
TH�ODEN	We will cover the causeway and the gate  from above. No army has ever breached  the Deeping Wall or set foot inside  the Hornburg.
GIMLI	This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.  These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick  and their shields broad.
TH�ODEN	I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.  I know how to defend my own keep.
TH�ODEN	They will break upon this fortress like  water on rock. Saruman�s hordes will  pillage and burn, we�ve seen it before.  Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.  Within these walls, we will outlast  them.
ARAGORN	They do not come to destroy Rohan�s  crops or villages. They come to destroy  its people. Down to the last child.
TH�ODEN	[Draws close to Aragorn] What would  you have me do? Look at my men. Their  courage hangs by a thread. If this is  to be our end, then I would have them  make such an end as to be worthy of  remembrance.
ARAGORN	Send out riders, my lord. You must call  for aid.
TH�ODEN	And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We  are not so lucky in our friends as you.  The old alliances are dead.
ARAGORN	Gondor will answer.
TH�ODEN	Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold  fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies  closed in around us? Where was Gon�  � No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.  [He walks away, calling out orders]  Get the women and children into the  caves.
GAMLING	We need more time to lay provisions  for a siege, lord �
TH�ODEN	[Cutting him off] There is no time.  War is upon us!
ROHAN CAPTAIN	[to the soldiers] Secure the gate!
TREEBEARD	We Ents have not troubled about the  wars of men and wizards for a very long  time. But now something is about to  happen that has not happened for an  age... Ent Moot.
MERRY	What�s that?
TREEBEARD	'Tis a gathering.
MERRY	A gathering of what? [Merry and Pippin turns round as they  hear movement from the forest around  them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard  gathering.]
TREEBEARD	Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good,  good. Many have come. Now we must decide  if the Ents will go to war.
SOLDIER 1	Move back! Move to the caves!
SOLDIER 2	Keep moving!
SOLDIER 3	Quickly now! [Old men and young lads are being drafted  for war. The women and children say  their tearful and reluctant farewells  as their fathers, husbands and sons  are led away by soldiers. In the armoury,  weapons are being distributed. Aragorn  picks up a battered sword, looks at  it and tosses it back.]
ARAGORN	Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These  are no soldiers.
GIMLI	Most have seen too many winters.
LEGOLAS	Or too few. Look at them. They�re frightened.  I can see it in their eyes. [The men  around them fell silent. Legolas speaks  to Aragorn.] Boe a h�n: neled herain  dan caer menig! (And they should be...  Three hundred against ten thousand!)
ARAGORN	Si beriathar h�n. Amar n� ned Edoras.  (They have more hope of defending themselves  here than at Edoras.)
LEGOLAS	Aragorn, men i ndagor. H�n �-... ortheri.  Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors.  They cannot win this fight. They are  all going to die!)
ARAGORN	Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses  and then walks away. Legolas makes as  if to go after him.]
GIMLI	[Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go,  lad. Let him be.
GAMLING	Every villager able to wield a sword  has been sent to the armory. My lord?
TH�ODEN	Who am I, Gamling?
GAMLING	You are our king, sire.
TH�ODEN	And do you trust your king?
GAMLING	[Puts armour onto Th�oden] Your men,  my lord, will follow you to whatever  end.
TH�ODEN	To whatever end� Where is the horse  and the rider? Where is the horn that  was blowing? They have passed like rain  on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.  The days have gone down in the west.  Behind the hills, into shadow. How did  it come to this?
ARAGORN	Give me your sword. What is your name?
HALETH	Haleth, son of H�ma, my lord. The men  are saying that we will not live out  the night. They say that it is hopeless..
ARAGORN	This is a good sword, Haleth, son of  H�ma.
ARAGORN	There is always hope. [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his  battle gear. His sword is handed to  him as he reaches for it. He nods and  accepts the sword from Legolas.]
LEGOLAS	We have trusted you this far. You have  not led us astray. Forgive me. I was  wrong to despair.
ARAGORN	�-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing  to forgive, Legolas.)
GIMLI	If we had more time I�d get this adjusted.  [He drops the bundle and the chain mail  lands with its length right to the floor.]  It�s a little tight across the chest.
LEGOLAS	That is no Orc horn. [They run out to  the battlements.]
BEREG	[to another guard] Send for the king.  Open the gate!
SOLDIER	Open the gate! [An army of Lothl�rien Elves march up  the Causeway into the Hornburg. They  are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers  look upon them in wonderment and delight  as they pass.]
TH�ODEN	How is this possible?
HALDIR	I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.  An alliance once existed between Elves  and men. Long ago we fought and died  together. [He looks up to see Aragorn,  Legolas and Gimli running down the steps,  and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
ARAGORN	[He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome,  Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace.  Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back  lightly.]
ARAGORN	You are most welcome! [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other  on the shoulder.]
HALDIR	[Turning to Th�oden] We are proud to  fight alongside men, once more.
GIMLI	[Grumbling and straining to look above  the wall.] You could have picked a better  spot.
GIMLI	Well lad, whatever luck you live by,  let�s hope it lasts the night.
LEGOLAS	Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
GIMLI	Let�s hope they last the night. [The marching and thumping grows louder  and louder. Lightning flashes and it  begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army  continues to march at the fortress,  an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]
ARAGORN	A Eruch�n, �-dano i faelas a hyn an  uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no  mercy! For you shall receive none!)
GIMLI	[Jumping and straining to see] What�s  happening out there?
LEGOLAS	Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at  Gimli with a grin] Or would you like  me to find you a box?
GIMLI	[Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!
ARAGORN	Dartho! (Hold!) [The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring  and thumping. With a hollow groan, the  Uruk that was shot collapsed to the  ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their  teeth and roar with anger. With a cry,  the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon  in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts  charging.]
TH�ODEN	So it begins.
ARAGORN	Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!) [The Elves notch their arrow and aim.]
LEGOLAS	Faeg i-varv d�n na lanc a nu ranc. (Their  armor is weak at the neck and beneath  the arms.)
ARAGORN	Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!)
GIMLI	Did they hit anything?
TH�ODEN	Give them a volley.
GAMLING	[to the men] Fire!
MAN-WITH-MISSING-EYE	Fire! [More arrows are released. But the Uruk-hai  army keep advancing, with more replacing  those fallen.]
ARAGORN	Fire!
GIMLI	[Impatiently] Send them to me! C�mon!
ARAGORN	Pendraid! (Ladders!) [The Elves draw their blades in preparation  for combat. The first ladders are almost  reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk  Berserkers on top of them.]
ARAGORN	Swords! Swords!
GIMLI	Good! [Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai  climb over the wall.]
GIMLI	Legolas, two already! [Holding up two  fingers]
LEGOLAS	I�m on seventeen!
GIMLI	[Outraged] Argh! I�ll have no pointy-ear  outscoring me! [He turns to a Uruk just  climbing over the wall, whacking it  in the groin with his axe and killing  it as it falls.]
LEGOLAS	[Fires two arrows] Nineteen! [The Ent Moot is still in progress.  The Ents sway a little as they continue  to deliberate. Merry and Pippin are  sitting a distance away. Suddenly, Treebeard  nods and turns to the hobbits.]
PIPPIN	[Gesturing] Merry!
TREEBEARD	We have just agreed. [Long pause with  his eyes closed.]
MERRY	[Angles his head in query] Yes?
TREEBEARD	I have told your names to the Ent moot  and we have agreed � you are not Orcs.
PIPPIN	Well, that�s good news.
MERRY	[impatiently] And what about Saruman?  Have you come to a decision about HIM?
TREEBEARD	[Waving a hand] Now don�t be hasty,  Master Meriadoc.
MERRY	Hasty? Our friends are out there! They  need our help! They cannot fight this  war on their own.
TREEBEARD	War, yes� It affects us all. But you  must understand, young hobbit. It takes  a loong time to say anything in ooold�  Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their  eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never  say anything� unless it is worth taking  a looong� time to say.
GIMLI	Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!  Twenty-one! Twenty-two!
ARAGORN	Na fennas! (Causeway!) [Directs the  Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]
TH�ODEN	Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,  Saruman?
ARAGORN	Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down,  Legolas!) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai  in the shoulder but the latter keeps  going] Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!  Kill him!)
TH�ODEN	Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!
GIMLI	Aragorn!! Argh! [He is soon overpowered. Aragorn gets  up and sees Gimli falling.]
ARAGORN	Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind  him] Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)
ARAGORN	Herio! (Charge!) [Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge  towards the Uruk-hai streaming in. He  rushes to Gimli�s side and picks him  up. At the top of the battlements, Legolas  grabs a shield and sends it sliding  across the ground. He then hops onto  it and surfs down the steps, releasing  three arrows as he goes, and kicking  the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he  lands at the bottom.]
TREEBEARD	The Ents cannot hold back this storm.  We must weather such things as we have  always done.
MERRY	How can that be your decision?!
TREEBEARD	This is not our war.
MERRY	But you're part of this world! Aren�t  you?! [The Ents look at one another,  taken back] You must help, please! You  must do something!
TREEBEARD	You are young and brave, Master Merry.  But your part in this tale is over.  Go back to your home.
PIPPIN	Maybe Treebeard�s right. We don�t belong  here, Merry. It's too big for us. What  can we do in the end? We've got the  Shire. Maybe we should go home.
MERRY	[Looking into the distance.] The fires  of Isengard will spread. And the woods  of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.  And all that was once green and good  in this world will be gone. [Turns to  Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder]  There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING	Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get  your men out of there!
ARAGORN	Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!  (To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep!  Haldir, to the Keep!)
GIMLI	[Protesting] What are you doing? Argh!  What are you stopping for!
ARAGORN	[Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs  up the steps to Haldir�s side and catches  him and he collapses. Haldir's head  rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing.  Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then  with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and  swings down to the ground, killing as  he goes.]
GAMLING	Brace the gate!
SOLDIER	Hold them!
TH�ODEN	[Drawing his sword] To the gate! Draw  your swords!
GAMLING	Make way! We cannot hold much longer.
TH�ODEN	Hold them!
ARAGORN	[Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai  through the broken gate] How long do  you need?
GAMLING	Brace the gate!
TH�ODEN	As long as you can give me!
ARAGORN	Gimli!
THEODEN	Timbers! Brace the Gate! [Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit  and stand on a ledge just to the side  of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over,  seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming  the gate.]
GIMLI	Come on! We can take �em!
ARAGORN	It�s a long way. [Gimli takes a peek and then steps back.]
GIMLI	[Mumbles] Toss me.
ARAGORN	What?
GIMLI	I cannot jump the distance! You�ll have  to toss me!
GIMLI	Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorn�s hand] Don�t  tell the Elf.
ARAGORN	Not a word. [He tosses Gimli to the head of the  Causeway and then leaps over.]
GIMLI	[Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai]
TH�ODEN	Shore up the door!
SOLDIER 1	Make way!
SOLDIER 2	Follow me to the barricade.
SOLDIER 3	Watch our backs!
SOLDIER 4	Throw another one over here!
TH�ODEN	Higher! [Men are bracing the gate with wood  and nails. Aragorn and Gimli continue  to fight off the Uruk-hai just outside.  Meanwhile the Uruk-hai load and fires  enormous hooks over the battlements.  Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders  as they are pulled up towards the walls,  the super-ladders locking onto the edge  of the battlements with their steel  grips. Legolas takes aim as another  super-ladder is being pulled up and  shoots away one of the ropes. The ladder  falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]
SOLDIER	Hold fast the gate!]
TH�ODEN	[Through a crack in the gate] Gimli!  Aragorn! Get out of there!
LEGOLAS	Aragorn! [He throws them a rope] [Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand and  the rope with the other as they are  pulled up the wall. Just then the Uruk-hai  load and fires enormous hooks over the  battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb  onto super-ladders as they are pulled  up towards the walls, the super-ladders  locking onto the edge of the battlements  with their steel grips. Legolas takes  aim as another super-ladder is being  pulled up and shoots away one of the  ropes. The ladder falls back onto the  Uruk-hai army.]
TH�ODEN	Pull everybody back! Pull them back!
GAMLING	Fall back! Fall back!
TH�ODEN	They�ve broken through! The castle is  breached. Retreat!
GAMLING	Fall back!
TH�ODEN	Retreat!
ARAGORN	Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!
GAMLING	Into the Keep! [They all run towards the keep, Legolas  firing two arrows into the Uruk-hai  army as he goes.]
TREEBEARD	I will leave you at the western borders  of the forest. You can make your way  north to your homeland from there.
PIPPIN	Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to  a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take  us south!
TREEBEARD	South? But that will lead you past Isengard.
PIPPIN	Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can  slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer  we are to danger, the farther we are  from harm. It�s the last thing he�ll  expect.
TREEBEARD	Mmmm. That doesn�t make sense to me.  But then, you are very small. Perhaps  you�re right. South it is then. Hold  on, little Shirelings. I always like  going south. Somehow it feels like going  down hill.
MERRY	Are you mad? We�ll be caught!
PIPPIN	No we won�t. Not this time. [Faramir and company draws close to  Osgiliath.]
RANGER 1	Look! Osgiliath burns!
RANGER 2	Mordor has come.
FRODO	[With tears in his eyes] The Ring will  not save Gondor. It has only the power  to destroy. Please, let me go.
FARAMIR	Hurry. [He presses them on]
FRODO	Faramir, you must let me go! [Frodo and Sam are pushed on towards  Osgiliath]
TREEBEARD	And a little family of field mice that  climb up sometimes and they tickle me  awfully. They�re always trying to get  somewhere where they � Oh!! [He sees  the desolated landscape of tree stumps  that used to be forested grounds] Many  of these trees were my friends. Creatures  I had known from nut and acorn.
PIPPIN	I�m sorry, Treebeard.
TREEBEARD	[With tears in his eyes] They had voices  of their own. [His gaze turns to the  treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns]  Saruman! A wizard should know better!
TREEBEARD	There is no curse in Elvish, Entish  or the tongues of men for this treachery.  My business is with Isengard tonight.  With rock and stone!
MERRY	Yes!
TREEBEARD	Hoorarooom... Come my friends. The Ents  are going to war. It is likely that  we go to our doom. Last march of the  Ents!
MADRIL	Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern  shore. Their numbers are too great.  By nightfall we�ll be overrun.
SAM	Mr Frodo!
FRODO	It�s calling to him, Sam. His eye is  almost on me.
SAM	Hold on, Mr. Frodo� You'll be alright...
FARAMIR	Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir  sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will  change our fortunes in this war.
SAM	Do you want to know what happened to  Boromir? You want to know why your brother  died? He tried to take the Ring from  Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect  him, he tried to kill him! The Ring  drove your brother mad!
RANGER	Watch out! [A boulder crashes into a tower overhead  and shatters it. Suddenly, Frodo�s eyes  roll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.]
SAM	Mr Frodo?
FRODO	[In a faraway voice] They�re here. They�ve  come.
FARAMIR	[Looking up] NAZG�L!! [He grabs the  hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.]  Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his  men] Take cover!
TH�ODEN	The fortress is taken. It is over.
ARAGORN	[Carrying a table with Legolas to shore  up the door of the hall] You said this  fortress would never fall while your  men defend it! They still defend it!  They have died defending it!
WOMAN	They are breaking in!
ARAGORN	Is there no other way for the women  and children to get out of the caves?  [There is no answer.] Is there no other  way?
GAMLING	There is one passage. It leads into  the mountains. But they will not get  far. The Uruk-hai are too many.
ARAGORN	Send word for the women and children  to make for the mountain pass. And barricade  the entrance.
TH�ODEN	So much death. What can men do against  such reckless hate?
ARAGORN	[Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and  meet them.
TH�ODEN	[A light of determination shines in  his eyes] For death and glory.
ARAGORN	For Rohan. For your people.
GIMLI	The sun is rising. [Aragorn looks up at a window to see  faint light streaming through. He recalls  Gandalf's words.]
GANDALF	Look to my coming at first light on  the fifth day. At dawn, look to the  east.
TH�ODEN	Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand  shall sound in the deep one last time!
GIMLI	Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to the  horn of Helm Hammerhand]
TH�ODEN	Let this be the hour when we draw swords  together. Fell deeds awake. Now for  wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!
TH�ODEN	FORTH EORLINGAS!!
ARAGORN	Gandalf.
GANDALF	Th�oden king stands alone.
�OMER	[Coming up from behind] Not alone. [He  raises a hand] Rohirrim!!
TH�ODEN	[Looking to the east] �omer!
�OMER	To the king! [The Rohirrim and the White Rider charge  down the slope. Half the Uruk-hai army  turns to face the challenge, bearing  their spears down towards the riders.  As the riders draw closer, the sun rises  behind them, momentarily blinding the  Uruk-hai who raise the hands (and spears)  to shield their eyes. The riders crash  right into the Uruk-hai and engage them  in battle.]
PIPPIN	Yes!
TREEBEARD	A hit. A fine hit! [Two Ents rock a wooden structure and  push it over into the caverns below,  smashing against the rock. Some Orcs  fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent,  setting him on fire. Saruman continues  to look about from his balcony, helpless.  Some Ents are now breaking away at a  dam.]
TREEBEARD	Break the dam! Release the river! [The dam is broken and Saruman looks  up to see the river rushing down the  slope towards Isengard, washing away  Orcs and wooden structures in its path.
MERRY	Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten  their hold on top of Treebeard]
TREEBEARD	Hold on, little hobbits! [Treebeard braces himself against the  flood. As the water rushes over Isengard,  an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burning  body into the water. The water rushes  into the caverns, washing away the bridges,  mechanisms and structures within.]
SAM	What are you doing? Where are you going?!
[SLOW MOTION	Frodo walks up some stairs and stands  on a bridge. A Nazg�l on a Fell beast  emerges in front of him. Frodo stares  at the Nazg�l, fixated. Feeling the  call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir  watches the unfolding tableau from below.  As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his  finger and the Nazg�l flies closer and  closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo  over. Faramir releases an arrow and  shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam  roll down the stairs. As they come to  a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam  in a death grip, yells and points Sting  at his throat, his eyes livid with madness  and anger that someone would try to  take the Ring away.]
FRODO	Aaarrgghh!!!
SAM	[With tears running down his face] It�s  me. It�s your Sam. Don�t you know your  Sam?
FRODO	[Slowly and with despair] I can�t do  this, Sam.
SAM	[Getting up slowly] I know. It�s all  wrong. By rights we shouldn�t even be  here. But we are. [He stands and leans  against a wall, looking out into the  distance.] It�s like in the great stories,  Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.  Full of darkness and danger they were.  And sometimes you didn�t want to know  the end. Because how could the end be  happy? [Images of the riders winning  the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm�s  Deep] How could the world go back to  the way it was when so much bad had  happened?
TH�ODEN	Victory! We have victory! [He raises  his sword with a victorious cry]
SAM	But in the end, it�s only a passing  thing, this shadow. [The women and children  welcome the men as they return. �owyn  runs up to Aragorn and embraces him,  crying tears of relief.] Even darkness  must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard  is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on  from their perch on Treebeard. On the  balcony, Saruman stumbles back into  his chamber] And when the sun shines  it will shine out the clearer. Those  were the stories that stayed with you.  That meant something, even if you were  too small to understand why. But I think,  Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.  Folk in those stories had lots of chances  of turning back only they didn�t. They  kept going because they were holding  on to something.
FRODO	What are we holding on to, Sam?
SAM	There�s some good in this world, Mr.  Frodo. And it�s worth fighting for.
FARAMIR	I think at last we understand one another,  Frodo Baggins.
MADRIL	You know the laws of our country, the  laws of your father. If you let them  go, your life will be forfeit.
FARAMIR	Then it is forfeit. Release them. [Sam shakes the ranger�s hand from his  shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir  with gladness. Over in the realm of  Rohan, Gandalf, Th�oden and company  ride to the top of a slope, looking  towards the Mountain of Fire in the  distance.]
GANDALF	Sauron�s wrath will be terrible, his  retribution swift. The battle for Helm�s  Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth  is about to begin. All our hopes now  lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere  in the wilderness.
SAM	I wonder if we�ll ever be put into songs  or tales.
FRODO	What?
SAM	I wonder if people will ever say, �let�s  hear about Frodo and the Ring.� And  they�ll say �yes, that�s one of my favorite  stories. Frodo was really courageous,  wasn�t he, dad.� �Yes, my boy, the most  famousest of hobbits. And that�s saying  alot.�
FRODO	Huh, you left out one of the chief characters  � Samwise the Brave. I want to hear  more about Sam.
FRODO	Frodo wouldn�t have got far without  Sam.
SAM	Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn�t make fun.  I was being serious.
FRODO	[smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk  on]
SAM	[Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives  his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
FRODO	Sm�agol!
SAM	We�re not gonna wait for you. Come on!
SM�AGOL	Master... Master looks after us. Master  wouldn�t hurt us.
GOLLUM	Master broke his promise.
SM�AGOL	Don�t ask Sm�agol. Poor, poor Sm�agol.
GOLLUM	Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy,  false. We ought to wring his filthy  little neck. [Twists the branch of a  tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them  both. And then we take the precious  and we be the master.
SM�AGOL	[Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The  fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
GOLLUM	Then we stabs them out. Put out his  eyeses. And make HIM crawl.
SM�AGOL	[Bites on his finger and nods eagerly]  Yes! Yes! Yes!
GOLLUM	Kill them both.
SM�AGOL	Yes! No no! [Backs away against a tree]  It�s too risky, it�s too risky.
SAM	Where�s he gone? Hey Gollum, where are  you?
FRODO	Sm�agol?
GOLLUM	[Softly and sinisterly] We could let  HER do it.
SM�AGOL	Yes. She could do it.
GOLLUM	Yes, precious she could. And then we  takes it once they�re dead.
SM�AGOL	Once they�re dead�
GOLLUM	Shh� [He pops out from hiding in front  of the hobbits.]
SM�AGOL	Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet.  Sm�agol will show you the way.
GOLLUM	Follow me. [ Camera pans up over the forest and  Ephel D�ath to reveal the desolation  of Mordor. To the left of the frame  is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-d�r,  and to the right of the frame is the  fiery Mount Doom. Three Fell Beasts  circle the dark skies. Lightning flashes  as the scene fades to black.]
