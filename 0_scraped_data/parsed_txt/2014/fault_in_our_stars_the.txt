Fault in Our Stars, The

HAZEL	I'm not depressed.
FRANNIE	... she eats like a bird. She barely leaves the house,
HAZEL	I'm not depressed.
FRANNIE	... she reads the same book over and over...
DOCTOR	She's depressed.
HAZEL	I'm not depressed!
HAZEL	The booklets and web sites always list depression as a side effect of cancer...
HAZEL	Depression's not a side effect of cancer...
HAZEL	... it's a side effect of dying.
HAZEL	Which is what was happening to me.
FRANNIE	... some days she won't even get out of bed.
DOCTOR	I may switch you to Zoloft. Or Lexapro. And twice a day instead of once.
HAZEL	Why stop there?
DOCTOR	Hmm?
HAZEL	Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids.
DOCTOR	Have you been going to that Support Group I suggested?
FRANNIE	She's gone a few times.
HAZEL	I'm not sure it's for me.
DOCTOR	If you're depressed --
HAZEL	I'm not de--
DOCTOR	-- support Groups are a great way to connect with people who are...
HAZEL	What?
DOCTOR	On the same journey.
HAZEL	"Journey?" Really?
FRANNIE	Hazel.
DOCTOR	Just give it a chance, ok? For me.
DOCTOR	Who knows? You might even find it... enlightening.
PATRICK	... we are gathered here today - literally - in the heart of Jesus.
PATRICK	Who would like to share their story with the group?
SPEAKER #1	Jillian. 15. Lymphoma.
SPEAKER #2	Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma.
PATRICK	Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started a few years ago, when I was...
PATRICK	Who else would like to share?	Hazel?
HAZEL	I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.	Thyroid originally but with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs.
PATRICK	And how are you doing Hazel?
HAZEL	Alright? I guess...?
PATRICK	Maybe now I'll play a song...
FRANNIE	It's Friday night.
HAZEL	Hmm?
FRANNIE	I was just thinking... you should call your friends, see what they're up to.
HAZEL	That's ok.
MICHAEL	Wanna see a movie?
HAZEL	Why don't you guys go to a movie? (off their look)
HAZEL	You haven't been out in a while. Go. Have fun. Take the night off.
MICHAEL	This is a really good show.
HAZEL	Ugh. You can't make me.
MICHAEL	Of course we can, we're your parents.
MICHAEL	Hazel, you need to get out of the house. Make friends. Be a teenager.
HAZEL	If you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot.
MICHAEL	You don't take pot.
HAZEL	See, that's the kind of thing I would know with a fake ID.
FRANNIE	Get in the car.
HAZEL	Are you gonna sit here and wait the whole time?
FRANNIE	Of course not, no. I... (she totally is) I have errands to run.
HAZEL	Ok.
FRANNIE	Love you.
HAZEL	Love you too Mom.
FRANNIE	Make some friends!
HAZEL	I'll take the stairs.
GUS HAZEL
GUS HAZEL
HAZEL	Excuse me.
PATRICK	Who would like to begin?
PATRICK	Isaac, I know you're facing a challenging time. Perhaps you would like to say something...
ISAAC	Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye cancer.	It's looking like another surgery in a couple weeks. After which, well, I'll be blind...
ISAAC	Not that I'm complaining or anything. I know a lot of you have it way worse but, still, I mean, you know, being blind's gonna suck...
ISAAC	...My girlfriend helps. And friends like Augustus here...
ISAAC	So... yeah. That's what's up.
PATRICK	And does your friend want to speak?
GUS	Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a touch of osteosarcoma bout a year and a half ago - lost this baby as a result...
GUS	But really I'm just here at Isaac's request.
PATRICK	And how are you feeling Augustus?
GUS	Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend.
PATRICK	Perhaps you'd like to share your fears with the group, Augustus.
GUS	My fears?
GUS	Oblivion.
PATRICK	Oblivion?
GUS	Yeah, see... I intend to live an extraordinary life. To be remembered. If I'm scared of anything it's... not doing that.
PATRICK	Would, uh, anyone like to speak to that?
PATRICK	Hazel! That's unexpected.
HAZEL	I just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead.
HAZEL	It might be tomorrow. Might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us, right?
HAZEL	Oblivion's inevitable. And if that scares you, well, I suggest you ignore it. God knows it's what everyone else does.
ISAAC MONICA
GUS	Literally.
GUS	I thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus.
HAZEL	Someone should probably tell him, don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart.
GUS	What's your name?
HAZEL	Hazel.
GUS	No your full name?
HAZEL	Hazel Grace Lancaster.
HAZEL	What?
GUS	I didn't say anything.
HAZEL	Why are you looking at me like that?
GUS	Because you're beautiful.
GUS	I enjoy looking at beautiful people and I decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. Particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon.
HAZEL	I'm not beaut --
YOUNG GIRL	Hey Gus.
GUS	Hey Alisa.
ISAAC MONICA
HAZEL	What's with the "always?"
GUS	"Always" is their thing. They'll "always" love each other and whatnot. Must have texted "always" to each other at least four million times this year.
HAZEL	He's gotta be hurting her boob.
GUS	Let's watch a movie.
HAZEL	Oh. Um. Uh... (yes!) Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this
WEEK--
GUS	No I mean now.
HAZEL	What?
GUS	Hmm?
HAZEL	What do you mean "now?"
GUS	I've got a car.
HAZEL	You could be an axe murderer.
GUS	There is that possibility.	Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.
HAZEL	Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're kidding right? (off his look) You just ruined the whole thing!
GUS	Whole thing?
HAZEL	What, you think that's cool? Oh you idiot! There's always a hamartia, isn't there? And yours is - even though you had FREAKING CANCER you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire EVEN MORE CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so well.
HAZEL	Let me tell you... not being able to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.
GUS	Hamartia?
HAZEL	A fatal flaw.
GUS	They don't hurt you unless you light them.
HAZEL	Sorry?
GUS	I've never lit one.
GUS	It's a metaphor. See? You put the thing that kills you between your teeth. But you don't give it the power to do the killing.
HAZEL	Metaphor.
FRANNIE	Hi sweetheart. Ready for some "Model?"
HAZEL	Can't tonight. (off her confused look) I've made plans with Augustus Waters.
GUS	I failed the test a couple times.
HAZEL	You don't say.
GUS	Most amputees can drive with no problem but... yeah. Not me.
HAZEL	I'm surprised you have a license.
GUS	Tell me about it!
GUS	The fourth time I took the test... it was going about how this is going... and when it was over, the instructor looks at me and goes, "your driving, while unpleasant... is not technically unsafe."
HAZEL	Aha. Cancer perk.
GUS	Total cancer perk.
GUS	So what happened to you?
HAZEL	I was 13 when they found it.
FRANNIE	(through the tears) Are you ready, sweetie?
HAZEL	Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly grown since...
HAZEL	Of course my lungs still suck but, theoretically, they could continue to suck in just this way for, I dunno, a while maybe.
GUS	Wow.
HAZEL	Yeah.
GUS	So are you back in school or...?
HAZEL	Can't.
GUS	Why not?
HAZEL	Got my GED.
GUS	A college girl! Well that explains the aura of sophistication...
GUS	We're here.
GUS	My parents call them "encouragements." (rolling his eyes) Don't ask.
GUS	Hey guys.
GUS'S MOM	Augustus, hi. New friend?
GUS	This is Hazel Grace.
HAZEL	It's just... Hazel.
GUS'S DAD	How's it going, Just Hazel?
GUS	Downstairs if you need us!
HAZEL	Nice to meet you!
GUS	I used to play.
HAZEL	Must have been pretty good.
GUS	These are mine. And these. The rest of it's just cancer perks.
HAZEL	Need to sit.
HAZEL	Don't get any ideas. (catching her breath) All that standing... and stairs... and then more standing... lotta standing for me.
GUS	I understand.
HAZEL	I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian lady, fainting-wise.
GUS	You ok?
GUS	So what's your story?
HAZEL	I already told you my story. I was
DIAGNOSED --
GUS	Not your cancer story. Your story. Interests, hobbies, passions, weird fetishes...
HAZEL	Um...
GUS	Don't tell me you're one of those people who becomes their disease.
HAZEL	No. I'm just... I don't know... un- extraordinary.
GUS	I reject that out of hand. (beat, Hazel shrugs) Think of something you love. First thing that comes to mind.
HAZEL	"An Imperial Affliction."
GUS	Ok. What's that?
HAZEL	It's a novel. My favorite novel.
GUS	Does it have zombies?
HAZEL	What? No.
GUS	Stormtroopers.
HAZEL	Seriously?	It's not that kind of book.
GUS	Sounds horrible.
HAZEL	It's not, it's... kind of my bible actually.
GUS	Interesting. What's it about?
HAZEL	Cancer. (off his look) But not in that way, trust me. The guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten, he's... well, the only person I've ever come across who seems to a) understand what it's like to be dying and b) not have died.
GUS	In that case... I am going to read this horrible book with the boring title that does not contain zombies or stormtroopers. And in exchange...
GUS	... all I ask is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game.
GUS	Your hands are cold.
HAZEL	Not so much cold as under- oxygenated.
GUS	Ooh Hazel Grace...	I love it when you talk medical to me.
FRANNIE	That's different.
FRANNIE	Did he give it to you?
HAZEL	By "it" do you mean herpes?
FRANNIE	I'm sure he'll call, don't worry.
HAZEL	I'm not worried. Please. It's not like I'm waiting for him to call or anything. I just... we hung out. No big deal.
MICHAEL	Would you like to be excused?
HAZEL	Welcome to the sweet torture of reading "An Imperial --"
HAZEL	What the -- are you ok?
GUS	I am, however, with Isaac.	Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse?
GUS	Isaac! Focus. On. Me.	How fast can you get here?
GUS	(calling to Isaac) Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is coming downstairs.
GUS	A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode.	You look nice, by the way.
HAZEL	How ya doing Isaac?
GUS	Seems Isaac and Monica are no longer a going concern.
HAZEL	Oh I'm sorry.	Do you want to talk about it?
GUS	He just wants to cry and play video games.
HAZEL	Fair enough.
GUS	It doesn't hurt to talk to him, however. If you have any sage words of feminine advice...
HAZEL	I actually think his response is appropriate.
GUS	"Pain demands to be felt."
HAZEL	(lights up at that) You're quoting my book!
ISAAC	She didn't want to do it after the surgery. Said she couldn't handle it. I'm about to lose my eyesight and she can't handle it.
ISAAC	I kept saying "always" to her. Always, always, always. And she just kept talking over me and not saying it back. It was like I was already gone, you know? "Always" was a promise! You can't break promises.
HAZEL	Sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them.
ISAAC	Right, sure, but you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.
GUS	That could be an "encouragement."
GUS	Isaac...?
GUS	Here we go...
GUS	That's it! Punch that thing.
GUS	I've been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis but I have been waiting until I could form a coherent thought in re: "An Imperial Affliction."	I can't stop thinking about it.
HAZEL	I know, right?
GUS	The only problem is the ending.
HAZEL	It is rather abrupt.
GUS	It's torture! I mean, I totally get that she died or whatever - Anna. But there is an unwritten contract between author and reader and I think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract.
HAZEL	But that's part of what I like about it. It portrays death truthfully. You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence. But I do - God, I do want to know what happens to everyone else.
GUS	Yeah like her Mom.
HAZEL	The Dutch Tulip Man...
GUS	Sysiphus the Hamster...
GUS	Have you tried contacting this... Peter Van Houten?
HAZEL	I've written letters. He's never responded. Apparently he moved to Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't published anything. Doesn't do interviews.
GUS	Sad.	Hang on. (turns to Isaac) Isaac!
GUS	Pillows don't break.
GUS	You need to break something.
GUS	Go to town, my friend.
GUS	I've been looking for a way to tell my Dad that I kinda hate basketball. Think maybe we've found it.
GUS	Feel better?
GUS	That's the thing about pain... it demands to be felt.
FRANNIE	Dr. Maria called today. The PET Scan is set for the eighth.
FRANNIE	I told you Support Group was a good idea.
MICHAEL	By all means.
GUS	Hazel Grace.
HAZEL	Hello Augustus.
GUS	So I read it again. And I just kept feeling like... like it was a gift. Like you'd given me something important.
HAZEL	You're welcome.
GUS	On the other hand... we need closure, don't we?
HAZEL	What we need is a sequel.
GUS	Yes. We need to know what happens to Anna's family after she dies.
HAZEL	That's what I kept asking Van Houten for in my letters.
GUS	But he never wrote back.
HAZEL	That's correct.
GUS	Because he's a recluse.
HAZEL	Yeee-up.
GUS	Utterly unreachable.
HAZEL	Unfortunately so.
GUS	"Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence received this 6th of April.
GUS	"I am grateful to anyone who sets aside the time to read my book..."
HAZEL	Augustus!?
GUS	I found his assistant. I emailed her. She must have forwarded it to him. (Hazel is stunned) Shall I continue?
HAZEL	Keep reading, keep reading!
GUS	"I am particularly indebted to you, sir, both for your kind words about `An Imperial Affliction' and for taking the time to tell me that the book, and here I quote you directly, `meant a great deal' to you."
GUS	"To answer your question: No, I have not written anything else, nor will I. I do not feel that continuing to share my thoughts with readers would benefit either them or me. However thank you again for your generous email. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten.
HAZEL	You're making this up?
GUS	Hazel Grace, could I, with my meager intellectual capabilities, make up a letter from the great Peter Van Houten?
HAZEL	Holy hell.
GUS	Indeed.
HAZEL	Can I... would you mind...
GUS	Go check your in-box.
FOLLOWING:"
HAZEL	"I know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions, but I would just really like to know."
HAZEL	(reading it aloud to him) "And of course, if ever you do decide to write anything else, even if you don't want to publish it, I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd read your grocery lists. Yours with great admiration, Hazel Grace Lancaster. Age 16."
GUS	Not bad.
HAZEL	You think?
GUS	Bit pretentious. But then again, Van Houten uses words like "tendentious" and... "bacchanalia" so I think he'll like it.
HAZEL	Is it really almost 1?
GUS	Guess so.
HAZEL	I gotta get to sleep.
GUS	Ok...
HAZEL	Ok...
GUS	Ok...
HAZEL	Ok...
GUS	Perhaps "ok" will be our "always."
HAZEL	Ok.
GUS	Ok.
HAZEL	Ok.
ISAAC	She hasn't even visited. Fourteen months we were together. What kind of person...
ISAAC'S NURSE	You'll get over her Isaac. Just takes a little time. You'll see.
ISAAC	Is she gone?
HAZEL	Yeah.
ISAAC	Did she really just say "you'll see?"
HAZEL	(shakes her head) Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go.
ISAAC	Doesn't pun your disability.
HAZEL	Gets blood on the first try.
ISAAC	That is huge. I mean, seriously, is this my freakin' arm or a dartboard? Three - no condescending voice.
HAZEL	(lays it on thick) "I'm gonna stab you with this needle now, so there might be a little ouchie."
HAZEL	You doing alright, Isaac?
ISAAC	I don't know. To be honest, I think a hell of a lot more about Monica than my eye. Is that crazy? That's crazy.
HAZEL	It's a little crazy.
ISAAC	But I believe in love, you know? I don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love. Don't you think?
ISAAC	Gus was here earlier.
HAZEL	(trying to be nonchalant) Was he?
ISAAC	Mmm... that's better.
HAZEL	The pain? (off his slow nod) Good. Good, Isaac. (Isaac closes his eyes) What about Gus?
HAZEL	Holy shit!	"Dear Ms. Lancaster... I cannot answer your questions, at least not in writing, because to do so would constitute a sequel, which you might publish or otherwise share on the internet. Not that I don't trust you, but how could I trust you, I barely know you."
HAZEL	"Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your leisure. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten" Son of a - WHAT
FRANNIE	What's wrong?!
HAZEL	(realizing she scared her) Nothing. Sorry.
FRANNIE	Nothing?
HAZEL	Everything! Look!
HAZEL	Can we go to Amsterdam? Please?
FRANNIE	Hazel, I... I love you and... you know I'd do anything for you, but we don't...	We don't have the money. The expense of getting equipment over there - love, it's just not possible...
HAZEL	No, yeah, of course.
FRANNIE	I mean, I could talk to your father
OR --
HAZEL	Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything. Forget I mentioned it.
GUS	Just use your wish.
HAZEL	I've used it already. Pre- "Miracle."
GUS	What'd you do?
GUS	Not Disney.
HAZEL	I was 13...
GUS	Tell me you did not go to Disney World. (Hazel looks away) Hazel Grace! You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World!
HAZEL	And Epcot Center.
GUS	(hands in the air) Oh my God!
HAZEL	We had fun on that trip.
GUS	That is the saddest thing I've ever heard!
HAZEL	I met Goofy...
GUS	Now I'm embarrassed.
HAZEL	Why are you embarrassed?
GUS	How can I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes?
HAZEL	Wait, what?
GUS	What?
MICHAEL	Is that a Rik Smits jersey?
GUS	It is indeed.
MICHAEL	Man, I loved that guy.
HAZEL	Gus?
GUS	Hi Hazel.	How would you like to go on a picnic?
FRANNIE	Something to drink?
GUS	I'm great Mrs. Lancaster.
MICHAEL	You're a survivor yourself?
GUS	(taps his leg) Didn't cut this fella off for the hell of it. Though it is an excellent weight-loss strategy. Legs are heavy!
MICHAEL	How's your health now?
GUS	N-E-C for fourteen months.
MICHAEL	That's fantastic.
GUS	I'm very lucky.
MICHAEL	Son, you have to understand... Hazel's still pretty sick. She will be the rest of her life.
MICHAEL	She'll want to keep up with you - she's that kind of girl - but the truth is, her lungs --
HAZEL	You ready Gus?
HAZEL	Is this where you bring all your romantic conquests?
GUS	Every last one.	Probably why I'm still a virgin.
HAZEL	You're not a virgin. (off his look) Are you really?
GUS	See this? This circle is virgins...
GUS	And this... is 17 year old dudes with one leg.
GUS	"Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout.
HAZEL	He sounds Dutch.
GUS	And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And tulips.
GUS	Sandwich?
HAZEL	Let me guess --
GUS	Dutch cheese. And tomato. (she takes one) The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry.
GUS	How cool is that? A skeleton being used as a playground.
HAZEL	You do love your symbols.
GUS	Speaking of which...
GUS	You're probably wondering why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey.
HAZEL	It has crossed my mind.
GUS	Hazel Grace, like so many before you - and I say this with great affection - you spent your Wish... moronically.
HAZEL	I was thir--
GUS	Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here.
HAZEL	Sorry. Please, continue...
GUS	You were young. Impressionable. The Grim Reaper staring you in the face. And the fear of dying with your one true Wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didn't really want, for how could little Hazel Grace, having never read "An Imperial Affliction" ever know that her one TRUE wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile.
GUS	If you were smart, you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self.
HAZEL	But I... didn't save it.
GUS	Good thing I saved mine.
GUS	Got it in exchange for the leg.	And I still have it.
HAZEL	Are you saying --
GUS	I'm not gonna give you my Wish or anything. But I too have an interest in meeting Peter Van Houten and it wouldn't make much sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book, now would it? (Hazel's eyes widen) I talked to the Genies and they're in total agreement.	We leave on May third.
HAZEL	Wait a minute.	Are you only doing this so I'll kiss you?
HAZEL	Cause I'd totally kiss you either way.
HAZEL	Seriously... why are you doing this?
GUS	Because Hazel Grace... I found my Wish.
FRANNIE	Are you out of your mind?
FRANNIE	It's too much, Haze. We can't accept something like that from a virtual stranger.
HAZEL	He's not a stranger.
FRANNIE	Really?
HAZEL	Don't be gross.
FRANNIE	It's still "no," I'm afraid.
HAZEL	Can we at least ask Dr. Maria?
HAZEL	You said the PET scan was encouraging!
HAZEL	They have doctors in Amsterdam. And cancer. Someone will know what to do.
HAZEL	(turns to her Mom) So you'll come too.
FRANNIE	What?
HAZEL	The Genies can hook it up. They're loaded.
FRANNIE
I --
HAZEL	You've never been to Amsterdam, have you Mom?
HAZEL'S NURSE	Hello.
HAZEL	Hi.
HAZEL'S NURSE	You're ok, Hazel.
HAZEL'S NURSE	Would you like to see your parents?
FRANNIE	They thought it was a brain tumor.
MICHAEL	It wasn't - thank god --
HAZEL	So what happened?
FRANNIE	The usual. Fluid in the lungs, preventing oxygenation. They put that in...
FRANNIE	Drained a liter and a half last night.
MICHAEL	The good news is... no tumor growth. No new tumors in your body.
MICHAEL	We're all so relieved.
FRANNIE	This is just a thing Hazel. It's a thing we can live with.
GUS	Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing?
MICHAEL	Better, thank you. Much better.
GUS	They won't let me in. Family only.
MICHAEL	I'm sorry --
GUS	No I get it. Will you just... will you tell her I was here?
MICHAEL	Of course I will.
MICHAEL	Gus.
MICHAEL	Why don't you go home, get some rest?
ONCOLOGIST #1	The great news is... Phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth.	The not so great news is we're still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation.	So how should we proceed?
HAZEL	Um, I feel like I'm not the most qualified person to answer that.
ONCOLOGIST #1	I was talking to Dr. Simmons.
MICHAEL	So we're gonna do nothing?
HAZEL	Can't I just get like a lung transplant or something?
FRANNIE	(through the tears) Are you ready, sweetie?
FRANNIE	I won't be a mom anymore.
HAZEL	I have a question.
HAZEL	Can I still go to Amsterdam?
HAZEL	Why not?
HAZEL	Why not, Dr. Simmons?
I --
HAZEL	So does going to the mall --
HAZEL	They have oxygen on airplanes.
FRANNIE
HAZEL --
HAZEL	It's my life, right?
HAZEL	I have this opportunity I may never have again. If the medicine's working, I don't see why --	Look, I don't know any other way to say this... You're just too sick.
FRANNIE	We'll be right outside.
MICHAEL	Gus again.
MICHAEL	I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep.
HAZEL	Hi Augustus.
HAZEL	Kind of.
HAZEL	I don't know. I want to go to Amsterdam. And I want him to tell us what happens after the book and I don't want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and there's this old swing set that my Dad made for me when I was a kid. It's just... everything.
GUS	I see your point.	That is one sad swing set.
HAZEL	Thanks for coming over.
GUS	You do realize... trying to keep your distance from me will in no way lessen my affection for you.
GUS	All efforts to save me from you will fail.
GUS	Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we
DON'T --
HAZEL	It's not about Amsterdam. It's about me. It's about...
GUS	Grenades.
GUS	I get it. One day you're going to explode in a huge ball of fire and everyone close to you will die in your wake.
HAZEL	Exactly.
GUS	There's already two people in your life you're going to destroy. Why add a third to that list. Am I right?
HAZEL	That's why I don't have a hamster.
GUS	We have got to do something about this frigging swing set.
HAZEL	"Swing Set Needs Home."
GUS	"Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home."
HAZEL	"Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks Butts of Children."
HAZEL	No?
GUS	That's why.
GUS	In case you were wondering... that's why I like you. (beat, off her look) You're so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.
GUS	Friendly.
ISAAC	Do you like him?
HAZEL	Of course I like him.
ISAAC	But you don't want to hook up with him?
HAZEL	It's complicated.
HAZEL	Mom?
HAZEL	Mom!
FRANNIE	What is it, what's wrong?!
HAZEL	Sorry, I... I didn't know you were in the shower.
FRANNIE	Bath. I was just... just trying to take a bath for five seconds. What's the matter?
HAZEL	Did you ever call the Genies to tell them the trip is off? I just got an email from Peter Van Houton's assistant. She still thinks we're coming.
HAZEL	What?
FRANNIE	I'm not supposed to tell you until your father gets home.	We're going to Amsterdam.
HAZEL	(still not believing) Really...
FRANNIE	Dr. Maria called last night and made a convincing case that you need to live --
HAZEL
FRANNIE	I'm getting back in the tub now.
HAZEL	(whispering to her lungs) One week, lungs. Keep your shit together one more week...
HAZEL	Amsterdam!
FRANNIE	Amsterdam!
MICHAEL	Amsterdam!
MICHAEL	I love you. I'm so proud of you.
HAZEL	For what?
HAZEL	Mom?
FRANNIE	We can't eavesdrop, Hazel.
GUS	Always a pleasure to see you ma'am.	Hello, Hazel Grace.
HAZEL	Ok...?
GUS	Ok.
HAZEL	Ok.
FRANNIE	Amsterdam!
HAZEL	(with some difficulty) Amsterdam!
HAZEL	Oh that's not necessary.
LITTLE GIRL	What's in your nose?
HAZEL	It's called a Cannula. These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe.
GIRL'S MOTHER	Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry.
HAZEL	No, no. It's alright.
LITTLE GIRL	Would they help me breathe too?
HAZEL	I dunno. Wanna try?
LITTLE GIRL	Tickles.
HAZEL	Right?
LITTLE GIRL	I think I'm breathing better.
HAZEL	Well... I'd love to give you my cannula but... I kinda really need the help.
LITTLE GIRL	Thanks for letting me try it.
HAZEL	I think that's us.
HAZEL	Have you never been on a plane before?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Sir, you can't smoke on this plane. Or... any plane.
GUS	(cigarette in his mouth) I don't smoke.
HAZEL	It's a metaphor. He puts the killing thing in his mouth but doesn't give it the power to kill him.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	That metaphor is prohibited on today's flight.
PA SYSTEM	"Flight attendants, prepare for departure."
HAZEL	Ok?
HAZEL	This is what it feels like to ride in a car with you.
GUS	We're flying! Look!
GUS	Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS
FRANNIE	(not looking up from her
MAGAZINE)	Just so you know, I'm right here. Sitting next to you. Your mother.
HAZEL	We're just friends, Mom.
GUS	She is. I'm not.
CAB DRIVER	Americans?
FRANNIE	We're from Indiana.
CAB DRIVER	Indiana. They steal from the Indians but the keep the name, yes?
HAZEL	Something like that.
HAZEL	(to the Driver) This is Amsterdam?
CAB DRIVER	Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the rings of a tree. It gets older as you get closer to the center.
GUS	I'll be right down the hall.
HAZEL	Good morning.
FRANNIE	Actually, it's five o'clock.
HAZEL	How was the park?
FRANNIE	Never made it.
HAZEL	Mom!
FRANNIE	What? I like watching you sleep.
FRANNIE	I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff tonight while you and Gus are at dinner.
HAZEL	What do you mean?
FRANNIE	You have reservations at a place called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set it up. Very fancy according to the Book. And romantic.
HAZEL	Mom...
FRANNIE	I'm just saying...
HAZEL	A 16 year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery... is totally cool with you. Is that what you're saying?
FRANNIE	(beat, excited) Let's get you dressed!
FRANNIE	(calling to the bathroom) Hazel! Gus is here.	Looking sharp.
GUS	Thank you ma'am.
GUS	Wow.
HAZEL	Am I under-dressed?
GUS	You look gorgeous.
HOSTESS	Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.
HOSTESS	The champagne is our gift.
GUS	Ok.
HAZEL	Ok.
HAZEL	Wow that's good.
WAITER	Do you know what Dom Perignon said after he invented champagne?	`Come quickly,' he said. `I am tasting the stars!'
WAITER	Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like a menu or will you have the chef's choice?
GUS	The chef's choice sounds lovely. (the Waiter nods) And can we get more of this?
WAITER	We have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends.
GUS	Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.
HAZEL	Thank you for letting me hijack your wish.
GUS	Thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa.
WAITER	Belgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion.
HAZEL	Oh my god.
GUS	Yeah?
HAZEL	I mean...
GUS	That is just...
HAZEL	There are no words.
GUS	We don't speak Dutch!
ANOTHER LOCAL	She says, "the beautiful couple is beautiful!"
GUS	I want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person so I can take it to Vegas and marry it.
HAZEL	I like your suit.
GUS	Thanks. First time wearing it.
HAZEL	That isn't the suit you wear to funerals?
GUS	Oh no. That one's not nearly this nice. (off her look) When I first found out I was sick - I mean, they told me I had like an 85% chance to be cancer-free. Great odds, sure. But that meant a year of torture, the loss of my leg, and still a 15% chance it might fail.	So right before the surgery I asked my parents if I could buy a suit, like a really nice suit, just in case I didn't make it.
HAZEL	It's your death suit.
GUS	That's what it is.
HAZEL	I have one of those. Bought it for my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd wear it on a date, though.
GUS	Are we on a date?
HAZEL	(cocks her head) Watch it.
GUS	God?
HAZEL	Maybe.
GUS	Angels?
HAZEL	Undecided.
GUS	Afterlife?
HAZEL	No. Well...	Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to say no. I just... I'd like some evidence.	What do you think?
GUS	Absolutely.
HAZEL	Really?
GUS	Oh for sure. I mean, not like a heaven where you ride unicorns, play harps, and live in a mansion made of clouds but, yeah, I believe in something.
GUS	Something becomes of us. It has to. Otherwise what's the point?
HAZEL	Maybe there is no point.
GUS	I refuse to accept that.	I won't accept it.
HAZEL	I hope you're right.
GUS	I'm in love with you.
GUS	You heard me.
HAZEL
AUGUSTUS --
GUS	I'm in love with you. And I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you. (shrugs, matter-of-fact) Sorry.
WAITER	More stars?
GUS	Just the check, please.
WAITER	No, sir.	Your meal has been paid for by Mr. Van Houten.
FRANNIE	I really don't get that shirt.
HAZEL	Van Houten will get it. Trust me. There are like fifty Magritte references in "Imperial Affliction."
FRANNIE	"This is not a pipe."
HAZEL	Exactly.
FRANNIE	But it is a pipe.
HAZEL	No it's not. It's a drawing of a pipe. See?	All representations of a thing are inherently abstract. A drawing of a thing is not the thing itself. Nor is a t-shirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself.
FRANNIE	When did you get so grown up? I feel like it was yesterday I was telling 8-year old Hazel why the sky was blue. You thought I was a genius back then.
HAZEL	Why is the sky blue?
FRANNIE	Because I say so.
GUS	Who's ready for some answers!
HAZEL	I'm so excited I can barely breathe.
GUS	As opposed to other days...?
GUS	Maybe he can't hear over the music?
GUS	Mr. Van Houten?	Who the hell's "they?"
VAN HOUTEN	Which of you is Augustus Waters?
LIDEWIJ	Please. I am sorry. Come in.
HAZEL	Trash?
LIDEWIJ	Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never opens it.
VAN HOUTEN	Yours are the first missives to which I've replied and look where that got me.
VAN HOUTEN	Scotch?
HAZEL	Um, no thanks.
VAN HOUTEN	Augustus Waters?
GUS	It's 11am.
VAN HOUTEN	Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and soda.
LIDEWIJ	Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?
VAN HOUTEN	She thinks I have a drinking problem.
LIDEWIJ	I also think the Earth is round.
VAN HOUTEN	So you like my book.
HAZEL	Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made meeting you his Wish so that we could come here and talk to you.
VAN HOUTEN	Did you dress like her on purpose?
HAZEL	(looks at her shirt) Kinda.
VAN HOUTEN	I do not have a drinking problem. I have a Churchillian relationship with alcohol: I can crack jokes and govern England and do anything I want to do. Except not drink.
GUS	Incidentally, thank you for dinner last night.
VAN HOUTEN	We bought them dinner last night?
LIDEWIJ	It was our pleasure.
VAN HOUTEN	You've come a long way so... what is it I can do for you?
HAZEL	We have some questions --
VAN HOUTEN	Uh-huh...
HAZEL	About what happens, you know... after... the end of your book. Specifically to those who Anna leaves behind. Like her Mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --
VAN HOUTEN	How familiar are you with Swedish hip-hop?
HAZEL	I would say... limited?
VAN HOUTEN	But presumably you know Afasi Och Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."
GUS	Um...
VAN HOUTEN	Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla' immediately.
HAZEL	(yelling over the music) I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak Swedish.
VAN HOUTEN	Who the hell speaks Swedish? The important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling.
GUS	Are you messing with us?
VAN HOUTEN	Pardon?
GUS	Is this some kind of performance?
VAN HOUTEN	Rudolf Otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you. And I say to you, my friends, if you cannot hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic response to fearfulness, then my work is not for you.
HAZEL	So anyway... when the book ends, Anna's mom --
VAN HOUTEN	(raising a hand to silence
HER)	Let us imagine that you are racing a tortoise.
VAN HOUTEN	The tortoise has a ten yard head start. In the time it takes you to run ten yards, the tortoise has moved maybe one yard. And so on, forever.
VAN HOUTEN	I assume that answers your questions.
GUS	I don't know what's going on.
VAN HOUTEN	And yet you seemed so intelligent in print, Mr. Waters. (under his breath) Must be all that cancer in your brain.
LIDEWIJ	Peter!
HAZEL	Can we please, maybe, talk about Anna for a sec? I mean, I understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue --
VAN HOUTEN	I'm not interested in talking about that book.
HAZEL	- but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right?
VAN HOUTEN	I said I'm not interested --
HAZEL	But you promised!
HAZEL	Mr. Van Houten, you said you would tell us what happens and that's why we're here. We... I need you tell me. Surely you've thought about it. I mean, as characters --
VAN HOUTEN	Nothing happens to them! They're fictions. They cease to exist the moment the novel is over.
HAZEL	They can't! (again, has to calm
HERSELF)	I mean, I understand. In a literary sense. But it's impossible NOT to imagine some future --
VAN HOUTEN	I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid of them, please. (Lidewij doesn't move, he turns back to Hazel) I won't indulge your childish whims. I refuse to pity you in the manner in which you're accustomed.
HAZEL	I don't want your pity --
VAN HOUTEN	Of course you do. Like all sick kids, your existence depends on it.
LIDEWIJ	Peter!
VAN HOUTEN	(on a roll) You are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed, the child who believes there is life after a novel ends. And we, as adults, we pity this, so we pay for your treatments, for your oxygen machines. We give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough --
LIDEWIJ
VAN HOUTEN	You are a side effect of an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives.
LIDEWIJ
HAZEL	Hey listen douchepants. You're not gonna tell me anything I don't already know about illness. I need one thing and one thing only from you before I walk out of your life and that's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters!
VAN HOUTEN	I cannot tell you.
HAZEL	Bullshit!
VAN HOUTEN	I cannot --
HAZEL	Make something up.
VAN HOUTEN	Lidewij. I'll have a martini please.
LIDEWIJ	I have resigned.
VAN HOUTEN	Oh don't be ridiculous.
VAN HOUTEN	I'd like you to leave now.
HAZEL	You're really not gonna tell us?
VAN HOUTEN	I would like you... to leave.
VAN HOUTEN	Have you ever stopped to ask why you care so much about your silly questions?
HAZEL	Go fuck yourself.
GUS	Hey. It's ok. It's ok... (beat, an idea) I'll write you a sequel. (she cries harder) I will. Better than any shit that drunk could write. With blood and guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.
HAZEL	I spent your Wish on that asshole.
GUS	You did not spend it on him. You spent it on us.
HAZEL	I wanted...
GUS	I know... I know. Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory.
LIDEWIJ	I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made him cruel. I thought meeting you would help him, if he would see that his work has shaped real lives, but... I'm very sorry.
LIDEWIJ	Perhaps we can do some sightseeing. Have you seen the Anne Frank House?
GUS	I'm not going anywhere with that monster.
LIDEWIJ	He is not invited.
LIDEWIJ	I'm afraid there's no elevator.
HAZEL	Oh, um, that's alright.
LIDEWIJ	No, there are many stairs. Steep stairs.
HAZEL	I can do it.
GUS
HAZEL --
HAZEL	I can do it!
LIDEWIJ	Shall we?
LIDEWIJ	This is the bookcase that hid the Frank family and four others.
GUS	You're a champion.
GUS	That's enough --
HAZEL	I'm ok.
GUS	We're at the top. That's it.
LIDEWIJ	The only member of the whole family to survive was Otto, Anne's father.
LIDEWIJ	I don't know how you go on, without your family.
GUS	It's above my knee.
GUS	It tapers a little and then it's just skin --
HAZEL	What?
GUS	My leg.	Just so you're prepared --
HAZEL	Oh get over yourself.
HAZEL	I love you, Augustus Waters.
GUS	I love you too, Hazel Grace.
HAZEL	"Get up you fat bastard."
GUS	"I can't stand up, I'm too drunk."
HAZEL	I said "get up."
GUS	"Standing is for fools!"
HAZEL	God, what an asshole.
HAZEL	It was awful, Mom. You can't imagine.
FRANNIE	And then what happened?
HAZEL	Then we went to the Anne Frank museum.
FRANNIE	And after that?
HAZEL	We just... walked around.
FRANNIE	Sounds lovely.
FRANNIE	Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs a little. Give the two of you some time to talk.
HAZEL	Um... ok...
HAZEL	That was weird.
GUS	Shall we?
HAZEL	Augustus?
GUS	There's something I have to tell you...
GUS	Just before you went into the hospital... There was this... I felt this... ache in my hip.
HAZEL	Oh no...
GUS	I had a PET scan.
GUS	It lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel...
HAZEL	Oh god.
GUS	The lining of my chest, my liver... everywhere.
HAZEL	Oh my god no!
HAZEL	I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so
SORRY --
GUS	I'm sorry too --
HAZEL	It's so unfair --
GUS	I should have told you --
HAZEL	It's so fucking unfair!
GUS	Apparently the world is... not a wish-granting factory.
GUS	Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time.
HAZEL	Does it hurt?
GUS	It's ok.	I'm ok.
HAZEL	Ok.
GUS	Ok.
GUS	What?
HAZEL	I'm just... I'm very fond of you.
GUS	I don't suppose you can forget about it, treat me like I'm not dying.
HAZEL	I don't think you're dying, Augustus. You've just got a touch of cancer.
GUS	Would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now?
HAZEL	Gus had a recurrence.
MICHAEL	Mrs. Waters told us the night before you left.	I'm sorry Hazel.
HAZEL	You're not gonna say it?
MICHAEL	What's that?
HAZEL	The usual. "Everything happens for a reason..."
MICHAEL	I don't know, Haze.	I always thought being an adult meant knowing what you believe...	... that has not been my experience.
HAZEL	How are your eyes?
ISAAC	Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're not in my head is the only problem.
GUS	I hate to one-up you but... seems my entire body is made out of cancer now, so...
GUS	Whoa, I'm taken.
ISAAC	(to Hazel, re: Gus) Did you write his eulogy yet?
GUS	Dude.
ISAAC	What?
GUS	I haven't asked her.
ISAAC	Oh.	Oops.
HAZEL	What are you talking about?
ISAAC	My bad.
HAZEL	Augustus?
GUS	I need speakers at my funeral. I thought maybe you and Isaac... but especially you --
ISAAC	Hey!
GUS	Would you be kind enough to whip something up?
HAZEL	(touches his hand) It would be an honor.
ISAAC	You guys are adorable.
HAZEL	How's your love life? Anything from Monica?
ISAAC	Not a word.
HAZEL	She hasn't even like, texted to ask how you're doing?
HAZEL	That is so messed up!
ISAAC	I've stopped thinking about it. Moving on. There's a new girl in Support Group with these humongous -
HAZEL	How do you even know that?
ISAAC	I'm blind but I'm not that blind.
GUS	Hazel Grace!
GUS	Do you happen to have four dollars?
HAZEL	Ok now what?
ISAAC	Is it there?
GUS	Oh it's there.
ISAAC	She's in the house?
GUS	Who cares where she is? This is not about her. This is about you. (sticks out his hand) Hazel...
ISAAC	I didn't hear anything.
GUS	A little to the left.
ISAAC	My throw was to the left or I should aim to the left?
GUS	Aim left.
GUS	Lefter.
GUS	Yes! Excellent! And throw hard.
GUS	Bullseye!
ISAAC	Really?
GUS	No you missed it by like 20 feet. (hands him a THIRD) Try one more time.
HAZEL	Woo hoo!
GUS	Keep throwing, keep throwing!
MONICA'S MOM	What in God's name --
GUS	Are you Monica's mom?
MONICA'S MOM	I am.
GUS	Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done an injustice and we've come here seeking revenge. We may not look like much. Between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes, and two and a half working lungs.
GUS	But we also have two dozen eggs. So If I was you, I would go back inside.
HAZEL	How's he doing?
HAZEL	What about the chemo?
HAZEL	Can I see him?	We have to be a family now.
HAZEL	If you don't mind, I'll just hang for a while.
HAZEL	What are you thinking about?
GUS	Oblivion.
HAZEL	Augustus...
GUS	I know it's kid's stuff but... I always thought I'd have a grand story to tell, you know? Something that would run in all the papers. I always thought I was special.
HAZEL	You are.
GUS	Yeah but... you know what I mean.
GUS	What?
HAZEL	I do know what you mean, I just... I don't agree.
HAZEL	This obsession with being
REMEMBERED --
GUS	Don't get mad --
HAZEL	But I am mad!	I think you're special, is that not enough?
GUS
HAZEL --
HAZEL	You think the only way to live a meaningful life is for everyone to love you, for everyone to remember you. Well guess what, Gus, this is your life. This is all you get. You get me, and your family, and this world. And if that's not enough, well I'm sorry, but it's not nothing. Cause I'll remember you, I'll love you --
GUS	You're right --
HAZEL	And I just wish... I just wish you'd be happy with that.
GUS	You're right. I'm sorry. (pulling her back down) I'm sorry.
GUS	It's a good life, Hazel Grace.
HAZEL	It's not over yet, you know.
HAZEL	Hello?	Hazel Grace.
HAZEL	Oh, thank God. Hi. Hi, I love you!
HAZEL	What?
GUS	Hi.
HAZEL	Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911.
GUS	No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do not call 911 or my parents -- I'll never forgive you -- Don't, please.
GUS	Please just look at it.
HAZEL	I think it's infected...
HAZEL	Gus, what the -- why are you here? Why aren't you home?
HAZEL	Oh, sweetie...
GUS	I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I lost my pack. Or they took it.
GUS	I don't know. They said they'd get me another one but I wanted... to do it myself. Do one little thing myself.
HAZEL	I can't fix this. I have to call someone. I'm sorry.
GUS	No, Hazel, please!
GUS	(to himself, shaking) I hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this...
GUS	Read me something.
HAZEL	Read you something?
GUS	Do you know any poems?
HAZEL	I know one.
GUS	Read it to me.
HAZEL	"The Red Wheelbarrow" by William Carlos Williams. (beat, tries to remember) "So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens."
GUS	Is that it?
HAZEL	No of course not. Um... what else...	so much depends/ upon a blue sky/ cut open by the branches/ of the trees./ So much depends/ on the transparent G-tube/ erupting from the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy.
HAZEL	So much depends upon this observer/ of the universe...
HAZEL	Hi, Augustus.
HAZEL	I may have...
GUS	Excellent. Do you think you could find yourself at the Literal Heart of Jesus in 20 minutes.
HAZEL	Um... sure. Is everything --
HAZEL	I gotta go.
FRANNIE	Finish eating first.
HAZEL	I can't, I have to meet Gus.
FRANNIE	You haven't eaten a thing.
HAZEL	I'm not hungry.
FRANNIE	You can't not eat, Hazel.
HAZEL	I am aggressively unhungry, ok?
MICHAEL
HAZEL --
HAZEL	I have to go.
FRANNIE	Sit down.
HAZEL	No!
MICHAEL	Hazel, listen to your mother.
FRANNIE	You have to eat, Hazel. You're not gonna starve yourself to death just because Gus is sick. You have to stay healthy --
HAZEL	I can't! I can't stay healthy because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am dying. I am going to die and leave you here alone and you won't have me to hover around and you won't be a mother anymore, and I'm sorry, but I can't do anything about it, ok?! Just leave me alone!
FRANNIE	You heard me?
FRANNIE	You heard me say that to your father?
FRANNIE	Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not something I believe.
FRANNIE	As long as either of us is alive, I will be your mother. Even if you die, I --
HAZEL	When.
FRANNIE	Even when you die, I will still be your mother. I will always be your Mother.
HAZEL	I worry that you won't have a life. That you'll sit around all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and be miserable or off yourselves or something.
FRANNIE	We're not gonna off ourselves. It's gonna hurt like hell to lose you
BUT --
MICHAEL	Hazel. You of all people know it's possible to live with pain.
FRANNIE	I don't just sit around, you know.
FRANNIE	I'm taking some classes. Online. To get my master's in social work.
HAZEL	You are?
HAZEL	So when you're waiting for me outside Support Group or whatever, you're always --
FRANNIE	Working or reading. If I get my MSW, I can council families in crisis or lead groups dealing with
ILLNESS --
HAZEL	Why didn't you tell me?
MICHAEL	We didn't want you to feel
ABANDONED --
HAZEL	Are you kidding? Mom, this is awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my god!
HAZEL	I'm so excited! You're gonna be so great, Mom!
FRANNIE	Thank you. That means everything to me.
FRANNIE	I'd still really like you to eat.
HAZEL	I know Mom. And I will. I promise. But right now... I really gotta go.
GUS	Hazel Grace, you look ravishing.
HAZEL	I know, right?	So, um, what's going on guys?
ISAAC	You're late.
HAZEL	Late for what exactly?
GUS	I wanted to attend my funeral. By the way, will you speak at my funeral?
GUS	Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure, I thought I'd - well, not to put you on the spot, but I thought I'd arrange a pre-funeral.
HAZEL	Why now?
GUS	No time like the present.
HAZEL	(looks around the room) How did you even get in here?
GUS	Would you believe they leave the door open at night?
HAZEL	Um, no.
GUS	As well you shouldn't.
ISAAC	"Augustus Waters was a self- aggrandizing bastard. But we forgive him. We forgive him... not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked, or because he got 18 years when he should have gotten more."
GUS
ISAAC	I'm assuming you've got some time, you interrupting bastard! I mean seriously... (back to the speech) "Augustus Waters talked so much that he'd interrupt you at his own funeral. And he was pretentious.
ISAAC	Sweet Jesus that kid never took a piss without pondering the resonances of human waste production. And he was vain. But that comes with superhuman handsomeness."
ISAAC	"But I will say this: when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to piss off, because I don't even want to see a world without Augustus Waters."
ISAAC	"And then, of course, having made my rhetorical point, I will put my robot eyes on because, I mean... robot eyes!"
ISAAC	"So anyway, Augustus, my friend... Godspeed."
GUS	Thank you Isaac.
ISAAC	Goddamn it, Gus.
GUS	Hey don't swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus.
ISAAC	Shit! Ass! Balls!
ISAAC	Can I get a hand here, Hazel?
GUS	Hazel Grace, it's down to you.
HAZEL	"Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears.	Like all real love stories - ours will die with us, as it should. I'd hoped that he'd be eulogizing me, because there's no one I'd rather have..."
HAZEL	(beat, composing herself) "I can't talk about our love story so instead I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 And .12 And .112 And an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that I am eternally grateful. I love you."
HAZEL	He loved you so much too.
HAZEL	It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.
MINISTER	I think we're ready to begin.
MINISTER	Augustus Waters fought hard for many years. His battle was a courageous one and his strength was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us...
MALE VOICE	What a load of shit, eh kid?
MINISTER	Let us pray.
VAN HOUTEN	We need to fake pray now.
MINISTER	Now I call on Augustus's close friend Isaac to say a few words.
ISAAC	Of all the things I've lost in my life, this hurts the most.
MINISTER	And now we'll hear from Gus's... special friend Hazel Lancaster.
HAZEL	I was his girlfriend.
HAZEL	There's a beautiful quote in Gus's home that reads "if you want the rainbow, you gotta deal with the rain."
HAZEL	I'll be fine.
FRANNIE	Are you sure? We can drive you --
HAZEL	No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for a while.
VAN HOUTEN	Could I hitch a ride?
VAN HOUTEN	Just to the bottom of the hill.
HAZEL	How did you even --
VAN HOUTEN	The internet.
HAZEL	And you just... bought a ticket?
VAN HOUTEN	The drinks are free drinks in First Class.
VAN HOUTEN	Omnis Cellula e cellula.
VAN HOUTEN	Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite a bit in his last --
HAZEL	You read your fan mail now?
VAN HOUTEN	I would hardly call him a fan. He despised me. But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral and tell you what became of Anna and her mother. So here I am and that's your answer: omnis cellula e cellula.
HAZEL	I'm so not in the mood --
VAN HOUTEN	"Life comes from life."
HAZEL	Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.
VAN HOUTEN	You don't want an explanation?
HAZEL	Nope. Thanks though. Have a great life.
VAN HOUTEN	You remind me of her.
HAZEL	I remind a lot of people of a lot of people.
VAN HOUTEN	She was eight, my daughter. She suffered... beautifully. For so long.
HAZEL	She had leukemia? Like Anna?
VAN HOUTEN	Just like her, yes.
HAZEL	Were you married then?
VAN HOUTEN	Not when she died, no. I was insufferable long before Anna, my dear. Grief doesn't change you, Hazel, it reveals you.
HAZEL	Well I'm sorry for your loss.
VAN HOUTEN	And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry for everything, for being so rude to you two, for ruining your trip --
HAZEL	You didn't ruin our trip, you asshole. We had an awesome trip.
VAN HOUTEN	Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You asked me to tell you what happens and I wish I could do that. I wish that I could. But I can't. No one can. No one knows, Hazel. They don't talk to us. Unless...
HAZEL	You think I care about that? I don't give a shit, Van Houten.
HAZEL	You're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. And I'd like you to get out of my car right now so I can go home and grieve.
VAN HOUTEN
BUT --
HAZEL	Get out of the car!
HAZEL	Occupada.
MICHAEL	I'm so so sorry.	It was a privilege to love him, though, wasn't it?
MICHAEL	Gives you an idea how we feel about you.
ISAAC	Do you know if it hurt or whatever?
HAZEL	He was really fighting for breath, I guess. He eventually went unconscious, but it seems like, yeah, it wasn't great or anything. Dying sucks.
ISAAC	It just seems so impossible.
HAZEL	Happens all the time.
ISAAC	Are you angry?
HAZEL	Very.
ISAAC	Me too. (a few beats) Gus really loved you, you know.
HAZEL	I know.
ISAAC	He wouldn't shut up about it.
HAZEL	I know.
ISAAC	It was annoying.
HAZEL	I didn't find it that annoying.
ISAAC	Did you read the note or whatever from your author friend?
HAZEL	He is not my friend and -- how do you know about that?
ISAAC	We talked at the cemetery. Said he came all this way to give you that.
HAZEL	Yeah well I'm over it. I never want to read another word of that asshole's again.
ISAAC	Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus did.
HAZEL	What?
ISAAC	That's what he said. Gus had written something, sent it to Van
HOUTEN --
ISAAC	What?
HAZEL	I... I have to go. I... Are you...?
ISAAC	I do it all the time. Go.
GUS'S VOICE	Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person but a shitty writer. You're a shitty person but a good writer. We'd make a good team. I don't want to ask you any favors but if you have the time, and from what I saw you have plenty, please fix this for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.
GUS'S VOICE	She asked me to write one and I'm trying, I just, I could use a little flair. See the thing is... we all want to be remembered.
GUS'S VOICE	We all want to leave a mark.
GUS'S VOICE	But not Hazel. Hazel is different. Hazel knows the truth. She didn't want a million admirers, she just wanted one. And she got it. Maybe she wasn't loved widely but she was loved deeply. And isn't that more than most of us get?
GUS'S VOICE	When Hazel was sick, I knew I was dying. But I didn't want to say so.
GUS'S VOICE	She was in ICU and I snuck in for ten minutes and sat with her before I got caught. Her eyes were closed, her lungs were intubated...
GUS'S VOICE	... but her hands were still her hands, still warm, and the nails painted this dark blue back color and I just held her hands and I willed myself to imagine a world without us and what a worthless world that would be.
GUS'S VOICE	She's so beautiful. You don't get tired of looking at her. You never worry if she's smarter than you cause you know she is. She's funny without ever being mean.
GUS'S VOICE	I love her, god I love her. I'm so lucky to love her, Van Houten.
GUS'S VOICE	I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.
GUS'S VOICE	Ok, Hazel Grace?
HAZEL	Ok.
