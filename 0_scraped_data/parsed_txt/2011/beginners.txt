ANDY	Okay. Is it on? (recorder)
OLIVER	Yeah yeah.
ANDY	This is for our friend Hal Fields. Hal. We love you.
OLIVER	You're coming to live with me now.
OLIVER	This is my car.
OLIVER	This is the dining room where people come and eat sometimes.
OLIVER	This is the living room.
OLIVER	That's the bathroom.
OLIVER	He was a museum director - she fixed up old houses.
OLIVER	They had a child, and they stayed married for 44 years...
HAL	I'm gay.
HAL	I'm gay.
HAL	I'm gay.
HAL	I loved your mother, but, uh... now I want to explore this side.
HAL	I don't want to be just theoretically gay, I want to do something about it.
HAL	...I want to do something about it...
HAL	...I want to do something about it.
ANDY	Since I came out to my father, he never speaks to me. That's why I've been always attracted to older men.
OLIVER	Look, its lonely out here, so you'd better learn how to talk with me.
ARTHUR SUBTITLE	While I understand up to 150 words - I don't talk.
OLIVER	I know. I know.
OLIVER	Calm. Calm, calm breaths.
HAL	Oliver! Please help me with all these ropes.
OLIVER	Pop, Pop, stop -- you're gonna hurt yourself.
NURSE	Mr. Fields, we're going to have to secure your arms again.
HAL	You two married?
OLIVER	No, Pop.
HAL	Why not? She's great.
OLIVER	She's a great nurse in the hospital, we don't really know her, you're very high on drugs.
HAL	You always have some very good reason, haven't you?
OLIVER	No, Pop, I just don't want to be like you and mom. (aside to the nurse) Thank you...
GEORGIA	Oliver!
GEORGIA	Olly, you can do better.
GEORGIA	That's good.
OLIVER	Go have your own experiences with your own people. I'll be right here...
OLIVER	I'm a human. I'm not a dog. And you're a Jack Russell, that's a breed. Your personality was created by this guy John Russell, a hunting enthusiast, in the 1800s. And he bred your ancestors to have stamina and courage for the hunt. You think you're just you, and you want to chase the foxes, but other people planted that in you years ago.
OLIVER	Now, somewhat arbitrarily, you are considered very cute by us humans, and we keep breeding you not to chase foxes, but to be cute, and we put you in movies and television shows, and you, you're chasing tennis balls cause there as close to a fox as you're going to get.
OLIVER	Want me to read this? I found it in your books.
HAL	Yeah, alright. Give me the flashlight.
OLIVER	Nice.
HAL	Oh, that's nice.
OLIVER	Oh, Andy brought those for you.
HAL	Oh, yeah?
HAL	Oh, who did that painting?
OLIVER	Well, I don't know. Its just a painting on the wall.
HAL	A--, and these?
OLIVER	They're just photos, Pop.
HAL	But how do they relate to the exhibit?
OLIVER	They're just personal photos. They're not art.
OLIVER	Uh, well that's the water sprinkler thing.
HAL	Well, its beautiful.
OLIVER	What is?
HAL	Putting the Japanese gardens there. It's just beautiful.
ANDY	Hal.
HAL	Andy!
ANDY	I brought something for you.
ANDY	We made a recording for you.
HAL	Oh, God.
OLIVER	Jesus, Liz. Another band that wants portraits.
LIZ	Well, at least it pays the rent.
OLIVER	You do something decent once, and that's all people ever want.
ELLIOTT	Hi Liz.
ELLIOTT	Oliver?
OLIVER	Yeah?
ELLIOTT	The pen is not your friend. The paper is not your friend. The party is your friend. We're your friends. Your friends are your friends.
SHAUNA	I got the skills... he's got the moves...
ELLIOTT	I got the moves... you've got the skills...
OLIVER	Arthur, you haven't been invited to this party. You're gonna stay and look after the house.
ELLIOTT	You remember when Oliver was funny? And he could actually, like, talk, in complete sentences?
SHAUNA	Funny? Funny? I don't think so Fun maybe, but not funny unless, like, serious is funny. Then he's' fucking hilarious.
SHAUNA	But, lovable. You are very lovable.
ELLIOTT	Yeah, very lovable.
FEMALE PARTIER	So cute, does he do tricks?
OLIVER	His name's Arthur - he doesn't do tricks.
PARTIER	No? Arthur, SIT!
PARTIER	He's so cute. Shake!
PARTIER	Oh my god, he's so cute, I want him.
OLIVER	(in Freud accent) Does it make you feel powerful to order my dog around? Maybe give you a sense of power?
PARTIER	Oh, you're being a therapist! Freud!
OLIVER	Thanks, yeah. Very good.
LONG-HAIRED MAN	Well, I didn't ask for this. Who would ask for this? This color. This nose. This cheek, this chin. You know, this is my life. This isn't a story. This isn't a joke...
OLIVER	Yeah.
LONG-HAIRED MAN	I'm so glad you came, Doc. Just really good to get this stuff off my chest.
OLIVER	(in Freud accent) I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh... for this week. Thank you for coming in.
OLIVER	(back in accent) Well, I guess we should start with your mother.
OLIVER	Well then your father.
OLIVER	I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis?
OLIVER	That's a physical problem.
OLIVER	I was doing such a good job of hiding it. How could you tell?
OLIVER	Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink. You?
OLIVER	You, stay here, yeah?
ELLIOTT	No, its just not a natural color for a chicken.
SHAUNA	No.
ELLIOTT	(motioning to Shauna's
COSTUME)	And look, you see what happens when you free yourself from the cage, walk away from the factory.
SHAUNA	You just have no real color.
YOU'RE LIKE--
ELLIOTT	Hey, hey.
SHAUNA	Uh-oh, one. Uh-oh, two.
ELLIOTT	Two drinks.
SHAUNA	What does that me--, one, two.
ELLIOTT	Well that's two, two people.
SHAUNA	Two people. A girl and a guy?
ELLIOTT	Hopefully.
SHAUNA	Yeah, wow, making moves.
OLIVER	Watch him OK?
OLIVER	Hello?
HAL	Oliver?
OLIVER	Yeah.
HAL	I'm not sorry I woke you! I went to Akbar tonight.
OLIVER	You did?
HAL	"House music."
OLIVER	Would you like to dance?
OLIVER	Hello...
OLIVER	Can I give you my number?
OLIVER	Thanks.
ARTHUR SUBTITLE	Tell her the darkness is about to drown us unless something drastic happens right now.
OLIVER	I feel bad dragging Arthur to the party. I should get home. It was really nice meeting you.
OLIVER	Au revoir. Yeah.
OLIVER	Hello?
OLIVER	Is that you?
OLIVER	One beep means yes?
OLIVER	I've always wanted to have a phone call with someone who doesn't talk...
OLIVER	You want to do something?
OLIVER	Now?
OLIVER	Okay, I'm parked just right up the street.
OLIVER	Okay. You point - I'll drive.
OLIVER	This way?
OLIVER	Nice place.
OLIVER	Oh, my mother. My mother died five years ago.
ANNA	(in a hoarse whisper) Oh merd.
OLIVER	Oh, you spoke.
ANNA	I'm not supposed to.
OLIVER	My father died two months ago, almost three.
OLIVER	He, he was gay.
OLIVER	He was gay the whole time they were married.
OLIVER	He came out after my mother died and, uh... he was 75 years old.
OLIVER	Sorry.
ANNA	Can we just sleep?
OLIVER	Sure, sure.
OLIVER	Oliver.
OLIVER	How long are you here when you get back?
OLIVER	A year?
OLIVER	A month? Right. And then?...
OLIVER	You're filming here. Acting.
OLIVER	And after?...
OLIVER	Just somewhere else. Where?
OLIVER	Yes.
OLIVER	Hello house, (Low voice) hello Oliver.
OLIVER	Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail.
HAL	But...?
DOCTOR LONG	The bronchoscopy revealed a mass about the size of a quarter. It is located in your lower right lung.
HAL	Uh-huh. I see.
DOCTOR LONG	It appears to have spread... to the large hilar lymph nodes in your chest and liver.
DOCTOR LONG	Do you have any questions?
HAL	No. Thank you.
OLIVER	I'm sorry.
HAL	Well, let's not rush out and tell everyone.
OLIVER	Andy?
HAL	No need to get him up a tree.
HAL	Can you read me something?
OLIVER	The Brazilian ballet star is already known not only as a skilled partner, but also as a gifted and versatile dancer, who adeptly fields roles ranging...
HAL	But is he eating?
OLIVER	Yeah, yeah, he's eating.
HAL	Oh God, I worry so much about--
HAL	Oh here we are...
HAL	What have you got in there?
ANDY	A slug.
HAL	Oh, Andy, you can't bring that kind of thing in here.
ANDY	Oh I can look.
HAL	Fuck you.
HAL	It's time for inspection...
NURSE	Hello, Mr. Fields.
HAL	Hello.
ANDY	I'm Andy. Hal's boyfriend
NURSE	I'm Sophia.
ANDY	You know, I have the right to be here as much as anyone else.
HAL	Go take a walk. Calm yourself.
OLIVER	What was all that?
HAL	Oh, Andy hasn't had it easy. Be nice to him.
HAL	(knowing he stole them) Andy, where did you get these?
ANDY	Guys, guys, this is to us. Cheers.
STRICT NURSE	Drinking's not allowed in the room.
HAL	Oh, it's not?
OLIVER	I'm sorry.
HAL	No, no, no. She's a wonderful nurse. (he pauses a beat, then raises his cup again) Here's to health care.
EVERYONE	To health care!
OLIVER	What did you do with my father? He was so polite.
HAL	Oh, I invited him - but he never returns my calls.
OLIVER	Two, four, six, eight...
ELLIOTT	That's it? That's all you're gonna tell me?
OLIVER	I'm gonna meet her at her hotel again. You happy?
ELLIOTT	Yeah, I'm very happy. Are you happy?
OLIVER	(to shop owner) Here's eight...
OLIVER	We haven't actually had a conversation yet, so, you know...
ELLIOTT	You're thinking about her all the time.
OLIVER	And you know that because?
ELLIOTT	Because you're not talking about it. I know you.
OLIVER	It's true. It's embarrassing. I'm 38 and falling for a girl again...
YOUNG OLIVER	Where's Pop?
GEORGIA	At the museum.
YOUNG OLIVER	Is something wrong with you guys?
GEORGIA	What're you, in the FBI?
YOUNG OLIVER	No.
GEORGIA	The CIA?
YOUNG OLIVER	No.
GEORGIA	KGB? (Oliver shakes his head, no) SLA? (no) PTA? (no) BMW?
GEORGIA	There is nothing wrong with me and Pop.
GEORGIA	C'mon.
GEORGIA	When you feel bad, you go into a room and scream - loud as you want, for a minute or two, then it's out of you. It's called catharsis.
OLIVER	I don't feel like screaming...
GEORGIA	You will...
OLIVER	What the fuck is that?
ELLIOTT	L-E-IT, Elliot
OLIVER	Well, that's ridiculous.
ELLIOTT	I know! (Getting his criticism more) You're not very supportive.
OLIVER	Well, its just copying something someone did, like, 30 years ago in the Bronx.
ELLIOTT	Well yeah. I'm part of a tradition of civil disobedience, something bigger than myself.
OLIVER	How does it work?
ELLIOTT	Shake it, you have to shake it.
ELLIOTT	What was that?
OLIVER	Historical consciousness... you know, something bigger than myself.
OLIVER	Let's do it again.
ANNA	He's sweet. He misses your Dad.
OLIVER	Maybe we, we could, um, just talk for a second.
ANNA	Right.
ANNA	Well, my name is Anna. You're worried you can't trust me because you don't know who I am. I get it. That makes sense to me.
GEORGIA	Oliver, stop it.
OLIVER	This music's old.
GEORGIA	It's black, black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most, them and the Jews.
GEORGIA	In my next life I'm gonna marry a good hot blooded Jew - someone full of emotion.
OLIVER	I'm Jewish right?
GEORGIA AT 50	You're a quarter, I'm a half, your father's none. He has the least emotions, You'll have more emotions than him, but I'll have the most emotions.
GEORGIA AT 50	You get to play chauffeur but just to the bottom of the hill.
GEORGIA	You're turning into a wonderful driver.
SECURITY GUARD	Excuse me Mrs. Fields....
GEORGIA	What? You're not allowed to interact with the art?
SECURITY GUARD	It's just that...
OLIVER	C'mon.
GEORGIA	You too? You like being a good citizen?
OLIVER	No.
ANNA	Can you toss me my camisole.
ANNA	No, my camisole.
OLIVER	Camisole?
ANNA	You don't know what a camisole is?
OLIVER	I was brought up by these animals and they didn't like questions.
OLIVER	They were very frowned upon. So I had to guess.
ANNA	You can ask me anything.
OLIVER	Anything?
OLIVER	What's out there?
ANNA	That's a tree.
OLIVER	Yeah.
ANNA	And cars.
OLIVER	Uh-huh.
ANNA	Another building like this one.
OLIVER	Right.
ANNA	People in the building like us. Half of them think things will never work out. The other half believe in magic. It's like a war between them.
OLIVER	How do you know so much about people?
ANNA	Oh. Well, you have to learn how to read their faces.
ANNA	For example... here is mad.
ANNA	Happy...
ANNA	Sometimes its just nothing.
OLIVER	Oh yeah?
ANNA	This is nothing... And they are good at looking one way and being another way.
OLIVER	Okay, open your eyes...
ARTHUR SUBTITLE	She's unlike any girl I've ever met.
OLIVER	Someone flashy walks into your life and you're just gonna fall for it?
ARTHUR SUBTITLE	Are we married yet?
OLIVER	No, uh, it doesn't work like that. There are other steps, it's complicated.
ARTHUR SUBTITLE	I hope this feeling lasts.
HAL	What happened with Michelle?
OLIVER	You know... I don't know.
HAL	She seemed great.
OLIVER	She was great.
HAL	Maybe you should take out a personal ad, where you explain your situation?
OLIVER	My situation?
HAL	Yeah, I mean, you want to be in a relationship but you can't stay in one.
OLIVER	That's your fatherly advice? Personal ads?
HAL	Well, a lot of people use them... I did.
OLIVER	What?
HAL	If Andy wasn't going to be monogamous, why should I be?
OLIVER	Jesus, Pop.
HAL	Jesus yourself.
HAL	Hello house (Answers back in deep voice) Hello Hal.
HAL	Oh God, what have you got this time?
ANDY	It's a green caterpillar.
HAL	No, no, no, you don't have a green caterpillar.
ANDY	Oh yeah I do.
HAL	Oh my God. Gross! Oh, Jesus...
HAL	Hey, you going?
ANDY	Yeah, Michael's in town.
HAL	Oh. Right.
OLIVER	I thought he was your boyfriend?
HAL	Well, at least I'm the number one boyfriend.
OLIVER	Pop.
HAL	Oh, my stomach.
OLIVER	Alright, come on. Come on.
OLIVER	Arthur, down.
HAL	Well, let's say, when you were little, you always dreamed of some day getting a lion?
HAL	And you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and the lion doesn't come. Then along comes a giraffe.
HAL	You can be alone or you can be with the giraffe.
OLIVER	I'd wait for the lion.
HAL	That's why I worry about you.
HAL	You want me to be with someone like me. I like Andy cause he's not like me... he's fun.
OLIVER	Hey, what did you get?
OLIVER	Liv Ullman. Very serious.
ANNA	And I found this crazy book.
OLIVER	That's kind of a classic American thing.
ANNA	Maybe we can figure out some classic American things to do.
OLIVER	Yeah, Like page 75?
ANNA	Uh-huh.
OLIVER	Or 75 all the way through, through
OLIVER	Louise Brooks, star of silent screen... effectively banned from Hollywood in early Thirties, ended up working as a salesgirl at Saks Fifth Avenue.
OLIVER	Veronica Lake.
ANNA	Oh I love her.
OLIVER	She was a pin-up model and a film star... Success was short-lived... series of broken marriages... She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism. She died of hepatitis at the age of 53.
ANNA	All these actor stories end sad. I can tell you that already. It's not a good life.
ANNA	So. Now I want real Mexican food.
ANNA	And I want to try page... 46.
ANNA	No.
OLIVER	Yeah.
ANNA	Really?
OLIVER	It's really good.
OLIVER	What do you think?
ANNA	It's so good.
OLIVER	It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd like it.
ANNA	Why?
OLIVER	You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel.
ANNA	I like this place.
ANNA	I used to love hotels. But now I'm always in a new apartment or... in another hotel somewhere.
OLIVER	How do you keep hold of friends... or boyfriends?
ANNA	It makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people.
OLIVER	You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people.
ANNA	You are like that? Its what you do?
ANNA	So we are the same?
OLIVER	Yeah, I guess so.
OLIVER	Pop?
HAL	Oh, did I wake you? Yeah. (Handing Maria some books) Thank you Maria. (to Oliver) And now that you're here, uh, would you please put those up there?
OLIVER	What are you--? Pop. What?
HAL	I'm reorganizing.
OLIVER	Prednisone makes you crazy.
HAL	I'm just not sleepy. I feel great.
HAL	As soon as I finish these papers. Right, papers? (In a different voice) Right, Hal. As soon as you're done, you can rest.
ANNA	What?
OLIVER	Nothing, you're pretty.
ANNA	No...
OLIVER	Yeah.
ANNA	Jewish girls are not pretty. They can be "interesting", or cute, but not pretty.
OLIVER	You're kidding right?
ANNA	That's what my mom told me.
OLIVER	She did not.
ANNA	No, you're right, this girl at school told me that. And I went home and my mom said, `Anna, who told you that?
OLIVER	Yeah. Right.
OLIVER	Here, Pop.
HAL	Oh, God.
OLIVER	I know, I know. Come on.
HAL	Hey, no, no, no. That's the Gay Pride Day stuff. Just leave those.
OLIVER	Alright.
HAL	And that's for gay book club. You better leave those too.
OLIVER	But what about this chair? Is it gay?
HAL	The chair's not gay. Obviously.
OLIVER	Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that far.
HAL	Oh, to hell with it.
HAL	Oh, hey what's that?
ANDY	Now that you're out of the hospital, you'll have to exercise, get you back into shape.
HAL	That's a great idea.
ANDY	Okay, let's try it. I'll, I'll show you how.
HAL	Yeah, later on, I'm gonna make myself some tea.
ANDY	Okay, I'll clean it up. It's a little - yech.
HAL	Your mother's vase needs some flowers.
OLIVER	Pop, you just got out of the hospital, you should take it easy.
OLIVER	You need to tell Andy that you're... not well.
HAL	You'll tell him, won't you?
OLIVER	Me?
HAL	Please?
OLIVER	Hey.
ANDY	You know that I tried to have sex with women?
OLIVER	Yeah?
ANDY	Yeah. I wanted you to know I tried, it just, it didn't work.
OLIVER	Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys.
ANDY	Have you ever had sex with a man?
OLIVER	No.
ANDY	I heard that if a man hasn't had sex with another man, he's always afraid of gay men. You know, they're a threat.
OLIVER	I don't know Andy.
ANDY	I didn't want you to feel threatened, I don't want to have sex with you. What I do, most people wouldn't even call it sex.
OLIVER	Okay, okay.
ANDY	Hey...
OLIVER	I couldn't tell him.
HAL	That's okay.
OLIVER	No it's not. You can't hide this from him. He loves you.
HAL	For someone with so much relationship advice, you seem awfully alone.
OLIVER	Just act natural. When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it, okay?
ANNA	Don't, don't.
ANNA	It's my dad.
OLIVER	He's that bad?
ANNA	I'll be my dad, you be me.
OLIVER
ANNA	(In a deep man's voice) Honey?
OLIVER	Oui?
ANNA	C'est toi, cheri?
OLIVER	Oui Papa.
ANNA	You never call me back.
ANNA	You know, I can't stop thinking about, you know, about it. Doing it.
OLIVER	Doing what?
ANNA	Killing myself. You are the only one I can tell that to.
OLIVER	You should tell mom about that, not me.
ANNA	You are my girl.
ANNA	Now I have to kill you.
OLIVER	Just as it was going so well.
ANNA	I know. I'm sorry.
OLIVER	Hey Anna?
ANNA	Hey Oliver?
OLIVER	How do you feel about vandalism?
ANNA	I don't know. Pretty okay.
ELLIOTT	Oliver, don't write any of that serious stuff, okay? Just write something funny. Girls like funny.
SHAUNA	You know what? Here, give me Arthur. We'll just stay here and get arrested. You know, that's good.
OLIVER	You okay?
ANNA	Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my new friend (the handrail she holds).
OLIVER	Okay.
ANNA	C'est beau ici.
OLIVER	Yeah.
OLIVER	I'm trying to impress you.
ANNA	(Gasps ironically) Really?
ANNA	It's working.
OLIVER	Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry.
OLD MAN	Oh. No problem. No problem. What's with this card?
OLIVER	Uh, do you mind?
OLD MAN	Thank you.
ANNA	He looked like your dad?
OLIVER	Yeah.
OLIVER	Somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick.
HAL	Oliver, this is Blake. He's a wonderful man.
HAL	Look. I finally got a tattoo. Registration purposes of course.
ANNA	Good for him.
OLIVER	He had a lot of parties.
HAL	Well, glad you could make it.
OLIVER	I thought I was making dinner?
HAL	It's movie night.
PARTY GUEST	Hal, you look wonderful.
HAL	Oh, I'm turning the corner on this thing.
OLIVER	Why're you telling them you're "turning the corner"?
HAL	Well...
OLIVER	You have stage 4 cancer?
HAL	It's not as bad as it sounds.
OLIVER	Pop. There is no stage 5.
HAL	That's not what it means.
OLIVER	What does it mean?
HAL	It just means it's been through 3 other stages.
OLIVER	What movie are we watching?
HAL	"The Life of Harvey Milk." He was the first openly gay politician...
OLIVER	Yeah I know who Harvey Milk is.
HAL	Good, good.
HAL	Eventually Jesus grew old. He could no longer walk far and he could no longer preach in a loud voice. One day he announced to his apostles that he was departing. The three disciples prayed with him, gave him water, bathed and fed him. After gasping for breath for several days, one morning, just as dawn came, Jesus passed away.
OLIVER	You re-wrote Jesus' death?
HAL	It was so violent, we need new stories.
ANNA	Stay here.
OLIVER	Anna?
ANNA	I couldn't sleep, I wanted to walk around...
ANNA	You've lost so much. What if I can't make up for that?
OLIVER	If this is too much, then we should just stop.
ANNA	Wait, wait.
ANNA	I don't want to stop.
ANDY	Ready?
OLIVER	No!
HAL	Again!
EVERYONE
OLIVER
GUYS

EVERYONE	Arthur! Arthur... Arthur...
ANNA	Ah, you're awake! Arthur says it's time to get up, he says he has the day off.
OLIVER	He talks to you too?
ANNA	Yeah.
OLIVER	Your English is not so perfect. And he said ten minutes.
OLIVER	You okay? (to Anna) You did really well.
ELLIOTT	Yeah, I can't believe that was your first time.
OLIVER	(To Arthur) You watching all the humans going around and around.
MANAGER	Excuse me. There's no dogs allowed in the building. You need to remove him from the premises please.
OLIVER	If I leave him on his own, he loses all control.
MANAGER	I'm sorry. There's no dogs allowed in the building.
OLIVER	Yeah, but if I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls. I can't leave him in the car.
ANNA	A ca vas! C'est bon!
MANAGER	I don't know what she's saying but I don't like it.
OLIVER	She is just talking in French. She's saying it's OK, it is such a small dog.
MANAGER	You need to remove the dog from the premises or I'm going to have to call the authorities.
OLIVER	You're gonna call the authorities?
ANNA	Dans ce pays! On ne peut pas amener un chien. On peut rien faire. Mais c'est con...
OLIVER	Sorry, excuse us, sorry.
OLIVER	He shouldn't do this to you.
ANNA	Even if we don't answer, he's still in here (points to her head).I go somewhere else, he's still here.
OLIVER	Your leaving soon?
ANNA	Yeah.
OLIVER	I think you should come to my house and move in with me.
ANNA	Would you want a strange girl like me?
OLIVER	Yeah, a lot.
ANNA	Do you cook?
OLIVER	Yes (not so sure).
ANNA	I would love that.
OLIVER	But now I'm going to have to kill you for sure now.
ANNA	Why?
OLIVER	Cause I'm falling in love with you.
OLIVER	Next one.
HAL	Lord.
HAL	Here, that means gay pride.
OLIVER	Yeah, everyone knows that, here.
HAL	No they don't.
OLIVER	Everyone knows about that Pop.
HAL	Don't be ridiculous.
HAL	Did you know, about me?
OLIVER	No, I just thought you and mom weren't in love.
HAL	We loved each other.
OLIVER	But you were gay that whole time.
HAL	I learned how not to be.
OLIVER	For 44 years?
HAL	I knew I was gay, though, at dinner parties I was looking at the husbands not the wives.
HAL	I couldn't have survived if I didn't know that. I just chose not to follow those instincts.
OLIVER	What about sex? You guys had sex?
HAL	She didn't think I was the greatest lover, but we made do. Look, I liked my life, the museum, our house, that's what I wanted.
OLIVER	And mom? You wanted mom too right?
HAL	Yes, stop that.
HAL	She proposed to me you know.
HAL	I said - look I love you and we're great buddies but you know what I am. And then she says, that doesn't matter. I'll fix that.
`HAL	I thought. Oh, God. I'll try anything.
NATURE
HAL	Andy's moving in.
OLIVER	Yeah? Is that a good idea?
HAL	Just be happy about it.
OLIVER	This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness.
OLIVER	Here, this could be your...
OLIVER	Your gonna need a big CD box. Four billion years ago, Earth begins. And the idea is that sadness has not been created yet.
OLIVER	I'm sorry.
OLIVER	Well, that went well.
ARTHUR SUBTITLE	Are we married yet?
OLIVER	Come on Arthur.
OLIVER	This is the living room.
OLIVER	Dining room.
OLIVER	There are my parents. My mom. Hal, Georgia, this is Anna - Anna - Hal, Georgia.
ANNA	Hello.
OLIVER	These're the stairs.
ANNA	Yeah?
OLIVER	They go up.
OLIVER	I emptied these for you. I'll get your case.
OLIVER	Are you okay?
ANNA	You OK?
OLIVER	Are you?
ANNE	I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to bug you.
ANNA	I was nervous, and excited. I kept thinking, maybe I'm not so lost.
OLIVER	Why were you crying yesterday?
ANNA	You okay?
OLIVER	Yeah.
ANNA	You seem so unhappy with me.
OLIVER	Well are you happy here?
ANNA	Maybe I'm not perfect at it. I don't really know what I'm doing... but I want to be here.
OLIVER	I don't know Anna. I don't think this is what I am supposed to feel like.
ANNA	Okay. I will go back to New York then.
HAL	Have I done something wrong?
HAL	I see.
HAL	You did an excellent job Dr. Long. Thank you... for... For coming to the party.
HAL	You always wanted to hold my hand when you were little. I couldn't, you know. I was afraid it would look funny. I wanted to be close, you know and my father certainly was never close with me. God, I hope I wasn't like that.
OLIVER	I can barely remember you from when I was little.
HAL	I guess I was at work.
FANCY WOMAN	Oh!
OLIVER	Let's go home.

ANDY	Hey.
OLIVER	Arthur...
OLIVER	Thank you... Thanks.
ANDY	It's cause I'm gay, isn't it?
OLIVER	What?
ANDY	You never called or came to see me?

OLIVER	What happens now?
ANNA	I don't know.
OLIVER	How does that work?
