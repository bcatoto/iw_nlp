Ides of March, The

STEPHEN	I am neither Christian...nor atheist. I am not Jewish or Muslim. What I believe...my religion is called the constitution...
DIRECTOR	Hang on...let me open these up....
DIRECTOR	Okay...
STEPHEN	I will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in...
STEPHEN	If I'm not religious enough for you, don't vote for me.
STEPHEN	You got it?
STEPHEN	If I'm not experienced enough don't vote for me. If I'm not...
DIRECTOR	Okay got it, thanks.
STEPHEN	Thanks. We'll need these monitors turned up a bit...it's a big space and he wants to be able to hear.
STAGE MANAGER	You got it.
STEPHEN	Also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions. You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes.
STAGE MANAGER	No I know, we just got those specs last night and they're building a piece to go under...
STEPHEN	Great, thanks. See you guys in a few hours.
BEN	I didn't know the Governor had trouble reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear...
STEPHEN	He doesn't but Pullman is 5'8" he'll look like a hobbit behind that podium.
SENATOR PULLMAN	Would you call yourself a Christian?
SENATOR PULLMAN	"I have no idea what happens when we die, maybe nothing...maybe it was like before we were born." You did write this Governor...
SENATOR PULLMAN	Is that your idea of being specific?
SENATOR PULLMAN	I just wanted you to say out loud if you believed in the teachings of the Bible.
PAUL	A double?
STEPHEN	A double.
PAUL	Fucking national security.
PAUL	Outta the park.
STEPHEN	Home run.
DUFFY	I'm trying to remember if the democrats ever nominated an atheist before...
PAUL	Well, we know they've nominated jackasses before.
DUFFY	Must've been you that did the prep work. Paul's not that clever.
PAUL	You always had the brains Duffy, but me - I always had the balls.
DUFFY	(nodding to Stephen) Looks like you got some brains now too. Be careful. I just might have to steal him from you.
PAUL	What a prick.
IDA	So Paul, tell me something I don't know...tell me what's gonna happen on the 15th.
PAUL	Ha-ha.
IDA	What?
PAUL	What do you think Stevie?
STEPHEN	It's ours for the taking.
PAUL	Ben?
BEN	We'll win.
PAUL	What do you think Ida?
IDA	I'm asking you.
PAUL	You tell me and I'll tell you.
IDA	If had to say, I'd say it'll be close, but you'll eke it out.
PAUL	Eke?
PAUL	You see, she's trying to get under my skin.
IDA	So what's gonna happen?
PAUL	Us by nine.
IDA	Nine? There's no way you'll win by nine.
STEPHEN	At least. Maybe more.
IDA	(To PAUL) So you're certain you're gonna win here?
PAUL	Certain? No. Confident? Yes.
IDA	You just said you'll win by nine.
PAUL	And I think we will, but I won't tell you it's a sure thing. Fucking Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his four horseman to rig the ballot boxes for Pullman and it wouldn't surprise me. Don't get me wrong. Six presidentials I've done and I've never felt this good. But am I gonna sit here and say "Yes -we will definitely win Ohio"? Not a chance. In the last thirty years seventy-three Democrats have run for president. How many have won? Three.PAUL	That means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost.
IDA	So you're saying there's a good chance you won't win.
PAUL	Don't twist my words. What I'm saying is that I'm not going to promise we'll win. But he's decorated by Bush Senior from the first Gulf war and protested the second. He left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth highest education rate. The Republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guy...so for this moment, this election, this primary is the presidential. And that Ida, is the state of the union. And on that note, I'm gonna take a shit.
IDA	So Stephen...
STEPHEN	Yes Ida?
IDA	Stephen, Stephen, Stephen....
STEPHEN	Here it comes...hit me.
IDA	Paul's going to the airport?
STEPHEN	Yes?
IDA	Getting on a plane.
STEPHEN	Mmhmm.
IDA	Where is that plane going?
STEPHEN	Three guesses.
IDA	Not going back to headquarters.
STEPHEN	Correct.
IDA	He's not going to Texas?
STEPHEN	No need, we'll split Texas, it's a wash.
IDA	What if I said North Carolina?
STEPHEN	That's your guess?
IDA	He's going to North Carolina.
STEPHEN	I will neither confirm nor deny that statement.
IDA	I knew it. Now tell me why.
STEPHEN	That I cannot do.
IDA	I hate you.
STEPHEN	You love me.
IDA	I love Paul. You I hate.
STEPHEN	You only love him because he gives you all the scoops.
IDA	Sexual favors?
STEPHEN	You're engaged.
IDA	If it meant a good scoop my fiance would understand.
IDA	You really buy into all this crap? All this take back the country nonsense?
STEPHEN	Ida I'm not naive about this stuff. I've worked on more campaigns than most people do by the time they're forty...I'm telling you this is the one.
IDA	You really have drunk the kool-aid.
STEPHEN	I have drunk it it's delicious. I don't care whether he leads in the polls...I don't care whether he has all the tools...Because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives...Even the people that hate him. If Mike Morris is President it says more about us than it does about him. I don't give a fuck if he can win. He has to win.
IDA	Or what? The world will fall apart? It won't matter...Not one bit to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who work and eat and sleep and get up and go back to work again. If your boy wins...You get a job in the white house...If he loses you're back at a consulting firm on K Street...That's it. You used to know that before you got all goosebumpy about this guy. Morris is a politician...He's a nice guy...They're all nice guys.IDA	He will let you down...sooner or later.
PAUL	This is off off off the record.
IDA	What?
PAUL	Franklin Thompson.
IDA	Seriously?
PAUL	Off the record. The only people who know are the Governor, Stephen and me.
IDA	My lips are sealed.
PAUL	I have a meeting tomorrow at Thompson's house.
IDA	He's gonna endorse?
PAUL	After I'm done talking with him, what do you think?
IDA	That's huge.
PAUL	It's more than huge. He has 356 pledged delegates...they all travel with him. That puts us over the top.
IDA	He's said publicly he's not gonna endorse anyone.
PAUL	That's what they all say until we get them alone in a room.
IDA	So this is for real?
PAUL	Yup. It's just about in the bag.
IDA	When are you gonna announce?
PAUL	Nope. That's all you get for now.
BEN	Okay so listen up...these are your new cell phones...Shelly has pre- programmed everyone's numbers in...thank you Shelly...no personal calls...if you lose them, Paul has authorized me to kill you.
BEN	New phones...
STEPHEN	I'll get it in a bit...
STEPHEN	Fucking kill me...where did we get this?
EDITOR	Before he announced at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania...
STEPHEN	Thank God it wasn't overseas. Just get rid of it -
EDITOR	It plays to his base, if-
STEPHEN	Are you fucking stoned...this is the same...the exact same piece the Republicans are gonna run against him in the general...we don't need to brag about it...Hi I'm Neville Chamberlain and I want to be your commander in chief.
EDITOR	If it's gonna come out-
STEPHEN	It's gonna come out but not paid for by us pal. (To Staffer) Any truth on whether Pullman had investments in those diamond mines in Liberia?
STAFFER 1	We're still checking...it was a blog so who the fuck knows...
STEPHEN	Doesn't matter I want to hear him denying it. If it's true, find out, if it's not, let them spend the next day telling the post that he doesn't own a diamond mine in Liberia...win win.
STAFFER 1	Okay.
STEPHEN	We need to counter this Christian shit we're taking from last night...so get going...Where's our cut on the new thirty and a sixty second spots? We'll show it to him this afternoon in the staff meeting.
EDITOR	Got it.
MOLLY	Ben wanted me to get you to sign off on this before the staff meeting.
STEPHEN	Oh, right. Thanks. I've been waiting for this.
MOLLY	Anything interesting?
STEPHEN	Just some white paper I gotta pass out tonight.
MOLLY	White paper?
STEPHEN	Negative shit. Our oppo guys do research - we feed it to the press, hope they bite.
MOLLY	So like what sort of negative stuff?
STEPHEN	Read tomorrow's paper and you'll see.
MOLLY	Which paper?
STEPHEN	All of them.
MOLLY	So it's something big?
STEPHEN	I wish it were something bigger actually. Just some transportation numbers. I'll have to spin this shit pretty heavy if we want it to stick.
MOLLY	Well that's what you're good at, right?
STEPHEN	I guess.
MOLLY	(Holding up her phone) Did you get your phone?
STEPHEN	(Holds his up) Just now.
MOLLY	It's exciting isn't it?
STEPHEN	You a Bearcat...?
MOLLY	A what?
STEPHEN	A Cincinnati Bearcat?
MOLLY	Oh no...I'm not from here...I worked with you in Iowa actually.
STEPHEN	Oh that's right...but you changed something. (Searching for a way out.)
MOLLY	My hair?
STEPHEN	You changed your hair.
MOLLY	No..
STEPHEN	I must look like a total dumb ass right now.
MOLLY	Not at all...you're the big man on campus...I'm just a lowly intern.
STEPHEN	Come on it's not like that.
MOLLY	Sure it is...you get to stay at the Millennium, they put us into a motel on the other side of the river.
STEPHEN	You're right, I am big man on campus.
MOLLY	Now you're starting to see.
MOLLY	We do have the better bar though.
STEPHEN	I heard that.
MOLLY	You ought to stop by one night and have a drink with the worker bees.
STEPHEN	Maybe I will...when's a good night?
MOLLY	Tonight's good...
STEPHEN	Really? Tuesday?
MOLLY	Yeah it's quiet.
STEPHEN	Quiet's good.
MOLLY	Well you have my number.
STEPHEN	I do?
MOLLY	Programmed right there in your phone.
STEPHEN	Oh...right...(He opens the phone)
MOLLY	Under Mary.
STEPHEN	(Looking at the phone) Yup...Mary.
MOLLY	Molly...my name's Molly...
SENATOR THOMPSON	That's what I'm hearing...since Super Tuesday I'm a very popular guy. What are your polls telling you?
PAUL	That Pullman's negatives are high...mid forties. Senator we have an open seat in the White House and the Republicans don't have dick. They're disorganized and they can't find a nominee that isn't a world class fuck up. They look like Democrats. No Republican is gonna show up to vote for their guy. But if Pullman gets the Democratic nod they'll show up to vote against him.
SENATOR THOMPSON	And so you think they won't for your guy...you think Morris gets into the independents?
PAUL	I sure do. Senator...I'm a bit confused...we need your delegates...we need you...your fund raising. It was my understanding that...your endorsement a week before Ohio...would win this for us...
SENATOR THOMPSON	(Looks to his aide) Estella...hand me that ice bucket.
STEPHEN	Paul knows...Paul agrees...
BEN	Got it right here. (He opens his laptop.)
STEPHEN	Print it out.
BEN	I'll get it printed. Molly, I'm printing out this op ed...can you grab it off the printer?
MOLLY	Be right back.
STEPHEN	Governor...if you want to change...or lets call it refresh...
STEPHEN	National service isn't polling like the rest of your domestic policy.
STEPHEN	Good cop, good cop.
STEPHEN	All of that is exactly right...Governor if you're going to do it...then do it. Don't make it voluntary...mandatory.
STEPHEN	Mandatory!...everyone who graduates high school or turns eighteen, gives two years to his or her country. Military...peace corps...plant fucking trees, I don't care...and for that...their college education is paid for...period.
STEPHEN	No sir you don't...do it all...all the way. Mandatory.
STEPHEN	And here's the beauty of it...everyone who is older than eighteen and past the age of eligibility, would be for it...create national pride...give all the kids an education.
STEPHEN	Can't vote. Too young.
STEPHEN	You can't lose.
MOLLY	Stephen you have a call on three, your dad.
STEPHEN	Remember, Governor... you have a six o'clock with Charlie Rose...
STEPHEN	It's long form... he's flying in...
STEPHEN	No, he won't be back... Ben and I are taking you...
STEPHEN	...Don't tell me anyone's died...
DUFFY	Hey Stephen...
STEPHEN	Who is this?
DUFFY	Tom Duffy...sorry about the dad bit...but I didn't think you'd want my name yelled out at a Morris campaign office.
STEPHEN	What do you want?
DUFFY	You got a couple of minutes...I'd like to sit down with you.
STEPHEN	What for?
DUFFY	I think it's important.
STEPHEN	If it's important shouldn't you be calling Paul?
DUFFY	I'm calling you...This is all on the up and up...just give me five minutes.
STEPHEN	I can't be talking to you...
DUFFY	I hear you...but if you get five minutes...I'll be at the Heads First Sports Bar for the next couple of hours.
STEPHEN	I can't Tom.
DUFFY	There won't be anybody there...if you get a chance there's something I want to show you.
STEPHEN	Paul, listen, call me as soon as you can...it's important.
DUFFY	You're working for the wrong man.
STEPHEN	You're working for the wrong man.
DUFFY	Oh on the contrary you are working for the wrong man. You've got something the other guys don't have.
STEPHEN	Yeah?
DUFFY	Yeah, what is it exactly? Charm isn't the right word. It's more than that. You exude something. You draw people in. All the reporters love you. Even the ones that hate you love you. You play them all like they're pieces on a chess board. And you make it look effortless. We both know how much work it takes, constantly being on guard, weighing every word so carefully, every move. But from the outside, you make it look easy.DUFFY	People are scared of you because they don't understand how you do it, and they love you for it. There's nothing more valuable in this business - the ability to win people's respect by making them mistake their fear for love. You can guess what I'm gonna say next.
STEPHEN	No...I don't think I can.
DUFFY	I want you to work for us.
STEPHEN	You gotta be kidding me.
DUFFY	Not in the least. You are going to lose Ohio.
STEPHEN	I am not.
DUFFY	You're sitting on about a six percent lead in both polls...six percent of the Democrats polled.
STEPHEN	Eight.
DUFFY	Six...but that doesn't matter...Independents and Republicans can vote for the Democratic candidate.
STEPHEN	You think they like your guy?...pro choice...tax and spend liberal?
DUFFY	Fuck no they hate him...they think they can beat my guy...but they're worried about yours...so starting tomorrow morning you're gonna see a fucking blitz...Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, all the right wing blogs are gonna start a "Get out the vote campaign"...it's already started...every fucking conservative in Ohio is gonna stand in line and punch my guys ticket...that's just one of the steps...Ohio is gone...the polls don't mean shit...tomorrow morning everyone will know...that's why I want you to handle the fallout we'll take in the press...
DUFFY	And by the way...we've got Thompson in the bag.
STEPHEN	I know for a fact that Thompson is going with us.
DUFFY	We promised him Secretary of State, Ohio is over...it's been over for weeks...and with Thompson's delegates...I'm thinking down the road now...that's why I want you...I'll bring you in straight at the top.
STEPHEN	I can't do it.
DUFFY	I'm not asking for an answer right this moment.
STEPHEN	I've played dirty but I don't have to play dirty anymore...you know why? Cause I got Morris!
DUFFY	None of this is about the democratic process Steve, It's about getting your guy into office. Simple as that.
STEPHEN	This is the sort of shit the Republicans pull.
DUFFY	You're right, this is exactly what the Republicans do, and it's about time we learned from them. They're meaner, tougher and more disciplined than we are. I've been in this business for twenty five years and I've seen way too many Democrats bite the dust because they wouldn't get down in the mud with the fucking elephants.
STEPHEN	Paul's a friend.
DUFFY	Do you want to work for a friend or do you want to work for the President? Think about it...you have my number.
STEPHEN	Paul.
STEPHEN	Not that I know of. What's going on with Thompson?
STEPHEN	It's nothing...never mind.
STEPHEN	Yeah okay...I'll look for quaaludes.
STEPHEN	Just get online and see if there's any chatter on the blogs...
BEN	What kind of chatter? There's always chatter.
STEPHEN	I don't know... just see what they're talking about.
BEN	Give me a second...
STEPHEN	I'm married to the campaign, Governor.
BEN	(looking at his computer) Wall Street Journal poll has our numbers holding steady and Pullman dropped a point.
STEPHEN	Really? When did they do that? Governor... Wall Street Journal numbers are in... and Pullman's down a point.
BEN	I'm married to the campaign, Governor.
STEPHEN	Make sure Charlie Rose has these latest numbers before he goes on...
BEN	I'm on it.
STEPHEN	And get a copy of the show before we leave...
CHARLIE ROSE	So you would appoint a judge to...
CHARLIE ROSE	But you're against the death penalty?
CHARLIE ROSE	Suppose Governor it was your wife...
CHARLIE ROSE	It gets more complicated when it's personal.
CONTINUED:
CHARLIE ROSE	So you, you Governor would impose the death penalty.
CHARLIE ROSE	Then why not let society do that?
CHARLIE ROSE	And what about guns?
CHARLIE ROSE	This is public TV, we don't have commercials...
STEPHEN	Where'd you go after Iowa?
MOLLY	California for Super Tuesday.
STEPHEN	I had to go to New York.
MOLLY	I know...you guys needed a lot more help over there.
STEPHEN	Yeah. So why politics?
MOLLY	Because the pay is so good.
STEPHEN	It just seems like an odd fit.
MOLLY	My dad is Jack Stearns.
STEPHEN	He's a good guy.
MOLLY	He's an asshole but he's your boss.
STEPHEN	He's not my boss. He's the head of the DNC.
MOLLY	You don't work for the Democratic National Committee?
STEPHEN	I work for Paul, Paul works for Morris and if Morris wins, he's going to be your dad's boss.
MOLLY	Don't tell my dad that.
STEPHEN	Don't tell your dad a lot of things.
MOLLY	Never.
STEPHEN	What time do you start tomorrow?
MOLLY	Nine AM...I'm showing the new interns how to robo call...you see...I'm the experienced intern.
STEPHEN	I do see...
MOLLY	How old are you?
STEPHEN	How old do you think I am?
MOLLY	Thirty?
STEPHEN	You think I'm thirty?
MOLLY	I'm sorry, how old are you?
STEPHEN	Thirty...how old are you?
MOLLY	How old do you think I am?
STEPHEN	Twenty one?
MOLLY	Twenty.
STEPHEN	That's young.
MOLLY	Too young to fuck a thirty year old?
STEPHEN	See laws are different in different states. Here in your hotel, in Kentucky...it's frowned upon...but we'll go across the bridge into Ohio...
MOLLY	Where your hotel is?
STEPHEN	Yeah surprisingly they're very lax about their child endangerment laws...
MOLLY	You have a car? I don't drive.
STEPHEN	I took a cab.
MOLLY	I have the keys to the campaign bus...
STEPHEN	(On the phone) What time does Paul land?... Christ...who do we talk to about polling?...no...I just...I just need to get some internal polling on the fucking Independents and the right-wing nuts.
MOLLY	Do you want me to go?
STEPHEN	Listen, put me on the line with...what's the guy's name at the Wall Street Journal?... yeah...
MOLLY	You seem busy...I should go.
STEPHEN	Wait.
STEPHEN	Right...Adler...get me on the line with him.
MOLLY	Steve?
STEPHEN	Molly listen, just give me a second...I want to talk to you about something.
MOLLY	We can talk about it later if...
STEPHEN	What? No nobody...just the cleaning lady...listen Ben...keep trying till you get him. We're gonna go with the position that we've always said, the race is closer than the polling...right...no don't...don't say that...just get him on the line and call me...I'll handle it...yup.
STEPHEN	Sorry about that.
MOLLY	The cleaning lady.
STEPHEN	What?
MOLLY	You called me the cleaning lady.
STEPHEN	You're not mad about that are you?
MOLLY	No why would I be mad?
MOLLY	Look.
CHRIS MATHEWS	Earlier I spoke with Jack Stearns, head of the DNC, and he had this to say...
JACK STEARNS	I know you're looking for a reaction, but listen we have two great candidates in a very tight race...and at the end of the day the voters will decide who best can represent this party in the fall.
CHRIS MATHEWS	I understand Jack - but doesn't this kind of disruption take away from what you want to be pushing this year?
STEPHEN	Your dad is an asshole.
MOLLY	I'll tell him you said that.
STEPHEN	Do that.
MOLLY	You said you wanted to talk to me about something?
STEPHEN	Yeah, I just wanted...I just wanted to be clear about everything...so there's no confusion...
MOLLY	I won't tell anyone about last night.
STEPHEN	Well yeah, I'd appreciate it if we kept this...I mean, you know how people are.
MOLLY	Really wouldn't look good if you screwed an intern.
STEPHEN	It's not like I got drunk and this happened...I mean...I wanted to...I really like you...you're smart...but I just...I don't want there to be any expectations...
MOLLY	Steven, you don't have to say anything.
STEPHEN	I just don't want you to think I'm some kind of player.
MOLLY	Well you are kind of a player, but that's okay.
STEPHEN	No I'm not. I was being polite.
MOLLY	Bullshit...you were trying to pick me up.
STEPHEN	No I wasn't.
MOLLY	You were pretty obvious about it.
STEPHEN	I was?
MOLLY	Totally.
STEPHEN	I thought I was being all smooth and subtle.
MOLLY	You were pretty forward.
STEPHEN	You were pretty forward ...inviting me to the bar.
MOLLY	Well...I've been trying to fuck you for a while.
STEPHEN	Wow.
MOLLY	Pretty slutty of me, huh?
STEPHEN	No, not at all...I mean I kind of respect it in a weird sort of way.
MOLLY	Good.
STEPHEN	You have absolutely no idea how to tie a tie do you...
MOLLY	No no not a clue.
STEPHEN	You're very mature.
MOLLY	For a teenager.
STEPHEN	When are you coming back?
PAUL	I'll be at the event...a little late...these cock suckers...fucking dirty shit.
STEPHEN	What happened with Thompson?
PAUL	Nothing, the prick...we had him all sewed up...MOTHER FUCKER...how bad is it?
STEPHEN	I'm running some numbers now...I don't know...
PAUL	Alright, I'll be there in three hours...I want hard numbers...and a strategy.
STEPHEN	Yeah I'm on it...I gotta go.
STEPHEN	Yup...(Nope) Just trying to figure out our stops on the ground.
STEPHEN	We'll be fine...we have to do it...and it's the right thing. Nothing bad happens when it's the right thing.
STEPHEN	Well there are exceptions to every rule...
STEPHEN	Fine now.
STEPHEN	Great...
STEPHEN	I think we're solid.
STEPHEN	Governor there's a big difference between Paul and me. Paul only believes in winning so he'll do or say anything to win.
STEPHEN	I'll do or say anything if I believe in it...but I have to believe in the cause.
STEPHEN	Well I won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it.
STEPHEN	Pimping out ex presidents...
STEPHEN	Yeah.
STEPHEN	I didn't think it was true.
PAUL	Whoa...
STEPHEN	But I should have told you this yesterday...sorry...
PAUL	-Slow down.
STEPHEN	I met with Tom Duffy yesterday.
PAUL	What?
STEPHEN	You were on a plane and he called me and he asked if we could meet...And I said why...he said it was very important so I did...but I should've fucking told you...
PAUL	Stop Stop let me get this straight. You met with Tom Duffy?
STEPHEN	Yes.
PAUL	What'd he want Stephen?
STEPHEN	-the gist of it is he wants to hire me. He wants me to jump ship and come work for him...this is bad Paul. He showed me poll numbers with Pullman ahead by four. We're in really deep fucking trouble he laid out their whole plan. Robo- calls, traffic jams, fake lit, and fucking Thompson. They promised him Secretary of State.
PAUL	If this is some sort of practical-I mean -my fucking blood pressure is going through the roof right now.
STEPHEN	Paul I'm sorry. Believe me...I just didn't think it was true.
PAUL	It doesn't fucking matter what you thought. It matters what you did. It matters what you didn't do. If all this shit is true I made a fucking ass of myself at Thompson's place. And I gave away our game plan.
STEPHEN	Please believe me that I honestly believed you were gonna come back and you were gonna tell me that we have Thompson in the bag and I didn't see the point. But it doesn't make it right and I'm sorry.
PAUL	Let me think...let me think...
PAUL	We get the Governor right after he finishes singing Kum Bay Ya and give him everything we know.
STEPHEN	Who do you want...
PAUL	You, me and the Governor, that's it! What's he got after?
STEPHEN	A fund-raiser in Cleveland tonight.
PAUL	He'll be late...we're gonna tell him that if he doesn't offer Thompson a cabinet position...he's not gonna get the nomination.
STEPHEN	Will he go for it?
PAUL	I don't fucking know Stephen.
PAUL	Find us a room...
STEPHEN	We might pick up a couple of points...but we're...I don't know, we lose by three or four percent.
PAUL	Who the fuck knows Governor...but we can't take the chance...
PAUL	I think we fold up the campaign in Ohio...take a loss and blame it on the Republican's playing games...head to North Carolina.
PAUL	Not if you get Thompson's endorsement.
STEPHEN	Cabinet post.
STEPHEN	State...
PAUL	Governor, if you lose Ohio, and they get Thompson's delegates...Then they get North Carolina...then they get the lead. A lead you can't beat. But if we walk from Ohio, take Thompson, give him a cabinet post, then we take North Carolina. His state. Then Pennsylvania. Your state. And then it's simple math Mike. Take his endorsement and the race is over.
STEPHEN	(On the phone) Do we have any other senators that can go to bat for us? House members won't do.
BEN	(Whispering to him) Or a Congressman from Ohio maybe.
STEPHEN	Right...but we need a Senator...one from Ohio would be nice.
MOLLY	This is all the car rental companies in Northern Ohio...they've booked every single van for Tuesday...
STEPHEN	Fuck...Jess, I'll call you back... (To Molly) All of them? Goddamit!
BEN	(On the computer) Here's what I have so far...Independents don't seem to be biting, but Republicans are...or say they are.
STEPHEN	They're not gonna tell a pollster that they're gonna vote Democratic...I don't even know how to read these polls.
MOLLY	I called and we can get a hundred vans out of Covington and Newport Kentucky.
STEPHEN	We don't need the fucking vans...we just don't want Pullman to have them...
PAUL	No, No that's not what I'm saying...we were the underdog before we got into this and we continue to be the underdog...well the numbers...we knew the numbers would get closer the closer we got to Tuesday...I'm not lowering expectations...have you ever heard me say that we had Ohio locked?... Then at least give me the courtesy of printing that in your column.
CINDY	What're you writing?
CINDY	The bar is awfully high on that one.
CINDY	I got hit up by Mitchell's wife for you to show up at her "Daughters of the American Revolution" luncheon.
CINDY	Congressman from the first district. You might want to remember that.
CINDY	No I can't. Lets just do this one more time.
CINDY	That's it.
CINDY	You think we'll lose Ohio?
CINDY	If you took Thompson's delegates the race is over. Ohio wouldn't matter.
CINDY	(Shaking her head) Stephen.	They are good.
CINDY	Is Thompson so bad?
CINDY	Worse than Pullman?
CINDY	You've got great hair.
STUDENT 1	Gay marriage?
STUDENT 1	Not to fifty percent of Americans.
STUDENT 1	That's who votes...that's who shows up at the polls.
PAUL	Keep an eye on the Governor.
STEPHEN	Let me know how it's going out there.
STEPHEN	I'm on it.
STUDENT 1	From...a religious...a
STUDENT 1	But one could argue a great difference between gender and race.
STUDENT 1	The argument of course-
STUDENT 1	The argument is that men and women, can in fact be separate but equal, races cannot.
STUDENT 1	You have separate public bathrooms for men and women but it would be illegal to have separate bathrooms for two races.
STUDENT 1	Yes now.
STEPHEN	What time is this on tonight?
BEN	Nine o'clock.
STEPHEN	How'd he do?
BEN	He did good.
STUDENT 2	Do you think candor is your appeal? Is that what you're running on as much as your platform...?
STUDENT 2	I just heard a lot of Christian Coalition cars start up.
STEPHEN	It's not you.
STEPHEN	Hello...
VOICE	Molly?
STEPHEN	Your phone rang.
MOLLY	Really?
STEPHEN	Who's calling at 2:30 in the morning?
MOLLY	I don't know?
STEPHEN	He asked for you by name.
MOLLY	You answered it?
STEPHEN	I thought it was mine. Who was it?
MOLLY	I don't know...
STEPHEN	One of the other interns drunk dialing you?
MOLLY	Oh that never happens...let me see the number...
STEPHEN	Hold on...
MOLLY	(Still waiting for it) Stephen...
STEPHEN	I'm gonna call him back.
MOLLY	No!
STEPHEN	...And I'm gonna tell him that I'm your dad...
MOLLY	Gimme my phone Stephen!
STEPHEN	And I'm gonna tell him I'm coming over there with a shotgun...
MOLLY	(Getting more urgent) Don't do that Stephen... Hang up!
STEPHEN	Why is the Governor calling you at 2:30 in the morning?
STEPHEN	Why is the Governor calling you at all?
MOLLY	I'm in trouble...
STEPHEN	With the Governor? What's going on?
MOLLY	I was working on the campaign in Iowa...we had a party in Ben's room after the rally in Des Moines...
STEPHEN	There was a party with you...and Ben...and the Governor.
MOLLY	No he wasn't there.
STEPHEN	Where was he?
MOLLY	I took him up a hard copy of the polling numbers...
STEPHEN	After the party?
MOLLY	(Shaking her head yes) About midnight I guess...I stood in the doorway with him...we were talking...a long time...then he just reached behind me and closed the door.
STEPHEN	Jesus fucking Christ...Were you drunk?
MOLLY	Not that drunk...
STEPHEN	How many times?
MOLLY	Just that once.
STEPHEN	Does anybody know? Did anyone see you?
MOLLY	No.
STEPHEN	How could you know?
MOLLY	I know!
STEPHEN	Then why is he calling you now?
MOLLY	I called him first.
STEPHEN	Why?
MOLLY	Because I didn't know who to go to...and I needed nine hundred bucks...
STEPHEN	For what?
MOLLY	I can't go to my dad...We're catholic.
MOLLY	So what should I do?
STEPHEN	Ben... come here a minute
BEN	What's up?
STEPHEN	What's our limit on petty cash?
BEN	It's probably five hundred. Why?
STEPHEN	I need as much as we have.
BEN	Everything okay?... anything I can help with?
STEPHEN	Yeah...don't put it on the books. That's all.
BEN	What should I put it down as?
STEPHEN	Don't put it down as anything...
BEN	Anything over a hundred I got to put it down as something...
STEPHEN	(raising his voice) Just do it!
STEPHEN	Molly...
STEPHEN	Here...
MOLLY	Okay.
STEPHEN	I'll take that. That's all.
IDA	Stevie ... off the record ...
STEPHEN	No I can't tell you what happened in North Carolina.
IDA	That's not what I wanted to ask you about.
STEPHEN	Okay what?
IDA	You met with Duffy.
STEPHEN	Who told you that?
IDA	A little bird.
STEPHEN	Who?
IDA	Did you meet with him?
STEPHEN	Where are you?
IDA	I know you met with him at a little bar in Cincy, two nights ago, just before the press conference. Duffy ordered buffalo wings.
STEPHEN	Did Duffy tell you this?
IDA	Anonymous. What happened with Duffy?
STEPHEN	You're supposed to be my friend Ida. You'd stab me in the back like this? You'd ruin my reputation just so you-
IDA	Wait wait wait -is that what you thought? That we were friends?
STEPHEN	I've given you everything -every fucking scoop, your profile with Pau1....
IDA	You're right -you've given me a lot. But let's get real here Steve. The only reason you ever treated me well was that I work for the Times. Not because I was your friend. You give me what I want, I write you better stories. Don't pretend it's any more than that. Why'd you meet with Duffy?
STEPHEN	Go fuck yourself.
IDA	Okay, I'll make it easier on you. Forget Duffy. What happened at Paul and Thompson's meeting?
STEPHEN	Will you keep your voice down. Do you have any idea what a story like this could do to me?
IDA	Of course I do. That's why I'm giving you a choice here.
STEPHEN	I could get fired.
IDA	So it's not a difficult choice, is it? I've got to file by three p.m.IDA	tomorrow. You've got till then to make up your mind.
STEPHEN	You mother fucker.
DUFFY	Excuse me?
STEPHEN	You leaked it.
DUFFY	Leaked what?
STEPHEN	Don't bullshit me Tom.
DUFFY	Bullshit you...I have no idea what you're talking about.
STEPHEN	I just spoke with Ida Horowicz.
DUFFY	Yeah?
STEPHEN	She's threatening to release the story.
DUFFY	What fucking story?
STEPHEN	That we met! That I fuckin met with you!
DUFFY	How did she find out?
STEPHEN	Don't play dumb here Tom.
DUFFY	You think I leaked it to her?
STEPHEN	Who else?
DUFFY	I didn't leak it to her.
STEPHEN	Well I know I didn't, so that leaves you.
DUFFY	What's she know?
STEPHEN	She knows whatever you told her.
DUFFY	I swear to Jesus I didn't leak it to her Steve. I don't want this story out any more than you do.
STEPHEN	Well too late.
DUFFY	What did she tell you?
STEPHEN	She knows where we met, she knows when we met... she knows you had buffalo fucking wings.
DUFFY	She has a source?
STEPHEN	Yes she has a source.
DUFFY	And you have no idea who it could be?
STEPHEN	Yeah, you.
DUFFY	Well it wasn't me, and for the record I didn't have fucking buffalo wings. It's gotta be some one else.
STEPHEN	Did you tell anyone?
DUFFY	No. Did you?
STEPHEN	No.
DUFFY	Did you admit to meeting with me?
STEPHEN	No.
DUFFY	Then we stonewall her and she's got nothing.
STEPHEN	She's gonna take the story to Drudge, or Roll Call...shit like that.
DUFFY	You can't stop her?
STEPHEN	She's trying to blackmail me - wants info about Thompson.
DUFFY	Then tell her what she wants to know.
STEPHEN	I can't do that.
DUFFY	You can't let this story get out.
STEPHEN	I'm not gonna be blackmailed Tom.
DUFFY	You don't have much of a choice here.
STEPHEN	If I tell her about Thompson I gotta tell her he's gonna endorse you guys.
DUFFY	Then tell her. I can handle it from my side if I start getting calls.
STEPHEN	No fucking way. Paul told her we had Thompson in the bag. It'll make us look like fools.
DUFFY	You're gonna look like fools anyway when he endorses us.
STEPHEN	I can't do it.
DUFFY	You're on a sinking ship Steve. Tell her what she wants to know and jump. Come over to our side. We can control this thing.
DUFFY	Steve?
STEPHEN	I Gotta go.
STEPHEN	I'm up here.
MOLLY	Shit, you scared me.
STEPHEN	Take this.
STEPHEN	It's almost 1800 bucks... you make the appointment now... today... from a pay phone... I'll take you to the clinic and pick you up... no one else... you understand?
MOLLY	Yes.
STEPHEN	You take the rest of the money and you buy a ticket home... you can't be here anymore... we can't afford it... not with everything that's gonna happen in the next week. This situation just can't be here.
MOLLY	You mean I can't be here.
STEPHEN	Right.
MOLLY	But I would never tell anyone...
STEPHEN	I would hope not.
MOLLY	Then why?
STEPHEN	You fucked up, Molly...
MOLLY	He and I both fucked up.
STEPHEN	But I have a responsibility to him... and more importantly I have a responsibility to this campaign.
MOLLY	I could go to North Carolina and work on the campaign...
STEPHEN	Molly you've go to wake the fuck up... this is the big leagues... it's mean...and when you make mistakes you lose your right to play. Make the appointment and tell me when and where we have to go.
BEN	Listen to this. I got the placement in the Times...this is a match up of hope versus fear. Nine times out of ten the fear candidate tends to be the most experienced...but in our presidential races the least experienced candidate almost always wins. JFK versus Nixon...Carter versus Ford...Bush versus Gore...I like our chances with the new kid on the block, end quote. Thomas Fucking Duffy...he's gotta be having a stroke right now.
STEPHEN	So just call me when you can leave okay.
MOLLY	(Looking at the clinic) I hate this shit...
STEPHEN	I'll be back, this'll all be over...
MOLLY	Yeah...
PAUL	Absolutely -there's no question about it ....
PAUL	But we've got to think broader strokes here, rethink everything....uh-huh....Yeah, I know how to handle it....Look,Stevie just got here. Can I call you back in a few minutes? ..Okay, bye. (He hangs up) The Governor. We had a good long talk on the way back. He's up to speed with everything.
STEPHEN	How'd he take it?
PAUL	Better than I thought he would. Still won't take Thompson's endorsement.
STEPHEN	Paul-I gotta tell you something.
PAUL	What's up?
STEPHEN	Ida knows I met with Duffy.
STEPHEN	I don't know how she found out. Tried to blackmail me. Said she was gonna let the story out if I didn't tell her what happened at your meeting with Thompson.
PAUL	So it's gonna hit the papers.
STEPHEN	Probably. Yeah. Whoever she takes it to, they're gonna call me for a statement.STEPHEN	I could just deny the whole thing, but if they call Duffy and he admits to it, that could look worse. If I say no comment they won't let up.
PAUL	I leaked it to Ida.
PAUL	At the event.
STEPHEN	I don't understand.
PAUL	We made a deal.
STEPHEN	Paul...they're gonna print that story in the paper tomorrow morning.
PAUL	I know.
STEPHEN	But why? Why would you do that to me? Why would you do that to the campaign.
PAUL	The campaign will survive.
STEPHEN	Then why would you do that to me?
PAUL	Makes it easier to let you go.
STEPHEN	What?
PAUL	Why'd you meet with Duffy?
STEPHEN	I made a mistake - a stupid mistake.
PAUL	No Stephen. You didn't make a mistake. You made a choice. You called me and left a message to call back...that it was important. But when I did...you said to forget about it. You chose not to tell me. Why did you make that choice?
STEPHEN	I didn't think it was important.
PAUL	Sure you did. But you went because you were curious, because you were flattered. Because it made you feel special to think Duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me. Because you thought to yourself: maybe I can get something out of this. Because it made you feel big. First campaign I ran tiny little race in Kentucky -state senate seat. Workin for redneck nobody named McGuthrie. Had no money, no staff, no fuckin office. Everyone thought we didn't stand a chance. There's no way we can compete. And about this time, a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call. Says, "I really like what you were able to do for poor ole' Sam. But let's face it, he's a goner, so why don't you come work for me?" What do I do? Well Stephen -this is where you and I are different. I told Sam about the call. And Sam says to me, "Paul, you think this other's guy's got a shot at winning, and he can pay you more than anything I can afford, so if it's what you feel you need to do, then I won't get in your way." So I say, "Sam -you took a chance and hired me when I was even more of nobody than you are, and I'd be damned if I'm gonna jump ship just because the shit hit the fan." We lost the race, but three years later, when Sam decided to run for Governor -who do you think he called? We won that race.PAUL	And twenty years later I'm where I am now. (Beat) There's only one thing I value in this world Steve, and that's loyalty. Without it you're nothing and you have no one. And in politics it's the only currency that you can count on. That's why I'm letting you go. Not because you're not good enough. But I value trust over skill. And I don't trust you anymore.
STEPHEN	Well it really isn't whether you trust me, it's whether the Governor does.
PAUL	The Governor knows, he thinks it's the right thing to do.
STEPHEN	He does.
PAUL	If I were you? I'd get a good night sleep because you're gonna get fucking pounded by calls from the press in the morning...
NURSE	These are Vicodin...they're for the pain. You have Ambien...that'll help you sleep...and I threw in a couple of Xanax for the next couple of days. Did the doctor explain there would be some bleeding?
NURSE	Not much...and it shouldn't last very long. If it does you'll need to call us.
NURSE	Do you have a ride?
NURSE	Okay...if you need anything you just call the clinic...okay.
MOLLY	Okay.
DEBBIE DIXON	Yes Mike, Senator Franklin Thompson of North Carolina arrived at the Lunken airfield today igniting rumors of a deal in the works.BEN	Hey, where were you today?
MOLLY	I'm not feeling great Ben...
BEN	You picked a hell of day to call in sick...Jesus...fucking wild day...
MOLLY	Why?
BEN	Stephen's off the campaign. Paul fired him. Some fucking set up about loyalty and it looks like Stephen was doubling down with Duffy on the Pullman campaign. I was sitting in the room when Paul told Stephen that he was fired. Stephen said who's gonna take over and Paul said me...and I'm like...easy there soldier...but Stephen goes ape shit then Paul gives the speech about loyalty and then shits on Stephen like I've
NEVER SEEN	before...christ...humiliating shit.
MOLLY	When was this?
BEN	Molly listen to me...I'm gonna run the campaign under Paul...Stephen is going to Duffy. I just jumped three years ahead...so starting tomorrow morning we go into full damage control and I'm telling you Stephen's going ape shit...he said he's taking everyone down on his way out...Morris, everybody!
BEN	Shit I gotta take this. Do you need anything?
MOLLY	No.
STEPHEN	Where's Duffy...
STAFFER 1	You got an appointment?
DUFFY	Joe can you excuse us for a minute.
DUFFY	Not very bright, walking in here...
STEPHEN	I'm in. I'm coming to work for you.
DUFFY	A reporter at Roll Call phoned me this afternoon.
STEPHEN	I know who leaked it.
DUFFY	Who?
STEPHEN	Paul.
DUFFY	You told Paul?
STEPHEN	Yeah. I told him we met. He leaked it.
DUFFY	You shouldn't have told him that.
STEPHEN	I felt like I should.
DUFFY	I've worked with Paul. He gets paranoid.
STEPHEN	Obviously.
DUFFY	So he fired you.
STEPHEN	I quit.
DUFFY	You're lying to me...come on...
STEPHEN	I quit! And I can give you everything on Morris. Everything.STEPHEN	I can lay out his whole strategy for you.
DUFFY	I already know his strategy. Paul gave it all to Thompson.
STEPHEN	What if I had something else?
DUFFY	You'd do that to Morris? To Paul?
STEPHEN	Yeah.
DUFFY	Revenge makes people unpredictable Steve. I can't have someone who's unpredictable. Who's unstable.
STEPHEN	I'm not unstable.
DUFFY	If it had been a clean break -if you'd left Morris before this story broke, that'd be one thing. That we could control. But the way it'd look now -Paul fires you and then you come work for us. Looks like we're picking up the scraps. Puts Morris in the drivers seat. I can't have that.
STEPHEN	What if I had something big?
DUFFY	Like what?
STEPHEN	Something big. Something that'll bring Morris down.
DUFFY	What is it?
STEPHEN	(Shaking his head) Give me the job.
DUFFY	It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry. Go take a nice long vacation.
DUFFY	You're a smart guy Steve. Everything I said yesterday is true. But maybe politics isn't for you.
STEPHEN	Politics is my life.
DUFFY	Do yourself a favor. Get out now while you still can. Go into entertainment, or business, or open a fucking restaurant in Costa Rica - anything. Do what will make you happy. You stay in this business long enough it makes you jaded and cynical.
STEPHEN	Like you?
DUFFY	Yeah. Just like me.
STEPHEN	You knew I was gonna tell Paul.
DUFFY	I didn't know. I thought you might, but I didn't know.
STEPHEN	You knew if I told him he'd fire me.
DUFFY	Thing you gotta know about Paul- he's big on loyalty.
STEPHEN	Yeah I got a nice speech on that. You were never gonna hire me.
DUFFY	Put yourself in my shoes Steve. Your opponent has the best media mind in the country working on his team. What do you try to do? You either try to hire him yourself, or work it so if you can't have him, the other team can't either. This was a win-win situation for me. You work for us -great. Paul doesn't have you. Then again, if Paul fires you and I don't take you -fine - Paul still doesn't have you. Either way I win. The moment I got you to sit down in that chair, I knew I'd won.
STEPHEN	This is my life you're talking about.
DUFFY	It's not easy for me to do this sort of thing Steve. Don't think I take any pleasure in it. I'm sorry for you. I really am. Take care of yourself.
JANITOR	No ma'am she's not breathing...No nothing...
JANITOR	...I don't know, fifteen minutes...how far away are they?
JANITOR	Do you know her?
JANITOR	She's gone.
JANITOR	Hello...I'm sorry what? Yes I can hear them now...
PHONE	You have four new messages and four saved messages. First new message.
SENATOR THOMPSON	I want on the ticket...you need me on the ticket...and you need my delegates...you could use em before Tuesday. Make a fine story on the Sunday morning news cycle...so I expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow...or I endorse Pullman and take my cabinet seat.IDA	Is suicide ruled out?
REPORTER 5	Did you know her well Governor?
REPORTER 6	How long has she interned with you Governor?
PAUL	She'd only been on the road with us for a few weeks...maybe four I think, I can check.
IDA	Will you continue with your schedule today? You're set to tour Proctor & Gamble this afternoon.
PAUL	We will most certainly stay on schedule. This accident, and we have to assume for now it's an accident, is just simply a tragedy. The work, the schedule won't be altered. It just means that those of us that knew Molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart.
STEPHEN	Does it seem that way?
STEPHEN	What's say I do the talking and you do the listening.
STEPHEN	As of tomorrow morning there's going to be some changes in your campaign. Paul is out. I will be your senior campaign manager. I'll draft a statement, "we're at a point in the campaign where some changes have to be made etc." You can put your own words in there, you do it better than most.
STEPHEN	Because you want to win. Because you broke the only rule in politics. You want to be President, you can start a war, you can lie, you can cheat, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't fuck the interns...they'll get you for that.
STEPHEN	A troubled young pregnant girl...
STEPHEN	...Who needed cash for an abortion.
STEPHEN	Is that your best play?
STEPHEN	So how did I get here? You're right Mike, there's nothing. No phone messages, no text, no e- mails, no photos or tapes, and yet I'm standing right here.
STEPHEN	She left a note.
STEPHEN	I cleaned up your mess. I took her phone and I found her note.
STEPHEN	You tell me, you were the last one she called. Note says she was pregnant, said you were going to pay for her abortion...it also said she didn't want to hurt you.
STEPHEN	Because she's twenty.
STEPHEN	Paul's gone today. I set a meeting with you and Thompson where you promise him the ticket. You get three hundred and fifty-six pledged delegates, you get North Carolina, and then you take office and make right what so many have made wrong. All the things we both believe in.
STEPHEN	Four years, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
STEPHEN	Housekeeping, before you ended up on page one.
STEPHEN	I was fixing a situation...I got a call, someone from the hotel thought I could help and called me.STEPHEN	I loaned her some money and gave her a ride.
STEPHEN	Okay, there's no note.
STEPHEN	You think I brought it here? That's how people get hurt.
STEPHEN	It's your call Governor.
CHRIS MATHEWS	How much could a big shake up days before the Ohio primary hurt a campaign. I asked Paul Zara how his firing could actually help the candidate.
PAUL	The Governor and I both felt, that in light of some of these changing numbers, it was best to put a new face on the campaign...Stephen is very talented...very smart...
JACK STEARNS	You always hear people talking about events out of sequence...the order of things. There is no greater grief than a parent laying their child to rest...She was a little girl trying to make it in a very grown up world...a world were every mistake is magnified and she was smart and pretty and so so young.
PAUL	You should hire Jack for a speech writer.
STEPHEN	I'll keep that in mind. Are you here to talk to me?
PAUL	No. I'm friends with the family. I got her the internship...known her since she was born.
STEPHEN	I'm sorry.
PAUL	The Governor couldn't make the flight?
STEPHEN	He's meeting with Thompson.
PAUL	Look at you, all grown up with tits and all.
STEPHEN	I learned from the best.
PAUL	One day we'll grab a beer and you'll tell me what you had on the Governor that put me out.
STEPHEN	How do you know I didn't have something on you?
PAUL	You better get going, you've got a campaign to run and I've got offices to go look at.
STEPHEN	Farragut North?
PAUL	Nice consultant firm right off of K Street.
PAUL	A million a year and nobody to fuck you over.
STEPHEN	Sounds relaxing.
PAUL	Doesn't it.
SENATOR THOMPSON	And the right man to lead this great nation of ours in these challenging times and the next President of the United States of America, Governor Mike Morris!...And I ask only one thing, that all of us stand shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm in a united Democratic party.
DUFFY	No it's not decisive, we still have several contests and those states are going to want to have their say. It does look like we'll win Ohio...
RACHEL MADDOW	But you must concede that these three hundred and fifty-six delegates put the pledged delegates out of reach. And with word today that the super delegates are breaking three to one for Morris.
DUFFY	We still have a lot of contests Rachel, Ohio is-
RACHEL MADDOW	Well then do you have the funds? As we read it-
DUFFY	Of course we have the funds. We're getting new donations daily...
JILL	Hey...Ben...I was told to talk to you. I'm supposed to get a phone...
BEN	Right...you're....
JILL	Jill Morris...no relation.
BEN	Are you a Bearcat?
JILL	No...I'm from Columbus I'm a Buckeye.
IDA	You're making me look bad.
STEPHEN	How so?
IDA	I just filed a story that said you were off the campaign and Thompson was going to Pullman.
STEPHEN	You can't believe everything you read.
IDA	I want to give you an opportunity to comment on my next story. It says that you delivered Thompson...You got the three hundred and fifty-six delegates, you delivered the nomination. And all you asked in return was Paul's job. Any chance of you confirming that?
STEPHEN	No press beyond this point...she's press. I'll read about it in the funny papers.
IDA	Come on Stephen...aren't we friends anymore?
STEPHEN	You're my best friend Ida.
SOUND MAN	You should be able to hear them...do you hear them?
STEPHEN	Yeah I can hear them.
SOUND MAN	Good, quick mic check can you count to ten for me?
SOUND MAN	Coming to you in five...four...three...two...
JOHN KING	We now have Governor Morris's new senior campaign advisor, Stephen Myers, coming to us from Xavier University where Senator Thompson has just endorsed Governor Morris, essentially ending this primary race. (To Stephen) Stephen, can you give us some insight into how this whole thing unfolded?
