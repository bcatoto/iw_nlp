Moneyball

BILLY	It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on. It's no big deal.
SECURITY GUARD	No, it's okay, I don't need to watch it. The guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently turns in his hands -
BILLY	How's Meg?
SECURITY GUARD	She's good, thanks. - and the glass window of the bar behind him -
BILLY	And the boys?
SECURITY GUARD	They're good. Everybody's good.
BILLY	That's good. The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through the glass, but it doesn't happen.
BILLY	Night.
SECURITY GUARD	Night, Billy. It was a great season.
BILLY	Yeah...
BILLY	No. That would be, uh--
BILLY	Are you asking me to pick one?
BILLY	I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not thinking about either of those things.
BILLY	They were down two-love and then beat us three in a row. Trust me, the better team won.
BILLY	That sounds good.
BILLY	How about Oakland?
BILLY	Yeah.
BILLY	Yeah.
BILLY	Great. I'm on my way. Billy chucks the radio away. Gets back in the car, puts it in gear. HARD CUT TO --
BILLY	Is it Boston? You're talking to Boston? What are they offering?
BILLY	What?!
BILLY	You don't know that.
TICKET CLERK	You need to hurry.
BILLY	I don't know that -- since I don't know what they're offering.	What did she say?
TARA	She said we had to hurry up.
BILLY	Scott? Scott?
BILLY	What did they offer?
BILLY	Just to be clear -- they offered seven and a quarter.
BILLY	As opposed to you said seven and a quarter and they're thinking about it.
BILLY	I'm thinking I don't want to lose Damon, but I don't pay my whole infield seven million dollars.
TARA	We're losing Damon?
BILLY	Wait, don't hang up. Don't hang up --
TSA OFFICER 1	Is that phone still on?
BILLY	What's the difference?
TSA OFFICER 1	Faradie. Can his phone be on?
TSA OFFICER 2	Sir, you need to turn your phone off.
BILLY	It's already through.
BILLY	Seven point five?
BILLY	I'll talk to Steve.
TARA	Try to relax.
BILLY	(hitting speed dial on another number) A small emergency is starting to develop.
TARA	Try. Try to relax.
BILLY	You look fantastic today.
BILLY	Arn. Billy. We gotta talk about Giambi.
TARA	Wait, we're losing Giambi, too?
BILLY	We can talk now. We're talking now.
BILLY	Who are you talking to -- the Yankees?
BILLY	Don't hang up.	He hung up.
TARA	You found Giambi.
TARA	A thousand dollars says you don't get on the plane.
BILLY	Denise. Billy.	These guys are auctioning off my team one player at a time.	He's not in today, Billy.
BILLY	I know, I just want to send him flowers.
TARA	Flowers?
BILLY	Where would I send them?
BILLY	To Arn.
TARA	BILLY

BILLY	TARA

BILLY
TARA	BILLY
TARA	(hands him tickets)
BILLY
TARA	I'm picking up a guy at the breakfast buffet.
BILLY	A left-handed reliever if you can.
BILLY	How much longer you think?
GUEST	What?
BILLY	Nah, it's okay.
PHONE --
BILLY	Arn, I don't wanna lose him.
ARN
BILLY --
BILLY	I don't wanna lose him.
ARN	This is my nephew's Bar Mitzvah.
BILLY	He did well with his Torah portion I thought.
ARN	Thank you.
BILLY	What did they offer?
ARN	He's not staying in Oakland, Billy.
BILLY	What did the Yankees offer him?
ARN	It's New York; you've got to give a player a reason not to play there.
BILLY	What did they offer?
ARN	17 million.
BILLY	No way.
ARN	Yeah.
BILLY	I don't pay my whole infield 17 million dollars.
ARN	I know, I know...
BILLY	For how long?
ARN	17 a year for seven years.
BILLY	A hundred and twenty million dollars?
ARN	Hundred and nineteen.	You gotta get Steve to let you spend some money.
BILLY	That's pretty good advice, I should do that.
ARN	Steve doesn't get it. This isn't a charity raffle.
BILLY	Arn. I get it, he gets it, Jason gets it and you certainly get it. I'll talk to him.
ARN	And you're losing Isringhausen, too.
BILLY	Ya think?
ARN	I've gotta get back.
BILLY	Hey mazel tov, Arn.
ARN	Thank you. Good luck.
KID	Are you Billy Beane?
BILLY	Yes.
KID	That was a pretty serious choke.
BILLY	Are you from around here?
KID	Yeah.
BILLY	You a Dodger fan?
KID	Yeah.
BILLY	Here, drink a lot of this.
BILLY	We're losing Damon and Giambi. We can't survive losing Damon and Giambi.
SCHOTT	Isringhausen's gone, too, don't you think?
BILLY	I can win without a closer. I can't without power.
SCHOTT	So negotiate with them.
BILLY	I have. They want more.
SCHOTT	So offer them a little more.
BILLY	I have. They want more than a little more.
SCHOTT	Like what. What'll it cost - say - to keep Giambi?
BILLY
SCHOTT	17 for how many (years) -
BILLY	One.
SCHOTT	For one year? Billy nods. Steve smiles. And Billy knows what it means. It means, That makes it easy - there's nothing more to discuss on the matter.
SCHOTT	I have confidence you'll find a way to make it work without them.
BILLY	I can't.
SCHOTT	Sure you can.
BILLY
STEVE -
SCHOTT	Billy. What are we? The Taj Mahal? We're a small-market team. Obviously, we can't afford Giambi at such a (price) -
BILLY	Fine. He's gone. But I might - for a bit more than last year - be able to keep Damon in (Oakland) - (Steve is shaking his
HEAD NO)	I need more money, Steve.
SCHOTT	Billy...
BILLY	I can't compete against a hundred and twenty million dollar payroll with a forty million dollar payroll.
SCHOTT	We just won 102 games with a forty million dollar payroll.
BILLY	With Giambi and Damon. We wouldn't have without them.
BILLY	You can't ask me to be okay with losing. That's too much to ask a professional athlete.
SCHOTT
BILLY--
BILLY	It's too much, Steve!
SCHOTT	You're not a professional athlete!	You're a professional GM.	SCHOTT	We're a small market team. You're a small market GM. And I'm asking you to be okay with not spending money I don't have. And I'm asking you to take a breath and shake off the loss. And then I'm asking you to get back in a room with your people and figure out how you're going to replace these guys with the money I do have.	Got it? SCHOTT can go from milquetoast to ruthless in a blink and he just did.
BILLY	Scott. Billy.
BILLY	It's just my phone, it's about to die, but this'll be quick - listen - I'm losing my favorite prospects, but I got you the seven point five.
BILLY	No. No, you won't. I got it for you and we're done. Damon stays in Oakland.
BILLY	Whose number is that - seven point five. Mine?
BILLY	It's yours. So make your call, but don't play me, Scott. We have a deal. I won't be a stalking horse. The word stays in the - dictionary.
BILLY	Sorry, hon. I'm gonna need another day.
BILLY	You've got my suitcase?
BILLY	Why?
BILLY	(beat, can this get any worse?) Okay. Billy's cell phone rings --
BILLY	I gotta take this.
BILLY	Yeah.
BILLY	No, you didn't.
BILLY	No, I have Johnny for seven-point-five or he's not playing anywhere, because that's the deal --
BILLY	We had a deal.
BILLY	Why am I the ugliest girl at the dance, Scott? Why do I get the feeling I'm always gonna be a quarter million short?
BILLY	No, you played me. And you're playing me now. Congratulations, asshole. You win. Billy hangs up on him.
GRADY	Alright, guys... we had a great year. We won 102 games and we only came a buck short in New York. Now the bad news... we've got three big holes to fill.	Let's start with who we like for Giambi. We'll go around the room. Who you like, Matty?
KEOUGH	I like Geronimo. (approval from the
OTHER SCOUTS)	Guy's an athlete. This guy is big, fast and talented.
GEORGE	Six foot four.
PITTARO	Top of my list.
POTE	Clean cut, good face.
ARTIE	Good jaw. He's the real deal.
GEORGE	Five tools, good lookin'.
BILLY	Can he hit?
KEOUGH	He's a tools guy.
BILLY	Can he hit?
KEOUGH	He's got a great swing. Natural swing.
BILLY	So you're saying he can't hit.
KEOUGH	He can hit.
BARRY	The ball explodes off his bat.
ARTIE	It's exciting. When he hits it sounds like he's droppin' a firecracker at his feet.
PITTARO	Down in the pisser you can hear that sound.
BARRY	Sounds like Mays, Mantle, Aaron...
BILLY	That's not what I asked. I asked can he hit.
KEOUGH	He's a good hitter.
BILLY	If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit good?
KEOUGH	He needs a little work. He'll be able to hit. He could be a great hitter.
BILLY	Right... we put him up against big league competition and suddenly he'll be able to hit.
GRADY	Artie, who do we like?
ARTIE	I like Perez. He swings like a man.
KEOUGH	He swings like a man who swings at too much.
ARTIE	There's some work needs to be done. I admit it. He needs to be reworked a little. But he's noticeable.
GRADY	He's notable?
ARTIE	No, he's noticeable. You notice him.
KEOGH	He's got an ugly girlfriend.
BARRY	What's that mean?
KEOGH	Ugly girlfriend means no confidence.
BARRY	Alright. That's true.
PITTARO	I agree with Art. I like the way he walks into a room. Kid's so confident his dick gets there two minutes before he does.
GEORGE	Passes the eye candy test. He's got the looks, he's ready to play the part. He just needs some playing time.
KEOUGH	I'm just saying, his girlfriend's a 6.
BARRY	Billy, if you want to talk about another Giambi, this guy could be it.
GRADY	Is that a suggestion, Billy?
BILLY	Guys, stop. You're talking like this is business as usual. It's not.
GRADY	We're trying to solve the problem.
BILLY	Not like this. You're not even looking at the problem.
GRADY	We not only have a very clear understanding of the problem we now face, but everyone in this room has faced similar problems countless times before.
BILLY	Good. What's the problem?
GRADY	The problem is that we've lost 3 key players that we now have to replace.
BILLY	Uh-uh. What's the problem?
PITTARO	The problem is the same as it always is; we've got to put a team together with what we've got.
BILLY	Uh-uh. What's the problem?
BARRY	We've got 38 home runs to replace, 120 rbi's, 47 doubles...
BILLY	Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game. There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet of crap and then there's us. And now we've been gutted. We're organ donors to the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys and the Yankees took our heart. And now I'm listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like you're looking for Fabio. Is there another first baseman like Giambi?	Is there?
BILLY	Then stop looking for one because what we'll surely wind up with is the McNuggets version of Giambi.
GRADY

GRADY
BILLY	Don't attack the man, attack the argument.
PITTARO	(to the room) I think he just won the argument.
BILLY	What if we've been wrong this whole time about what ingredients manufacture a win? What if this whole time we thought it was the chicken that made the chicken soup taste good when really it was the onions that made the chicken soup taste good? Onions are a lot cheaper than chicken, you see what I'm saying?
POTE	I don't have the first idea what you're saying.
BILLY	We gotta start over. We gotta rethink this thing. We gotta look where others aren't looking.
GRADY	With all due respect, we've been doing this for a long time.
BILLY	That doesn't mean you're doing it right. Do you watch nature docs? You know what happens to the runt of the litter? He dies. I'm open to any solution, as long as it's not what the other guys are doing.	Now, I'm going to Cleveland to poach an outfielder named Brandon Garcia --
TBD SCOUT	Hold on -- You're going to Cleveland for a double-A guy?
GRADY	Billy, I've seen Garcia. He's got a bad body. It's not a pretty sight.
PITTARO	Kid wears a large pair of underwear.
KEOGH	That is a big boy.
GRADY	He's not just big, but kind of doughy. A fleshy kind of body.
BILLY	Oh, you mean like Babe Ruth.
SCOUTS	He's no Babe Ruth.
PITTARO	When he walks, Billy, his thighs stick together. There's enough friction there to start a bonfire.
KEOGH	If you saw him, I'm telling you, you wouldn't want to go to Cleveland.
BARRY	Billy, can I make a suggestion? If you could get Ricardo Rincon... he'd be worth the trip to Cleveland.
GEORGE	That would solve our left handed reliever problem.
BILLY	Really?
SCOUTS	Yeah.
BILLY	I should get Rincon?
SCOUTS	Definitely.
BILLY	Okay. I'll also come back with Joe DiMaggio and Ty Cobb. And who would like a Faberg� egg? Guys, you aren't hearing me -- in what universe can we afford Rincon?	I'm asking you guys to look at this game differently than you've ever looked at it before. I'm going to Cleveland.	BILLY	And when I come back, I want you to tell me something I don't already know. I want to question everything. We've got to rethink this game. As he exits --
BILLY	And Grady? Nobody cares about a 102 win season. Billy storms out.
KEOUGH	What's a Faberg� egg?
BEFORE--
SABATINI	This is the guy.
MARTINEZ	He's got a great path. I love the extension in his swing and the backspin he creates.
SABATINI	That's some amazing power right there, huh?
MARTINEZ	Good approach, great balance. How's he compare to the others around the country?
SABATINI	He's number one. Let's just hope he's still there when we pick.
MARTINEZ	This guy'll go in the first round.
SABATINI	Billy. I'm Sabatini, Area Scout, New York Mets. Can we get a couple minutes of your time, find out more about you?
BILLY	Of course.
SABATINI	I'd like to introduce you to Tom Martinez.
MARTINEZ	Very impressive performance today. In my job as the national cross-checker for the New York Mets, I see the top 200 players in the United States. It's been a while since I've seen a five tools guy, the complete package. Your throwing ability, your fielding skills... Ed told me you had power but I had no idea it was of the light tower variety. I hope you're as interested in professional baseball as we are in acquiring you in the upcoming draft.
BILLY	Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with my parents, decide if baseball is something I want to do full time. I have a scholarship to play football at Stanford.
MARTINEZ	Well, Billy, we're certainly looking forward to meeting your folks and talking to them as well. And we believe in college, but that's something you can do in the winter months. You need to know the sky's the limit with your ability. You could be a superstar before you've even graduated. But to get to that level, you need to work with our people. Pro-ball is where you need to be to develop the skills God gave you.
ASSISTANT	Mr. Beane? Mark's ready to see you now.
SHAPIRO	So Billy, what are you looking for?
BILLY	50 million in additional payroll.
SHAPIRO	Try Giambi.
BILLY	Ouch.

BILLY	You have any outfielders I should be looking at?
SHAPIRO	To replace Damon?
BILLY	Yeah.
SHAPIRO	That's a tough one Billy.
BILLY	Yeah. Who do you got?
SHAPIRO	The guys you might be able to afford? Hollins, Garcia... Coste.
BILLY	Tell me about Garcia.
SHAPIRO	To replace Damon?!
BILLY	Is he healthy?
SHAPIRO	He had a back thing, some minor surgery, but he's okay. Petey?
PETEY	He'll be good by Spring Training.
BILLY	He'll do. I can give you Guthrie for him if you kick in some cash.
SHAPIRO	Mark Guthrie?
SHAPIRO	How much are you thinking?
BILLY
SHAPIRO	Sorry about that. So... Garcia is going to be a no. What else are you thinking about?
BILLY	Let's make it work, I'll go straight up with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker. Shapiro looks to Bruce, Peter is covering his mouth with his hand but we can just barely hear him whisper the word 'no'. Bruce subtly shakes his head to Mark.
SHAPIRO	Sorry Billy, who else you interested in?
BILLY	Hey.
PETER	Hi.
BILLY	Who are you?
PETER	My name is Peter Brand.
BILLY	What do you do?
PETER	I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro.
BILLY	So what do you do? (pointing at co-
WORKER)	Hey, mind your own business.	What do you do?
PETER	Mostly player evaluation right now.
BILLY	Why does Mark listen to you?
PETER	Actually he rarely does.
BILLY	He just did.
PETER	I don't think he was really listening to me in there per se.
BILLY	Really?
PETER	Yeah, I think he was listening to Bruce.
BILLY	Who are you?
PETER	Peter Brand.
BILLY	I don't give a rat's ass about your name.
BILLY	What happened in there?
PETER	I'm not sure what you're asking me.
BILLY	What did you tell Butch?
PETER	Huh? Oh Bruce? I told him I like Garcia.
BILLY	Why?
PETER	Probably for the same reasons you do.
BILLY	Meaning what?
PETER	He's undervalued. You were smart to go after him.
BILLY	What makes him undervalued? Peter is stuck. He can't bring himself to say anything. After a long beat Billy nods to him in a way that seems to say, `I understand, it's okay'.
BILLY	Come on. Billy makes a strong gesture indicating Peter to follow. Which he does. They exit the offices into
BILLY	Where you from Peter?
PETER	Maryland.
BILLY	Where did you go to school?
PETER	Yale.
BILLY	I hate Yale.
PETER	Why?
BILLY	Kid from Yale once blocked a trade I was trying to make. What'd you study?
PETER	Economics.
BILLY	What are you doing in baseball?
PETER	I love baseball.
BILLY	I'm just curious. Why were you so cagey in there?
PETER
BILLY
PETER

BILLY
PETER
BILLY

BILLY
PETER
BILLY
PETER	The goal shouldn't be to buy players, what you want to buy is wins. To buy wins, you buy runs. You're trying to replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at Johnny Damon and they see a star worth seven point five million a year. When I look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from.
PETER	He's got a good glove. He's a decent leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's not worth the seven point five million Boston is paying him. You're lucky to have him off your payroll, it opens all kinds of interesting possibilities.
BILLY	You read Bill James, Pete?
PETER	Yes. These ideas and this approach to the game aren't all new. In fact, some of them have been around for two decades.
BILLY	If this approach has been around for so long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing them?
PETER	That's a much more difficult question than how to win baseball games. Once you begin to pull at that string, your understanding of the world might begin to unravel. The elevator door closes.
MOTHER	Billy? They're here.
JONGEWAARD	Billy... Good to see you again. Obviously you're a very special player. We'd like to compliment you on your high school career, and we're looking forward to you being a part of the Mets family. Jongewaard sits at the kitchen table, speaking more to Billy's parents than Billy himself --
JONGEWAARD	There's good -- and there's premium. Your son is premium. He has it all -- power, speed, the arm. The Look -- and I'm never wrong about that. Which is why this is a premium number. He sets a contract on the table. Clipped to its top- sheet is a check. On its left-hand corner is the Mets insignia; on the right, the amount: $125,000. They all see it. A lot of money in 1980. Silence. Then --
MOTHER	Billy's been offered a scholarship to Stanford.
JONGEWAARD	I know. And that's a great accomplishment. I'm sure you're very proud of him.
MOTHER	So he can accept that, go there, and then -
-	Jongewaard is already shaking his head no.
JONGEWAARD	I understand how important college is. I do. But what I can't do is burn a second first-round draft pick on someone who can't play for four years -- no matter how good he is. Four years is ample time for someone to get hurt. It happens all the time. So, no. I'm sorry. It has to be one or the other. To postpone four years is four years he could be in big leagues. The sooner he gets there the sooner he can reap the benefits. Stanford or The Money. Young Billy regards the check, and then his parents. He really doesn't know what to do.
JONGEWAARD	We're going to give him a different kind of education. This won't be his life's career, it'll be his first career. He's going to be a young guy in the business world when his baseball career is done. He'll still have his whole life ahead of him.
FATHER	It's your decision, Billy. Whatever you decide is fine with us.
INTERCUT WITH
PETER	Hello?
BILLY	It's Billy Beane.
PETER	What time is it?
BILLY	I don't care. Would you have drafted me in the first round?
PETER	What?
BILLY	After I left you ran me through your computer, right? Would you have drafted me in the first round?
PETER	You were a good baseball player.
BILLY	Would you have drafted me in the first round?
PETER	I'd have drafted you in the ninth round. No signing bonus. You'd have passed and gone to Stanford.
BILLY	Pack your suitcases.
PETER	Why?
BILLY	I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians. BILLY hangs up the phone. He sits all alone for a moment.
BILLY	Good evening.
PETER	Good evening.
BILLY	I asked you to do three.
PETER	Yes.
BILLY	To evaluate three available players.
PETER	Yeah.
BILLY	And how many did you do?
PETER
BILLY
OKAY--
PETER	51, I don't know why I lied just then.
BILLY	Talk me through the wall. PETER gets up and gives BILLY a tour of the dry erase boards.
PETER	This is the American League West. This year we're going to need to win between 97 and 101 games to make the post season. Here's the number of runs we'll need to score in order to win those games and here's the number of runs we can allow.

PETER	A doctor named Semmelweiss showed that if the attending physicians and nurses sterilized their hands before delivery, the mortality rate dropped to 1%.
BILLY	And he was vilified?
PETER	He was institutionalized. For suggesting that washing your hands before putting them inside someone else's body was a good idea. High functioning people can live under the spell of an inexplicable mental lapse when they think as a group. Why isn't anybody else doing it? Because they don't think guys who look like you are what win baseball games. They know it for sure.
BILLY	Alright, let's find our team.
BILLY	Nervous?
PETER	No??
BILLY	Huh. Interesting. Peter doesn't know what to make of that.
BILLY	Hey, Art.
ART	Can I talk to you a second before you get started.
BILLY	I got a lot to do.
ART	I know. Whatever it is, Billy knows it can't be as dire as his other problems, but also knows that to ignore Art would be to insult him. He gestures for Peter to go into the scouting room alone. He'd rather not, but does. The scouts, assuming perhaps he's there to make coffee, ignore him. He finds a place to sit in a corner.
ART	Who's the kid?
BILLY	That's Peter.
ART	I can't manage this team under a one-year contract.
BILLY	Sure you can.
ART	No I can't.
BILLY	I've got to put a team on the field, then I'll deal with your contract.
ART	How about you deal with the manager's contract and then put a team on the field?
BILLY	At the moment, if a ground ball is hit to first base, nobody's going to be there to stop it from rolling.
ART	I have to tell you it's not easy doing what I do under the cloud of a one-year contract.
BILLY	I know. I been there.
ART	I know you have. And a 1-year contract says the same thing to a manager as it does to a player: There's not a lot of faith there. Which is strange after a 102-win season.
BILLY	If you lose the last one of the season nobody gives a shit about the others.
ART	It's on me now?
BILLY	It's on me, Art!	And the kid's the new assistant general manager.
ART	What the fuck are you about to do?
GRADY	How did it go in Cleveland?
BILLY	It was cold. The news bothers no one.
GRADY	Let's get after our relief pitching problem.
BILLY	We got Chad Bradford. Right-hander. Few, if any of them, have heard of Bradford and begin leafing through their printouts and notes.
GRADY	Submariner?
BILLY	That's the one. Technically an underhander.
GRADY	What's his velocity?
BILLY	Unimpressive.
ARTIE	About 85.
GRADY	Does he have a good breaking ball?
BILLY	Doesn't have one.
GRADY	Why do you like this guy?
BILLY	Well, he gets people out.
ARTIE	The left-hander hitters get a really good look at him.
GRADY	He's down there. He's down there real low, too.
BILLY	Let's move on.
GRADY	Well, we, I think, have fared better. We have some ideas for what to do about Giambi.
BILLY	Knock me down.
GRADY	We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A big heart in the last year his contract. Tend to play hard. We usually get a pretty good year out of them. Make up for some of the offense we lost. (puts more names up) Or the other option. Just a thought. We go for a high-maintenance guy. A guy that's a little difficult but talented. A guy like Milton Bradley. Well, not like Milton. Milton himself. Which do you want to talk about first?
BILLY	None of them.
BILLY	You're still looking to replace him; you're just saying it another way.
BARRY	We got some trades here.
BILLY	We can't do it. What we can do is recreate his value to us in the aggregate.
GRADY	The (what) -
BILLY	Giambi's on-base percentage was .477. Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless his heart - was .291. Add that up and you get -
PETER	You want me to speak?
BILLY	When I point at you, yes.
PETER	Ten-ninety-two.
BILLY	Divided by three -
PETER	Three-sixty-four.
BILLY	That's what we're looking for. And that's what we'll find. Three players whose average OBP is -
PETER	Three-sixty-four.
ARTIE	That doesn't come out right.
BILLY	You gotta carry the one.
ARTIE	Still don't look right.
BILLY	It's right.
GRADY	Billy?
BILLY	Yes.
GRADY	Who's that?
BILLY	That's Peter.
GRADY	I don't know how to say this delicately - but does - Peter - need to be here?
BILLY	Yes.
POLONI	What's with this on base percentage obsession? Is that Bill James bullshit?
BILLY	You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for all I care.
BILLY	So here's who we want. One.
BILLY	Jason's little brother Jeremy.
BARRY	He never comes home from the games.
POLONI	Billy, if I may, he's had his problems on the field -- not to mention his problems off the field -- not to mention he's getting a little thick around the middle -- there's the stuff with the weed. He's at strip joints...
GRADY	This guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole officer for Christ's sake.
BILLY	His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs $285,000 a year.
GEORGE	He can't catch a ball in the outfield. I've seen him lose a ball in the moonlight.
BILLY	David Justice.
GRADY	Ten years ago he was a big name. He's going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year. But by June he's not going to be hitting his weight.
PITTARO	He's 36!
ARTIE	His legs are gone. He's a defensive liability. I question whether the bat speed is still there.
BARRY	Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline he's willing to eat up half his contract to get rid of him.
BILLY	That's good.
HOPKINS	He's a fossil. With all due respect, bringing these three guys aboard is like putting bubble gum on a flat tire.
GRADY	And why do we want to be the ones to bail Justice out of his contract?
PETER	He gets on base.
GRADY	I got 37 free agents who are better than those guys.
BILLY	Scott Hatteberg.
POTE	Who?
BILLY	Exactly. Sounds like an Oakland A already. Yes, he's got a little damage in his elbow.
GRADY	Some damage? He can't throw.
BILLY	We're not interested in him for his arm anymore than we wanted Giambi for his.
GRADY	Wait, you're talkin' about Hatteberg at first?
BILLY	Yes.
HOPKINS	He's a career .260 hitter and the good part of his career is over.
BILLY	I say it's just starting.
PITTARO	Well, Billy, you'll like the sound of this... I hear Boston wants to cut him and no one wants to pick him up.
BILLY	That's good news for us. He's cheap.
GRADY	Let me understand this. At first base you want a guy who's been cut from half of the minor league teams in the country due to irreparable nerve damage?
BILLY	He can't hit and he can't field, but what can he do?	Look at the piece of paper or I'm going to point at Peter.

WASHINGTON	Billy, I just don't see it.
BILLY	That's okay, Wash. We won't be victimized by what we see anymore.
WASHINGTON	I understand what you're saying about their averages, but there's something you're forgetting. None of them plays first base.
BILLY	I haven't forgotten that, Wash. One of them is going to have to learn.
WASHINGTON	Learn.
BILLY	You're going to have to teach him.
WASHINGTON	Teach.
BILLY	Instruct.
WASHINGTON	Which one?
SCOTT	Hello?
BILLY	Scott?
SCOTT	Yes?
BILLY	It's Billy Beane. Oakland A's. SCOTT was expecting that it would be someone else...
SCOTT	Yes?
BILLY	Can we talk?
SCOTT	Yes.
BILLY	You want to invite me in?
SCOTT	What?
BILLY	I'm outside. I can see you in the window. SCOTT goes to the window and cups his hands against the glass to see outside.
ELIZABETH	Honey? Two silhouettes are standing on the edge of the fairway. One of them waves.
BILLY	Thank you, ma'am.
WASHINGTON	Thank you, ma'am. She leaves her husband with the two men but listens in on their conversation from the next room, nibbling on a cookie of her own.
BILLY	You've played catcher your whole life?
SCOTT	Since I was 8. BILLY produces a baseball from his windbreaker and hands it to SCOTT. SCOTT can only manage to grip the baseball like a claw. Washington looks to heaven.
BILLY	How's the elbow?
SCOTT	Good. Real good. It's great.	I can't throw at all.
BILLY	Yeah, don't worry about it. You've thrown your last baseball from behind the plate. I want you at first.
SCOTT	I've only ever played catcher.
BILLY	You're not a catcher anymore. If you were, then mine wouldn't have been the only call you got when your contract expired at midnight.
SCOTT	I appreciate it but--
BILLY	You're welcome.
SCOTT
YOU SEE--
BILLY	You don't know how to play first base.
SCOTT	That's right.
BILLY	It's not that hard. Tell him, Wash.
WASHINGTON	It's incredibly hard!
BILLY	Anything worth doing is. Wash is gonna teach you.
SCOTT	Wait a minute, what about--
BILLY	Jason's gone, Scott.
SCOTT	I'm taking Giambi's spot at first? What about the fans?
WASHINGTON	Yeah, maybe I can teach one of them.
BILLY	The fans don't run--	--GOOD ONE--	(back to SCOTT) --the fans don't run my ball club.
SCOTT	They're gonna hate me.
WASHINGTON	(motioning to BILLY) No, they're gonna hate him.
BILLY	The fans love me.
WASHINGTON	Okay.
BILLY	Hello.
HATTEBERG'S DAUGHTER	Hi.
SCOTT	That's our youngest daughter.
BILLY	Great.
SCOTT	Do you have kids?
BILLY	--yeah, I have a daughter.
BILLY	This is a contract for you to play baseball with the Oakland A's. A copy's on its way to your agent. Discuss it with your wife and let us know. (They get up and Billy calls off) Thanks for the cookies, ma'am. We see ELIZABETH with tears running down her face...then go back to the living room--
BILLY	(on his way out) Merry Christmas.
BILLY	Hi.
SHARON	Hi, Billy. She pulls the door open so he can come in. As he does -
BILLY	She home?
SHARON	She's out, but she'll be home soon.
ALAN	Yeah, no, don't worry about it sweetie. Here's mom. Alan hands Sharon the phone.
BILLY	Hey Alan.
ALAN	Come on in have a seat. Want some coconut water? It's really refreshing.
BILLY	I'm all set, thanks.
ALAN	What are you benching now?
BILLY	I don't keep count.
ALAN	Well, whatever it is, it's working. You look good.
ALAN	I haven't got to see you since the playoffs in New York. That was heartbreaking, Billy. We were rooting for you.
BILLY	Yep.
ALAN	You know what I say?
BILLY	Fuck `em.	I'm sorry Alan, what do you say?
ALAN	No, I just wanted to say that a lot of teams don't get that far, and to make it that far is a really big accomplishment.
BILLY	So how is she?
SHARON	She's great. Be here in a minute. How's the team shaping up?
BILLY	New beginnings. Blue horizons.
ALAN	I read that you lost two players. Damon
AND -	ALAN	Ghee-ambi?
SHARON	Giambi. Wow, that's tough. That's really tough.
BILLY	And Isringhausen.
ALAN	Sounds tough.
BILLY	So where is she?
ALAN	I just talked to her on her cell. She's just coming up the hill, she's two minutes away.
BILLY	You bought her a cell phone?
SHARON	Yeah.
BILLY	At 12?
ALAN	Just for emergencies. I'm sorry, we should have consulted you for that
DECISION-
BILLY	It's probably a good idea.
SHARON	But actually I called you - The front door opens. It's Billy's daughter Casey - a pre- teen indie-rock girl - and not a moment too soon. He's up quickly to give her a hug and to get out of here.
BILLY	Let's go shopping.
BILLY	You want one with nylon strings, right?
CASEY	I like the red ones.
BILLY	How about this?
CASEY	Yeah, that's cool.
BILLY	Let's try it out over here.
BILLY	Casey.
CASEY	Yeah.
BILLY	You got good.
CASEY	I've just been playing a lot.
BILLY	That's... that's not the way most 12 year olds play.
CASEY	Alan thinks I should have a better teacher.
BILLY	Who's Alan?
BILLY	Oh, yeah. Mom's Alan. What's wrong with the teacher you have now?
CASEY	Alan thinks I should be working more on technique so I don't learn bad habits.
BILLY	Well, you seem to be doing just fine to me. Do you like playing?
CASEY	I love it.
BILLY	That's so great. I'm so happy for you. The most important thing in life is to find something you love and do it well. Do you like your teacher?
CASEY	Yeah.
BILLY	Okay, I'll talk to Mom and Alan. Do you like that guitar?
CASEY	Yes!
BILLY	That the one?
CASEY	Yeah, I think so.
BILLY	Let's get it. Let's get it now.
CASEY	Really?
BILLY	Merry Christmas.
LEGEND: 1984	BILLY's at the plate, a batting helmet snug around his head, wearing a METS uniform, as a 97 mph fastball buzzes by him and the UMPIRE calls--
UMPIRE	Striiike! BILLY steps out of the box, taps the dirt off his cleats and steps back in. A younger-looking SHARON is sitting in field level seats, looking on nervously and trying not to show it. BILLY half-swings at the breaking ball, holding his swing at the last minute.
UMPIRE	Striiike! And Billy's out. SHARON holds her head in her hands and BILLY walks back to the dugout, passing a player with "STRAWBERRY" on his back. And now the quick scenes of failure become staccato--
LEGEND: 1985	BILLY playing for minor league Tidewater and he grounds
OUT AND
LEGEND: 1986	BILLY playing for minor League Toledo. He swings and pops up lamely to the PITCHER, throwing his bat down in frustration as he jogs hopelessly to first and we
LEGEND: 1986	BILLY playing for the Minnesota Twins where he comes back into the dug out and throws his batting helmet down and
LEGEND: 1987	BILLY playing for minor league Portland and a water cooler goes flying across the dugout and
LEGEND: 1987
LEGEND: 1988	BILLY playing for the Detroit Tigers and the bat rack gets heaved across the field and
LEGEND: 1989
UMPIRE	Strike! Billy breaks the bat over his thigh and drops the pieces on the plate. He begins to walk off.
UMPIRE	Hey Billy, clean up after yourself. Billy hears him but continues to walk off.
PETER	How'd it go?
BILLY	How'd what go?
PETER	Hatteberg.
BILLY	He can barely hold a baseball. But he's our guy now. Billy sits.
BILLY	Who's that?
PETER	That is Kevin Youkilis. This is the guy we want more than anyone else in the world. Billy watches the guy on the screen. He's an overweight right-handed batter with a peculiar stance.
PETER	He can't run, throw or field. But he walks more than anyone in baseball except Barry Bonds. Take out intentional walks and it's more than Bonds. He's the Greek God of Walks. On the TV, the batter takes another pitch just off the edge of the strike zone.
PETER	I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last June. He said he waddled like a duck. Boston took him. Boston won't let him go yet. They're going to wait and see. They watch him lay off a pitch an inch outside the strike zone. Peter gives Billy a look that says, You see that?
PETER	You all right, Billy?
GRADY	Can we talk a minute?
BILLY	Yeah.	Yeah.
GRADY	Your boy and I had a talk while you were in Tacoma. I didn't like much of what I heard.
BILLY	No?
GRADY	No. You got a kid in there with a Yale economics degree and a scout out here with 29 years baseball experience and you're listening to the wrong one.
BILLY	I don't listen to anyone, you know that.
GRADY	This isn't a joke.
BILLY	I'm not joking.
GRADY	This isn't how you run a ball club, with a computer. You know that. You're a baseball man. There are intangibles that only a scout can see in a player that you're not going to pick up with just numbers, with someone who doesn't play the game, who knows nothing about the game but how to feed numbers into a computer.
BILLY	That's what we're doing. That's exactly what we're doing.
GRADY	If this is what baseball is, if it's not Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two bad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had one swing left in that body... a computer wouldn't do that. They would have had him sitting up in the stands.
BILLY	A computer doesn't romanticize the sport. Leave that for the fans.
GRADY	Well, romance and the fans, it's called a love affair with the game and it's been going on for one hundred and fifty years.
BILLY	I don't want to hurt you love affair with the game. Just because we've been doing it one way for a hundred and fifty years doesn't mean we've been doing it right. You have any idea how long people thought the sun revolved around the earth? To your eyes it looks like that's what's happening.
GRADY	You're saying everybody's been wrong? Everybody?
GRADY	Are you saying everybody's been wrong?
BILLY	Yes. Maybe.
BILLY
GRADY
BILLY
GRADY
BILLY	GRADY	BILLY
GRADY	GRADY	You're making it impossible for yourself to get another job once Schott fires you after this catastrophic season you're setting us all up for and you're gonna have to explain to your wife and your kid why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.
BILLY	I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.
GRADY	Go fuck yourself, Billy.
BILLY	Well now maybe. GRADY takes off. BILLY stands there a moment. On his way out, passing Art's windowed office, he exchanges a look with the manager. Billy takes a short walk to where a few of his scouts are standing around an arcade console. To the youngest one -
BILLY	Eric. You never even played high school ball, right? The young scout shakes his head, embarrassed.
BILLY	Grady's gone. You're the new Head Scout. Billy turns away and is headed back to the video room. Pokes his head in.
BILLY	Don't try to explain things to scouts. They're not programmed to get it. It's just us. He leaves. Peter watches the door close, then glances back to the tape as Youkilis takes ball four and waddles down to first base.
SPORTS REPORTER	Billy, will the fans still come out now that you've lost Giambi?
BILLY	I don't know, Graham. Will they listen to your insipid radio show?
BILLY	Well, we didn't pay him for his defense. Art and Washington hit grounders to Carlos Pena and Scott Hatteberg. Hatteberg miraculously gets his mitt on it.
BILLY	That's the way, Hatte. Pickin' Machine. Behind a portable backstop, a guy with a radar gun gets ready to clock a trio of relievers. Mike Magnante has his pant legs pulled up to adjust knee-braces. Magnante gets up and begins throwing, increasing his velocity each time.
BILLY	None of those broke 85.
BILLY	Chad I have high hopes for. Bradford overthrows his first submarine hand-scraping- the-ground pitch, and the ball sails wide of the catcher. Somebody ducks. Art Howe glances with a long-suffering look to Billy.
BILLY	It just got away from him. They watch David Justice do wind sprints.
BILLY	He's still got it. Then Justice stops, winded.
BILLY	It's the first day of week one. There's nothing to judge yet.
ART	I can judge it and so can you. First base is the moon to him.
BILLY	It wasn't to Giambi? He's the worst first baseman in baseball. What do you think of him, Wash?
WASHINGTON	The nicest way I can put it is, he lacks confidence.
BILLY	Work with him Wash.
WASHINGTON	I'll do that, Billy, but we've got Pena who can play first. And he's looking pretty good out there.
BILLY	I want to make it work with Hatte, Wash.
ART	Not to mention we already have a first baseman.
BILLY	A rookie first baseman. It's not the same.
ART	Number 11 on the Top 100 Prospects list.
BILLY	Lists aren't baseball.
ART	Catchers at first base aren't baseball. Who's idea was this? Peter's?
BILLY	Hatteberg will be fine, Art.
ART	He will be fine, you're right. Pinch hitting while Pena plays first base.
MAGNANTE	Yeah... been doing it for way too long.
HATTEBERG	How long does it take?
MAGNANTE	When I first started these things? It was like a half hour process. Now I can knock these suckers out in 30 seconds, no problem.
TEJADA	Is a dollar, mang.
JUSTICE	What?
TEJADA	Always been like that here.
JUSTICE	You're kidding me, right?
TEJADA	Welcome to Oakland. BILLY and PETER walk through. He walks past CHAD BRADFORD's locker...
CHAD	Excuse me, Mr. Beane.
BILLY	Hey Chad.
CHAD	I hope I'm not disturbing you.
BILLY	You're not, what's up?
CHAD	I wanted to say thanks for the opportunity.
BILLY	It's gonna work out well for both of us.
CHAD	Nobody in the major league ever took me seriously.
BILLY	Nobody?
CHAD	Just you, sir.
BILLY	Okay.	It's a big day, you won't forget it.
CHAD	I'm going to pray for you and your family. PETER follows BILLY out of the locker room.
MONTAGE:	It's fifteen minutes before the game as some executives have their picture taken on the field with BILLY.
BILLY	Hey, great to see you. Thanks for coming out. Got a good box? You want a picture? Sure, let me step in there. Great, big smiles now. Big smiles. Know what I like about opening day? Everyone's even. Thank you. You all enjoy the game. BILLY gets his picture taken with KIDS from an area Little League team. He's laughing and being a good host.
BILLY	Hey, how you guys doing. So you won? That's great. What position are you? How's your fastball? 92? Alright, should we get a pic?
ELIZABETH	Hi, I'm Elizabeth.
TARA	Hi. Tara. Which is yours?
ELIZABETH	Scott Hatteberg. Catcher - actually first base - actually we don't know. Yours?
TARA
ELIZABETH	Mr. Beane? Tara nods.
ELIZABETH	He's a saint.
TARA	Really?
JOURNALIST	Are they picking up your option for next year? A beat.
ART	I brought it up to them during the off- season, and I still do not have my option.
JOURNALIST	Are you frustrated?
ART	I think it's fair to say that.
BILLY	Okay, good.	I'm heading in.
PETER	Why?
BILLY	I don't watch the games.
PETER	Is this a joke? BILLY shakes his head "no". PETER gestures "What the fuck are you talking about?"
BILLY	I don't know what you're miming.
PETER	I'm miming "You don't watch the games?!"
BILLY	This is my team. And they've taken the field. They're world class athletes who are fighting for their lives and I stand with them. Except not literally so I need you to text me what Art does. BILLY walks out onto--
"643 DBL PLAY"	The blackberry goes crashing into the wall and blows apart.
BILLY	Yeah. I should have made you a bigger part of the conversation, I should have had you in the scout meetings from the first day, that way you would have understood this better and that was another mistake, I take full responsibility.
ART	What are you trying to say?
BILLY	It doesn't matter what moves I make if you don't play the team the way I need them played.
ART
BILLY -	You are out of your depth.
BILLY	Why wasn't Hatteberg at first?
ART	Because he can't play first.
BILLY	How do you know?
ART	Not my first baseball game.
BILLY
ART--
ART	Scott Hatteberg can't hit.
BILLY	He gets on--
ART	And his defense--
BILLY	Still keeps us in the plus column and we only need to be 7 over 500.
ART	Anything else?
BILLY	Yeah, I would have rather seen Chad Bradford in there at the end than Magnante.
ART
BRADFORD'S--
BILLY	I don't care about righty/lefty.
ART	I do.
BILLY	This is about your contract?
ART	No, you've made it clear what you think about that. This is about you doing your job and me doing mine. Mine's being left alone to manage the beer league team you assembled for me.
BILLY	I didn't assemble them for you, I assembled them for me.
ART	No shit.
BILLY	I want you to go on the road with the team.
PETER	You don't go on the road with the team.
BILLY	That's why I want you to do it.
PETER	Why don't you?

PETER	Those are my only choices?
BILLY	Go on the road with the team.
DAVID	How come your boss doesn't travel with the team?
PETER	He doesn't like to mingle with the players.
DAVID	Makes us easier to cut? PETER doesn't say anything...
DAVID	He's gonna make some moves if we keep losing. PETER gives a small "Yeah" shrug...
DAVID	How come soda costs a dollar in the clubhouse?
PETER	Billy likes to keep the money on the field.
DAVID	Soda money?
DAVID	Where on the field is the dollar I pay for soda?
PETER	It's hard to see.
DAVID	(shaking his head) Alright.
PASSENGER	Hey, aren't you Billy Beane?
BILLY	Yeah.
PASSENGER	Shouldn't you be at the game?
BILLY	Nope. CASEY emerges from the gate, sees her father before he sees her and runs to him. They hug.
CASEY	Hey, Dad.
BILLY	Hey, honey... I'm glad to see you.
PETER	It's not a big enough sample yet. I want to wait until we play more games.
TV ANNOUNCER	And Justice hits into the 6-4-3 double play to end the game... The INDIANS trot on the field to high-five each other.
BILLY	Do you want strawberry or vanilla?
CASEY	Both.
BILLY	Don't tell your mother.	If you could only have one ice cream for the rest of your life, which would you choose?
CASEY	Vanilla. Definitely vanilla.
BILLY	Interesting. Chocolate sauce?
CASEY	Yup.
CASEY	Dad... if you could choose between the power of invisibility or flight, which would you choose?
BILLY	Flight. Yeah, I'd wanna fly. You?
CASEY	I think I'd want invisibility.
BILLY	Really? Why?
CASEY	I don't know. People wouldn't notice me as much.
BILLY	Why wouldn't you want people to notice you?
CASEY	I don't know.
BILLY	Well, I guess you could sneak up on people. Or eavesdrop on their conversations. You could be a spy.	So how's school?
CASEY	My teacher's kinda mean. She doesn't like us to ask questions.
BILLY	What kind of teacher doesn't let you ask questions?
CASEY	I know, right? Mom was mad, too. She thinks maybe I should be home schooled.
BILLY	Wouldn't you miss your friends?
CASEY	Yeah. But the other kids are mean.
BILLY	There are always going to be bullies. Try not to let them get to you. But let me know if it's becoming a problem.
CASEY	Can I ask you a question? Are you still chewing tobacco?
BILLY	Yeah...
CASEY	Please stop.
BILLY	I know, it's terrible. Look, I promise I'll quit in November if you promise not to worry about it.
CASEY	Pinkie swear?
BILLY	Pinkie swear.
PETER	Theoretically, when we've played more games the numbers will become more
REPRESENTATIVE OF--
BILLY	Theoretically?
BILLY	Alright. Be good.
CASEY	Okay.
BILLY	I feel like--
CASEY	You feel like what?
BILLY	I don't know, did we talk enough this time?
CASEY	About what?
BILLY	Anything. Did we talk about the things you want to talk about, did we have fun?
CASEY	Yeah!?
BILLY	Okay.
CASEY	I love you, Dad.
BILLY	You're doing it right now.
CASEY	What?
BILLY	You're worrying about me.
CASEY	Sorry.
BILLY	Do I look like I'm worried?
CASEY	Yeah.
BILLY	`Cause you're getting on an airplane and those things crash all the time. Will you please stop worrying about your father? You're a kid, I can't have it.
CASEY	Okay. Can I worry about the airplane now though?
BILLY	Absolutely. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches --
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	We're all set.
BILLY	Great. There's a slightly awkward moment and CASEY isn't sure whether she's supposed to hug her father again and so they do a sort of half-hug.
BILLY	I love you. BILLY watches her go off with the attendant, feeling like it was an unsatisfying visit. He looks at his blackberry-- 3-2. Magnante in.
BILLY	No! WHY IS HE IN THERE?! EVERYONE in the area stops to look at the madman.
BILLY	(to the people looking at him) No no. I'm alright.
EMPTY STANDS--
ANNOUNCER	Art Howe is the only manager in baseball who has to think about pinch running his leadoff hitter. Down in the Visitors' pen, Chad sits with Mike Magnante.
MAGNANTE	Why do you do it?
CHAD	I can't not do it.
MAGNANTE	How do you do it? Every ball park's different.
CHAD	I take that into account and adjust the distance of my steps.
MAGNANTE	Exactly seventy-four, from the pen to the mound.	MAGNANTE	You should get that looked at, man.

SCHOTT	Give me a date, give me a time frame.
BILLY	Where do we expect to be mid July All Star break?
PETER	Our goal and our expectation by the All Star break is to be within seven games of first place.
BILLY	That'll keep us in the hunt.
PETER	And that would be this working exceptionally well.
SCHOTT	7 within 500. By July. And what's going to keep us from getting there?
BILLY	Nothing Steve.
SCHOTT	Nothing. We're 3 for 17 right now. You've got to be able to give me a little bit more to go back to my partners with.
BILLY	Listen, you hired me to do this job and that's where we're going to be.
SCHOTT	That's not good enough.
BILLY	Well, let's go buy Barry Bonds, then. This is the team we've got and this is the team we'll win with.
SCHOTT	Billy, put yourself in my shoes. What do you imagine is going to happen if things don't turn around?
BILLY	It's very clear, Steve. If I put myself in your shoes, I'd spend another 20 million on the team.
SCHOTT	We don't have another 20 million
BILLY	I'm just kidding, Steve, I'm just kidding. We've got the team.
SCHOTT	I gotta be honest with you, Billy, I wish you had a little more worry and a little more fear. Because things aren't going in our direction right now.
BILLY	162 games Steve.
SCHOTT	Let's hope the next 30 are better than the last 30.
BILLY	I don't need to hope.
SCHOTT	All right fellas. Let's go try and win one. We're in May, we've got til July.
BILLY	We're not gonna lose three at home to the Orioles.	BILLY

ART	Part of the conversation? I've heard enough of the conversation and I disagree with you, plain and simple. Moreover, I strongly believe that you're in the middle of experiencing some sort of personal crisis and you seem indifferent to the fact that you're taking a whole organization down with you. I'm playing my team in a way I can explain in job interviews this winter. Some As players arrive in the dugout, causing Billy to hold his tongue. He simply says -
BILLY	Hatte, not Pena.
ART	It's just one game.
BILLY	That's the point, you think?
ART	The point is always tomorrow's game.
BILLY	No, the point - as you said - is to win. I don't like sharing the cellar with Texas, do you? We hear FUNK MUSIC begin to play in the distance.
ART	I'm doing the best I can with what I've got. I'm playing the players I've got.
BILLY	I'm through talking.
JEREMY	Yeah! He's not even aware of Billy. It's just like any other night as far as Jeremy Giambi is concerned. He dances to a CD of funk music as he dresses, until he becomes aware of Billy standing there, and smiling, he kills the music.
JEREMY	What?
BILLY	Getting swept by the Red Sox at home. Having Long lead off the ninth with a triple in a one-run game and not being able to score a runner from first with nobody out, is that fun?
JEREMY	No.
BILLY	Then what the fuck are you having fun for?!	This is what losing sounds like. He heads out.	Billy?
BILLY	Yeah?
PETER	Cruz -- .283, .347, .476. Stevens -- .244, .349, .560. Miner -- .272, .349, .499. Hanson -- .280, .363, .450. Baretta -- .273, .354, .497. Durazo -- .292, .395, .621. What do you think?	Billy?	I don't know where I am.
PETER	You okay?
DRIVING --
SHARON	Have you thought about what you might do if baseball doesn't work out?
BILLY	What?
SHARON	That was too abrupt.
BILLY	No.	What?
SHARON	If baseball doesn't work out. Have you thought about what you might do?
BILLY	The game's only been over for three hours, I haven't had that much time to think about it.
SHARON	Sure.	Maybe real estate.
BILLY	I'll be honest, if I don't make it in baseball I don't think I'm going to be able to afford much real estate.
SHARON
I MEANT--
BILLY	I know what you meant.
SHARON	It's just a slump, right?
BILLY	No.
SHARON	You're saying every scout was wrong?
BILLY	You're kind of saying it too.
SHARON
BILLY--
BILLY	Honey...don't you think you should divorce me now while you're young?
COMMENTATOR	When a science experiment fails in a lab, things blow up.
IN BLACK:	Problems are the price you pay for progress. - Branch Rickey
BILLY	Get me Wade.
PETER	Why.
BILLY	Get him.
PETER	Why.
BILLY	Get him.
BILLY	Ed. Billy. I need some help on defense and I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi for it.
PETER	No, you (aren't) -
BILLY	(ignoring Peter; to
WADE)	Who you got?
PETER
BILLY
BILLY
BILLY	(put the call on
HOLD)
PETER
BILLY
PETER
BILLY	(into the phone)
BILLY
BILLY	I do. His career is stagnant, to put it nicely. Can we say it's done in theory and start drawing up paperwork?
BILLY	Great.
PETER	I think he was going to say something else.
BILLY	Peter. Rule Number 3: When you get the answer you're looking for - hang up. That's done, and in a minute Pena's going to Detroit.
PETER	I don't think you want to do that.
BILLY	Art can't put him at first if he's playing for the Tigers and I want Hatte in the lineup tonight.
PETER	Maybe you should think about this. You're upset and this is - this -
BILLY	What am I missing?
PETER	It's just a very hard move to explain. People are going to think you've lost your mind.
BILLY	Why's that a problem Peter?
PETER	Don't make an emotional decision Billy.
SUZANNE	David Dombrowski's on 3.
BILLY	Sometimes you have to shake it up.	David, Pe�a's going on the blocks, you're my first call... because he's making the rest of the team look bad... He's going to be rookie of the year...
PETER	(not eager to help but...) Probably an all star.
BILLY	He's an all star Dave... (winks at Peter,
LISTENS)	It's more like he's creating self-esteem problems for the other guys... No, I'm looking for a reliever and some cash... Ok... five minutes Dave, I'm not waiting.	What's the problem?
PETER	(trying to slow it
DOWN)	Billy, Pe�a is an all star. If you dump him, and if Hatte doesn't work out, you know, this is the kind of decision that gets you fired.
BILLY	Why you worrying about my job?	You worried about my job or yours?
PETER	I'm worried about yours.
BILLY	Well you should be worrying about yours because if this thing we're doing don't work... neither of us have jobs.
PETER	That's probably true.
BILLY	In which case I'm a 44 year old guy with a high-school diploma and a daughter who I'd like to be able to put through college one day. (lets it sink in) You're 25 years old with a degree from Yale and a pretty impressive apprenticeship.	I don't think we're asking the right question. I think the question we're supposed to be asking now is, do you believe in what we're doing or not?	It's a problem that you think we need to explain ourselves. Don't... to anyone. I'm going to see this through, for better or for worse. Just tell me, do you project we'll win more games with Pe�a or Hatteberg on first?
PETER	It's close Billy but theoretically Hatteberg.
BILLY	What are we talking about then?
BILLY	Dave.	That works. Great. There's just one more thing I need. I don't want the guys paying for soda--I want you to stock my soda machine for three years. Uh huh, uh huh, great... then that's a deal.
PETER	That was thoughtful.
BILLY	Yeah. Okay. You gotta tell Pena to pack.
PETER	You want me to tell Pena he's been traded?
BILLY	Be a man.
PETER	What about Jeremy? Am I telling him, too.
BILLY	No. I'll do that.
PETER	Hey, Carlos.
PENA	Yeah.
PETER	Can I get a moment with you?
PENA	Sure.
PETER	Okay, maybe we can talk over here. They walk awkwardly to the players' lounge.
PETER	Have a seat. They sit.
PETER	So, um, Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers. This is the number of Jay Palmer, their travel secretary. He's expecting your call. He'll help you arrange travel to Detroit. Pena sits and stares at him. It's excruciating for Peter, awkward, until --
PENA	Is that all?
PETER	Yeah.
PENA	Cool. Pena just takes it. Picks up the number and leaves.
BILLY	Mind if I have a seat.
ART	Please.
BILLY	You can't start Pena at first tonight, you'll have to start Hatteberg.
ART	I don't want to go 15 rounds, Billy, the line-up card is mine and that's all.
BILLY	The line-up card is definitely yours, I'm just saying you can't start Pena at first.
ART	I am starting Pena at first.
BILLY	I don't think so, he plays for the Detroit Tigers now.
ART	You traded Pena?!
BILLY	Along with German, Hiljus and Jeremy Giambi.
ART	You are outside your fucking mind. Art stares at him in a silence broken by Jeremy Giambi knocking on the open door.
BILLY	Jeremy, come on in. Billy jots a phone number on an A's Post-It and hands it to him.
BILLY	This is Ed Wade's number. You know him? Art looks sick.
JEREMY	No.
BILLY	Phillies General Manager. Real nice guy. Give him a call - he's expecting it - say hello - then talk to Futterman about arranging a flight for you.
JEREMY	The what?
BILLY	The flight. To Philadelphia.
BILLY	It's been a real pleasure, Jeremy. I mean that. You're a great ballplayer and great guy.
BILLY	We're going to miss you.
BILLY	Adkins is gone, too.
ART	You're killing this team.
BILLY	Art? I can do this all day long.
ART	What are you looking at?
PETER	I'm not looking at anything.
ART	You went along with this? You agree with this bullshit?
PETER	A hundred percent.
TEJADA	Keep your head up, okay? It's part of the business. You're gonna be a great player, okay?
PENA	Thank you, man.
TEJADA	Don't let this bother you at all. Chad Bradford --
CHAD	Nice to meet you, brother. Take care and... God bless you, man.
PENA	Thank you. Scott Hatteberg --
HATTEBERG	You're the best first baseman here. It's not right, Carlos.
PENA	Thank you, Hattie.
HATTEBERG	Yeah.
BILLY	Scottie H.!
SCOTT	Yes sir.
BILLY	Go out and field some grounders.
BILLY	Everybody, listen up. You may not look like a winning ball team. In fact, you look nothing like a winning ball team. But you are one. So play like one tonight. You'll get further instructions tomorrow.
BILLY	Okay.
BILLY	No more bunts.
CHAVEZ	No more bunts?
BILLY	A bunt is an out. You're paid to avoid outs, not make them.
CHAVEZ	A bunt isn't an out. It's a sacrifice.
BILLY	A bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters. You're not a pitcher, Chavvie, so what are you saying?	Until the third out, anything can happen. After the third out, it's over. You gotta protect your outs like they're your children. Every out's precious, don't give `em away.
BILLY	Another thing -- you should see more pitches. We wanna get into their bullpen. Deep into their bullpen. We want to see 100 pitches by the end of the 5th inning. You wanna get your at-bats off their 10th and 11th pitcher.
ELLIS	You want us to walk more. How much more?
BILLY	Pete?
PETER	At least once every ten at bats.
ELLIS	Or...?
BILLY	Triple-A Sacramento's only 80 miles away. And there's no flights. (as they look to
PETER)	Don't look at him. Here's the deal. I'm not interested in what you think you know about baseball, or what you think I don't know about it. I'm not interested in guts or heart or determination or anything else the fans or your mothers love about you. I'm interested in you getting on base. If you do that, we win. If you don't, we lose. And I hate to lose. I hate to lose more than I need to win. There's a difference.
PETER	Every at bat is like a hand of blackjack. Every card that's dealt, your odds completely change. For instance, every first pitch strike, your batting average goes down about 75 points.
BILLY	75 points.
PETER	75 points. Every first pitch ball, it goes up about the same amount. So you gotta lay off the first pitch.
BYRNES	First pitch curveball or first pitch fastball?
PETER	First pitch period. When you swing at the first pitch you're batting .140.
BILLY	We want to see more pitches.
DYE	How many pitches?
PETER	Every starter, we want to see 100 pitches by the 5th inning.
DYE	So... 5, 6 pitches per at bat?
PETER	Yeah. I mean, Hatteberg drained 38 pitches.
BILLY	And Byrnsie, you're hackin' at everything. You're all squirrely out there. Wait for your pitch, man. This is a war of attrition. There's no clock on this thing. Wait `em out. Let them make the mistakes. And when your enemy's making mistakes -- don't interrupt them.
PETER	Basically, these are all your at bats. This is you versus righties, you versus lefties... and then, of course, all your count knowledge, okay? In an 0-0 count you're batting .290. In an 0-1 you average .238. In a 0-2, .159. When you're 1-0, you're batting .324. Understand what I'm saying?
DURHAM	Not really.
PETER	I know, it's a lot of math. When your first pitch is a strike, your batting average goes down about 70 points.	PETER	When it's a ball, it goes up about 30. If you draw a ball on your first pitch, you're unstoppable. If you strike on the first pitch, you might as well be jumping off cliff. I'm trying to get you to lay off the first pitch.
DURHAM	But I'm a first pitch hitter. I like to swing at fastballs.
PETER	And that's the way you've been trained. But it's a habit we'd like to break you from. We're trying to design the game to your strengths. This has nothing to do with you being a great hitter -- you're a great hitter. We just want to get you on base.
DURHAM	But if I get my pitch, I'm gonna swing at it, no matter what the count is.
PETER	I'm not worried about you crushing the ball out of the park. I just want you to lay off anything that will result in a strike.
DURHAM	I guess I'll have to watch some film and take a look at it.
PETER	Absolutely. The video room is open to you any time, I'm always available.
PETER	-- But seriously. Make him use up all his bullets.
BILLY	Yeah, make him work.
HATTEBERG	So... Mr. Beane?
BILLY	Billy's fine.
HATTEBERG
BILLY --
BILLY	Nah, make it Mr. Beane.
HATTEBERG	Mr. Beane --
BILLY	I'm screwin' with you, Haddie.
HATTEBERG	So we just don't steal?
BILLY	That's right.
LONG	That's what I do. That's what you pay me to do.
BILLY	No, I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second.
LONG	I don't get thrown out much.
BILLY	I don't hit on 17 at the blackjack table, but if I did, the odds would be the same.
PETER	You've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17 tries this season.
LONG	I get 11 of 17. That's not bad.
BILLY	You just handed them an out. Protect your outs like they're your children. There's no clock on this game. Until the third out, anything can happen. Get on base and let the next guy move you up. Pass the torch, pass the torch. We're like a machine. A run making machine.
JUSTICE	What's your biggest fear?
SCOTT	A baseball being hit in my general direction.
JUSTICE	That's funny.	No, seriously.
SCOTT	Seriously.
BILLY	Hey, Dave. I've been thinking... I want you to --
JUSTICE	You gonna teach me something?
BILLY	Excuse me?
JUSTICE	I've never seen a GM talk to players.
BILLY	You've never seen a GM who was a player.
JUSTICE	Huh.
BILLY	Is there a problem?
JUSTICE	It's okay, man. I know your routine. It's a patter, it's rap, it's for effect. That's okay. But it's for them, it's not for me.
BILLY	You're special?
JUSTICE	You're paying me 7 million bucks so I guess I am a little.
BILLY	As a matter of fact I'm not paying you 7 million bucks, David. The Yankees are paying half your salary. That's what the New York Yankees think of you.	BILLY	They're paying you three and a half million dollars to play against them.
JUSTICE	Where are you going with this, Billy?
BILLY	You're almost 37, Dave. Almost as old as me. Let's be honest with each other about what we each want. I want to milk the last ounce of baseball you have left in you, and you want to stay in the show. So let's do that. I'm not paying you to be the player you used to be, I'm paying you to be the player you are now. You're smart, you know what's going on here. I need you to set an example for the younger guys. Take a leadership role.
BILLY	We're cool?
JUSTICE	We're cool.
BILLY	All right.
BILLY	You know -- the Yankees are coming to town. If it were me -- I'd want to take that three point five and shove it up their ass. But I'm a competitor.
JUSTICE	You know, I got a couple World Series rings. I think I'm a pretty good competitor, too.
BILLY	You want another one?
ANNOUNCER	Tejada taking a big lead off first, eyeing the steal--
BILLY	Don't do it, Migs.
BILLY	Thank you.
PETER	Did you hear that?
BILLY	I heard 7 in a row. Billy clicks off the TV and it's very quiet. Billy is scrolling down numbers that show trends and comparisons of all of the A's relief pitching.
BILLY	Can you show me righty-lefty matchups for the division and overall versus Mariners? Peter reaches over and with a few clicks produces new columns of numbers, upon which Billy darts his eyes as he scrolls through them. Finally -
BILLY	Okay. He gets up and heads out.
BILLY	Voos.
VOOS	Billy.
BILLY	(pointing back down
HALL)	That smell is getting worse.
VOOS	I'm on it, Billy.
BILLY	What are we doing tonight?
HERNANDEZ	Splitting the plate in half.
BILLY	Both sides. (to Hudson, playing
CARDS)	Huddy, you gotta mix it up tonight. Trust your slider.
HUDSON	Yes sir.
BILLY	(to the others) You guys stop distracting him.	Chavvie -- you couldn't hit that shit with a boat paddle last night. You gotta see more pitches. Patience.
CHAVEZ	You got it, Billy. As Billy crosses through the weight room --
BILLY	Hey David --
JUSTICE	Hey, man.
BILLY	Great at bats. Really. Quality.
JUSTICE	Thank you.
ART	Come in. BILLY does. He's going to try to do this nicely.
BILLY	How are ya?
ART	Good. You knocked.
BILLY	I did, and I hope you take it as a show of respect.
ART	We'll see.

BILLY	If we have a lead late in the game and they have runners on base, I'd rather not see Magnante out of the bullpen.
ART	I'll make that decision when the time comes.
BILLY	That's what you should do. Baseball's a game of situations and you should make the decision when the time comes. Except you should make it now.
ART
LOOK--
BILLY	Don't bring Magnante out if we've gotta hold a late lead with runners on. He's 37, he's scared shitless of being the guy who blows this winning streak.
ART	You think a lot of yourself, don't you?
BILLY	I......think the regular amount of myself. Magnante on the other hand, he doesn't think very much of himself at all, and when he tightens up we've got ourselves an adventure. So I'd like to see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight when we're in, let's say, just to make it easier for you, any situation. Righty/lefty, two outs, no outs, the umpires have decided we're going to finish the game by playing darts, whatever. Bradford's the first guy out of the pen.	Okay?
ART	I could've coached you up, you know.
BILLY	I don't think so.
ART	You think you went as far as you could have?
BILLY	Yeah, that's what I meant. Play Bradford. BILLY steps out of Art's office into--
UMPIRE	You can't be in there, Billy. BILLY doesn't move. He just watches ART as he comes into the dugout.
UMPIRE	Billy? The PLAYERS are watching to see what's going to happen. BILLY puts his hand on ART's shoulder a second as he says-
-
BILLY	Just nod a little bit--not too much--like I'm assuring you you didn't just make a calamitous vocational decision.
UMPIRE	Players and coaches only, Billy.
BILLY	(ignoring the umpire-- still quietly to
ART)	Remember that in about four seconds-- BILLY sees one of the nearby TV cameras pivot over to catch this conversation--
BILLY	--yeah there it is. We're the lead story on Sports Center now so let me be brief. First of all, that was an awfully costly fuck-you, wouldn't you say?
ART
LOOK--
BILLY	Second of all, genius, those boos? They're for you. Drink up.
UMPIRE	Come on, Billy.
BILLY	Get me this game back. As BILLY passes MAGNANTE he pats his back before we--
VOOS	You want one, Billy?
BILLY	I'm good, Voos. Thanks.
BILLY	Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.
PETER	Are you thinking Rincon?
BILLY	Yeah, he's lost faith for the season. I think he's gonna dump him.
PETER	Hardcore. They wait as Suzanne dials the Indians' GM, staring at the speakerphone that sits like a little island in the middle of the conference table.
SUZANNE	Shapiro on two.
BILLY	Mark. Billy. Let's be honest. A premiere setup man is not going to get you any closer to the playoffs.
BILLY	He's a luxury you can't afford.
BILLY	By at least one, you mean one? Who is it?
PETER	San Francisco.
BILLY	I'll call you back.
PETER	What do you think we can get for Magnante?
BILLY	Nothing. (continues to stare
DOWN PETER)	What's left on Venafro's contract?
PETER	Two-seventy-five.
BILLY	Suzanne -- get me Sabean.	If we can get San Francisco interested in Venafro, Shapiro's only got one buyer for Rincon.
PETER	Us.
SUZANNE	On three.
BILLY	Sabes. Billy. You like Venafro. I can let you have him for almost nothing.
BILLY	Because I'm amazing.
BILLY	All I want is a couple of bucks and a sweetener. Throw in, say...
PETER	Anderson.
BILLY	Anderson.
BILLY	No, you don't. I don't even like him. I don't know why I'm doing this -- but let's do it anyway. Venafro for Michaelson?
PETER	Anderson.
BILLY	Anderson. See, I don't even know his name.
BILLY	Think about it and call me back.
BILLY	Get Shapiro back on.
SUZANNE	Two!
BILLY
MARK --
BILLY	You sure about that? I get the impression the market for Rincon is softening. I could be wrong. Call whoever's interested and make sure they're still interested. And call me back.
BILLY	What about the Mets for Venafro?
PETER	You just offered him to the Giants.
BILLY	Suzanne -- Steve Phillips! Get me Steve Phillips.
BILLY	Between Bonds, Nen, Kent and Snow, they're never gonna do it.
PETER	Totally agree.
BILLY	We just need them to cool on Rincon.
SUZANNE	Phillips on two.
BILLY	Steve-O. Billy. I hear you're looking for a left-handed reliever. What do you think of Venafro? I can make it quick and easy for you.
BILLY	No angle.
BILLY	Hang on a second.
PETER	Bennett maybe?
BILLY	How old?
PETER	Twenty-six.
BILLY	Twenty-six and in Double-A? Forget it.
PETER	Duncan? No. Cerda? No. Furbush?
BILLY	Furbush?	No.
PETER	Eckerton? Eckerton. Eckerton, that's the guy.
BILLY	Eckerton.
BILLY	You don't even know who Eckerton is.
PETER	Hello?
PETER	Oh, hi.
BILLY	No, he's not hurt. He's fine. This is just a situation for us.
PETER	It's Steve.
BILLY	I'm on with Steve.	Not his fault. We misused him.
PETER	Steve Schott.
BILLY	Tell him to hold. (to Steve Phillips) Look. Steve. Here's the deal. I'm being straight with you. I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal. It's done.
BILLY	No, the Giants want Venafro. And I told them they can have him for Michaelson...
PETER
ANDERSON --
BILLY	-- but I'd rather deal with you. Because you can give me Eckerton and two hundred and twenty-five thousand cash and the Giants can't.
PETER	Yes, I understand it's impolite to keep you holding.
BILLY	Of course. Think. But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro.
PETER	He hung up.
BILLY	If you could have the power of flight or invisibility, which would you choose?
PETER	What?
BILLY	Invisibility or flight?
PETER	Invisibility.
BILLY	That's what Casey said. Why?
PETER	You'd have total access. Besides, everyone else would choose flight.
BILLY	Why isn't anybody calling?
SUZANNE	Shapiro's on two.
BILLY	Great. Lemme talk to my owner. Call you right back.	Get Steve.
PETER	Phillips or Schott?
BILLY	Why would I call Phillips back? Schott. Tell him I'm on the other line.
PETER	Right.
PETER	Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. Sorry I left you on hold. Billy asked me to call you back. He's on another line.
BILLY	Tell him we need two hundred and twenty- five grand for Rincon.
PETER	Billy says he needs two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo Rincon. Please?	Yes, I added the please. (listens; to Billy) No.
BILLY	Tell him I'll pay it, but when I sell him next year for twice that, I keep the money.
PETER	Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself, sell him next year, and keep the profit.
PETER	Okay. Thank you.	He says he'll pay for Rincon.
BILLY	Great! Shit. What are we forgetting?	Get me Shapiro!
BILLY	Wait, never mind! (beat, then into
PHONE)	Mark. Yeah, it's Billy. Here's the deal. I don't want Rincon pitching against me tonight. Tell him to change his clothes. I got you the money and I accept your gratitude. It's done.
BILLY	We gotta let someone go. It's Mags. It's gotta be Mags.
PETER	I call not it.
BILLY	Art. Billy. The good news is Ricardo Rincon's heading over to the clubhouse. The bad news is you got to tell Mags he threw his last pitch for the Oakland A's last night.
BILLY	What do you mean, no.
PETER	It's not the phone's fault. Suzanne, we're gonna need a new speakerphone.
BILLY	We gotta catch Mags before Rincon comes over. He leaves.
BILLY
MIKE --
MAGNANTE	Hey, Billy. I know I've been struggling lately. But we're coming into the home stretch, and I promise I'm gonna turn it
AROUND --
BILLY	-- I need you to stop getting dressed. Magnante isn't sure he heard right, but the silence tells him he did. Eventually -
MAGNANTE	Traded?
BILLY	I'm sorry for the crap news. I know it hurts.	Mike. I can't have 26 guys in the clubhouse.
MAGNANTE	Alright.
BILLY	Thanks.
BILLY	Hey, Ricardo.
RINCON	Hola, senor.
BILLY	Hola. Hey, I know this must seem a bit sudden, but the Oakland A's have been trying to get you for a long time. You're gonna love it here. The guys are fun.
PETER	Muy divertido.
RINCON	I pitch tonight?
BILLY	I don't know if you're gonna pitch tonight. But you're on our team tonight.
RINCON	I no wanna pitch tonight.
BILLY	Right. So... where you from?
RINCON	Veracruz, Mexico.
BILLY	Well, you're a lot closer to home. Why don't you hang out there for five menudos and we'll get you a uniform and everything. (to side room) Hey guys, clear the room, huh? Say hi to Ricardo Rincon. As the other players file out and say hello...
BILLY	Tara and me were thinking --
CASEY	Dad... Tara and I --
TARA	She is correct.
BILLY	Tara and I were thinking about going to Point Reyes to the beach.
CASEY	That'd be fun.
TARA	Me go, too?
BILLY	And I'll work on my grammar.
CASEY	(beat, then) Dad... are you going to lose your job?
BILLY	What? Where did you hear that, honey?
CASEY	The internet.
BILLY	No, I'm not going to lose my job. Don't go on the internet or watch TV or read the papers or talk to people.

PETER	This is a chart of what you should and shouldn't be swinging at. These circles represent different pitches. Red is hit, blue is out, yellow's missed or foul, green is chased, white taken. This is you versus Conway. What do you see?
HATTEBERG	I'm chasing a lot of high and outside.
PETER	The red is where most hits happen. That's where you want to be swinging. You don't want to be swinging at the junk at the top of the strike zone. We'd rather take those strikes, `cause you're not going to hit `em out of the park. And you're good about that, patient.	PETER	Right now you're averaging about 4 pitches per at-bat.
HATTEBERG	4 per bat?
PETER	Yeah, and that's great. One of the reasons why we love you. You're draining a pitcher's pitches. Now, guys like Bonds and Jason Giambi average a little over 5. That's top tier. Does this chart make sense to you?
HATTEBERG	Yeah. I'll get on base more if I lay off anything high. This is awesome. So you have a breakdown of this from every game?
PETER	Every game. Your instincts are in the right place. This isn't something they teach you in little league. This is something fundamental we're looking for -- how to wear out a pitcher's arm. If you're about to face Conway and wondering what you should and shouldn't swing at, come in here and watch how you're tending. You can click on any one of these pitches and watch it happen. Pretty great, right?
HATTEBERG	Show me some of the stuff I'm chasing up high... TIME LAPSE of hundreds of at bats registering and changing modalities to produce graphs and numbers. PULL OUT to reveal we're now in
PETER	Everybody thinks the first pitch is what's most important, but it's not. It's the first two out of three pitches that matter the most.	PETER	The difference between 1-2 and 2-1 is the difference between a scrub and an All Star.
BILLY	So you're saying if we can get our guys to lay off the first pitch it'll put us in the driver's seat?
PETER	Any sort of extra discipline in the first three pitches will help us. A game is on TV in the background. Billy makes various comments the the screen --
BILLY	That's a problem right there. Terrance jogging to first.	Mr. Justice. That's what we pay you for.	Chad Bradford, you deceptive son of a bitch, I love you.	He's a pain in the ass, but that Giambi gets on base. Another train of thought --
PETER	Hatteberg once had 18 walks in 30 at bats.
BILLY	My whole career I only had eighteen walks.
PETER	Actually... 11.
BILLY	Shut up. And now we have QUICK SCENES OF BILLY TAKING PLAYERS
ASIDE --
BILLY	Migs, let's make a deal. I'll pay you fifty bucks for every away fastball you hit to opposite field, but you've gotta pay me fifty for every one of those you pull.
BILLY	Hey, T. Did your car get egged?
LONG	Yeah.
BILLY	I think I just got an e-mail from the culprit. He said he was tired of paying good money just to watch you jogging around the bases.
LONG	What the hell does that have to do with anything?
BILLY	I don't know, man. Don't worry about it. Billy exits. Long calls after --
LONG	Who brings eggs to the ballpark anyway?!
BILLY	Man, you're not fooling anyone but yourself out there. You're falling further and further behind. In your mind, what's the problem? Mecir mumbles something.
BILLY	I can't understand you with your hand over your mouth.
MECIR	Sorry, Billy. It's just, the smell...
BILLY	Right?	It's that. And it's growing. They stare at the stain in silence. Finally --
MECIR	I'm gonna grab a shower.
BILLY	Yup.
BILLY	Hey, Scottie. What's on your mind?
HATTEBERG	I feel like I'm hurting the team. At first base I'm making a lot of errors. I'm gonna cost us a hundred runs.
BILLY	16.5 actually. But as a hitter, you will create 70 runs. 70 runs wins us an awful lot of ball games. I can live with that. Can you live with that?
HATTEBERG	I appreciate that, but I know you're just pulling those numbers out of your ass.
BILLY	I'm pulling them out of Pete's, actually.	And another thing. When a guy reaches first base, be social.
HATTEBERG	Social?
BILLY	Like a greeter at the Gap. A guy steps into your office, chat him up. You're well read, you went to college. Have some fun out there. Relax.
HATTEBERG	Yes sir.
BILLY	Scottie, you deserve to be here.
BILLY	More information. TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY of all of the changes to the board over the following two weeks.
HATTEBERG	What are you guys getting up to tonight? The focused Twins player looks at Scott like he's crazy.
TWINS PLAYER #1	Bed by ten o'clock. Game time.
HATTEBERG	I don't buy it.
TWINS PLAYER #1	I'm sore, man. Beat up. Day in, day out.
HATTEBERG	Where d'you guys go next?
TWINS PLAYER #1	Houston.
HATTEBERG	Houston?	You ever get up to Boundary Waters up there in Minnesota? It's beautiful. I went on a trip up there. Fishing trip. Caught some walleye.
TWINS PLAYER #1	That's good fishing.
HATTEBERG	"Mankevich" is polish?
TWINS PLAYER #2	Yes, sir.
HATTEBERG	Where'd you go to school?
TWINS PLAYER #3	University of Arizona.
HATTEBERG	What are you guys getting up to tonight?
TWINS PLAYER #3	See what the city's about -- San Francisco. What are you up to?
HATTEBERG	I don't know. Depends on if we beat you today. Probably celebrating.	So my GM says I gotta be more social. What was your name?
TWINS PLAYER #3	Jaqcue.
HATTEBERG	I'm Scott.
TWINS PLAYER #3	How are you doing, Scott?
HATTEBERG	Pretty good. You got kids?
TWINS PLAYER #3	Yeah... Crack! Hatteberg catches the ball, making another out.

GAME 20
BILLY	Don't tell me the score, Peter.
BILLY	How you doin', leggy.
BILLY	Sharon?
BILLY	Yeah. There's silence...
BILLY	Hello?	Sharon?	"Go into real estate". What a stupid thing to say. BILLY didn't even realize until that moment how much he wanted to hear her say that...He's not sure what to say back.
BILLY	I appreciate that, thanks.
BILLY	No, I'm on my way to Visalia to see our minor league team.
CASEY	Dad - turn around. You have to see the game.
BILLY	No, I don't.
CASEY	Turn around.
BILLY	I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. I love you. He hangs up, drives a little longer...letting what Casey said sink in. Then...
BILLY	Shhhit. ...he turns on the radio.
BILLY	Oh God.	Ohhhh God. BILLY sees the sign for the next exit coming up. He makes a decision and quickly crosses to the right, just making the exit.
CHAD	One, two, three, four -
CHAD	I know what it is to be in need and to have plenty. I am content. I can do all things through Christ who gives me
STRENGTH--
BILLY	(to himself but to
CHAD)	Okay Chad, let's see it.
AND --	Howe pulls Rincon. Tam comes in to relieve him. Sweeney's up. In rapid succession, we seem him battle off TEN PITCHES of Tam. He's got two strikes on him, more toilet paper flies on the field, Bowie comes in to warm up which Tam sees, then - SWEENEY HITS A THREE-RUN HOMER TO MAKE IT 11-10! This is excruciating.
ART	Hattie. Grab a bat. SCOTT HATTEBERG actually points to himself and mouths, Me?
ART	Let's go. SCOTT pulls a bat from the rack and heads to the on-deck circle. He only manages a warmup pitch or two before -
UMPIRE	Ball! Art Howe looks like he can't stand it any longer. In the dugout, Koch looks like a psychopath ready to kill. SCOTT steps out of the box to catch his breath. He steps back in and stares at the exact spot in space he thinks the pitch will leave the pitcher's hand. The pitch. SCOTT swings.
ELIZABETH	Mr. Beane? I'm Elizabeth Hatteberg. We met at my house last Christmas.
BILLY	Sure.
ELIZABETH	Thank you.
BILLY	Thank me? Thank you. Whatever you put in those Christmas cookies, keep--
BILLY	Whoa. It's okay.
ELIZABETH	I'm sorry.
BILLY	It's alright.
ELIZABETH	You don't know what it's like to have everyone think you're a failure.
BILLY	Well...You never thought that, and that's
WHAT'S--
ELIZABETH	(the worst possible
SIN)	I did.	And he knows I did.
BILLY	Yeah he does know you did.
ELIZABETH	He's talked to you?
BILLY	No. I just know.	That's all over now.	BILLY	Your husband just took a Jason Grimsley two-seam fastball and parked it in the upper deck in left field for a pinch-hit walk-off home run in a record breaking game. Go tell him about it. ELIZABETH looks at him a moment...and then starts crying
AGAIN--
BILLY	No it's okay now, just go. ELIZABETH goes off to find her husband. BILLY sees PETER standing there.
BILLY	Gilligan.
PETER	Congratulations.
BILLY	Aw, man. I spend the season trying to reduce it to numbers and we won on romance. Suddenly it's the Natural with Hatteberg. Scott Hatteberg.	To twenty.
TARA	To twenty.	You should've seen Elizabeth's face when it went right over.
BILLY	She showed up afterwards.
TARA	What did she say?
BILLY	I was a big moment for them. You know everyone wrote him off?
TARA	You didn't. You found him and you put that together.
BILLY	I know. It was beautiful. But you know... it's not gonna mean a thing. He's upset. She knows it.
BILLY	Here's the thing -- we changed the game. We got this year, maybe next, then they're gonna catch on. This is our moment. I want to go the distance. I wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not just the Yankees, but... these guys deserve it.
TARA	You deserve it. Honey, 20 games. It's a record.
BILLY	That's right, it's just a record. It gets buried in some book. Come on, tell me who won 19? I don't even know. It's 4th place at the Olympics. Any other team wins the World Series this year... great. We're still in the record books. But if we win, we've changed the game. We've put it on its head and shoved it up their ass. If we don't, they're gonna erase us.
LEGEND:
2002 ALDS
DECIDING GAME 5	Minnesota Twins at Oakland A's The camera pans down the huge scoreboard. It's excruciating. The numbers on the board tell us it's been an incredibly close game but the A's are losing by one run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs and nobody on.
ALDERSON	It's like a politician quitting a campaign to become a staffer. Do you even know what a scout does?
BILLY	I've been scouted since I was 15.
ALDERSON	And you're ready to say, "I'm not a baseball player"?
BILLY	I'm not a baseball player.
BILLY	Ready to do this? Pete nods. Billy calls out --
BILLY	Suzanne? Get Schott on.	You ever been to Boston? The speakerphone rings. Billy answers.
BILLY	We need to talk about the Red Sox.
BILLY	Yes. But I haven't spoken with him yet.
BILLY	I want your blessing before I do.
BILLY	I know that, Steve, but I'd like to talk to them. I want to see what they have to say.
BILLY	Yes. With your permission.
BILLY	Pete?
BILLY	Well, I think you'll agree this is a great opportunity for him. I can't believe he's not going to make a deal.
BILLY	I haven't asked to get out of my contract, Steve, I just asked if I could talk to them.
BILLY	Then talk to Peter.
PETER	Well, I didn't see that coming.
BILLY	I think you should think about staying. You're one of the architects of this thing, it belongs as much to you as it does to me.
PETER	Okay... okay...
BILLY	How you doing Pete?
PETER	I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I think I need to process what's happening.
BILLY	Why don't you take the day off.
HENRY	Due respect to the Coliseum, but this is a ball park.
BILLY	Yes it is. It is.
HENRY	You ever play here?
BILLY	No.
JOHN	That's a shame. Let's walk the field.
JOHN	Hey, I'm sorry I kept you waiting but believe it or not there was snow on 84. The second week in October. The car turns on to Yawkee Way and it's 53 degrees and this. How can there be an entirely different weather system here than there is three miles from here? Is that global warming or a sign that there's no such thing?
BILLY	I don't know.
JOHN	What's that Billy Joel song? Oh the snow it was falling from Stockbridge to Boston. And the hilltops seemed something because of that frosting.
BILLY	I think that's James Taylor and I'm certain those aren't the words.
JOHN	Well whatever, it was snowing from Stockbridge to Boston so I'm sorry I'm late. We'll have lunch in a little bit but why don't I have some coffee sent up. (he's already got his cell phone open) Denise? (back to BILLY) We've got espresso, cappuccino, latte, we've got a machine that makes whatever you want.
BILLY	We've got free soda.
JOHN	I heard about that.	Can you have some coffee in there for us?	Thank you. He snaps the phone shut.
JOHN	It's her birthday and I need to get her a present but she's usually the one who does that for me so do you have any ideas?
BILLY	A scarf?
JOHN	You mean like wool?
BILLY	No I meant something that women wear with, you know, a decorative --
JOHN	Sure! Excellent.	And where would I get something like that?
BILLY	John, no disrespect, I just lost in five for the second year in a row -- give her a bowling ball for all I care.
JOHN	Steve Schott told me he's offering you a new contract.
BILLY	Yes he is.
JOHN	So why'd you return my call?
BILLY	You're the Red Sox, and I think I can help you.	BILLY	I think I can do something about the Curse of the Bambino. I heard you hired Bill James.
HENRY	Why it took someone so long to hire that guy is beyond me.
BILLY	Because baseball hates him.
HENRY	Money buys a lot of things. One is the luxury to disregard what baseball thinks.
BILLY	That must be nice. (beat, then) I was grateful to get your call.
JOHN	You were grateful.
BILLY	Yeah.
JOHN	For 41 million you built a playoff team. You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen and Pena and you won two more games without them than you did with them.
JOHN	You won the exact same number of games as the Yankees but the Yankees paid 1.4 million dollars per win and you paid two- hundred and sixty thousand. Yes, I want you to be my General Manager.	I know you're taking it in the teeth. The first guy through a wall always gets hurt. But those are dying voices. Any GM that doesn't tear down their team and rebuild it using your model is gonna be a dinosaur.
BILLY	What's this?
JOHN	My first offer. BILLY opens it, looks at it for less than a second, and looks back up at JOHN...
PETER	Heads up!
BILLY	Jesus. What the hell --
PETER	Sorry.
BILLY	What the hell was that?
PETER	I don't know. Sorry.	How was Boston?
BILLY	Impressive.
PETER	You're giving me Youkilis, Billy.
BILLY	Why would I ever do that?
PETER	Come on Billy, Schott's going to want something in exchange for letting you out of your contract and I want Youkilis.
BILLY	Oh, what is that, your GM voice? You can't have him.
PETER	And Cash. And a player to be named later.
BILLY	You already have my job. What else do you want from me?
PETER	I don't want your job.
BILLY	Why did you take it?
PETER	You didn't leave me much choice.	Did Henry make you a good offer?
BILLY	It doesn't matter.
PETER	Did he make you a good offer?
BILLY	It was fine.
PETER	What was it?
BILLY	It doesn't matter.
PETER	He offered to make you the highest paid GM in pro sports.

BILLY	I'm not even over last year yet. I don't get over it.
PETER	I've got something in the video room, come with me.
BILLY	I really can't look at video right now.
PETER	No, come with me.
PAUL	It's not much more than a home movie but you'll get the idea.
BILLY	Who is it?
PAUL	The Visalia Oaks and their 240 pound catcher, Jeremy Brown, who's scared of running to second. This was in a game six weeks ago. PAUL hits the remote and the tape starts. The quality is poor and the camera is focused only on Jeremy.
PAUL	This guy's gonna start him off with a fastball low and in because he hasn't read the book on our guy and doesn't know that low and in is where he eats. Jeremy takes him to deep center -- We see JEREMY BROWN connect and the ball fly off the bat but the camera stays on JEREMY running to first. PAUL slows down the picture with the remote
PAUL	-- and he knows that if he runs it's a stand-up double and he's running.
BILLY	Go pal.
PAUL	And now he's gonna do something he never does. He's gonna round first base, he's gonna take the turn.
BILLY	Please tell me he's safe at second.
PAUL	No. Because right here --
PAUL	-- is what he's always been afraid of. It's all he can do to get himself back to first.
BILLY	What is that?
PAUL	That's the first base coach.
BILLY	Why's he laughing? I'm gonna fire that guy, why the hell is he --
PAUL	Everybody's laughing.
PAUL	And now Jeremy finds out why. Watch his face because this is art. He's just found out the ball went 60 feet over the fence. He'd hit a home run but he didn't know it.
BILLY	How can anybody not be romantic about baseball?
PAUL	It was a metaph--
BILLY	I know it was a metaphor.
PAUL	That was a hell of a baseball season, boss.
BILLY	The Island of Misfit Toys. Okay. And with that, Billy's mind begins to go elsewhere. No resolution, no decision, other than to get up and wander on.
