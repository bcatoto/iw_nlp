PADDY	Tommy?
PADDY	What're you doing here?
TOMMY	I was just passing through. Figured why not have a belt with the old man.
TOMMY	She looks good.
PADDY	(patting car hood) Yeah, she's hanging in there.
TOMMY	Well, you always did take good care of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of priorities.
TOMMY	Got a little something for ya. Mom always said never go anywhere empty handed.
PADDY	She did. But that's not for me anymore, Tommy.
TOMMY	What? You change brands?
PADDY	C'mon, let's go inside.
TOMMY	I like what you've done with the place.
TOMMY	There's not much of a woman's touch around here.
TOMMY	Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays.
PADDY	Here you go.
TOMMY	Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and you're not gonna have a drink with him?
PADDY	I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming up on a thousand days.
TOMMY	C'mon, just one drink.
PADDY	No.
PADDY	He's a school teacher down in Philly.
PADDY	Remember Tess? They've got two beautiful little girls.
TOMMY	So you found God, huh? That's awesome. Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. Who knew?
TOMMY	So, you gonna ask about her, or you just gonna sit there all sober?
PADDY	I know.
TOMMY	Oh, you know? What do you know? Do you know it wasn't enough just to drive west to get away from you? When we hit the water we drove north, too.
PADDY	When I got sober I hired a man to find you.
TOMMY	(taking a swig) Is that one of the 12 steps? Or does a guy like you get 24?
PADDY	Just the 12.
TOMMY	Did your guy tell you what you needed to know?
PADDY	Just that your mother died in Tacoma. And you were in the Marines. That was all. That was enough.
TOMMY	That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details.
TOMMY	You could've heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat. Having me rub her down with holy water, because she didn't have no insurance. All the while waiting for your pal Jesus to save her. Did your man tell you that?
PADDY	I'm sorry, Tommy.
TOMMY	It's good to know you're sorry, Pop. Goes a long way.
TOMMY	I think I liked you better when you were a drunk.
TESS	What's going on here?
BRENDAN	Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess.
TESS	Em, you want to open your presents?
TESS	(off pink box) This an awfully big box.
BRENDAN	It's her birthday.
TESS	I know, but that's why you call it a budget. You set it, and you don't budge.
TESS	Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying goodbye to the girls. She's gotta get on the road. They've been fed. They just need a bath.
BRENDAN	I'm on it.
TESS	Can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight? They're exhausted.
BRENDAN	Where's the rest of that skirt?
TESS	Babe.
BRENDAN	Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay?
TESS	(off his cut) Yeah. Just like you gave me a call when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face.
BRENDAN	I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some action.
TESS	Alright, well wait up for me tonight. I'll see what I can do about that.
BRENDAN	Promises, promises.
TOMMY	Fitzy still own this?
FENROY	Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns this gym.
FENROY	Can I help you with something?
TOMMY	How's it work here?
FENROY	Thirty five a month with locker. We're open at 7, lights out at 11. You wanna join?
TOMMY	Sure.
FENROY	Put your name and contact info on the card.
BRENDAN	Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in this too, OK? Listen up. So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs--
TITO	Acceleration.
BRENDAN	Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead.
BRENDAN	There we go. Alright Tito, well done. Remind not to mess with you. Sit down everybody. Dial it down.
BRENDAN	So, have we got it?
NASH	Force equals mass times acceleration. We got it.
BRENDAN	Alright. The third law--
STEPHON	How many laws this dude got?
BRENDAN	The dude? The dude has three. Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
BRENDAN	For example, if KC does not stop the action of sending texts in class...
BRENDAN	...and tell her posse outside to beat it...
BRENDAN	...then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office. Thus setting our world back in proper balance.
KC	Mr. C, I put it away.
BRENDAN	Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week.
MAD DOG	Where do you find these girls?
COLT BOYD	We got a tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh? Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that fights outa the Bottoms. If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks.
TOMMY	Yo, I'll fight him.
COLT BOYD	Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag. We don't need anybody else getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk.
MAD DOG	Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today?
FENROY	His phone's disconnected.
COLT BOYD	Then go through the list. Get me Joe Bones.
TOMMY	All I'm saying is if you need somebody to help you, I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.
COLT BOYD	You ever fought before?
TOMMY	Yeah.
COLT BOYD	This guy sign a waiver?
FENROY	All good.
COLT BOYD	What's your name?
TOMMY	Tommy.
COLT BOYD	You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tommy.
TOMMY	Sure, no problem.
COLT BOYD	Come on in.
MAD DOG	Gonna be a hero? Alright.
TOMMY	You owe me two hundred bucks.
DAN TAYLOR	This is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly. As you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage. That's the problem. It's the country that did the assessment, not the bank. So, the numbers are what they are, Mr. Conlon.
BRENDAN	Brendan.
DAN TAYLOR	The numbers are what they are, Brendan. I mean, you're a Math teacher, you can appreciate that.
BRENDAN	I teach Physics.
DAN TAYLOR	Physics. OK. But the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures. According to these figures, you're upside down on your mortgage--
BRENDAN	You said that three times already. I get that. But I'm asking you if there's something else you can do. Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure--
DAN TAYLOR	Well, you've already refinanced twice.
BRENDAN	Because you advised us to do that.
DAN TAYLOR	I presented you with that option. It was your choice. I'm also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi.
BRENDAN	We had that conversation. I was paying medical bills. Is that in your file?
DAN TAYLOR	Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's...kidney?
BRENDAN	Heart.
DAN TAYLOR	Heart, right. (off stack of files on desk) Lot of stories.
BRENDAN	So my option is I've got no options? You're not even gonna try to help me?
DAN TAYLOR	I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can get you 90 days to get even--
BRENDAN	90 days is not enough. My wife and I have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. So, what do you suggest?
DAN TAYLOR	Let me ask you a question: have you considered bankruptcy? It's a viable option. There's no shame in it these days.
BRENDAN	That's not how I do things.
DAN TAYLOR	Well, then you're looking at foreclosure.
COLT BOYD	How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.
PADDY	Who?
COLT BOYD	Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.
PADDY	What business you got with Tommy?
COLT BOYD	None yet. That's why I'm here. I manage fighters.
PADDY	Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself.
COLT BOYD	I'm just looking for some general information here.
PADDY	Like I said, anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself.
COLT BOYD	Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night. He put this address down when he signed up at the gym.
PADDY	He doesn't live here. Hey. I'm just pulling in. Huh? Oh, they've got this open mic night thing. Should be a quiet one. Sleep well. You too. Bye.
ANNOUNCER	It's time for our next contest! Introducing first, fighting out of the red corner, from Ripley, West Virginia, please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore!
ANNOUNCER	And in the blue corner. He fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon!
ANNOUNCER	This bout is scheduled for three five-minute rounds, and when the action begins your referee is Mr. Rick Fike.
REFEREE	Fighters to the center! I want you to obey my commands at all times. If you have no questions, touch gloves, back up, and wait for my signal. Come out fighting!
REFEREE	Fighters, are you ready? Let's go!
PROMOTER	Nice fight. Two more wins and you take home the bacon.
TESS	Hey babe. How was work?
TESS	Oh my God. What happened? You said it was going to be a slow night.
BRENDAN	I'm not bouncing at a club.
TESS	What do you mean you're not bouncing?
TESS	You've been lying to me?
BRENDAN	I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing.
BRENDAN	They're putting us out of the house in three months, we're running out
OF OPTIONS--
TESS	Then they'll put us out of the house in three months. I'd rather go back to the old apartment than see you in the back of an ambulance again. I thought we agreed that we weren't going to raise our children in a family where their father gets beat up for a living.
BRENDAN	We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going
BACKWARDS
TESS	We'll figure it out. But this is what we're not going back to.
PADDY	You wanted to talk?
TOMMY	Yeah. I'm gonna start fighting.
PADDY	That right?
TOMMY	Don't play babe in the woods with me. I know that guy from the gym came to see you.
PADDY	Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.
TOMMY	We wouldn't be sitting here now if you did.
TOMMY	Alright. Look. There's this tournament. A big tournament. Top sixteen middleweights in the world. Single elimination. Winner take all for a lot of money. I'm gonna do that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm gonna need a trainer. Now that much you were good at. (off Paddy grinning) No, no, no. This doesn't mean anything.
TOMMY	I'm serious. We train. That's it. I don't wanna hear a word about anything but training, you understand? You wanna tell your war stories, you can take `em down to the VFW. You can take `em to a meeting, or church, or wherever the hell it is you go nowadays.
PADDY	What about Colt Boyd?
TOMMY	What about him? I told him I don't train with people I don't know.
PADDY	Ah, the devil you know.
TOMMY	Excuse me?
PADDY	The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.
PADDY	Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda like old times.
TOMMY	I just told you, this doesn't mean anything. You get that through your skull right now or I'm walking.
PADDY	Alright. Alright. But you get something through your skull, too. You called me. So don't go threatening to walk every five minutes. And since this is about training, you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned. I don't want to see `em.
PADDY	In fact, hand `em over right now. I know they're on you, Tommy. You sounded like a goddamn maraca coming through the door.
PADDY	That's not gonna do. When you came through that door it was chhh-chhh-chhh. (holding up 3 fingers) Three.
PADDY	(off French fries) And another thing, you don't eat crap like this. This is for losers and old men. And we're gonna have to bunk up. If we're gonna do this right, you gotta stay at the house. 25.
PADDY	I watch your diet, we follow the old regimen. You copy?
PADDY	Copy.
TITO	My brother said he was at the strip club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA---
NASH	What's MMA?
STEPHON	Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different styles of fighting.
KC	Your brother's a liar.
BRENDAN	Take your seats.
BRENDAN	Now, please.
TITO	Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the titty bar last night and said you was choking brothers out. What's up? Is it true?
STEPHON	Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really work on some fools or something?
KC	You have to tell us.
BRENDAN	C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks.
JOE ZITO	Are you being literal or figurative? Because literally it looks bad. And figuratively it looks even worse. The superintendent's coming by in a few minutes. So gimme a little help here, Brendan. Can you explain to me what the hell you were doing?
BRENDAN	I need the money, Joe.
JOE ZITO	Yeah, but we can't have this. This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's for Christ's sake. 27.
BRENDAN	Actually, I used to be one of those animals.
BRENDAN	I fought for a living. Guess I forgot to put that down on my application.
JOE ZITO	Yeah, I guess you did.
BRENDAN	Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just--
JOE ZITO	Listen, the school district's not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.
BRENDAN	It was the parking lot of a strip club.
JOE ZITO	Wherever it was, you can't be doing it, alright? I mean this is a serious--shit, he's here. Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9-11.
BRENDAN	What are we gonna do?
JOE ZITO	You say yes, sir. And you say no, sir. And you say it'll never happen again, sir. And then we just pray to God he's in a good mood.
TESS	What are you doing?
BRENDAN	The girls have an important piano recital in the morning. Got an equipment malfunction. How'd it go?
TESS	They're gonna review your case at the end of the semester, but until then you're suspended without pay. Joe gave me the number of his attorney.
BRENDAN	How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney?
TESS	He talked to me for free. As a favor to Joe.
BRENDAN	That was nice.
TESS	He said there's no precedent for this. You'll be back by next semester.
BRENDAN	Next semester?
BRENDAN	Look, Tess. They have these smoker fights all over. There's one in Lancaster next week. There's two in Dover the week after. Wilmington. Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us afloat.
TESS	You're gonna put yourself through this over and over, for five hundred bucks a pop?
BRENDAN	Some of them pay a little more than that. I would have had to bounce for a month to make what I made in two hours last night.
BRENDAN	And these guys, they're not real fighters. They're just guys who have seen too much UFC on TV. If you have a better solution, I'm all ears.
TESS	What are we gonna tell the girls?
BRENDAN	It'll be fine. I'll just leave the house as usual, except now I'll be going to the gym.
PADDY	Oh the duck says quack and the cow says moo, and the old red rooster says cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a- doodle-doo.
PADDY	Look what I found in that disaster of a basement. Whattya say we sit down and update this sometime? You can fill me in on how close you got to that record.
PADDY	Did you continue wrestling after you left with your mother? C'mon, Tommy. Tell me something.
TOMMY	Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You can take that thing back to where you found it. And you can leave the coffee in the pot. I can pour that myself. I can wake myself up, too.
PADDY	OK. Hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway. 31.
PADDY	Coffee pot's on til 0-500, then I dump it.
MARINE #1	Damn dude, that's brutal.
BRADFORD	What's that?
MARINE #2	"Mad Dog" Grimes gettin' tuned up by some dude in a gym in Pittsburgh.
BRADFORD	Who's "Mad Dog" Grimes?
MARINE #2	Shit, Bradford. The stuff you don't know amazes me. Oh my god, did you see that?
BRADFORD	Wait, rewind that.
BRADFORD	AV, I need to see the tape!
AV	What tape?
BRADFORD	The tape.
BRADFORD	Freeze.
BRADFORD	That's him. That's him.
FRANK	Let the music sink in to you. This is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe.
FRANK	Do I know you? I think I know you.
FRANK	Long time, brother.
BRENDAN	Liking the place, Frank.
FRANK	Thank you, brother. (off Brazilian fighter) You see this beast? Marco Santos? I'm training him for Sparta.
BRENDAN	Amazing, man.
FRANK	Come on back.
FRANK	You look good, brother. How're the girls?
BRENDAN	Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie.
FRANK	I know. Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. I was gonna call, but then time went by. I don't know. I'm a piece of shit. I should have called.
BRENDAN	It's alright.
FRANK	No, Brendan. I'm sorry.
BRENDAN	It's all good. She's good now.
FRANK	It's great to see you, man. So everything's going good?
BRENDAN	Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually.
FRANK	I've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need?
BRENDAN	I didn't come here for a loan, Frank. I was hoping you'd train me.
FRANK	Train you for what?
BRENDAN	I want to get back in the cage.
FRANK	You're serious?
BRENDAN	I just won an event the other night.
FRANK	Ah, you won an event. (off bruised face) That's what this is. Let me guess, it was in a parking lot. DJ from the local radio station. Couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare. Am I right?
BRENDAN	Ish.
FRANK	Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But why would I train you? When you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me. You never listened to anyone. These guys are animals. I mean, you're a teacher, right? What're you gonna do? You're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention? You're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early?
BRENDAN	I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue. The parking lot thing kinda got me suspended. I need to keep working the smokers.
FRANK	Tess know about this? (off Brendan's nod) Yeah? `Cause the last time you fought, I got read the riot act sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that?
BRENDAN	No. I was unconscious.
FRANK	She's not gonna come down here with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?
BRENDAN	It's not gonna happen. Come on. Whattya say, Frank?
FRANK	What do I say? What am I gonna say to you? No? I mean, all my time is wrapped up with Marco. You come down, I'll throw you in the rotation, you spar with these guys, no problem. But I can't promise you much more than that, Brendan.
BRENDAN	That's all I need.
BRENDAN	I appreciate it.
FRANK	Let me know when you're coming down.
BRENDAN	Well, I'm just gonna go get my stuff from the car.
FRANK	Now?
PADDY	Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop.
BRENDAN	What're you doing here?
PADDY	I have some news for you.
BRENDAN	Something wrong with your hands?
BRENDAN	If there's nothing wrong with your hands then there's no reason for you not to phone. That's the deal.
PADDY	Yeah, I forgot--
BRENDAN	Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.
PADDY	Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady? Have you?
BRENDAN	I'm going inside.
PADDY	I've got a thousand days. A thousand days sober today.
BRENDAN	Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything.
PADDY	What do you mean it doesn't change anything? Have a heart, Brendan.
BRENDAN	You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I do.
PADDY	C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we could break bread. Open some lines of communication.
BRENDAN	You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is.
PADDY	I know you got a wife and kids in there. I got a grand-daughter I haven't seen in three years and another I haven't even ever met.
BRENDAN	Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that?
BRENDAN	That shit you pulled. Never again. And all the shit I saw growing up? That doesn't happen here.
BRENDAN	Take care of yourself.
PADDY	Tommy's back.
PADDY	He's in the `Burgh.
BRENDAN	Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
PADDY	He came to see me.
BRENDAN	He came to see you?
PADDY	He's over at the house. We're doing a little training at Fitzy's. Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's anymore.
BRENDAN	You and Tommy are training together?
BRENDAN	Tommy Conlon.
PADDY	Riordan. He's using your mother's maiden name now.
BRENDAN	I know what her name is.
PADDY	I thought you'd want to know he's back. That's why I drove all the way over here.
BRENDAN	I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days?
PADDY	That too.
BRENDAN	Did he say if he wants to see me?
PADDY	He doesn't say much. He's just not that happy kid he was.
BRENDAN	Wow, look at you. Mister inside man.
BRENDAN	You and Tommy training together like nothing ever happened. This is unbelievable. Now I know what you're really doing here.
PADDY	What's that?
BRENDAN	You came to gloat.
PADDY	I did not come to gloat. I came to get my son back.
BRENDAN	Well, there you go. You got your son back.
PADDY	I'm talking about you, Bren--
BRENDAN	You got your son back.
BRENDAN	You know, part of the reason I stuck around was `cause I thought I'd finally get you all to myself. But you didn't have any interest in training me. Tommy was the one.
PADDY	Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean, you know. I'm sorry.
BRENDAN	Forget it. You were always a front runner. You never had any interest in underdogs. But I was your son.
PADDY	You are my son.
BRENDAN	Am I?
PADDY	Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me.
BRENDAN	Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I do not trust you. Tell Tommy this is where I am if he wants to see me.
PADDY	Alright. But they're not different things. You've gotta trust to
FORGIVE--
BRENDAN	Goodnight, Pop.
PADDY	My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie?
ROSIE	Daddy, who is that?
BRENDAN	Just some nice old man.
JON ANIK	Huge news breaking here at ESPN. Koba is coming to America and will fight at Sparta. Universally considered to be the greatest pound for pound fighter that ever lived, the mighty, mythical Russian has never fought on U.S. soil in his legendary career...
COLT BOYD	Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got you into Sparta. Took some doing, but I made it happen.. (off no reaction from Tommy) Thank you and 10 percent is customary.
PILAR	Bueno?
TOMMY	Pilar. It's Tommy.
PILAR	Tommy! Dios mio! I can't believe it! How are you?
TOMMY	Good good. How you doin'?
PILAR	OK. You know me, Tommy. I was getting really worried about you.
TOMMY	How're things? Kids are good?
PILAR	They're good. Maria's getting so big. She looks more like Manny every day.
TOMMY	How's little man?
PILAR	He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy. Takes care of his sister. He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
TOMMY	You know, Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute what I promised you. What I promised Manny. I've got an opportunity coming up to help you guys out. To take care of you guys.
PILAR	Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know Manny would really appreciate it. You worry too much. It's OK. We're hanging in there. 44.
FRANK	No he did not tap you! Physics teacher! That's the best in the world there, son.
BRENDAN	You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite?
FRANK	Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta call the boys and break the news. I'll call you tomorrow.
BRENDAN	Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me?
FRANK	You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
BRENDAN	It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do.
BRENDAN	They'll have to kill me to get me out of that cage.
FRANK	That's what I'm afraid of.
BRENDAN	Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you.
FRANK	You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us?
BRENDAN	That's not gonna happen.
FRANK	Not gonna happen. Wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
BRENDAN	It's not gonna happen.
FRANK	I'll make a call.
BRENDAN	I love my coach! That's unbelievable. I can't thank you enough. I don't know what to say. Alright, listen, I've gotta call you back. Alright, bye.
BRENDAN	I'm in. I'm going.
TESS	Really? So that's your decision? You decided? `Cause I really enjoyed that conversation we just had about making that decision together.
TESS	You told me you were gonna fight guys that watched too much UFC. I saw that Koba dude on TV, and he's the guy they're watching.
BRENDAN	It's a lot of money, Tess.
TESS	I don't give a shit about the money, Brendan. I told you that. We're gonna end up cashing in your life insurance policy before we pick up that prize money.
BRENDAN	You don't think I can do it.
TESS	I think you can get killed.
BRENDAN	I'm not gonna get killed.
TESS	Fine, you're not going to get killed. But can you promise me you're not going to get hurt? You're not gonna end up in the hospital? You're not gonna end up paralyzed? We'll have no prize money. No house. Payments for
HOSPITAL BILLS--	51.
BRENDAN	Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise?
BRENDAN	So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd really love it if you'd be with me on this.
TESS	I'm not gonna watch you fight again. I'm not. I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.
CALLEN	J.J., you've made a fortune with your hedge funds, yet you turned your back on Wall Street and dedicated your life to making Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this tournament so important to you?
SHERIDAN	Thank you, J.J. And here's something fans never thought they'd see: Koba is here! The legend arriving to fight on U.S. soil for the very first time...
FRANK	Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me. 54.
PADDY	Tommy!
TOMMY	I'm takin' a walk. Brendan.
BRENDAN	Been looking all over for you. How's it going?
TOMMY	It's going.
BRENDAN	I was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee.
TOMMY	I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
BRENDAN	You don't want to go sit down somewhere?
TOMMY	I'm good right here.
BRENDAN	Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to know I was never gonna see you guys again?
TOMMY	You were briefed. You had the information. You chose the old man and the girl.
BRENDAN	She wasn't some girl. I married her. She's my wife.
BRENDAN	(handing Tommy the picture) That's Tess. And that's Emily and Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy.
TOMMY	Don't know `em.
BRENDAN	I know you don't know them. Of course you don't know them.
TOMMY	Why am I looking at pictures of people I don't know?
BRENDAN	Because that's my family.
TOMMY	And who are you exactly?
BRENDAN	I'm your brother, man.
TOMMY	You were in the Corps?
BRENDAN	What?
TOMMY	I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
BRENDAN	I wasn't in the Corps.
TOMMY	Then you ain't no brother to me. My brother was in the Corps.
BRENDAN	Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old kid. What the hell did I know?
TOMMY	I don't know what you know. Why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it?
BRENDAN	She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it? I stay with Tess and I never get to see you guys again? Not a single phone call? Nothing?
BRENDAN	God, man, I don't understand this. You won't forgive me, but you'll forgive Pop?
TOMMY	Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness.
BRENDAN	That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them.
BRENDAN	But I forgave Pop. Just like I forgave you and Mom.
TOMMY	You forgave us?
BRENDAN	Yeah.
TOMMY	I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some stones.
BRENDAN	I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do?
TOMMY	You were supposed to stick to the plan. You were supposed to come with us. Mom needed you. I needed you. You were my big brother and you bailed on me.
TOMMY	Hey, I'm glad you stayed and everything worked out for you, Brendan. See, you leave, you get the opposite. You leave, you get to bury people.
BRENDAN	You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make!
TOMMY	You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of shit.
TOMMY	Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?
JOE ZITO	You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel when school's actually in session, right?
STEPHON	We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta.
TITO	What do you say?
JOE ZITO	Let me get this straight. You want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for? Am I hearing this correctly? I gotta talk to your parents. You guys might need to be in summer school after all.
NASH	But everyone wants to see it.
KC	The gym's the only place that's big enough.
JOE ZITO	It's never gonna happen.
STEPHON	What if we get a petition?
TITO	Yeah. We'll get the whole school to sign it.
NASH	The power of democracy!
JOE ZITO	Look, I appreciate that you guys love your teacher. I really do. But there is nothing I can do for you.
CALLEN	Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan. Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta he wanted to create, quite simply, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in history.
SHERIDAN	Five million dollars, Bryan. Five million dollars. J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen.
CALLEN	It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan, the war hero who has become an overnight sensation...
OFFICIAL	Five minutes, Paddy.
CALLEN	Sam. He ripped the door off a tank! 64.
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.
OFFICIAL	Show time.
FRANK	You can do this.
FRANK	I want to hear you say it.
BRENDAN	I can do this.
FRANK	Then let's go do this.
PADDY	Go get `em, son.
CALLEN	Classical music is about as fitting to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament. In fact, let me show you something.
CALLEN	This is Brendan Conlon. He's a feeder fish, and he's about to get dropped into a shark tank.
SHERIDAN	C'mon, give the guy a break. At least we've seen him fight before. He was in the UFC. We remember him.
CALLEN	I remember him, too. I remember him being very unmemorable.
FRANK	You asked for it.
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Alright, gentleman, you've been given your instructions, I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.
FRANK	Have some fun, baby.
ZITO	Move! You gotta move!
ZITO	C'mon, Brendan, get outta there!
FRANK	Get out of there! Get out of there!
FRANK	Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't know what hit him!
SHERIDAN	It just did, Bryan.
ZITO	He tapped him out! He tapped him out! He did it! He did it! He did it!
CALLEN	Very technical finish, but come on, that's a fluke.
SHERIDAN	I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.
TESS	Yes!
PADDY	You can do it, Brendan. 75.
FRANK	Take him down!
PADDY	That's it, Brendan!
PADDY	Way to go, Brendan!
BRENDAN	I'd doing this!
PADDY	OK, son.
BRENDAN	I'm doing it!
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war!
PADDY	Can't sleep, huh?
PADDY	I know that other thing's bothering the hell out of you, but I'm proud of you. What you did for that kid in the tank? That was really something.
TOMMY	How about deserting my unit? Is that really something, too? Yeah. I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys. What was I supposed to do, let `em drown?
PADDY	No. What'd you do?
TOMMY	What'd I do? I took off.
PADDY	That's why you go by Riordan. That's why the press can't find your service records.
PADDY	What the hell happened over there, Tommy?
TOMMY	That is none of your business.
PADDY	Come on, kiddo. I've been there. I've done it. I've seen it. You can trust me. I'll understand.
TOMMY	Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. The suit don't fit.
PADDY	I'm really trying here, Tommy.
TOMMY	You're trying? Now? Where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened. You and Brendan don't seem to understand that. Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you.
TOMMY	Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. At least you had some balls then. Not like now. Tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out. Take it somewhere else, old man.
TOMMY	In fact, you know what? Here's a cup. Why don't you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes? 80.
TOMMY	Go back to the room and listen to some more fish stories no one gives a shit about. Go on, get outta here. Get the fuck outta here!
PADDY	God pity `em! All shall perish except me! You bastards! Stop the ship, you bastards!
PADDY	Ishmael! God pity `em! Stop the ship! Please stop the ship! Somebody help `em!
PADDY	Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch!
PADDY	You stop the ship, you Godless sonofabitch!
PADDY	Captain. Oh captain. Stop the ship. For the love of God. We're lost.
PADDY	Please stop the ship.
PADDY	We're lost. We're all lost, Tommy. We'll never make it back.
PADDY	I always loved you. You know that, don't you Tommy? I always loved you. You and your brother. My two boys.
MARINES	From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight our country's battles in the air, on land, and sea...
SHERIDAN	It sounds like VJ Day in Times Square, Bryan. I've never seen anything like it!
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.
MAD DOG	It's not gonna happen again.
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war!
COLT BOYD	Stop it! Stop the fight!
FRANK	You've got a visitor. Second row, 10 o'clock.
FRANK	You alright with that?
FRANK	I want you to look right at him when he comes in here. Don't take your eyes off him.
FRANK	I'm proud of you brother. This is your cage.
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Alright, gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. 87.
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war!
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Let's go to war!
FRANK	Sit down. Breathe. (grabbing Brendan's face) Look at me! Look at me! Why are we here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are we here to win this fight? You tell me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw in the towel right now. We'll get Tess and we will go home. You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home.
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Let's go to war!
FRANK	Crank it! Crank it! You know, my Manny used to say Tommy was the brother he never had.
TESS	What are you gonna do?
BRENDAN	I'm gonna fight him.
FRANK	One more time.
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Gentlemen, this is the final. Five rounds. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.
BRENDAN	Where's Pop?
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Gentlemen, are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go to war!
TESS	What was that!
FRANK	C'mon, Josh!
FRANK	Sit down. Look at me. Look at me, Brendan! Let it go! Breathe. 97.
FRANK	Beethoven. He's coming hard, just like we planned. I want you to angle out, hit, and move.
BRENDAN	Angle out, hit, and move.
FRANK	Good. Breathe. Relax. He's not your brother, right? He's just a guy who's in the way.
FRANK	I'm taking a little more time for the cheap shot! Do your job, Josh!
FRANK	Switch! Switch!
BRENDAN	Tap, Tommy!
BRENDAN	Tap!
BRENDAN	I popped his shoulder.
FRANK	Relax, breathe.
BRENDAN	I heard it tear.
FRANK	You popped his shoulder? Good. I want you to pop his other shoulder.
BRENDAN	Josh!
FRANK	Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You got two rounds left! You need both rounds! Go in there, kick him in the head, take him down, and finish him!
BRENDAN	Tommy! What are you doing?
TOMMY	Shut up! C'mon.
BRENDAN	What are you that crazy?
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Let's go to war!
BRENDAN	What are you doing? It's over!
BRENDAN	It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't have to do this.
FRANK	Finish him! You finish him!
JOSH ROSENTHAL	Break! Break!
BRENDAN	I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry!
BRENDAN	Tap, Tommy! Tap!
BRENDAN	I love you, Tommy! I love you!
