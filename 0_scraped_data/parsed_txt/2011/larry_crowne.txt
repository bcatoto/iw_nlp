Larry Crowne

AVERY	Sweatpants! Two pair! $6.69!

TEAM LEADER #2	Chocolate turtles! 69 cents a pound bag!

TEAM LEADER #4	Duck Blind print sheets for a queen size bed. $7.69.
ALL	Shop UniMart! Where United, you save!
MOMMY	Too much mac & cheese for this little pickle bug!
LARRY CROWNE	They do love the comfort food. Don't you, Li'l Pickle Bug...
LARRY CROWNE	Buddy. Park there and you'll get a ticket.
PIZZA KID	Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in sixty seconds. (a dozen pizza boxes) You guys having a party?
STRANG	Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two- K a year are history. Who else would do us that favor?
ANDREWS	Wish they'd all sail off like her. Save us some grief.
STRANG	The "R" Bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place.
HURLEY	"R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?
COX	Separating the chaff from the wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff, right?
HURLEY	Chaff is the waste matter, correct. When are we restructuring?
COX	Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders.
STRANG	What say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd?
ANDREWS	How?
STRANG	Firing someone.
COX	Someone they'd never expect to be let go. To look fair. I like it.
STRANG	Like a Team Leader.
HURLEY	Team Leader?
STRANG
COX	Suggestions on who it should be?
STRANG	I say Crowne.
HURLEY	Larry Crowne?
STRANG	Who else? Avery won't retire. We fire him, it's a law suit.
STRANG	Alvarez is about to drop a kid. She'll go part time in a week.
STRANG	Crowne's pink slip will save 'da "U" big green backwash.
COX	What Salary Tier is Crowne at?
ANDREWS	Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L. bump at the first of the year.
COX	Sweet. We'll need Actionable Cause, of course.
COX	How's his review record?
HURLEY	He's a candidate for Employee of the Month. His 22nd time.
COX	Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a reason...
HURLEY	We could use the Limited Horizons strategy. Larry will always be passed over for Management. He never went to college.
COX	You're that familiar with his record?
STRANG	She was his squeeze for a few weeks, weren't you, Vick?
HURLEY	That was before the New Employee Covenants. That you even remember...
STRANG	The memory haunts me.
ANDREWS	He'll sock us for severance.
STRANG	Big brick in the pond, though.
COX	Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu.
VASQUEZ	LC Why still here?
LARRY CROWNE	Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy.
VASQUEZ	I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2.
LARRY CROWNE	Probably to clean up after the party.
VASQUEZ	Isn't it Employee of the Month Day?
LARRY CROWNE	Speck-tack-alar.
VASQUEZ	You're the only one around here who deserves it. How many will this be?
LARRY CROWNE	Ah, who's counting?
LARRY CROWNE	Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now.
STRANG	Cubby. Make tracks.
LARRY CROWNE	I think I know what this is about.
STRANG	I don't think you do.
COX	Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us.
LARRY CROWNE	Sounds like you're firing me.
STRANG	I take it back.
COX	Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas. It is touchas, right? Where you get kicked?
HURLEY	Yeah. A yiddish word.
ANDREWS	Like the buttocks.
HURLEY	Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous.
COX	Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak.
LARRY CROWNE	UniMart is firing me...
STRANG	Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job.
LARRY CROWNE	Why me?
ANDREWS	Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so.
LARRY CROWNE	Why not Strang?
HURLEY	Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons.
COX	Here's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder.
STRANG	Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded.
LARRY CROWNE	I won't make the Front Office?
STRANG	Never. (shows his college ring) S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs!
LARRY CROWNE	I went in the Navy. Right outta high school. Five years, and by then...
COX	Thank you for your service to our country, Larry. And, in total seriousness to UniMart too
LARRY CROWNE	I thought I was Employee of the Month.
STRANG	In a way, you are.
LARRY CROWNE	No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose my house...
COX	The timing on this is always a bitch.
LARRY CROWNE	Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. We can fix this. Can't we fix this?
COX	Really wish we could. Vick? The generous severance package?
HURLEY	Sign here. Here. Here. Initial that. Sign here. One more. Done.
VASQUEZ	12 jerks I'd fire before you. May walk away from UniMart myself.
LARRY CROWNE	Stick it out. You go to college?
VASQUEZ	Couple years. Then I blew out my
KNEE
LARRY CROWNE	Thanks for seeing me off.
VASQUEZ	I need your apron, man. Your apron. Says UniMart on it, so it ain't yours.
VASQUEZ	Thanks. Goofy car, man.
RECORDED VOICE	at RiverBank..."
LARRY CROWNE	I was holding for Barry Raphael in Home and Real Estate?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	Mr. Raphael is no longer with the bank. How can I help you?
LARRY CROWNE	Barry is gone? I need to talk to someone in Home and Real Estate.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
LARRY CROWNE	(reading his ATM card) I wish! I'm Customer number 566 7878 2031 339 and I can be there in three minutes!
LARRY CROWNE	Three minutes!
LARRY CROWNE	What happened to Barry Raphael? This is some kick in the head. Not sure what to tell you, Mr. Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE	I m hoping not to lose my house.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	You're carrying what on the house?
LARRY CROWNE
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	Two Ninety-two K. That's trouble. Three years ago I'd have loaned you $700,000, but I think you read the papers.
LARRY CROWNE	In a few weeks your financial base will tell us what we can do. Find new employment. Liquidate everything low on the Value Index. Stick to a budget. Clip coupons, buy in bulk, you know the drill. Then come back and we'll work with you.
LARRY CROWNE	That's RiverBank's plan for me?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	It is Friday, Mr. Crowne...
LAMARR	Larry's home a little late tonight.
PATIENCE	Maybe he was out on a date.
LAMARR	We'd see that on the news.
PATIENCE	Don't even think about lighting that up in my house.
LARRY CROWNE	How do I offer this up to Personnel?
PLANET STAFFER	There should be a box to put it in.
LARRY CROWNE	This?
PLANET STAFFER	No. There should be another box.
LARRY CROWNE	There isn't.
PLANET STAFFER	That's the one, then.
LARRY CROWNE	Just following up with an in-person visit.
LARRY CROWNE	You have a great location here.
LARRY CROWNE	I used to work for UniMart! I could spill you some 411.
LARRY CROWNE	I know their trade secrets.
LARRY CROWNE	And I'm ready to learn new strategies. I'll stop by again so you can keep me in mind.
LARRY CROWNE	I'll work every day.
CHEF AMOS	Oh, I remember you. Larry Crowne. I never forget anyone who quits on me.
LARRY CROWNE	As I recall, I gave my notice and worked all my shifts and that was 12 years ago.
CHEF AMOS	As I recall, I had to hire and train a line cook to take your place. Walking out doesn't happen in a vacuum, you know. Doesn't mean I wouldn't give you a job again. But you've been out of the business a long time, and look around. I don't need you.
RAUL	You come in two weeks ago I would have kissed you on the mouth, but Carlos and Nick, they walked in. Best I can do? Put you at the top of the list.
PERRY	Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I could help you but Raul runs the back.
LARRY CROWNE	Not sure I could work here anyway. The atmosphere is too pleasant and the clientï¿½le too A Number 1.
PERRY	Breakfast on the house. Chorizo Scramble, right?
LARRY CROWNE	No charity today. I got things to do.
PERRY	Like what?
LARRY CROWNE	Nothing. I was just saying that.
LARRY
LAMARR	There's been a yard sale at 1402 Derby Court since Monica Lewinsky! That gives me a monopoly on the location! You go yard on me, Larry Crowne and I will destroy you.
LAMARR	Bloody Friday. Security sees you off, by the time Monday comes around the fired man is the forgotten man. Diabolical.
LARRY CROWNE	They said it's because I didn't go to college.
LAMARR	Smoke screen. The Man just wanted you gone. (his yard sale) You liquidating assets to raise cash?
LARRY CROWNE	Buying out Denise's half of the house was the worst advice, ever.
LAMARR	I told you to avoid divorce lawyers. Get married. Stay married. Come with me.
LAMARR	I'll tell you straight up - I'm not lending you money.
PATIENCE	Whole box of Cha-Cha records from the Fifties. You don't have any of these, I promise.
LAMARR	He can't afford 'em Lost his job
PATIENCE	No! UniMart just lost my business forever!
LARRY CROWNE	I love you too.
PATIENCE	Sorry, Lie-bare-eye-bee. Get a better job somewhere so you can crush them.
LARRY CROWNE	Hard to do.
LAMARR	He's going to get something better than a job. An education.
LAMARR	Get some knowledge and you'll be fire proof.
LARRY CROWNE	Aren't there unemployed engineers and geophysicists?
PATIENCE	Listen to my husband. Hasn't called a man boss in years. Paid off the house.
LARRY CROWNE	You won the Lottery.
PATIENCE	Picked 8 little numbers when I kept saying he was a fool. A quarter million dollars later I've shut up.
LAMARR	Lost half to taxes.
LARRY CROWNE	I'll see if there's a class in here for PowerBall 250.
LAMARR	That's half a buck for the book.
LARRY CROWNE	They give these away free.
LAMARR	They do. I don't.
BUSIK	Back to college, huh?
LARRY CROWNE	First time. I was in the Navy.
BUSIK	Coast Guard. Adventure of a Lifetime.
LARRY CROWNE	Galley Mate.
BUSIK	We teach a whole track in Hotel and Restaurant Food Preparation.
LARRY CROWNE	No. No, no. I need an all-new career and a place to go everyday.
BUSIK	Those two things are my specialty.
BUSIK	First thing. Bravo for choosing East City College. Never too late for an education. Second, you need a jolt to the confidence machinery.
BUSIK	I am going to change your life. (a page in the catalog) Speech 217: The Art of Informal Remarks, cause it's not enough to just be smart anymore, you have to project ease even when it ain't easy.
LARRY CROWNE	Is this Public Speaking?
BUSIK	It's training. Job interviews will be a breeze with the confidence you'll get from Speech Two One Seven. (even better...) And you'll spend three hours a week with the most attractive package in all of Academia. The Golden Girl of East City. Mercedes Tainot.
GPS VOICE	Please Enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I'm here. Shut up. Turn off!
LARRY CROWNE	Sorry! Parking's impossible today!
MERCEDES TAINOT	Are you new to the Faculty?
LARRY CROWNE	New to the Student Body.
MERCEDES TAINOT	This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars.
LARRY CROWNE	I'm going to be late for my first day of school.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I bet it won't be the first time.
MERCEDES TAINOT	This is it? This class...is CANCELLED!!
LARRY CROWNE	Please tell me this is Speech 217.
MERCEDES TAINOT	While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in this
DIBIASI	Ms. Tie-knot?
DIBIASI	Uh, Tay-knot...Tai-bo...
MERCEDES TAINOT	Who are you?
DIBIASI	Steve Dibiasi. Friends call me Nomad. Only two days before I gotta get up and give my address? You may be dreaming.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Why are you here, Steve?
DIBIASI	Counsellor Busik said this class would change my life.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Busik. Of course...
DIBIASI	I gotta take this...
LARRY CROWNE	Look at us, in two classes in a row.
PINEDO	Yes. Hi.
LARRY CROWNE	That Ms. Tainot is something else isn't she? I'm new to this coll ge life and, I confess, she sca es e This whole place scares me.
PINEDO	Yes.
LARRY CROWNE	I woke up this morning so nervous about the first day of school. I changed my clothes three times.
PINEDO	I am Lala.
MANIACALLY)	That usually scares people. Yet none of you have fled. A good economic indicator.
LARRY CROWNE	I like this guy...
PINEDO	Yes... Shakespeare as I know him... is cancelled.
LAMARR	What's cookin' Joe College?
LARRY CROWNE	Money woes. Paying for gas, getting to school. You ever come across a moped or a scooter for sale or trade?
LAMARR	Come with me.
PATIENCE	Your next wife might stand smoking that pipe in the house but your first one says 'uh-uh!' On the old TV on "Wheel of Fortune" (A person).
LAMARR	Passing through, woman...
PATIENCE	Larry Crowne, been thinking about you. Sit down here...
LARRY CROWNE	"College Graduate."
PATIENCE	That's going to be you someday.
PATIENCE	You have money in all those records. If you can part with them, they'd go for something on the eBay. I'll show you how...
LAMARR	This what you're talking about?
LARRY CROWNE	That's a hunk of junk.
LAMARR	This is classic.
LARRY CROWNE	It doesn't work.
LAMARR	It will for eight hundred dollars.
LARRY CROWNE	Two hundred.
LAMARR	Seven hundred.
LARRY CROWNE	Two hundred.
LAMARR	Six fifty.
LARRY CROWNE	Two hundred.
LAMARR	Six thirty.
PATIENCE	Gonna be a long night with you two.
LARRY CROWNE	Forget it.
LAMARR	Larry! The secret of any negotiation is for both of us to win Talk to me How much do you
LAMARR	Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet. Gas. Brake. Light's busted. Tires are low. You'll need a special license.
LARRY CROWNE	All I need is the open road.
LAMARR	You break it, you bought it.
LARRY CROWNE	It still works.
LAMARR	Talking about the hedge.
DEAN TAINOT	Well, hey! Who's home early!
MERCEDES TAINOT
DEAN TAINOT	First day of term calls for a celebration!
MERCEDES TAINOT	You'd think so.
DEAN TAINOT	What's your burden this go round?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water Torture. And Speech at Sunrise
DEAN TAINOT	I built a Flamethrower of a posting for WarriorWeb which, if I do say, will feed nicely as an outline for "Carrier: Second Angel." And, I was a guest blogger on CyberShare.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Why wouldn't I believe you?
DEAN TAINOT	I was composing, Mercy. That's what I do all day.
MERCEDES TAINOT	You were looking at porn.
MERCEDES TAINOT
DEAN TAINOT	It's barely porn. I'm not hiding it.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Yes you are.
DEAN TAINOT	Don't chug. Sip. Everyone hides something.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I have no secrets from you. I share the whole miserable slate.
DEAN TAINOT	You walked in the door pissed off because -- I'm sorry -- I've established a beach head in New Media while you still have to teach at Vassar of the Valley. You hide that.
MERCEDES TAINOT	You look at Bra-Busters Triple-X expecting me to pretend I don't know or I don't care. I do both and don't like it.
DEAN TAINOT	It may look like I don't work hard around here, Mercy. But I do. I'm just a guy who's a guy being a guy when you're not around...
DEAN TAINOT	I'm a guy. Who's a guy. Being a guy...
RIDER	How you doing...
LARRY CROWNE	Speck-tack-alar. Nice machine. Where you headed?
RIDER	Work.
LARRY CROWNE	School. College. I'm a student. What do you do?
RIDER	I'm a gynecologist.
LARRY CROWNE	Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day' but that would be stating the
TALIA	Where'd you get the Hot Wheels?
TALIA	That machine's a classic.
LARRY CROWNE	Got me here for a nickel's worth of gas.
TALIA	You're in Matsutani's Econ with me.
LARRY CROWNE	I am?
TALIA	That class is straining my coconut.
LARRY CROWNE	It's only been one day
TALIA	Didn't know you scooted.
LARRY CROWNE	New to the sport.
TALIA	(pulls out mobile phone) Give me your number. I'll introduce you to like-minded enthusiasts. Name please?
LARRY CROWNE	Larry Crowne. With an 'e'.
TALIA	'Larry'? I don't think so. I used to be Kathleen but one day I looked in the mirror and saw a girl named Talia. (then in her phone) Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check your texts and we'll do us some scooting. Gotta tell you, Lance. Tucking a polo shirt into khakis makes you look like a cop.
LARRY CROWNE	Not much fashion sense.
TALIA	I know! Gotta change that...
LARRY CROWNE	Gotta go!
TALIA	Then get going!!
CALIMERIS	With the push-up added, the 4-count Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie and works out the pecs and biceps. It's an all-in-one exercise perfect for Cheerleader conditioning. The
6-COUNT BURPIE
MERCEDES TAINOT	We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you. Who's next? Ms. Crowne?
LARRY CROWNE	You mean me?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Mr. Crowne. My bad.
LARRY CROWNE	My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. "How to make French Toast", but I'll speak English...
MERCEDES TAINOT	M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut.
LARRY CROWNE	Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle.
MERCEDES TAINOT	(still talking to herself) Great. The history of the sugar maple tree now. Thank you Wikipedia. But the speech is over. MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Ah-ooo-gah! Time's up.
LARRY CROWNE	That went fast...
MERCEDES TAINOT	Breakfast may never be ready.
DIBIASI	I'll go. But you aren't going to like it.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Are you clairvoyant?
DIBIASI	(holding a pack of Toaster
WAFFLES)
DIBIASI	Brown Waffles in toaster at lightest or lowest heat setting. An adult should supervise heating by children. Applause please.
BUSIK	Simple. Direct. Informative.
TALIA	Hey Monkey!
TALIA	This is Lance Corona. Classmate and good guy, so far.
DELL GORDO	Dell Gordo. You want to ride with us?
LARRY CROWNE	Why not.
TALIA	Snap along, Lance or you can't join the gang.
DELL GORDO	Okay. You're in for a trial run.
STAN	Not many of these '66 Wasps left around. They had low torque. How's the torque?
LARRY CROWNE	I just bought it and ride around.
TALIA	Stan knows engines and junk.
DELL GORDO	Let's go, Sweets!
TALIA	We ride, Monkey!
LARRY CROWNE	Other than school, I have nothing to do.
DELL GORDO	Let's troll Buena Vista for junk stores.
STAN	We hit those last week.
TALIA	If it was Saturday we'd look for yard sales.
LARRY CROWNE	I know where a yard sale is, like everyday.
TALIA	Lead the way. Monkey! Lance knows a yard sale!
DELL GORDO	Take point!
LARRY CROWNE	Follow me, boys and girl!
LAMARR	We're being invaded!
LAMARR	Larry, what kind of thugs you get in with?
LARRY CROWNE	College buddies.
LAMARR	If they're college buddies why aren't they in college?
TALIA	You have any old clothes?
LAMARR	Speak to my bride inside.
DELL GORDO	Oh man! These TV trays are too much!
LAMARR	Bargains at $100 apiece.
DELL GORDO	For these? Are you nuts?
LAMARR	I'm joking, kid. Let's get to haggling. A buck apiece.
LAMARR
YOU	Ninety-nine dollars apiece. see how this is working?
DELL GORDO	Two bucks apiece!
LAMARR	Ninety-eight and, kid, I do this every day.
TALIA	Layer this... with this.
PATIENCE	Add this belt?
TALIA	I LOVE THIS! Where did you GET IT?
PATIENCE	Reeled it in like tuna from the Atlantic.
TALIA	Diamonds in a diamond mine. Take this... under this...unbutton that.
PATIENCE	You and I are going to spend some time together!
TALIA	I gotta see Chez Lance.
LARRY CROWNE	Entrez vous, sea food plate.
TALIA	No sign of a woman around here for years. Drape a scarf over that lamp and you'll soften the light. No TV, b t vinyl disks of music? You trying to seduce me?
TALIA	Alphabetical order. No artistic chaos for you.
TALIA	Spin this platter, Mr. DJ?
LARRY CROWNE	Good choice.
TALIA	Breakfast nookie!
TALIA	Did Denise make you breakfast in here with a little apron and lipstick perfectly applied?
LARRY CROWNE	I did most of the cooking, actually. You know about Denise?
TALIA	Patience thought she was stuck up and seriously fleeced you.
TALIA	So what happened there, my Lance?
LARRY CROWNE	The usual stuff between three people.
TALIA	She must have been pretty. Fair haired or dark?
LARRY CROWNE	Dark.
TALIA	Like me. So? How about a demonstration? he means 'of the kitchen'. Larry's game...
LARRY CROWNE	Stay outta my way.
TALIA	Kitchen, Monkey!
DELL GORDO	Corn pone!
TALIA	Lance made all this. You should have seen him. He was like...
DELL GORDO	You're like Uncle Ben or something. Stan's working on your bike.
LARRY CROWNE	He is?
DELL GORDO	Said the thing was a time bomb. He's saving your life.
LARRY CROWNE	'We'll be right back after these messages.'
DELL GORDO	You're in the Street Patrol. A full-time mission for beauty and justice.
TALIA	That Denise. What a fool. You a e way cooler than you appear.
DELL GORDO	Lance. All men fall in love with Talia. You will too, if you haven't already. But I love her the most. Know that right now.
LARRY CROWNE	Capice.
DELL GORDO	Seriously. Don't make me keep my eyes on you. What's your real name?
LARRY CROWNE	L rry.
DELL GORDO	Mine's Don. Shake hands. Look each other in the eyes. Firm grips. No contest, but firm. Hold. Stack it. One word, Lance. Peace.
LARRY CROWNE	Peace indeed.
LARRY CROWNE	Speck-tack-alar.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Act I: Inventory. What do you sell? Act Two? To Market. Reach your buyers. Act Three? Three legs of accounting. Receivable. Payable. Due. Act Four? Forward planning. Plan to grow. Act Five? Final Profitability. What do you clear on bottom-line? In other words: "To be or not to be... in Business."
MERCEDES TAINOT	Did you notice? No script. No notes. So it can be done. You did good, Fran. Thanks.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Anything for the woman who brought out the public speaker in Frances Taylor-Briegh. I used you as a Focal Reference but you weren't there for me. What's wrong, Mercy? I broke up with the Orthodontist. Now I have to get a new boyfriend and a new orthodontist. You ever do that? Get crushes on people you see every day after ignoring them and then find out they're creeps after all?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Mr Crowne? Can you move along
LARRY CROWNE	That was a great presentation. I learned a lot from it.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Super.
LARRY CROWNE	Smart stuff. Super smart.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Ethel's here, Lucy. What's going on?
MERCEDES TAINOT	When was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Mercy. You're an idol to me. Hearing you talk like that is crushing my dreams.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Well I'm joking of course!!! Translation? Ms. Francesco?
TALIA	Something complicated.
LARRY CROWNE	Breaking even is not making profit, it's a theoretical assumption. Economics abhors an assumption. The Break Even Paradox creates a new metric... Palm out again. DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D) I am growing tired of this game, Mr. Crowne. Aren't you?
LARRY CROWNE	So what happens here?
TALIA	You ready? Re-invention Big Boy
LARRY CROWNE	I have no idea what that means, but you betcha.
LARRY CROWNE	Holy smokes!
TALIA	I started in the smallest unit.
LARRY CROWNE	This is just sitting here? Talia! This is unproductive capital! Sell it on eBay.
TALIA	No one should ever buy clothes off the internet. You have to feel the fabric and test the drape...
LARRY CROWNE	What is all this worth?
TALIA	A lot to me. Try these on.
LARRY CROWNE	Where?
TALIA	Anywhere. Fashion is no place for modesty. Strip.
LARRY CROWNE
TALIA	This is a service to humankind, Lance. It hurts me to see a Top Cat dressed like an ex-hockey player. You gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar. Starting now.
DELL GORDO	Monkey! Thought you might be here.
TALIA	Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put your pants on!
GPS VOICE	Please enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Go to hell...
HE'S
DEAN TAINOT	No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful and brilliant. And I will be a good boy from now on. Why? Because you're right and I've learned my lesson. Just don't be mad at me forever. I have a pliable soul and I pray you do too
MERCEDES TAINOT	It was. Yes.
DEAN TAINOT	Been thinking. If you ever want to take a whack at writing something -- say a blog a couple of times a week -- I could help you out.
MERCEDES TAINOT	How?
DEAN TAINOT	I'd read your stuff. Make comments to make it web-savvy. Pieces need to pop, you know. Takes a little
PRACTICE
MERCEDES TAINOT	Okay.
DEAN TAINOT	See? You can't stay mad at me. No reason to be mad at me...
DENISE	This is Denise. How can I help you.
LARRY CROWNE	Denise. Larry.
DENISE	My god. Larry Crowne. I remember you.
LARRY CROWNE	This a good time?
DENISE	Other than me being at work?
LARRY CROWNE	I'll call you later.
DENISE	I'm surprised is all. What do you want?
LARRY CROWNE	Well. Okay. Uh. Here's the deal.
DENISE	Spit it, Lar.
LARRY CROWNE	I'm going to miss a few months on the checks for the house.
DENISE	Okay.
LARRY CROWNE	I hoped not to, but I there it is.
DENISE	Okay. Yeah.
LARRY CROWNE	I'm sorry.
DENISE	How many months?
LARRY CROWNE	Let's start with six.
DENISE	That can't happen, Larry. I'm extended. I've put a deposit down on the first vacation I've had in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as valid as yours, so I need the checks like always. A deal's a deal.
LARRY CROWNE	I don't have it.
DENISE	That's not my problem. Take out a loan on the house or something.
LARRY CROWNE	I tried. I'm too much of a risk.
DENISE	Oh, I'm not touching that. I don't want to open up the whole lawyer thing, but I will if pushed. Sucks, doesn't it? I appreciate the rigorous Crowne honesty, but this can't happen. These calls are monitored to guarantee customer satisfaction, so I'm hanging up before my supervisor comes on...
PERRY	Can I smell trouble or what?
RAUL	Can you speak English?
PERRY	Those two over in booth 6...
PERRY	Homeland Security. I piped thei badges and everything.
RAUL	What is Homeland Security doing here...
R
LARRY CROWNE
HEY
RAUL	This is Larry Crowne?
LARRY CROWNE	Raul? Yes.
RAUL	Get your ass down here. You got a job.
LARRY CROWNE	I do?
PERRY	We're swamped, Kimosabe. Get back there!
RAUL	You're late on your first day!
RAUL	Where you learn to turn eggs like
LARRY CROWNE	The USS Coral Sea. Boss, I don't want to quit school.
RAUL	So don't.
LARRY CROWNE	I gotta get to class before I miss the whole day. And I can't work mornings Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.
RAUL	Soon as the rush is finished, go. I'll get my idiot brother-in-law three days a week. You take evenings. Deal?
LARRY CROWNE	Deal. When will we talk salary?
RAUL	Never. This is take it or leave it. Don t worry. I may be tough but I'll be fair.
MACK	These are not toys. Nobody 'plays' with these. These are kept behind glass, so no way am I passing them around today.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Wait a ding dong minute. (counts the heads) 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is missing! Who cut my class?
MACK	Guess Larry's out today.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Anyone know why?
MACK	He didn't call me.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I don't believe this! Ditching me? He ditched me? Not okay. Larry Crowne, you are on my Shit List.
DIBIASI	Sounds like Teacher has a thing for a Teach-ee.
CALIMERIS	When you were out last week, she said nothing. I think she has a crush on Larry Crowne.
PINEDO	I do too. (off their looks) He's a nice man.
MACK	Should I continue?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Yes. Tell us more about your man dolls.
MACK	I'm sure everyone recognizes Boba Fett...
LARRY CROWNE	I'm sorry I'm late, Dr. Matsutani. May I still sit in the class? I'm going to ask a question in a moment. I want someone other than you to answer it - I don't care if the silence is positively Arctic. Anyone?
LARRY CROWNE	Lala... To upload market differences without...
PINEDO	Without mooting the quarterlies. I know.
LARRY CROWNE	Then say it. Just give the answer. You know it. Say it.
PINEDO	Can I?
PINEDO	To up... met... es without ...ing ...terly predicts....?
PINEDO	To upload market differences without mooting quarterly predictions.
PINEDO	No. Only the profit markdown.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Is that Larry Crowne!? You have a lot of nerve showing your face on campus after ditching my class!
LARRY CROWNE	I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not miss another class, this I vow.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne. You'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first. A story, with details, not a laundry list or slide show. And, as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid.
TALIA	That woman is one clenched fist of fury.
TALIA	She must not be having any amok lovin'.
TALIA	Without a workout in the Inner Sanctum a few times a week I can't concentrate.
LARRY CROWNE	Inappropriate subject in mixed company.
LARRY CROWNE
TALIA	You you want to fix it with your teacher? Bang her.
LARRY CROWNE	She's marred.
TALIA	You'd kill two birds in one bush. Nothing wrong with a campus romance. Otherwise life is what? Breakfast work, coffee, school, lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk, Mexican food, a movie, glass of wine or two then bed? That's not living.
TALIA	Bet she'd give you an A plus. If you're any good...
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	More complimentary coffee?
LARRY CROWNE	Complimentary coffee is usually lousy.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	I drink it all day. So? You're back!
LARRY CROWNE	I got a job.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	Atta Baby!
LARRY CROWNE	Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all day. And I'm going to school.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	At East City. I see. (from the papers) Larry, this doesn't change anything.
LARRY CROWNE	I was afraid of that.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	The interest alone will eat up your service industry salary.
LARRY CROWNE	It's been a few weeks.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	Okay. I will personally take this to my supervisor and fight to get you the loan you need. But you know how complimentary coffee is always lousy? Your chances are, too.
LARRY CROWNE	I can't make the payments on the house. I'm going to lose it, aren't I?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD	Stop with the gloomy puss. You're doing everything right. Hang in there. You still have a friend at RiverBank.
LARRY CROWNE	You guys are forced to say that, aren't you?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
DELL GORDO	I think it's letting up.
TALIA	It's going to storm till next year.
DELL GORDO	We can't stay here all day. Find a raincoat and let's get a little wet.
TALIA	I do not scoot in the rain.
DELL GORDO	How you going to get to school then, College Co-Ed Belle?
TALIA	My savior! Look at your new schmatas. And footwear! (hopping in, to Dell) Stay dry, sweetie!
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	I never read them.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Who did? I'm married to an ex- teacher turned blogger with two books in print. And oh, yes, he has the libido and internet access of a 13-year-old.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	I had a boyfriend who owned every movie Sophia Loren ever made. I d hear a DVD go into the playe an knew what I was going to be doing in a half-hour.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Once more to Divorce Court to cashier a spouse, line my cloak with alimony and do myself homage.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Othello. Act 1. Scene 1. Iago to Roderigo.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Why can't all my students be like y u?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Because, as I learned in your class, I am one of a kind.
MERCEDES TAINOT
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	It happens.
MERCEDES TAINOT	You are everything that's wrong with America, Larry Crowne!
DIBIASI	Woah! Larry Crowne, I didn't know you were gay. You've gone all Project Runway on us.
LARRY CROWNE	Should I begin?
MERCEDES TAINOT	(talking to herself in the MOVIE
DEVICE WAY)	Oh shut up you sleaze. Jerk. Look at the new pants. They actually fit. And that jacket is 'smart'. Did Busik put Larry Crowne into Fashion for Creeps? An old goat dressed like lamb. Of course! It's that doe-eyed young thing he's been wearing on his sleeve. Dressing like he's half his age. Give me a shotgun! I'll pepper Larry Crowne right now! Am I being unfair? I mean, if I were single and some young buck took to me, wouldn't I be inclined to diddly-dally?
DIBIASI	(jerking out buds) What? What he say?
LARRY CROWNE	Unless you're looking at a chart, you don't even know the Equator when you cross it...
MERCEDES TAINOT	A repackaged Larry Crowne won't fool me. Shame on you. Going after jail bait, you criminal. Insert Viagra joke here... herself at you... No. Don't let up. No, Mercy. NO MERCY!
PINEDO	That Larry believed there were signs on posts marking the Equator.
CALIMERIS	And that, when it's a first time, they make the rookies dress in drag and sing Abba songs?
MACK	Larry worked on an Aircraft Carrier! Night Carrier Landings are the trickiest flying in world.
MERCEDES TAINOT	That was a memorable nugget.
PINEDO	Larry was stationed in Panama! My father is from Panama!
MERCEDES TAINOT	Mr. Koss to the lectern, please.
LARRY CROWNE	Oh crap.
TALIA	Chef Corona! Steam us some corn bread?
TALIA	Woman on deck!
RAUL	You can't come in here.
TALIA	I'm a friend of Lance's.
RAUL	No Lance works for me.
RAUL	This is my kitchen and I am the boss.
TALIA	Is he, Lance?
LARRY CROWNE	Raul's my boss, yeah.
TALIA	Rah-ool. Rhymes with ya-cool. Are ya' cool, Raul?
RAUL	Sure I'm cool. Tough but fair, too.
TALIA	As boss, do you make up the menu?
L
RAUL
A	N . But I do the purchasing.
R
TALIA	Is that a tough but fair job?
R
RAUL
Y	It makes me crazy, you kidding? But it's gotta be done every day or guess what? No food. I'll show you how much I gotta do...
P
U
RAUL IS
PERRY	Breakfast all day, see. From Corn Flakes to popovers. We make the best Chicken Fried Steak outside of a truck stop.
TALIA	Can Lance take a break?
PERRY	Who?
TALIA	The artist formerly known as Larry. I need his expertise.
PERRY	Lance.
LARRY CROWNE	Square footage at this price is a bargain.
TALIA	Maurice says I'm saving his life by renting the space.
LARRY CROWNE	This is your Matsutani Delta Number. You net this every month, you cover overhead, and the rest is profit.
TALIA	You sure?
LARRY CROWNE	Chapter four.
TALIA	You make it sound so simple!!
LARRY CROWNE	Well, back to work!
DEAN TAINOT	Work my ass off all night trying to get f i in' smile out of you!
MERCEDES TAINOT	I'm smiling...
DEAN TAINOT	Like The Joker after three Apple Martinis.
MERCEDES TAINOT	If they help, they help.
DEAN TAINOT	We can't even have a Date Night now? You can't even chillax for one meal?
MERCEDES TAINOT	"Chillax?" Did you use the word "chillax?" That come from your Bloggers Thesaurus?
GPS VOICE	Please Enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT	You lie to me, Dean. Every day. You. Lie. To. Me.
DEAN TAINOT	You looking for a whole new man, Mercy? I'm the jerk who has to transform into Ultraman to make you happy? No. I like myself, Mercy. I put up with you and complain about nothing.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I'm not complaining. I'm stating the truth. I teach while you pretend to work.
DEAN TAINOT	I had three postings today alone. FogCaster, SkyScan, and ParsecTwelve.com
MERCEDES TAINOT	Those weren't postings. They were comments.
DEAN TAINOT	Hey, Booze-illa, who are you to judge me? I know what's really pissing you off. I like big titties. And you don't have any.
MERCEDES TAINOT
JANET	As soon as I saw you, I said, "I want to go out with that man."
TONY	What did you say when I asked you out?
JANET	I said "Yes." You were there, remember?
TONY	I saw you and I thought "I would be a lucky guy if she'd go out with me."
JANET	Yes you are.
TONY	Honestly, this is about as good a first date goes, isn't it?
JANET	Disaster looms on most first dates, but I'm talking to you like you're a friend I want to make out with.
TONY	Hold that thought.
DEAN TAINOT	I take it back. I take it back.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Drive, asshole! Drive away!
DEAN TAINOT	I've been drinking, too.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline!
DEAN TAINOT	You win! I'm letting you win! Everything you say is right and
MERCEDES TAINOT	LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER!
DEAN TAINOT	Screw you, you washboard!
MERCEDES TAINOT	Oh, chillax!!!
GPS VOICE	Please enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I'm throwing rocks at my own car !!
MERCEDES TAINOT	I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes.
TALIA	Lance! Chick alert!
TALIA	You are not going to believe how Fate meets cute!
LARRY CROWNE	Ms. Tainot?
MERCEDES TAINOT	No.
LARRY CROWNE	Larry Crowne.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Jesus Christ.
TALIA	And I've been calling you 'Lance'.
LARRY CROWNE	Do you need a ride? Hop on.
MERCEDES TAINOT	And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi?
TALIA	Hey. Bambi was a boy.
LARRY CROWNE	I was heading home. Right? We're done scooting?
TALIA	Not me. I love riding in the night. Magic happens.
MERCEDES TAINOT	What do men see in irritating free spirits?
LARRY CROWNE	Seriously. I offer you a ride.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Seriously. I don't want one.
LARRY CROWNE	I've yet to give anyone a lift on this but I think I can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts black boil up from my soul. Major consequences sure to follow. You'll read about them on Parsectwelve.com.
LARRY CROWNE	An attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I need a man flirting with me right now like I need a dog crapping on my lawn. I'm hoofing it.
LARRY CROWNE	In those shoes?
MERCEDES TAINOT	A man who notices shoes. All right. I'll be your Cycle Slut.
LARRY CROWNE	Put this on. Strap your legs round my engine and
MERCEDES TAINOT	It won't be a terrible thing if you kill us both.
LARRY CROWNE	Ain't you a ball of fun?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Are you really going to go this slow?
LARRY CROWNE	I do want to survive this night.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Fine. I have time to window shop. Oh look, a sale on tires at AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox. I've never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme. This is so slow a cat could knock us over.
LARRY CROWNE	Where am I taking you?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Down to Portola and left to Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo. Right on Palermo till I yell stop.
LARRY CROWNE	I may use this as a presentation in class.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Try it and you'll flunk.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
LARRY CROWNE	I like your class. You're making us all do things we never thought we could.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Put the shovel away and just get me home, 'kay?
LARRY CROWNE	Someone's getting pinched...
MERCEDES TAINOT	Measure his dick, officer! He's too diminutive to drive! Tiny dick loser!
LARRY CROWNE	Bad night for that guy.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Best night I've had in years! Drive on, McDuff!
LARRY CROWNE	Unit 114.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Thanks for the ox-cart ride. Help me.
LARRY CROWNE	You don't want to give me your pass code.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Just hold my hand up to the numbers. I'll manage from there. Two two two two. Pound.
LARRY CROWNE	This it?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Why I think it is!
LARRY CROWNE	I'll get the door for you
MERCEDES TAINOT	Take one step inside and I call security.
LARRY CROWNE	What?
MERCEDES TAINOT	This whole sorry chapter tonight.
LARRY CROWNE	What?
MERCEDES TAINOT	You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me.
LARRY CROWNE	What are you talking about?
MERCEDES TAINOT	What, you have no short-term memory?
LARRY CROWNE	When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home.
LARRY CROWNE	Goodnight, Ms. Tainot.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not see that?
LARRY CROWNE	I assumed you preferred Ms
MERCEDES TAINOT	When we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that. Why aren't you married?
LARRY CROWNE	That's a long story and it's late. My helmet?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Help yourself.
LARRY CROWNE
WHAT
MERCEDES TAINOT
IT MAY	You smell good.
LARRY CROWNE	Thanks.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Do you have a crush on me? Single student. Unattainable teacher. It's common.
LARRY CROWNE	We all have crushes on you. Even the gals.
MERCEDES TAINOT	You want to make out with me, you can. I know I'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still
GOT MOVES
LARRY CROWNE	Wow...
MERCEDES TAINOT	Pretty dang good. I still got it, no?
LARRY CROWNE	Yes, you do.. In you go. (Mercedes goes in) Close the door. Lock it!
MERCEDES TAINOT	Whoever I am...
DEAN TAINOT	Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow... Mercy!!!
TALIA	Oh, come on! I left you all set up! What went down?
LARRY CROWNE	Epilog. School today.
TALIA	Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel.
LARRY CROWNE	If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it.
PINEDO	Seeing them -- the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis -- should have been beyond me, but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me. That is something I will remember forever. The teacher says nothing. DIBIASI That was a knockout speech, Lala. Made the news. Caused riots downtown. School's out til 2019.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Mr. Crowne? A moment please?
CALIMERIS	Why doesn't she just throw herself at him?
PINEDO	This is bordering on harassment now.
DIBIASI	Quiet down. I'm watching the TV show...
MACK	Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
MERCEDES TAINOT	I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you.
DIBIASI	Move along folks. Privacy's a right in this great nation of ours.
MACK	You want I should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed??
LARRY CROWNE	How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short a time span.
LARRY CROWNE	Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want.
LARRY CROWNE	I wouldn't want that.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I hope the entire thing will be forgotten.
LARRY CROWNE	Sure. Nothing happened. At all.
MERCEDES TAINOT	So there will be no bravado among you and your pals?
LARRY CROWNE	None.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Thank you, Mr. Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE	I'd better scurry along to Dr. Matsutani's class. I hope I don't have this same conversation with him.
LAMARR	Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax. See? Works.
LARRY CROWNE	I have to sell my car.
LARRY CROWNE	If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it.
LAMARR	What's the job paying you?
LARRY CROWNE	Half my UniMart salary.
LAMARR	You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as dirt.
LARRY CROWNE	I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days.
LAMARR	Hang in there, neighbor.
LARRY CROWNE	Everyone keeps saying that.
LAMARR	I was in the same spot. Look what happened.
LARRY CROWNE	The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery.
LAMARR	I read how the universe is expanding, Larry, taking us along with it. That is a wild concept to grasp, but what it means is, we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we're going to be.
LARRY CROWNE	This thing must be making me dizzy. What?
LAMARR	Keep your grip. You'll be okay. It's like the wife always says...
LAMARR	A woman with a measuring tape? That's money in my pocket.
HURLEY	' ind bargains today?'
LARRY CROWNE	Vick? How you doing? Larry Crowne.
HURLEY	Larry. Hi.
LARRY CROWNE	Why are you on the Register?
HURLEY	Management Execs are now required to put in 8-hour shifts on the floor. Every day. No overtime. No bonus. Just more hours. Cash or UniMart Bargain Card? Like you have one of them.
LARRY CROWNE	Cash. No receipt.
HURLEY	You got out of here just in time... 'Thank you for choosing UniMart, where united we blah blah.'
DEAN TAINOT	Hi.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Thanks for coming.
DEAN TAINOT	No notice. No preamble. Just an email and a google map.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I knew you'd be on the computer. Working...
DEAN TAINOT	Point made. So. What up.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Are we making a mistake here?
DEAN TAINOT
MERCEDES TAINOT	Point made. We could change things. We could start right now.
DEAN TAINOT	We could. Why should we?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure.
DEAN TAINOT	I'd like that too.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Really?
DEAN TAINOT	You're not a pleasant woman after a few glasses. Mornings with you are to be survived.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Okay. Now, you.
DEAN TAINOT	I see. I'm what this is all about.
MERCEDES TAINOT	There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here.
DEAN TAINOT	You're talking about you but you really mean me. I am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything. So you don't get to either.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I'm not saying that.
DEAN TAINOT	We've both been here before. Why prolong the process? White flag! I give up. This ain't working. I'll sign papers and checks, see if there's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually I will be fine and you will too. But I am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults. I just now came up with that, and it is going to be my next posting.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid. Ms Pinedo Draw
MERCEDES TAINOT	Spuds. Can't wait.
DIBIASI	'Disraeli'? What is that?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Who is that?
DIBIASI	It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done.
LARRY CROWNE	'Consumerism'.
MERCEDES TAINOT	That's supposed to say 'Communism.'
LARRY CROWNE	The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism.
CALIMERIS	'Malpity Hoople.' What's this say?
MERCEDES TAINOT	No idea. Just pick another.
)	At the end of each chapter is a study guide. Master those and you will have mastered my book. Master my book and you will take over the world.
TALIA	You digging what you see?
LARRY CROWNE	You missed Matsutani's class. Review for the final.
TALIA	I'm done w th college.
LARRY CROWNE	What? Why?
TALIA	Because I'm going into business.
LARRY CROWNE	Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in school. Don't throw away your education.
TALIA	And don't drink and drive or do drugs and quit smoking and eat vegetables. I don't. I stopped. I did. I do.
LARRY CROWNE
TALIA	Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice gave us free tattoos. I wanted something in Japanese so check this out.
TALIA	That one says 'courage'. That one says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit.
LARRY CROWNE	Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce.
TALIA	Oh shut up.
LARRY CROWNE	It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce. Quitting school is for dopes.
TALIA	Be here for our Grand Opening!
LARRY CROWNE	Might not make it. I have finals!
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	This place anonymous enough?
MERCEDES TAINOT	As long as alcohol's out of my grasp.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	They have good pie, they say.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Great. Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Yep.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	You'd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious, right?
PERRY	Ladies. Bring an appetite?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	The mark of a restaurant is their Key Lime pie.
PERRY
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	No Key Lime?
PERRY	Cream pies I got.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Boston Cream?
PERRY	Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady, you're killing me here.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Phooey. Peach. Peach pie.
PERRY	Ma'am?
MERCEDES TAINOT	I'll have the French Toast.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	French Toast?
MERCEDES TAINOT	(on the menu) Breakfast all day.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	I have seen it happen a time or two.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I kissed a boy.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	When, third grade?
MERCEDES TAINOT	One of my students.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	You Hoor. Gimme the friggin' details! He's not a minor is he?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Older than me.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Hugh Hefner in your class? What went down?
MERCEDES TAINOT	He sort of... rescued me. And... he smelled nice.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	He a fireman who bakes bread?
MERCEDES TAINOT	I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Bold. Who is he?
PERRY	You're slipping, Larry. Lady says it's not French Toast as she knows it.
LARRY CROWNE	She's insane.
PERRY	Take it up with her.
PERRY	No shouting, okay? This is a family friendly establishment.
LARRY CROWNE	Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order?
MERCEDES TAINOT
LARRY CROWNE	Mrs. Tainot.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	The student of yours!?
MERCEDES TAINOT	This is Larry Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE	There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast.
MERCEDES TAINOT	It was fine, actually. I wanted to see if it was really you cooking back there. And say, howdy. Howdy doody.
LARRY CROWNE	You'll be the judge of that.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Absolutely.
LARRY CROWNE	Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Yes indeed.
LARRY CROWNE	Shall I prepare you another batch?
MERCEDES TAINOT	No. Thanks.
LARRY CROWNE	Then I will return to my station..
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	You kissed the cook... I got a whiff. He smelled like bell pepper.
MERCEDES TAINOT	Look at the men in my life.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH	Blame it on the booze... and collect yourself. You hoor...
MERCEDES TAINOT	That's my problem. I'm a drunken hoor. Check please?
MERCEDES TAINOT	What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought. Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris stopped up-talking. Lala you can't shut up. Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. And Larry Crowne... And... He's polite. Instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in. What kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me? He could have ravaged me. I misread this guy and if I had a brain I'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself. I wonder if he'd like that, if he would... What did I just say? What did I just say about Larry Crowne?
DIBIASI	Nothing. And I was just wrapping up here.
MERCEDES TAINOT	I'm so sorry. Please go on.
DIBIASI	Larry? It okay if I get to my climax and denouement?
DIBIASI	Thank you... If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria the Queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime Minister of Great Britain. Not bad for a Jewish guy, huh?
PINEDO	Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last?
DIBIASI	Fourth quarter dramatics. Not that it mattered to my Speech professor...
MERCEDES TAINOT	Congratulations all of you.
MACK	Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we vote?
MERCEDES TAINOT	Not me, I have to stay objective.
MACK	I say... Lala!
MACK	This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records.
LARRY CROWNE	Priceless at a buck apiece.
PATIENCE	A two-bedroom apartment and you don't have room for your furniture?
LAMARR	Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing. What's the minimum you'll take for this stuff?
LARRY CROWNE	You'll get me top price.
LAMARR	You did learn.
DIBIASI	Pizza at last!
LARRY CROWNE	Here's lunch as promised!
STRANG	Son of a cock. Larry Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE	Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony.
STRANG	Two extra large. One Salad Bucket. Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs. Sixteen- fifty.
LARRY CROWNE	Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough.
STRANG	Tell me about it.
LARRY CROWNE	Ah. Forget it. Keep the change.
STRANG	I appreciate it. That could have been
RAUL	My next wife just walked in.
