Henry's Crime

HENRY	Smells good.
DEBBIE	Sit down.
HENRY	Wow. Thanks.
DEBBIE	How was your night?
HENRY	Good. How was yours?
DEBBIE	Good.
HENRY	This is great.
HENRY	Your shift's at eight thirty?
HENRY	You not eating?
DEBBIE	I already did.
HENRY	You okay?
DEBBIE	Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday?
HENRY	Sure. What time?
DEBBIE	For the baby shower.
HENRY	Right.
DEBBIE	Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and Bill's.
HENRY	What?
DEBBIE	I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come here.
HENRY	Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime.
DEBBIE	Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us?
HENRY	You're talking about kids.
DEBBIE	Of course I am.
HENRY	Okay.
DEBBIE	'Okay' you want kids?
HENRY	I love kids.
DEBBIE	Henry?
DEBBIE	Do you still love me?
HENRY	Of course I do.
DEBBIE	Because I know you did once.
DEBBIE	What happened, Henry?
EDDIE	Henry Torne.
HENRY	Eddie Vibes.
EDDIE	So how you doin', man?
HENRY	I'm okay. What's going on?
EDDIE	Listen, I got a man down here.
EDDIE	Mind if we come in for a second?
DEBBIE	He's hot.
JOE	(holding it in) I'm sorry.
DEBBIE	You better come with me.
EDDIE	Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.
HENRY	Yeah.
EDDIE	So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's our first baseman. And he's not exactly game-ready as you can see...
HENRY	Yeah.
EDDIE	So, what do you say?
HENRY	What do I say what?
EDDIE	You feel like playing a little ball? Filling in for Joe?
HENRY	It's November.
EDDIE	Yeah. They keep the field in perfect shape.
HENRY	Oh.
EDDIE	So what do you say?
EDDIE	Henry?
EDDIE	Appreciate you driving, man.
HENRY	So where's this game?
EDDIE	Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.
EDDIE	Pull up right over here. We gotta grab some beer money at that ATM.
EDDIE	Just hang tight. We'll be right back.
FRANK	Freeze!
DETECTIVE	Henry, we know this wasn't your deal.
DETECTIVE	All you have to do is give me those names. And you can go home. It's that simple.
DETECTIVE	Come on. Why are you sticking up for these people? They're not your friends. You've got a wife. You've got a job... don't you care?	All you have to do is say something.
JUDGE	...the court sentences Henry Torne to four years in prison for the crime of Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.
HENRY	Huh.
MAX	I said what are you in for?
HENRY	Bank robbery.
MAX	Good. Clean. Simple. I like it.
HENRY	But I didn't do it.
MAX	Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial favorite. Identities are just constructs, anyway. They're mistaken all the time.
MAX	I'm Max.
HENRY	Henry.
MAX	Go on. Make yourself at home.
HENRY	So...what are you in for?
MAX	Life.
MAX	Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
MAX	Hurry up. We gotta go.
MAX	Breakfast.
MAX	`Monday is whole wheat bun-day.'
MAX	What are you thinking about?
HENRY	Nothing.
MAX	You're thinking something. Let me guess. You're thinking, `How did I get here?'
MAX	How do you think any of us got here?
HENRY	I'm not sure.
MAX	I'll tell you how. Because we committed crimes. But we committed to the wrong thing. You see that was our mistake. We didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people.
MAX	See him?
MAX	Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He could've been, but he chose not to fulfil his potential, he chose not to commit to his dream. And now look at him.	Bad choices, see.
MAX	By the way, I recommend the potatoes.
MAX	That's the real crime, Henry. Not committing to your dream.
MAX	So what's yours?
HENRY	My what?
MAX	Your dream.
HENRY	Not sure I ever had one.
MAX	Never had a dream? What kind of a life is that?
HENRY	I don't know. A pretty good one?
MAX	Henry, you're in jail.
MAX	But here's the good news. We got all this time to do. And time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it.MAX	Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And in your case, you can figure out what your dream is.
MAX	Your dream is your truth is your destiny.
HENRY	I told you. I'm here by mistake.
MAX	There are no mistakes.
HENRY	What?
MAX	But you're going to have to fight for that dream, Henry.
HENRY	I am.
MAX	You're at a crossroads now. There are going to be tests!
HENRY	What tests?
MAX	This is your moment. Whatever you do now defines you. Go get em!
MAX	You did good, Henry.
HENRY	I don't feel good.
MAX	You're doing better than you feel.
MAX	Go to sleep, Henry.	Sleep is for the blessed.
DEBBIE	Hi.
HENRY	Hi. You look beautiful.
DEBBIE	Thank you. How are you doing?
HENRY	I'm okay. How about you?
DEBBIE	I'm good.
DEBBIE	Listen, Henry. I have something I need to talk to you about.
HENRY	Okay.
DEBBIE	I fell in love.
HENRY	Oh.
DEBBIE	I just...I mean it just happened.
HENRY	Okay. Wow...
DEBBIE	I'm sorry, Henry.
HENRY	It's alright.
DEBBIE	You're not mad?
HENRY	No.
HENRY	I want you to be happy.
DEBBIE	You too, Henry.
MAX	I ever tell you I was married?
MAX	I mean nearly. I had a lovely correspondence going with Jocelyn Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she finally came on visitor's day she said I was too short.
HENRY	Books and covers.
MAX	Right. Books and covers.
MAX	Clean as a whistle.
FINK	(checking himself out) Max, I think you missed your calling.
MAX	Thank you.	Who do we got next, Henry?
HENRY	Hector. You're up.
HECTOR	Hey, Max. When are you up for parole?
MAX	October.
HECTOR	Show us what you did for the board last time.
MAX	I'm working.
OTHER INMATES	Show us!
MAX	Leave me alone.
INMATES	Come on! Show us.
MAX	All right, so I'm sitting there, and the head of the board asks me what I'm going to do if they let me out this time. And, so...
MAX	I get this twitch! and then I give him my answer: "I'm gonna break in your house, set your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on a naked rampage through your garden, dance in the streets of your l'il hometown like a crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming through the ethereal sky like God's blackest angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly fireball!
MAX	Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't want THIS. Not out THERE.
MAX	Believe me, I'm not going anywhere.
HECTOR	Hey, White Shadow. When's your review coming up?
HENRY	Next month.
HECTOR	You gonna do the twitch like your cellie?
HENRY	Nope.
HECTOR	What, you don't like it around here?
MAX	Everyone knows Henry's innocent.
HECTOR	The board don't like it when you deny the crime.
HENRY	I didn't do the crime.
HECTOR	Hey, but you got the time...so you may as well have done it.
MAX	I like it! `You got the time, so you may as well have done the crime!'
MAX	Now that's funny, Henry.
HENRY	Yeah, you're right.
HENRY	You know you never did tell me what your dream was, Max.
MAX	I'm living it.
HENRY	Really?
MAX	Sure! It's easier to live in here. You don't have to do anything. You just show up. In fact they even do that for you. I'm living the life.
HENRY	This place is horrible, Max.
MAX	So why didn't you just say something?
HENRY	When?
MAX	Back then. When you had the chance. When you were still innocent.
HENRY	I thought maybe this was my way out.
MAX	And was it?
HENRY	Yeah.
MAX	See. There are no mistakes.
MAX	You got everything, kid?
HENRY	Yeah.
HENRY	Maybe you should think about getting out of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of coffee on the outside.
MAX	The only thing I've ever missed in twenty three years is a hot bath. And that ain't worth walking out of here for.
MAX	Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is your truth.
HENRY	I thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny.
MAX	Just testing.
HENRY	I'm going to miss you.
MAX	Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again.
HENRY	I'm still gonna miss you.
MAX	Get out of here, Henry.
JOE	Henry. How you doing?
HENRY	Hey.
JOE	Debbie! Henry's here.	Come on in. Make yourself at home.
HENRY	Thanks.
JOE	Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up for my meeting. You want a beer?
HENRY	Sure.
JOE	Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer?
DEBBIE	Hi.
HENRY	Hi.
DEBBIE	I think that's everything you wanted.
HENRY	Thanks.
HENRY	Are you happy?
DEBBIE	I am, Henry.
HENRY	I'm glad.
DEBBIE	So what are you going to do now?
HENRY	I don't know yet.
JOE	Honey, they're starting to arrive.
DEBBIE	We're having a meeting. It's his new business.
JOE	Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry. You could become a distributor for Jin Chi.
JOE	It's Korean kitchenware. The future of food storage. Plus, if you recruit distributors, you get paid even more.
HENRY	You mean like a pyramid scheme?
JOE	No! God, no. It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm.	Anyway, why don't you give it some thought?
JOE	Henry.
HENRY	Yeah?
JOE	Listen, I just wanted to thank you. For not giving up my name.
HENRY	I don't know your name.
JOE	Sure you do. It's Joe.
HENRY	Right. You're welcome Joe.	I'll see you Deb.
DEBBIE	Take care of yourself, Henry.
NEIGHBOR	Henry! How are you?
HENRY	I'm good. How are you?
NEIGHBOR	Great. How was Greece?
HENRY	Greece?
NEIGHBOR	Debbie told us all about your trip.
HENRY	I was in prison.
NEIGHBOR	In Greece?
PRETTY BLOND	Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffalotto!
HENRY	Good. Thank you.
HENRY	About what?
HENRY	Sure. Sounds good.
HENRY	Thanks.
HENRY	It does?	How does it feel?
HENRY	Good.
JULIE	What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Are you okay? (into cell phone) Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran someone over. No, he looks okay.
JULIE	You idiot, you weren't even looking where you were going! Are you okay?
HENRY	I think I'm okay.
JULIE	No. Stay on the ground.
FRANK	Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance.
HENRY	No, don't. (Starts to stand) I think I'm okay.
FRANK	You!
HENRY	Yeah. Me.
JULIE	(to Frank, confused) Is he alright?
FRANK	Are you alright?
HENRY	Yeah. Fine.
JULIE	He just walked right out into the street. He came out of nowhere.
FRANK	I saw the whole thing. You were on the phone. You weren't even paying attention.
JULIE	Yes. I was. I know how to drive.
JULIE	What are you doing? Get back on the ground!
FRANK	Park your car. I'm going to take him into that cafe.
FRANK	They let you out, huh.
HENRY	Yeah.
FRANK	Let's get you a seat in here.
FRANK	Pierre! Une Verre d'eau.
HENRY	Thanks.
JULIE	Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an ambulance.
HENRY	It's okay. I really am fine.
FRANK	Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got run over. (sucks his teeth) Lucky I guess.
JULIE	I think we should call a doctor.
JULIE	What? Are you okay?
JULIE	Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a doctor?
HENRY	No. You look familiar.
JULIE	What?
JULIE	Oh. That.
HENRY	What?
JULIE	'Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffa-lotto'?
HENRY	Oh, that's why.
JULIE	Well, I guess you seem to be okay.
HENRY	Yeah. I'm okay.
JULIE	Okay. So you're okay?
HENRY	Yeah.
JULIE	Great.	So I can go now?
HENRY	Sure.
JULIE	Bye.	And be more careful.
HENRY	Thanks.
WAITRESS	Anything else I can get you?
HENRY	A bathroom?
MAX	I thought I told you I didn't want to see your face again.
HENRY	Nice to see you too.
GUARD	No contact.
HENRY	I figured it out.
MAX	What?
HENRY	My destiny.
MAX	Good. What is it?
HENRY	The bank.
MAX	The bank is your destiny?
HENRY	Yeah.
MAX	What bank?
HENRY	The one I didn't rob.
MAX	But you went to jail for it.
HENRY	Exactly.
MAX	What are you talking about Henry?
HENRY	I did the time, I may as well have done the crime.
MAX	Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right.	I still don't get it.
HENRY	I need your help.
MAX	What for?
HENRY	To rob the bank.
HENRY	So what do you say?
MAX	I'm in Jail. That's what I say.
HENRY	You've got your review coming up --
MAX	-- So?
HENRY	So you can get of here. If you want to.
MAX	No. It's not as simple as that.
HENRY	Yes, it is.
MAX	No, it's not.
HENRY	Yes. It is.
MAX	No, it's not.
HENRY
MAX --
MAX	I'm happy here. This is my home.
HENRY	This is not a home. This is a prison.
MAX	Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy here.
HENRY	Max. You can't die in this place.
MAX	I can die wherever I want.
HENRY	You really want to die here?
MAX	What do you want, Henry?
HENRY	I'm asking for your help.
MAX	To rob that bank?!
HENRY	I've thought about it. It's the right thing.	For both of us.
MAX	Henry. I got cards.
HENRY
MAX --
MAX	Great to see you, kid.
HENRY	Max!
JULIE	(as Madame Ranevsky) I think I must be dreaming. God Knows I love my country. I love it deeply. I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much.	But...I must drink my coffee...thank you Firs, thank you, you dear old man. I'm so glad to find you still alive.	I just want you to believe in me like the old days. I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did
THEN --
DAREK	Stop! Stop!
DAREK	Too small, too safe! Stop showing me your `safe face' --
ARNOLD	-- But I was --
DAREK	Not you. You're doing the best you can. You.
DAREK	What are you doing?
JULIE	I'm...listening.
DAREK	Listening? You look like you're hearing. To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be strong. To listen is an action.
DAREK	What is that?
JULIE	An action. I'm listening. Is this what you mean, Darek? Is this what you want?
DAREK	No, Djula.
JULIE	Then what do you want?
DAREK	I want you to be more. I want you to be better than that.
DAREK	Now go drink coffee. And don't think about what I want, think about what you want!
JULIE	Fine. I'll go drink coffee.
DAREK	I'll go drink coffee too! Let's all `go drink coffee'.	Ten minutes everyone! (to his Eastern European
ASSISTANT)	Olga! Coffee. Coffee for everyone. We'll all have coffee Djula! Every single one of us! And think about what we want!
JULIE	What are you doing here?
JULIE	Are you here to sue me?
HENRY	No.
JULIE	Then what are you doing here?
HENRY	I saw your picture outside. The door was open. I came in.
HENRY	Is it always like that?
JULIE	What?
HENRY	(gesturing back to the
THEATRE)	That.
JULIE	You mean rehearsal?
HENRY	Yeah.
JULIE	It's a process.
HENRY	Looks complicated.
JULIE	It's all pain.	Chekhov, right?
HENRY	I thought you were listening.
HENRY	I'm Henry by the way.
JULIE	Julie.
PIERRE	Madame Julie!
JULIE	Coffee, Pierre.
JULIE	You want one?
HENRY	Sure.
JULIE	Two.
JULIE	What?
JULIE	So what do you think?
HENRY	Doesn't look like you.
JULIE	No, I meant the poster.
HENRY	Oh. It's funny.
JULIE	Actors on a tree is funny?
HENRY	Yeah.
JULIE	That's the director's joke.
JULIE	He's making a comment on the American culture. Actors faces as falling fruit. Birth, death, the consumption of the ID.
JULIE	To him, the American dream has become the world's nightmare. "You are the country of apocalypse."	That's what he told us on the first day of rehearsal, anyway.
HENRY	Oh.
JULIE	The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, right?	But I know for a fact he hates himself for loving it. It's always an inside job, isn't it?
HENRY	Yeah. I guess.
JULIE	But the truth is I wasn't listening. I was playing it safe.	He was right. The jerk. About that, anyway...
JULIE	You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's last play. He was dying when he wrote it.
JULIE	It's perfect.
HENRY	Why?
JULIE (CONT'D	It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo.
HENRY	You're leaving?
JULIE	Right after we're done.	I'm glad you came by. Thanks for not suing me. I'll see ya.
INMATE	Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right?
MAX	Right.
ANOTHER CONVICT	Give `em hell!
MAX	I always do, Felipe!
GUARD	Morning, Max. Here we are again.
MAX	How's your grandson?
GUARD	Just started first grade.
MAX	That's great. The socialization begins!
GUARD	How many more of these you think you got in you, Max?
MAX	As many as it takes.	Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the board why you believe we should grant you parole?	Come on, Mr. Saltzman, what have you got for us this time?	(o.s.) Mr. Saltzman?
MAX	Well...
HENRY	I knew you could do it.
MAX	Where's the car?
HENRY	I don't have a car.
MAX	You don't have a car? What's wrong with you? You came to pick me up without a car. That's not picking a person up.
HENRY	Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.
MAX	I don't know about this. Maybe this is a mistake.
MAX	Dave! Carl!
HENRY	Max, it's okay. You're free.
MAX	Open up! DAVE!
HENRY	Come on, Max.
MAX	I don't like this.
HENRY	Take it easy. There's nothing to be frightened of. I promise. You're okay. The bus station's just a short walk.
MAX	I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe...
HENRY	You're going to be alright.
MAX	(nearly on his knees) I'm going to die right here. I told you!
HENRY	Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus.
HENRY	You hungry?
HENRY	It's pastrami. On rye.
HENRY	Here we are.
HENRY	That one's yours.
MAX	Thanks.
HENRY	Anything else you need?
MAX	Yeah.
MAX	(reads the label) Ah. The land of milk and honey.
MAX	What is this obsession with coffee, Henry? When did that happen?
HENRY	I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give people a lot of purpose.
MAX	Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my God. That tunnel's probably not even there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?
HENRY	It's a start.
MAX	A start? This was your plan? An old cartoon in a pissoir?
HENRY	It's an article.
MAX	Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in with guns and do it the old-fashioned way?
HENRY	No. No guns.
MAX	What?
HENRY	Someone could get hurt.
MAX	That's sweet, kid.
HENRY	(the tunnel photo) Maybe it's still there, Max.
MAX	Uh-huh.
HENRY	Maybe it is.
MAX	Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why don't we go take a look at this bank of yours?	At least we know that's still there.
MAX	Money is a mistress with a hard heart.
MAX	I'd like to speak to your manager please. I'm interested in opening an account.
MAX	What kind do you have?
MAX	You know my uncle put all his money in that vault when I was a kid, after we came from Europe, before the war...the Brownshirts. He said that vault will be there for three hundred years!
MAX	He was never wrong. How long's it been there already Mr. Tuttle?
MAX	And in the very same spot, correct?	See, my boy!. History. It's all about history.
MAX	You'll have to give us some time to think about which one.
MAX	Thank you. You've been very helpful.	No. Thank you.
FRANK	Have a nice day, gentlemen.
HENRY	The vault is here.
HENRY	The tunnel runs under here...
HENRY	And ends up somewhere in there.
MAX	It's virtually robbing itself!
JULIE	Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov shit!
JULIE
HENRY	(rubbing his head) Hi.
JULIE	Jesus. Henry?
HENRY	Julie, Max. Max, Julie.
MAX	Hiya.
JULIE	What are you doing here?
HENRY	Oh, we were, you know --
MAX	I was just showing Henry the place I used to perform.
JULIE	Oh. What?
SIMON	That's lunch, Julie.
JULIE	Thank God.
MAX	Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel stomach.
JULIE	You know Chekhov?
MAX	Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my favorite Russian.
MAX	Would you mind if we took a look around? It's been over thirty years since I've been inside.
JULIE	Sure.
JULIE	Sure. Yeah. Come on in.
MAX	Thank you.
HENRY	How you doing?
JULIE	Great. I'm in hell.
MAX	Home again.
JULIE	So what productions were you in?
MAX	Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the greats.	And the not-so-greats!
SIMON	Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek says to stay hungry.
JULIE	Fuck him.
SIMON	Got it.
MAX	Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time's sake?
JULIE	He used to perform here.
SIMON	I don't see why not. We're on a break.
MAX	That okay, Henry?
HENRY	Sure. Go ahead.
JULIE	Is that your dad?
HENRY	No. He's a friend.
JULIE	He seems like your dad.
HENRY	It's peaceful out here.
HENRY	Is it fun?
JULIE	What?
HENRY	Pretending to be other people.
JULIE	It's not really like that. I don't pretend to be someone else. I find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way...just inside of a character.
HENRY	So, in a way, you're still playing `you'.
JULIE	Yes. Exactly. In a way.
HENRY	So what part of `you' are you playing now?
JULIE	That's the question you always have to ask yourself.
MAX	Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before the magic! I remember it like it was yesterday.
ARNOLD	People often make the mistake in Chekhov of going down...but you must always always go up...
MAX	Simon, did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days?
SIMON	Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank!
MAX	I know.
SIMON	And there was a tunnel too!
MAX	I know!	I forget. Where was it?
JULIE	So what's your story, Henry?
HENRY	My story?
JULIE	I mean, like...what do you do?
HENRY	I'm figuring that out.
JULIE	Does that mean you don't have a job?
HENRY	I just got out of jail.
JULIE	Jail!
HENRY	Sounds worse than it is.
JULIE	Really? Jail sounds bad.	Why were you in there?
JULIE	Are you a murderer or something?
HENRY	No. Do I look like one?
JULIE	No.
HENRY	What do I look like?
JULIE	I don't know. A criminal.
HENRY	I do?
JULIE	Yeah.
SIMON	We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like people in his dressing room.
SIMON	It was right here.
MAX	Booze, broads and lucre. The good old days. I like it.
SIMON	They filled it in, in 1931 when they built the theatre.
SIMON	Times have changed.
MAX	All good things must come to... (he hits a hollow spot) ...an end.
MAX	Do you need volunteers?
HENRY	The Cherry Orchard. (leafing through it) So what happens? What's it about? Is it funny?
JULIE	A woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her youth, the only place she ever felt safe.
HENRY	I guess it's not funny.
JULIE	It's about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive.
MAX	Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon. I'll see you tomorrow.
JULIE	Tomorrow?
SIMON	Max has very kindly offered to volunteer at the theatre!
JULIE	Oh.
MAX	Henry, let's get out of these people's way!
HENRY	What are you doing after rehearsal?
JULIE	Why?
HENRY	Do you like Chinese?
JULIE	Yeah.
HENRY	Golden Dragon?
JULIE	It's okay.
HENRY	Eight o'clock?
JULIE	Sure.
DAREK	Work. Work! It's time to work Americans!	Even you Djula...
MAX	Let's go.
HENRY	See you, Julie.
JULIE	Stay out of jail.
MAX	You were right, Henry. You got a nose like a bloodhound!
HENRY	You found it?
MAX	Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing room.
HENRY	Who?
MAX	Lophakin. We find a way to get into his dressing room and we're right as rain!
MAX	I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The pieces of the puzzle are on the table. All we got to do is put them in the right order!	The only thing is the dirt...where does the dirt from the tunnel go?
HENRY	What about the vault?
MAX	First things first. I'm on the dirt.
HENRY	Okay. How do I look?
MAX	Like Henry.	We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be back in the soup.MAX	(he starts to take off his
CLOTHES)	Go have a nice supper.
JULIE	Sorry I'm late. I'm starving.
GUY	Julie.
JULIE	Bruce.
JULIE	That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry.
HENRY	Hi. How was rehearsal?
JULIE	I feel like duck.
JULIE	I don't just want to be good, I want to be great. And I don't just want to be great in Buffalo.
HENRY	Where then?
JULIE	Don't laugh.	Hollywood.
HENRY	I guess that's where people go.
JULIE	I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial. And it's not going to be. Soon as this thing is done I'm out of here.	Before it's too late.
HENRY	Sounds like a plan.
JULIE	I hate fortune cookies.
HENRY	We going anywhere in particular?
JULIE	(hits the joint) Want some?
JULIE	You know there's a whole bunch of bodies down there churning around. Just caught in the current.	They all took the risk and look what happened to them. Same in death as they were in life. Imagine that. You kill yourself and nothing changes.
JULIE	All those dreams churning around down there. It makes you sick.	I got to get out of here.
HENRY	I get it.
JULIE	So what did you do before jail, Henry?
HENRY	I worked at a toll booth.
JULIE	Which one?
HENRY	Rainbow bridge.
JULIE	No!
HENRY	Yes.
JULIE	I had family that used to live on the other side. I took that bridge all the time. We must of met a hundred times!
JULIE	Wow. So you were one of the guys in the tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves?
HENRY	Yeah.
HENRY	What's so funny?
JULIE	You were watching everyone go somewhere and you were going nowhere.
HENRY	That's funny?
JULIE	Yeah. Funny sad, not funny funny.
HENRY	I worked nights. It gave me time to think.
JULIE	About what?
HENRY	About where I wasn't going.
JULIE	See, that's funny.	What about now? Where you going now?
HENRY	I'm working on it.
JULIE	What'd they send you to jail for Henry?
HENRY	For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank.
JULIE	What!
HENRY	I thought I was on my way to a softball game. It was a mistake.
JULIE	Sounds like it.
HENRY	But now I'm going to rob it for real.
JULIE	You're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing?
HENRY	Yeah.
JULIE	Ha!
HENRY	There's a tunnel.
JULIE	What tunnel?
HENRY	Runs from the bank to the theatre.
JULIE	My theatre?
HENRY	Yeah.
JULIE	Ha!
JULIE	You're fucking hilarious, Henry.
HENRY	Thank you.
JULIE	You know what?
HENRY	What?
JULIE	I'm hungry.
HENRY	What for?
JULIE	(as the thought occurs) Ice cream.
JULIE	I can't believe I'm sitting here.
HENRY	Neither can I.
JULIE	I want to dance and clap my hands.
JULIE	I think I must be dreaming!
JULIE	God knows I love my country. I love it deeply.
JULIE	I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much.
JULIE	Page twenty one.
JULIE	I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. But I must drink my coffee.	Read Lophakin.
HENRY	`I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you.	You're as wonderful as ever....'
JULIE	Read the next line!
HENRY	`Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.'
JULIE	Say it like you feel it. Like it's real. Say it to me.
`HENRY	Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.'
JULIE	You're good. Keep reading! And get up. Walk around!
HENRY	`Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money-grubber.'
JULIE	Yes, you are. You're a bank robber, Henry!
HENRY	(the text again) `I don't care a bit. I just want you to believe in me like the old days!'
JULIE	(pulling him around the room) Don't stop --
HENRY	`I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.'
JULIE	Again!
HENRY	`I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.'
JULIE	I'm glad I ran you over.
HENRY	Me too.
JULIE	Good morning.
HENRY	Good morning.
HENRY	Good morning.
MAX	Henry!
MAX	(pulling up his boxers) I figured it out! Once we're in that dressing room the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof!
HENRY
MAX --
MAX	(rushing out into the front
ROOM)	That bank doesn't stand a chance.
MAX	Ah. Company.
JULIE	Good morning, Max.
HENRY	It's alright. She knows.
MAX	She does?
JULIE	I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof.
HENRY	We brought breakfast. How do you like your eggs?
JULIE	It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone.
MAX	Hold on.
MAX	You told her?	About what we're doing?
HENRY	Yeah. I did.
MAX	It's a crime. You're supposed to keep crimes a secret.
HENRY	It's okay, Max.
MAX	No. It's not kosher.
HENRY	How do you like your bacon?
MAX	Crispy.
MAX	Okay. I'll get dressed.
JULIE	So what were you in prison for, Max?
MAX	I'm a confidence man.
JULIE	You mean a `con' man?
MAX	I never liked that word. It's only half of what it is. The word confidence comes from the latin. Fides. With Faith. Belief.	That's what I'm about.
JULIE	You mean you make people feel good...and then you rip them off?
MAX	Yes.
MAX	But I was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part.	Hence, the prison.
JULIE	Aren't you guys worried about getting caught?
MAX	Not really. For me it's a win-win situation.
JULIE	How?
MAX	I like jail. Three hots and a cot.
JULIE	You too, Henry? You like jail?
HENRY	No. I like it out here.
JULIE	So why would you take the risk? Is it the money?
JULIE	It must be the money.
JULIE	You are a criminal. A greedy little criminal.
HENRY	(washing the plates) `Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart, a money grubber...	...but I don't care a bit'.
HENRY	`I just want you to believe in me like the old days.'
JULIE	You remember!
MAX	What is that?
JULIE	It's Chekhov!
MAX	Chekhov?!
HENRY	We read it last night.
JULIE	You really are good.	He's a natural.
MAX	I thought you were on a date.
HENRY	We were.
MAX	Reading Chekhov's a date?
HENRY	Yeah.
JULIE	I got to get to the theatre --
MAX	Can you give me a ride there?
JULIE	Why?
MAX	I'm a volunteer!
JULIE	You weren't in any of those plays, were you?
MAX	No.	But can you give me a ride?
JULIE	All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you...JULIE	Oh, if only I could be free of the stone that weighs me down! If only I could forget my past!
GAYEV	Yes and now the orchard will be sold to pay our debts, which seems impossible...
JULIE	Look! It's mamma walking in the orchard...in a white dress! (laughing with joy) There she is.
GAYEV	Where?
VARYA	Momma, don't!
MAX	This is driving me crazy.
HENRY	What?
MAX	We could be digging right now!
HENRY	We could?
MAX	If we were in that dressing room.
HENRY	It's rehearsal. There are people everywhere.
MAX	This is pissing me off.
HENRY	What?
MAX	I got an idea.
HENRY	What?
MAX	You have to be Lophakin!
HENRY	What?
MAX	If you did we'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want.
HENRY	I'm not an actor.
MAX	You're not a bank robber either! And you're doing that.
HENRY	Max. Come on.
MAX	She said you were a natural. That means you can do it.
HENRY	No, it doesn't.
MAX	Yes, it does Henry.	You ARE Lophakin! A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life.	A man who's in love with her!
MAX	Your dream is your truth is your destiny!
HENRY	I can't be Lophakin. They have a Lophakin.
MAX	What if they didn't?
HENRY	There has to be another way.
MAX	Kid, You forced me out of jail to help you. And I'm going to goddamn help you. But you got to help me help you. Now I need to know... (a fierce stare) ...do you want this bank or not?
HENRY	Yes. I want it.
HENRY	Then you're gonna be Lophakin!
ARNOLD	Good morning, everyone!
ARNOLD	You knew this day would come. You deserve this, lubya.
DAREK	Unprofessional shit!
ARNOLD	Mr. Millodragovich --
DAREK	Shit!
MAX	What's happening?
JULIE	Arnold's leaving the production.
MAX	Oh. Gosh.
ARNOLD	But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman we're talking about! (brandishing the letter) A Ken Waterstone production!
DAREK	OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production. The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy.DAREK	Run, run, to that pandering, populist, piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his spineless productions! You're perfect for it.
ARNOLD	Good-bye, Darek.	I'm sorry.
DAREK	Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now.	I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes NOW! And COFFEE!
SIMON	We'll hold auditions this afternoon, Darek! I'll get the list --
DAREK	I've seen that shit-list! It's a disaster.
SIMON	What do we do?
DAREK	I must think.
DAREK	Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled before she has a chance to grow.
JULIE	Perfect.
MAX	It is Ken Waterstone.
JULIE	Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but that's what's happening...	I don't know, he's `thinking'...
JULIE	What?
JULIE	Sorry, I can't give you a ride --
MAX	You said he was a natural.
JULIE	Stan. Let me call you back. (she hangs up, to Max) What?
MAX	Henry.
JULIE	Henry what?
MAX	Henry would be perfect for it.
JULIE	Perfect for what?
MAX	For Lophakin.
JULIE	You mean Henry should play Lophakin?
MAX	Yes.
JULIE	He's not even an actor!
MAX	Exactly. He'd be playing himself. (off her shocked look) Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.MAX	A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life and put his past behind him. A man who's in love with you...Madame Ranevsky.
JULIE	Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet?
MAX	Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin needs a dressing room.	Can you get him in to see Darek?
JULIE	What's going on here, Max? What are you doing?
MAX	Nothing.
JULIE	You made this happen, didn't you?
MAX	Sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good.
MAX	Fair enough.
JULIE	What am I supposed to do now?
MAX	He just needs a shot. One audition. Let the chips fall where they may.
JULIE	What if it doesn't work?
MAX	They'll get someone else.
MAX	Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm asking, Julie.
JULIE	Okay, confidence man.
DAREK	...you've never had any training...you've never been in a production...you don't even know the play...
HENRY	I read it. I think I know the scene.
DAREK	Think.
DAREK	Start.
HENRY	`Your brother , Leonid Andrevich...'
DAREK	How can you perform Chekhov and not be able to say AND-REY-E-VICH! Now say it!
HENRY
HENRY	Your brother, Leonid ANDREYEVICH says I'm an upstart, a money grubber --
DAREK	A what?
HENRY	A money-grubber!
DAREK	Are you?
HENRY
DAREK	Convince her.
HENRY	Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says I'm an upstart, a money grubber. He can say whatever he likes. I don't care a bit --
DAREK	(into his ear)
HENRY	I just want you to believe in me like in the old days.
JULIE	Show me, tell me.
HENRY	Good God in Heaven. My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that. But you, you did so much for me in the old days that I've forgotten all that...
HENRY	I love you...like a sister...more than a sister.
DAREK	You piece of shit! Yes!
DAREK	Good.
HENRY	Good?
DAREK	Yes.
DAREK	Tomorrow. Be more good.
JULIE	Does this make me an accessory?
HENRY	I think so.
JULIE	Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up.
HENRY	You mean since you ran me over...
JULIE	So why are you robbing the bank, Henry?
JULIE	It's not just about the money, is it?
HENRY	No.
JULIE	So why are you doing it?
HENRY	I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went. Just joining someone else's life.
JULIE	You were asleep at the wheel.
HENRY	Yeah, I was.	It was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth.
JULIE	Which was?
HENRY	That I was going along with everything. I didn't know I could change it.	So now I'm changing it.
JULIE	Robbing the bank is changing it?
HENRY	It already has.
JULIE	What was your wife like?
HENRY	Nice.
HENRY	Are you sure you're okay with this? I know it's a lot.
JULIE	Not for a girl like me, Henry.
DAREK	This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be taking over the role of Lophakin. If you please.
HENRY	Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward.
DAREK	Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga, cigarettes!
MAX	Tracks! Trolley tracks!
HENRY	There's still twenty feet to go.
HENRY	We're going to need another pair of hands.
HENRY	That's him.
MAX	That's him?
HENRY	Thanks for meeting us.
JOE	Sure.
HENRY	How's your pyramid scheme?
JOE	It wasn't a pyramid scheme.
HENRY	Okay.
JOE	It all fell apart.	We were banking on that money, Henry. And now all I've got is a garage full of dumb Korean plastic.
MAX	What's he talking about?
HENRY	Kitchenware.
MAX	Oh.
JOE	See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'?	It's killing me.
HENRY	So how's Debbie?
JOE	She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a couple months.
HENRY	She's pregnant?
JOE	Yeah, she's pregnant.
HENRY	Congratulations.
JOE	Thanks, Henry.	It's okay if you want to punch me out. Tonight would be a good night. In fact I could use it.
HENRY	Come on. This is great news. (off Joe's hopeless look) It's going to be okay.
JOE	Really? It is? You know how much diapers cost? You know how much it costs to send a kid to college?
MAX	You want to send your baby to college?
JOE	Of course not. I'm just saying. The kid needs stuff. Stuff that's expensive. Stuff it deserves.	These things are hot! I'm on fire.
HENRY	Listen, Joe, maybe we can help.
JOE	How?
HENRY	We might have a job for you.
JOE	No foolin'?
HENRY	There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault.
JOE	That's a lot of dirt, Henry.
HENRY	So what do you think?
JOE	I think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door!
HENRY	No guns. People could get hurt.
JOE	What about fake ones?
HENRY	They're still guns.
MAX	Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers and tears and chump change. We're doing an old fashioned heist. We're going right into the belly of the beast.	Are you in or are you in?
JOE	I hope we don't get caught.
JULIE	I hate that commercial.
HENRY	I like it.
JULIE	So what's your plan?
HENRY	For what?
JULIE	For when it's done. After. (making light of it) Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something?
HENRY	I hope not.
JULIE	But have you thought about what happens after?
HENRY	Not really, no.
HENRY	I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out west...
JULIE	Out west?
HENRY	Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there.
JULIE	When did you think of that?
HENRY	Just now.	So what about it?
JULIE	What about what?
HENRY	Meeting me --
JULIE	-- I'm not going anywhere, Henry --
HENRY	You're not?
JULIE	No.
HENRY	I thought that was your plan. Do the play
JULIE	Plans change, Henry. Okay?
JULIE	I think I ran out of maple syrup.
HENRY	Is there a reason you didn't leave before?
JULIE	Because life is fucked. It never works out the way you want it to.
HENRY	Yeah. Well. Maybe...	But you could still meet me.
JULIE	Right! On the lam? You're dreaming.
HENRY	It was just an idea. Why not --
JULIE	This isn't going to work out, Henry.
JULIE	Didn't we both know that?
HENRY	I didn't.
JULIE	I did.
JULIE	I think you should leave.
MAX	Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your head!
HENRY	Why couldn't I have met her after?
MAX	Who?
HENRY	Julie. I asked her to meet me. After we're done.
MAX	Oh yeah? What'd she say?
HENRY	She said no.
MAX	Of course she said no.
HENRY	Why of course?
MAX	Because life ain't like that. There's always a cost. That's why they call it life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper must be paid to pipe.
HENRY	I paid already, Max.	I don't want to leave her.
MAX	Who's that?
HENRY	I'll check.
HENRY	Who is it?
JOE	Sorry, Henry.
EDDIE	The same bank. Shit, Henry. Now that's poetry! I like it.
MAX	Who is this guy?
EDDIE	Your new partner.
MAX	What do you mean?
EDDIE	I'm in. Or you're out.
JOE	I screwed up. Sorry, Max.
EDDIE	(amused by the whole thing) Joe tells me you guys might need a little help with that vault. I know the whole story.
EDDIE	And I don't dig. Dig?	Got any cold ones?
MAX	Joe doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out of that chair.
EDDIE	Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back. We've known each other since high school, isn't that right?
HENRY	Yeah. I know you.
EDDIE	Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the quality of loyalty.
HENRY	What do you want, Eddie?
EDDIE	Nothing. Just the American dream.
MAX	I'm gonna kill him. With a knife.
HENRY	You can't kill him.
JOE	(slurred, on the floor) Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault --
MAX	Shut up, Joe.
JOE	Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it.
MAX	Go home. Please. Before it's too late.
TROFIMOV	I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's sake, the man has robbed you.
MADAME RANEVSKY	(stopping her ears) No! No! No! Don't say that!
TROFIMOV	He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user...
MADAME RANEVSKY	You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades!
TROFIMOV	Who cares?
MADAME RANEVSKY	You ought to be grown up by now. At your age, you ought to understand about love --
DAREK	Where are you, Djula? Where?!
MADAME RANEVSKY	(with double the fire) You ought to love someone yourself! You ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes!
DAREK	Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene.	Carlotta and the girls.DAREK	Let's run the magic scene!
HENRY	What happened last night?
JULIE	I came to my senses.	And you should too.
HENRY	We should talk about it.
JULIE	I don't want to, Henry.
MAX	(tugging the pulley) Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it.
JOE	What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not?
MAX	Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness.
JOE	What do you say, Henry?
FRANK	Now I see you coming out of the theatre behind the bank.
FRANK	I know what you're up to Gentlemen.
FRANK	And I want in.
MAX	In on what?
FRANK	We can't talk here. Let's drive.
HENRY	What's on your mind, Frank?
FRANK	The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency Retrieval and Exchange.
FRANK	Once a month a truck goes to all our partner banks across the border in Canada, picks up all the currency and brings it back home.
FRANK	I'd say on average eight to twelve million, held in our vault at First Buffalo for just a few hours before it's picked up for redistribution.
FRANK	Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank any other time.
FRANK	I can give you that date. I can help with alarms. I can be your guy on the inside.
MAX	Hypothetically say you were right about what we're up to...which you're not. But just say...why would you help us rob your bank?
FRANK	I got my reasons.
JOE	This sounds like a set-up, man --
FRANK	I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I got my reasons.
MAX	Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going to need to hear them.
FRANK	The wife got sick a few years ago. Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs. So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help cover the difference. We were going to retire to the Loire valley.	We had to use all our savings to cover the bills.
JOE	The man gave it to you, huh.
FRANK	I spent everything we had -- then she died...thirty years I've been at that bank.
HENRY	What was her name?
FRANK	Annie. Her name was Annie.
HENRY	I'm Sorry.
FRANK	November 23rd. The money's delivered at eight and picked up at midnight.
FRANK	I retire in two weeks. This is it.	You set up the table. I make sure dinner arrives hot.
HENRY	Shit.
HENRY	Opening night.
MAX	And?
HENRY	That's soon.
MAX	We're going to have pull some nights.
HENRY	Maybe we should wait. Do it closing night.
MAX	We can't. He's retiring. This is a one time deal.	I told you there were going to be tests, Henry.
MAX	You're going to have to leave her.	No looking back.
MAX	There he is!
MAX	You okay, Henry?
HENRY	No.
HENRY	I'm not leaving her.
JOE	Who?
MAX	The girl --
MAX	Now listen, Henry. You're digging this tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank. You're gonna take the money and you're gonna put it in the car and we're gonna drive away.	This is one thing. Julie is another thing. This is not that. That is not this. Understand?
JOE	Hey! I think I got something...
MAX	We have arrived! Look at that.
HENRY	Not a cloud in the sky.
MAX	So clear you can see tomorrow.	You're a good man, Henry. Thank you.
HENRY	You too, Max. Let's go.
DAREK	In this `American dream' of ours, everyone is happy and smiling, they have achieved their objectives...and yet in life there is only change, upheaval, the birth of the new...and that birth is painful.
DAREK	Our play is about misery, disconnection, a future that we don't see hitting us like a train...but tonight, my players, we show them...that this not a future to fear!
GAYEV	Off the cushion in the corner ; double into the centre pocket!
SIMON	Ten minutes people!
JULIE	Come in.
HENRY	I want you to meet me in California.
JULIE	Henry, we've been over this --
HENRY	We're doing it tonight.
JULIE	What?
HENRY	It's the only time we can get in the
VAULT --
JULIE	Of course! Opening night. What else? Like I said, everything always fucks up --
HENRY	Nothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a month from now, what's the difference? I still want you to meet me.
JULIE	Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked around recently? You're leaving. What about the goddamn play?
HENRY	Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it already.
JULIE	I'm sure he did.
HENRY	I want us to be together.
JULIE	We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So what?
HENRY	You know that's not true --
JULIE	No, really. A couple of times.	Don't you get it? I don't want to be with you.
JULIE	You're a thief. Go rob your bank.
MAX	Enjoy the show, folks!
SIMON	Curtain!
LOPHAKIN	Well, thank god the train is in. What time is it?
DUNYASHA	(checks his watch) Almost two. (blowing out the candle) It's light already.
LOPHAKIN	The train's late. At least two hours.
BERNIE	How you doin', Frank?
FRANK	Doin' good, Bernie. Real good.
MADAME RANEVSKY	My nursery, my dear, beautiful, sweet nursery! This is where I used to sleep when I was a little girl!
GAYEV	Your train was two hours late. How do you explain that? Is that good management?
MAX	Shit.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood! I used to sleep in this nursery.HENRY	Isn't she beautiful?
SIMON	Yes.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Oh, my cherry orchard...
BERNIE	You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank?
STAN	I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and put them in first place.
BERNIE	You'd need a lot more money than that. But I guarantee you I'd have them back in the Super Bowl within two seasons.
STAN	Perfect. Another chance to lose.
MAX	Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little pischer?
BERNIE	We're good.
MADAME RANEVSKY	I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples!
LOPHAKIN	True enough. To be honest. We live a stupid life.
STAN	Well this is it, Frank.
BERNIE	We got you something.
STAN	A little retirement gift.
STAN	Go ahead. Open it.
FRANK	Thanks guys.
BERNIE	We wanted to get you something from France.
STAN	You like French Roast, right?
FRANK	Thanks.	You know this isn't from France.
BERNIE	What are you talking about? It's French roast.
FRANK	Right. But over there they call it coffee.
STAN	(slightly baffled, at Bernie) But this is French roast...
EDDIE	Where is he? Where's that old man?
MAX	Julie -- Break a leg!
JULIE	Play's already started, Max.
JULIE	Good-bye confidence man.
MAX	Good-bye, Julie.
MAX	Go! Go! Go!
EDDIE	About time, old man.
MAX	Do your job.
EDDIE	Jesus! Not again! What is it with you?
JOE	Sorry.
EDDIE	You're a pussy, Joe, you know that?
MADAME RANEVSKY	Well, what should we do? Tell us what to do?
LOPHAKIN	I tell you every day. Every day I say the same thing over and over. You must rent out the Cherry Orchard and the rest of the Estate for villas. At once, right this second, the auction is coming up very soon --
MADAME RANEVSKY	It's all so vulgar!
MAX	That was good, kid. Good acting.
JOE	(a little giddy) There she is.
EDDIE	Get out of there!
EDDIE	This shit comes straight from hell.
EDDIE	Welcome to my world, bitches.
JOE	Fuck, yeah.
MAX	You're on, Henry!
LOPHAKIN	Yes.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Who bought it?
LOPHAKIN	I did.
LOPHAKIN	I bought it. Wait a minute ; don't rush me. I'm all dizzy. I can't talk...
JOE	Deb's gonna freak.
LOPHAKIN	...and now the Cherry Orchard is mine. Mine!	God! God in heaven. The Cherry Orchard is mine! Tell me I'm drunk, tell me I'm out of my mind, tell me I'm dreaming!
MAX	That's everything.
EDDIE	Yes, it is.
MAX	What's that, Eddie?
EDDIE	It's a gun, Max.
EDDIE	(with the gun) Joe! Take the money out back to my car.
EDDIE	Joe!
MAX	Stay right where you are, Joe.
EDDIE	Don't be stupid, Max.
MAX	You're not going to do this, Eddie.
MAX	You can shoot me dead if you want, but you're going to have to shoot me dead.
EDDIE	I'm not playing with you, old man.
JOE	What are you doing, Eddie?
EDDIE	Welcome to the party, Brando.
HENRY	What are you doing, Eddie?
EDDIE	It's money, Henry. Money.
MAX	This was your chance you idiot. You could've been a better man but you did it again. You messed up. And now you're back with the maggots. Just one big missed opportunity.
JOE	Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're done. He's right. Come on, man.
EDDIE	Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in the car. Shut up.
EDDIE	Now move, Torne. No happy ending for you.
EDDIE	You animal!
MAX	Famach deh mohl! Gey lig mitt'n vahntzin son of a bitch!
JOE	Get the extension chord.
EDDIE	You couldn't have done this without me.
MAX	Our new partner. Huh.
MAX	You ok?
HENRY	I got shot.
HENRY	I gotta get on stage.
GAYEV	Thank you, my friends, thank you.
YASHA	The peasants have come to say good-bye.	They're good fellows, Yermolai Aleksayovich but in my opinion a little stupid...
GAYEV	(to Madame Ranevsky) You gave them everything in your purse, Lyuba. Wrong, quite wrong!
MADAME RANEVSKY	I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it.
LOPHAKIN	(still a little out of
BREATH)	Won't you please come here and drink a glass as a good-bye?
MAX	Old man, huh.
MADAME RANEVSKY	We're going and not a soul will be here until after we're gone.
LOPHAKIN	Until spring.
JOE	Where is he?
MAX	Any minute now.
ANYA	Goodbye, home! Goodbye to the old life!
TROFIMOV	Hello to the new life!
LOPHAKIN	Until the spring, then. Goodbye my friends, until we meet again!
GAYEV	My sister! My sister!
MADAME RANEVSKY	Oh, my dear, sweet, lovely orchard! My life, my youth, my happiness, farewell! Farewell!
MAX	How's the leg?
HENRY	It's fine. Go.
JULIE	(as Madame Ranevsky) One last look at these walls, these windows...Dear mother used to love to walk about in this room.
GAYEV	My sister! My sister!
JULIE	(as Madame Ranevsky) We're coming.
HENRY	Stop the car!
MAX	Henry!
HENRY	Joe, stop the car.
MAX	He can't stop the car, it's the getaway!
JOE	Yeah, you can't --
HENRY
MAX	What the hell are you doing?
MAX	Henry!
LOPHAKIN	I had to come back. I couldn't get on the train. The moment I stepped on the platform, the blood drained from my heart.
LOPHAKIN	I knew I might never see you again.
DAREK	What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?!
LOPHAKIN	I had to come back.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Henry, what is this? What are you doing?
LOPHAKIN	This is the only way you'll listen to me.
MADAME RANEVSKY	You should have gotten on that stupid train. You made a mistake.
LOPHAKIN	The mistake would have been getting on that train without telling you how I feel.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All you care about is money.
LOPHAKIN	You think this is about money?
MADAME RANEVSKY	Yes.
HENRY	It's never been about money. You know that.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Let go of me!
LOPHAKIN	No.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Damn it! Just leave, Henry! (under her breath) Get off the fucking stage --
HENRY	Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow.
MADAME RANEVSKY	No, I'm perfectly happy here.
HENRY	That's not true. Meet me in Moscow.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Let me go!
HENRY	I can't.
MADAME RANEVSKY	Why are you doing this?
LOPHAKIN	You're just afraid.
MADAME RANEVSKY	I'm not afraid of anything --
LOPHAKIN	You're afraid because I love you.
MADAME RANEVSKY	...what?
HENRY	Meet me in Moscow.
HENRY	Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow.
AUDIENCE MEMBER	Go with him!
DAREK	He loves her.
JULIE	Henry. You're bleeding.
HENRY	I know.
DAREK	(whisper to Simon) Lights down ten. Down ten more. Slowly...
JULIE	Oh, fuck, Henry...
FRANK	Hello miou-miou.
DEBBIE	A girl.
MAX	Time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it. Education. Self-respect. You can even figure out your dream.
MAX	You're done. Next!
MAX	So tell me, Javier. What's your dream?
JULIE	Look. You can see the ocean.
HENRY	`Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money grubber...but I don't care a bit.'
EDDIE	I told you before. Dopey. Sleepy. Happy and Doc --
EDDIE	I may be all those things but one thing I'm not...is a rat.
