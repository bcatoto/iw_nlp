Pet Sematary
  
LOUIS	So...what do you think? 
RACHEL	It's gorgeous! 
ELLIE	Am I really gonna have my own room? 
LOUIS	Yes. 
ELLIE	Yaay! Is that a swing? 
RACHEL	Yes, but the rope might be-- 
ELLIE	Yaay! 
LOUIS	Let her go. It's cool. 
RACHEL	Louis, the house is beautiful. 
RACHEL	The Master of Disaster awakes. 
LOUIS	And Buckaroo Banzai. 
RACHEL	Come on--let's parole 'em. 
RACHEL	Decided to wake up and see what home looks like, huh? 
LOUIS	Ellie, you heard your m--- 
ELLIE	Wh-- 
ELLIE	Hurrts! It hurrrrts! 
LOUIS	Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee. 
GAGE	Hi-Durch! 
CHURCH	Waow! 
GAGE	Druck! 
RACHEL	Gage's gone! 
LOUIS	Jesus, the road! 
GAGE	Drucks! No shit, Sherlock. 
RACHEL	Gage! He was headed for the road, looked like. I corralled him for you, missus. 
RACHEL	Thank you. Thank you so much. 
LOUIS	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed. 
JUD	Jud Crandall. I live just across the road. 
RACHEL	I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here. 
JUD	No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night. 
JUD	Who might you be, little Miss? 
ELLIE	I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause) At least, I used to. 
JUD	And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed. Are clams really happy? 
RACHEL	Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you. 
JUD	Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance. Daddy, do I really have to have the stingy stuff? 
LOUIS	No-I guess not. 
ELLIE	Yayyy! I guess your daughter there ain't going to die after all. I guess not. 
JUD	House has stood empty for too long. It's damn good to see people in it again. 
LOUIS	Hey--they actually found the place! 
JUD	Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want. 
LOUIS	Well, maybe I---- Louis, what's this? 
FIRST MOVER	You Mr. Creed? 
LOUIS	Yes. Just a second. 
LOUIS	The movers-- 
RACHEL	Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go? 
LOUIS	I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow. I bet Mr. Crandall knows! 
JUD	Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and a good walk, too. I'll take you up there sometime, and tell you the story, too-- after you get settled in. 
LOUIS	Great. 
RACHEL	You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you? 
LOUIS	Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and--- 
RACHEL	---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and--- 
LOUIS	Did you see his shirt? Sure. Bruce Springsteen. 
LOUIS	I really do have a million questions about the area...but the thing I'm really curious about is how come this octogenarian Yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with the Boss. 
LOUIS	It's me. 
JUD	Well, come on up and have a beer. 
JUD	You need a glass? 
LOUIS	Not at all. 
JUD	Good for you. 
LOUIS	God, that's fine. 
JUD	Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself. 
LOUIS	What were you listening to? 
JUD	Allman Brothers. 
LOUIS	What? 
JUD	The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis. 
JUD	I'm sorry. Wait. 
JUD	Try that. 
LOUIS	Nice. 
JUD	I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause) One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. Thank you, Mr. Crandall. 
LOUIS	The one that goes into the woods--sure. 
JUD	That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there. 
LOUIS	What's at the end of it? Another day--after you get settled in a bit. Meantime, doc--- Here's to your bones. 
LOUIS	And yours. 
LOUIS	Church! God, you scared the life out of me! 
CHURCH	Waow! 
JUD	Take a look behind you. 
LOUIS	My God! 
RACHEL	It's beautiful! 
JUD	You folks ready to go on? 
LOUIS	Sure. 
ELLIE	But where are we going, Mr. Crandall? 
JUD	You'll see soon enough, hon. 
LOUIS	Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies? 
JUD	Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands. Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac. Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it? You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc? 
LOUIS	Not yet...how much further is it? 
JUD	Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile. 
ELLIE	What's it say, mommy? 
RACHEL	It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's misspelled, but...that's what it says. 
RACHEL	Ellen--! 
JUD	I told you it was a bad road, Louis--it's killed a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy. But at least something good come of it. This place. Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it! 
RACHEL	How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children! 
JUD	Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah! 
LOUIS	I think it's rather extraordinary. 
RACHEL	Extraordinarily morbid, maybe. 
JUD	Well...they have to learn about death somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed? The little ones? Why? 
JUD	Well...well, because-- Mommy! Daddy! Look at me! 
ELLIE	It's okay, Mr. Crandall-- 
LOUIS	Have you got a death-wish, Ellen? 
ELLIE	Well, I thought it was safe-- 
JUD	Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite. 
ELLIE	Bite? 
JUD	Ayuh. 
ELLIE	I want to look around, daddy-- may I? 
LOUIS	For a little while. 
LOUIS	I can hardly read these. 
JUD	Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle. (Points) Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there... (points) the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat  got...and I think that's the cat  himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure. Missy Ellen! Come over here just a  minute! 
JUD	I see you're quite a reader for such a little girl. Can you read that? 
ELLEN	"Spot a good fellow we love you boy." (Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..." Gee, I can't read the rest. 
JUD	Last name's Crandall, little missy. 
JUD	That's where I buried my dog Spot when he died of old age in 19 and 14. Dug it good and deep. By the time I finished, I had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back. Soil's stony up here. 
JUD	Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is? 
ELLIE	Well...I guess not. 
JUD	It's a place where the dead speak, Missy. 
JUD	No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the  marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis? 
LOUIS	I think it is so, Ellie. 
ELLIE	What if you can't read what's written on there anymore? 
JUD	Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it? 
ELLIE	Yes-- 
LOUIS	And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot. 
ELLIE	To remember. Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary place, Ellie. It's a place of rest and speaking. Can you remember that? Yes, sir. 
ELLIE	Mommy! This is a place where dead animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so! 
LOUIS	My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed. 
JUD	Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy. 
ELLIE	Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there because of the road, isn't it? 
ELLIE	That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much. 
LOUIS	Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey... 
ELLIE	In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he? 
LOUIS	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time. 
ELLIE	It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks! 
LOUIS	If it was up to me I'd let Church live to be a hundred...but I don't make up the rules. Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not mine! Not-- 
RACHEL	She's finally asleep. 
LOUIS	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid. 
RACHEL	It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it. 
LOUIS	Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you? 
RACHEL	Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die. 
LOUIS	Rachel...someday Church is going to  die. That is hardly the point! Church is not going to die today, or tomorrow-- Never mind. I can see you don't have the slightest idea what I'm talking about. 
LOUIS	Rachel--! 
ELLIE	Yee-uck! Gross! 
LOUIS	He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is going to be beyond him for a few years. 
ELLIE	I don't want him to get his nuts cut, daddy! What if he dies? 
LOUIS	Good God! Where'd you hear that? 
ELLIE	Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation! 
RACHEL	Honey, Church will be fine. 
ELLIE	But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary? 
RACHEL	Don't be silly. Church is not going to die. 
LOUIS	According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks. 
RACHEL	That's enough of that kind of talk! 
LOUIS	I just said-- 
RACHEL	I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place. I'm scared. What if school here isn't like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want to go h-h-home! 
RACHEL	You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face. 
LOUIS	And Church will be fine. Do you promise, Daddy? 
LOUIS	Well, honey...you know that... 
RACHEL	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise. Church will be fine. I promise. 
ELLIE	Yayyyy! 
RACHEL	Thank you, Louis. 
LOUIS	Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her. 
RACHEL	Have a great day! 
GAGE	Bye-bye! 
MISSY	Gonna get his-- 
LOUIS	--nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy, for introducing that colorful phrase into my daughter's vocabulary. 
MISSY	Don't mention it. How's that belly-ache of yours? No better and no worse. 
LOUIS	You ought to see a doctor about it. 
MISSY	It'll pass. They always do. 
RACHEL	Thank God. I was a little worried there. Have a great first day at school, doc. No broken bones. Not so much as a sprain. 
CHARLTON	Holy Jesus. Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed, we've got a mess here! Stat! 
GIRL	Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic! Get her out. Get them all out. No! No! He can't die! He can't die! 
LOUIS	Steve, get the ambulance over here right now. He's got to go to EMMC. 
STEVE	The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco downtown, getting-- 
LOUIS	--a new muffler, oh shit-- 
CANDYSTRIPER	I can't look at it...I can't stand it... Yes you by God can. Go get the hard stretcher! 
LOUIS	Help me hold him. 
STEVE	It wouldn't matter if we did have the ambulance. 
LOUIS	It wouldn't matter if we had the SST. 
LOUIS	He's going. Steve, go call the motor- pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon. 
CHARLTON	It won't-- 
LOUIS	I know it won't! But let's for God's sake do it by the rules! 
LOIS	There wasn't even supposed to be a sprain today, my friend--that's what I told her. 
PASCOW	...Pet Sematary... W-What did you say...? 
PASCOW	It's not the real cemetery... (Long pause) The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis...a man grows what he can...and tends it. 
LOUIS	How do you know my name? I'll come...to you. Dammit, how do you know my name? 
STEVE	Louis, they're sending a-- 
LOUIS	Steve, will you get a sheet to cover him with? 
LOUIS	He said my name. I heard it. He said my name. 
PASCOW	Come on, doc. We got places to go. 
PASCOW	Come on, doc--don't make me tell you twice. 
PASCOW	Let's go, doc. I don't like this dream. 
PASCOW	Who said you were dreaming? 
PASCOW	This is the place where the dead speak. 
LOUIS	I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I-- 
PASCOW	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know. 
LOUIS	Please, I want to wake up. Leave me  alone. It's not my fault you died; you  were as good as dead when they brought you in-- 
PASCOW	The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc. 
LOUIS	Leave me alone! 
PASCOW	Remember. 
LOUIS	Getting there. 
RACHEL	I got eggs down here! 
LOUIS	Good d-- 
JUD	Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days? 
LOUIS	For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about? 
JUD	Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's. 
LOUIS	Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus. 
LOUIS	It's Church. 
JUD	I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered. 
LOUIS	Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty. 
JUD	Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she? 
LOUIS	Yes. 
LOUIS	Bagged cat. What a mess. 
JUD	You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary? I guess that's what it's there for, huh? 
JUD	Going to tell Ellie? 
LOUIS	I don't know. 
JUD	Seems like you told me about a promise you made-- 
JUD	Cat's just as dead, Louis. Well that's a big help! (Pause) I'm sorry, Jud. 
JUD	No need to apologize. 
LOUIS	Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know? Maybe there's a better way. 
LOUIS	Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back. 
JUD	It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to. 
LOUIS	But-- 
JUD	Does she love the cat? 
LOUIS	Yes, but-- 
JUD	Then come on. 
LOUIS	Well, folks, here we are, in Louis Creed Dreamland. 
JUD	What say, Louis? 
LOUIS	Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one? 
JUD	We're still not where we're going. 
LOUIS	What do you mean? 
JUD	The place we're going is on the other side of that. 
LOUIS	We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks! 
JUD	No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure. 
LOUIS	I'm not climbing that. 
JUD	Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself. 
LOUIS	Let's go. Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up. 
LOUIS	God, this is amazing! 
JUD	Just don't stop and-- 
LOUIS	And don't look down. Right. 
JUD	Louis! You all right? Sure. I guess I just lost my happy  thoughts for a second there. I shouldn't have stopped...and it does bite. 
JUD	No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right? 
LOUIS	Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud? 
JUD	You'll see before long. Let's go. 
JUD	This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis-- you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow me and don't look down. 
JUD	Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp. 
LOUIS	Is there quicksand? 
JUD	Ayuh. Are there ghosts? 
JUD	Ayuh. 
JUD	There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis. 
LOUIS	You're telling me. 
LOUIS	It's funny, all right. 
JUD	Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God. (Pause) And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear. 
JUD	Almost there, Louis. 
LOUIS	You keep saying that. 
JUD	This time I mean it. 
JUD	This was their burying ground, Louis. 
LOUIS	Whose burying ground? 
JUD	The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat. 
LOUIS	Why? For God's sake, why? 
JUD	I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right? 
LOUIS	I guess so...but... 
JUD	You want to rest a bit before you start? 
LOUIS	No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin. 
JUD	Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage. 
JUD	I'm going to sit over yonder and have a smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to do it yourself. Each buries his own. That's how it was done then. 
LOUIS	You think so? 
LOUIS	What are those for? 
JUD	Your cairn. 
LOUIS	Doesn't look like they last long. 
JUD	Don't worry about that. 
LOUIS	Jud, why am I doing all this? 
JUD	Because it's right. 
LOUIS	Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but you were a hell of a good cat. 
JUD	That's fine. You did real good. 
LOUIS	Oh, shit! Rachel! 
JUD	When you talk to 'em, not one word about what we done tonight. 'S'far's you know, the cat's still fine. 
JUD	You'll understand. In the meantime, keep your peace. What we did, Louis, was a secret thing. Women are supposed to be the ones who are good at keeping secrets, but any woman who knows anything at all would tell you she's never seen into a man's heart. The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis--like the soil up there in the old Micmac burying ground. A man grows what he can...and tends it. 
LOUIS	But-- 
JUD	No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight. 
LOUIS	Hi, Dory...it's Louis-- 
LOUIS	That'd be real fine. Hi...daddy? Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy birthday to you! That was awful, daddy. 
LOUIS	Yeah, I know...how are things out  there in Chicagoland? 
ELLIE	Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair. Way to go, Gage! What? 
LOUIS	I said that's too bad. What did you get for presents from Gramma and Grampa? Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and a Chatty Cathy doll... 
ELLIE	...and a Garfield radio! How's Church, dad? Does he miss me? 
LOUIS	Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie. I haven't seen him this evening, but-- 
ELLIE	Well, make sure you put him down cellar before you go to bed so he can't run out in the road and get greased. And kiss him goodnight for me. Yuck! Kiss your own cat! 
ELLIE	Want to talk to Gage? 
LOUIS	Food, Church...food! 
LOUIS	Come on, Church! Chow down! 
LOUIS	In a second. 
LOUIS	Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded Christ, he ch-- 
LOUIS	Ow! 
LOUIS	What did we do? 
JUD	I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception. 
LOUIS	What did we do, Jud? 
JUD	Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis! 
LOUIS	I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But... 
JUD	Wouldn't wash? 
LOUIS	No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it? 
JUD	Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself. 
LOUIS	Can I have another one? 
JUD	I guess it wouldn't hurt. 
JUD	The Micmacs used to bury their dead up there long before the whites came. 
JUD	They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground. 
LOUIS	Wendigo? 
JUD	Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories.  And if one touches you... 
JUD	Maybe it really was a Wendigo-- I ain't the one to say it wasn't-- or maybe it was just some disease. Whatever the reason, those that were left moved on. But they left that place...the way it is now. 
LOUIS	You and this old Indian rag-man-- 
JUD	Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back. 
LOUIS	How did your mother take it, Jud? How did she take it when your dog came back from the dead? 
JUD	Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis? 
LOUIS	Yes. 
JUD	Why, then, things should be fine. 
LOUIS	A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown. 
JUD	She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie. 
JUD	A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die. 
LOUIS	What? 
JUD	Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong. 
RACHEL	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise. 
PASCOW	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. 
LOUIS	You don't understand-- 
PASCOW	Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc. 
LOUIS	Promise... 
LOUIS	How the hell did you get in? 
ELLIE	Daddy! 
LOUIS	Hi, sugar! 
ELLIE	Daddy, is Church all right? 
LOUIS	Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left. 
ELLIE	Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary. That was a silly dream, wasn't it? 
ELLIE	Is he really all right? 
LOUIS	Yes. 
ELLIE	Because you promised. 
LOUIS	I know. 
RACHEL	Want to take your son, doc? 
RACHEL	Yes--you have to take them to someone who grooms animals, though. I think it's pretty expensive. I don't care. I'll save up my allowance and pay for it. Church smells bad. 
LOUIS	I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen. 
ELLIE	I hate that smell. 
LOUIS	Yes--I hate it, too. 
ELLIE	They're all turning on their lights! Daddy, why are they all turning on their lights in the middle of the day? 
JUD	They do it to honor the dead, Ellen. 
ELLIE	Is that right, dad? 
LOUIS	Yes. To honor the dead. 
JUD	Rachel not feeling well? 
LOUIS	Well...a touch of the flu... 
ELLIE	She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy-- 
LOUIS	That's enough, Ellen. 
JUD	Out of the mouths of babes, Louis. 
LOUIS	This babe has said enough. 
LOUIS	Hop in, Ellie. 
JUD	Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on. 
LOUIS	My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits." 
JUD	Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis? 
LOUIS	It's Ellie's cat. 
JUD	Nope. He's your cat now. 
LOUIS	Ellie? What's wrong? 
ELLIE	No more chocolate chip cookies. 
LOUIS	Huh? 
ELLIE	Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! 
NEWSCASTER	Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems almost beyond doubt: the dead are returning to eat the living. Daddy? 
LOUIS	What's up, sugar? 
ELLIE	Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven? 
LOUIS	What? 
ELLIE	At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell. 
LOUIS	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear. 
LOUIS	But don't you dare say that. 
ELLIE	I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think? 
LOUIS	I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children-- 
ELLIE	Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose. 
LOUIS	Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard. 
ELLIE	Do you believe that? 
LOUIS	I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that. 
ELLIE	You believe in it. 
LOUIS	Oh, faith's a little more than just believing. 
ELLIE	I don't get it. 
LOUIS	Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow? 
ELLIE	Yeah, sure. 
LOUIS	Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right? 
LOUIS	But we plan on that chair. We believe in that chair. And I plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after I die. I believe I will. You have faith in that. 
LOUIS	Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that it is now time for Ellen Creed to get ready for bed. So buzz. 
ELLIE	I'm not tired! 
LOUIS	I'm sure you're not. 
ELLIE	Then why do I have to go to bed? 
LOUIS	Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz. 
RACHEL	I heard you tonight. 
LOUIS	I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised-- 
RACHEL	That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda. 
LOUIS	Your sister, I know. 
RACHEL	Sometimes you're so good with her, Louis--so straight with her--that you make me ashamed of myself. 
RACHEL	I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard. 
LOUIS	That's forgotten. 
RACHEL	Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know. 
LOUIS	Yes, I guess I do. 
RACHEL	I'm going to try to do better. 
LOUIS	You're doing fine. 
GAGE	Go, dayee! 
LOUIS	Hey, Gage! 
GAGE	Dat? 
LOUIS	String! You're flying it, Gage--you got the hammer, my man! 
GAGE	Gage fline it? 
LOUIS	Bet your boots. Look-- 
LOUIS	See? 
GAGE	Gage fline it!! Bet your ass, little hero. 
IRWIN	You-- 
RACHEL	Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT! 
IRWIN	How do you like that, you son of a bitch? I should have done it sooner! 
IRWIN	How do you like that? How do-- 
MARCY	Stop them. Right now. 
IRWIN	Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll take y'apart! 
STEVE	Stop it! 
STEVE	Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with you, Louis? It's your son's funeral, not a boxing match! 
PASCOW	A man grows what he can...and tends it. 
ELLIE	I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy! 
RACHEL	In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn. 
IRWIN	I don't know what happened to me. Louis, please-- I'm sorry, Gage--I'm so sorry, little hero. 
ELLIE	It got away from him! That numb shit! Ellen Creed! 
GAGE	Kite fline too fast! 
JUD	Don't let him go in the road, Louis! Get him, Louis! 
JUD	Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago? 
LOUIS	No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie. 
JUD	Louis-- 
JUD	What you got there, Ellie? Why that's real nice...you pullin' him on a sled. Bet he liked that, didn't he? I used to pull 'im a lot. 
ELLIE	I'm going to carry this picture, Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage come back. 
JUD	Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but-- 
ELLIE	He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair-- 
LOUIS	Ellie-- 
ELLIE	And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and... 
JUD	Louis, take care of your little girl...she needs you. 
ELLIE	G'night daddy. 
ELLIE	God could take it back if He wanted to, couldn't He? If He really, really wanted to? Can I have faith in that? 
LOUIS	Yes--I suppose you can. Good night, Ellie. 
JUD	I got you a fresh beer out of the fridge, Louis. 
LOUIS	Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just-- 
JUD	You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis. 
LOUIS	I'm thinking about going to bed. 
JUD	You never asked me if anyone had buried a person up there in the Micmac burying ground-- 
JUD	--but I think the thought has crossed your mind. 
LOUIS	Shit! Look at this mess! 
JUD	Ayuh--it's a mess, all right. 
JUD	I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on. 
LOUIS	Because something called a wendigo soured the ground. 
JUD	And because the dead walked. 
JUD	Oh, ayuh. It's been done. What you've been thinking of has been done. 
LOUIS	I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud? 
JUD	Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better. Tell that to my wife and little girl. 
JUD	It ain't your wife and little girl that's got me worried, Louis. 
JUD	Come on. 
ALAN	Oh holy Jesus lookit that. 
BILL	You men get out of here! 
JUD	I heard your boy was killed down Georgia. That was a mistake! 
HANNIBAL	Was it? 
BILL	You see him standing there, don't you? Now get out! Get the Christ off my land! Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an! Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can smell him! 
BILL	He ain't dead! Give him a day or two and he'll be fine! Don't you say that! 
JUD	Bill, this ain't right--you can see that yourself-- 
JUD	God help you, Bill. 
LOUIS	What happened? 
JUD	Get out, Billy--the place is going up. 
BILL	I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall! 
ALAN	You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud? If he don't, he don't. 
TIMMY	LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING! 
GATE AGENT'S VOICE	This is the final call for United's flight 61 to Chicago... 
LOUIS	You better get going, hon. 
RACHEL	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this-- 
LOUIS	I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy. 
RACHEL	Louis, are you sure? 
LOUIS	I'm sure. 
ELLIE	I don't want to go to Chicago, Gramma Dory. 
DORY	Why not, darling? 
ELLIE	I had a bad dream last night. A nightmare. About what? 
ELLIE	About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage. 
ELLIE	And someone named Paxcow. 
LOUIS	Come on, you guys--before you miss the boat. 
IRWIN	Louis, I am sorry. What can I say? That I lost my mind? It's the truth, but no good excuse. We all lost our minds, Irwin. 
LOUIS	Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you. 
ELLIE	Come with us, daddy. Please come with us! 
LOUIS	I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- 
LOUIS	Of what? I don't know. Everything's going to be all right, Ellie. Now go on--get aboard. 
ELLIE	Do you swear? 
LOUIS	I swear. 
CLERK	Anything else for you today? I think we got it all. 
CLERK	Looks like heavy work. 
LOUIS	It could be. 
ELLIE	Paxcow says it's almost too late! 
RACHEL	Ellie...Ellie...what... 
ELLIE	Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late! 
LOUIS	It's wrong. (Pause) What happened to you is wrong. 
PASCOW	The barrier was not meant to be crossed. The ground is sour. 
LOUIS	I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong. 
PASCOW	Timmy Baterman. That was wrong. 
LOUIS	Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard. 
LOUIS	If it doesn't work--if he comes back like Timmy Baterman--I'll put him to sleep. But I'm going to try. (Pause) And if it doesn't work...they don't ever need to know. 
ELLIE	Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He-- 
RACHEL	Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman? 
ELLIE	He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost. 
RACHEL	There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense. 
ELLIE	Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay? 
RACHEL	Of course I will. 
RACHEL	Now will you try to go to sleep? Yes, Mom. 
PASCOW	Pascow. 
RACHEL	Pascow? Was she saying Pascow? 
RACHEL	He's not home. 
DORY	Why, he probably went out for a hamburger or a chicken dinner, dear. You know how men are when they're alone. 
RACHEL	It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm calling from Chicago. Chicago! Is Louis with you? 
RACHEL	No...we're going to be here awhile, and he wanted a few days to wind up our affairs there. I just wondered if he was with you. 
JUD	No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you. 
RACHEL	Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car? I don't-- 
RACHEL	Was it Pascow? 
JUD	Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to-- 
RACHEL	Don't bother. I'm coming home. Rachel! 
RACHEL	Thank you, Jud. Goodbye. 
JUD	No! Rachel! Don't do that! Rachel--! 
DORY	Rachel...darling...you're upset... a night's sleep... 
RACHEL	I have to go. The connections are  tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in  forty minutes. Will you drive me, daddy? 
IRWIN	You know something's wrong, don't you? You know. And Ellie does, too. 
RACHEL	Yes. 
IRWIN	I'll drive you. Mommy? 
ELLIE	Please hurry. 
RACHEL	I will. Come and kiss me. 
IRWIN	I'll come with you if you want, honey. I've got three planes to catch and I got the last seats on two of them. It's like God saved them for me. 
JUD	You done it, you stupid old man... now you got to undo it. 
SEATMATE	Think you'll make your connection in Boston? 
RACHEL	I have to. 
LOUIS	Oh, Gage--oh, honey. 
LOUIS	It's going to be all right...I swear it's going to be all right... 
COP	I ain't afraid of no ghost. 
PASCOW	There's just time. If you run. 
PASCOW	Don't do that, babe. 
RACHEL	Make it come back! 
FEMALE GATE AGENT	I can't-- 
PASCOW	You're doing just fine. 
LOUIS	Please God--let this work. 
LOUIS	Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't gonna look down. 
HERTZ CLERK	I'm sorry...it's been very busy tonight. I really don't have anything. 
PASCOW	What about the Aries K with the scratch on the side? 
CLERK	I do have an Aries K, but it came in sort of beat up--there's a long scrape up one side-- 
RACHEL	I'll take it. 
LOUIS	See? Just imagination. Just-- 
LOUIS	Nothing...there. 
LOUIS	It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I think the Wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me. 
LOUIS	It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage. 
RACHEL	Now what? 
PASCOW	It's trying to stop you. Do you hear me? It's trying to stop you. 
RACHEL	Is anyone there? 
LOUIS	Come back to me, Gage. Come back to us. 
DRIVER	Hop in, baby. 
RACHEL	Thank you. 
RACHEL	Can't you go any faster? 
TRUCKER	Lady, I got nine points on my license right now. 
RACHEL	I understand. It's just that-- 
RACHEL	Thank you. If you only understood how important this is-- 
TRUCKER	That's all right, babe. Only if we get stopped, next time I'll be the one hitchin' and you can give me a ride. 
JUD	Come on, stop playing games! 
JUD	Gage? (Pause) Are you the one playing games? 
JUD	Gage? Come on out. 
JUD	I want to show you something. 
RACHEL	Thank you so much. 
TRUCKER	I didn't get a ticket, so you're welcome, lady. Whatever your problems are, I hope they work out. 
PASCOW	It's the end of the line for me, too--I'm not allowed any further. I'm sure things will be fine. 
PASCOW	I'm not. Mummy! Mummy! 
RACHEL	Who-- 
CHURCH	Miaow! 
RACHEL	Church! Mummy, I need you! 
RACHEL	Gage? Gage? 
LOUIS	Jesus! 
LOUIS	Gage--? 
LOUIS	Oh my God. (Pause) Gage! 
LOUIS	Gage! 
LOUIS	Hello! Hello, Louis--it's Irwin. I just wanted to be sure Rachel got back all right. 
LOUIS	Yes, she's fine. Well, put her on at that end and I'll put Ellie on at this one. Ellie's very worried about her mother. (Pause) She's almost in hysterics. 
LOUIS	She...Rachel's asleep. Then I suggest you wake her up. Ellie...I think she had a dream that her mother was dead. 
LOUIS	I'll call you right back. Louis--! 
LOUIS	Irwin, you'll just have to-- I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come over and play with me? Gage? Mommy already came. We played, daddy. First I played with Jud and then mommy came and I played with mommy. We had an awful good time. Now I want to play with you. 
LOUIS	What did you do? What did you-- 
LOUIS	What you buy is what you own, and sooner or later what you own comes home to you. Wasn't that what you said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it? 
LOUIS	Hi, Church. Want some grub? 
LOUIS	Don't mind me. Eat it while you can. Eat all you want. 
LOUIS	Eat all you can...all you want... that's right...today's Thanksgiving day for cats, but only if they came back from the dead... 
LOUIS	No, you don't! 
LOUIS	Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead. 
LOUIS	Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause) Gage? 
LOUIS	Gage? 
LOUIS	All right, Gage...let's. 
LOUIS	I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm-- 
LOUIS	I'm going to set things back in order. I...I know just what to do. 
LOUIS	Gage? 
GAGE	No fair! NO FAIR! 
LOUIS	And what you own always comes home to you.
