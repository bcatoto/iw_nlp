April Fool's Day

MARY	Hi... My name is Mary O'Reilly O'Toole O'Shea and...over there is the island my friend Muffy owns... It's spring break... and she's invited us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take us there... I don't know what else to say!
MARY	Something about myself? Oh, Gee... (composing herself, earnestly) Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on the first date. O.S. her friends explode with LAUGHTER. Brassy former deb NIKKI BRASHEARS gives us a big, wet wink, dropping the act.
CHAZ'S VOICE	Whoo! Outrageous woman! Nikki, you are my kind o' gal! He PANS THE CAMERA over to KIT-- a pretty, unaffected, natural beauty, bright and very much aware.
CHAZ'S VOICE	C'mon, Kit, how about you? Kit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself. She's got nothing to say.
KIT	Pass.
CHAZ'S VOICE	C'mon , Arch? Skip? He PANS over to the other two college boys on the dock here - ARCH, a big, good-natured, easygoing WASP jock (rugby and crew); and SKIP, Mr. Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless upper-crust kid. Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin.
ARCH	(ponders it with due consideration) Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date... Skip cracks up. Arch's laughter follows.
CHAZ'S VOICE	(teasing, with innuendo) Yeah, Kit, where is he? Oh, Kit... Concerned, Kit keeps her humor anyway, waving the lens away again.
KIT	Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you? He does, finally shutting down the videopak. The image reverts to FILM again.
NIKKI	(looks at her, persisting) Well?
ROB	(gestures, awkwardly) Here'll be fine, thanks...
ROB	Thanks... for the lift, I mean...
SUBURBAN LADY	(smiles, no reason for disappointment) It was a real lift for me, too, hon. A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road sign indicates: "BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT" in another direction. Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan. The Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate male hitchhiking down the road.
CLARA	The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my way... She hears a CLATTER from down below.
MUFFY	Shit.
CLARA'S VOICE	Need any help down there? Clara comes clopping down the steps. Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm still in her hand. Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust. Early 20's, pretty in an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood.
MUFFY	(puffing with the effort) No, Clara, thanks. Just trying some last minute straightening down here... god, I don't think I've ever worked so hard in my life...!
CLARA	Sure you don't want me to stay? There's nobody gonna be around here to help till first ferry back Monday, y'know...
MUFFY	(continuing with her work) Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses.
CLARA	(dubiously , turning to go) All right, then. Have a nice party.
MUFFY	(a buoyant laugh) Nice? It has to be better than nice... it's gotta be bloody unforgettable! Clara climbs the stairs.
CLARA	Good luck.
MUFFY	Bye, Clara. See you Monday. Soon there's the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing behind Clara. Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining clutter. She goes to open a basement window for ventilation. It is a ground-level transom, hinged at the top. Through it Clara is visible departing the grounds. Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING. She turns, hesitating, and follows the sounds.
CHAZ	Here she comes... He's a real hi-tech freak and Ivy League wiseass, a free spirit in neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt. He shoulders his lightweight videopak again, taping it. Arch and Skip watch with him from the end of the pier. But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car.
NAN	Hi... is this the ferry to the St. John house?
NIKKI I	Any second now.
NAN	Oh, thank goodness ! I didn't know if I was on the right road... Kit smiles welcome, lending a hand as Nan struggles the bag up the ramp.
KIT	Hi. Kit Graham... Nikki Brashears.
NAN	Nan Youngblood.
NIKKI	(needling, about the suitcase) Planning on staying a while?
NAN	(flushes, embarrassed) Oh, no... just some work for finals, when we get back... you don't know how far behind I am... Arch outhustles Chaz for her bag. Her simple attractiveness exerts an appeal.
ARCH	Hi. Arch Cummings . I've seen you around. Jewett Hall, right?
CHAZ	Chaz Vyshinsky. You got great legs.
NIKKI	(pointed1y, reminds him) Chaz, Arch already has her bag. Meaning, Chaz is Nikki's man, especially for this weekend.
NAN	(volunteering, happily) Well, I only met Muffy this term in Drama Society . I volunteered to do their costumes... I like to sew... Did you see her in Ghosts? She's so talented. She was wonderful!
SKIP	(to Nan, approvingly; in greeting) Congratulations, on finding your way. The landing BUMPS, the ferry touches down. They look up.
ANGLE CHANGE
FERRYMAN	Stand clear! The large, raw-boned FERRYMAN holds open the wooden stile for the one and only passenger from the island � Clara -- to disembark. Clara passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking her head in sad appraisal. FERRYMAN (cont.) Ok, let's go. It's not the friendliest greeting in the world. The ferryman keeps the stile open for them to board singly. There is also a younger assistant on board -- BUCK, a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s. FERRYMAN (cont.) To the rear. Outa the operator's way. Nikki clutches at Skip's arm.
NIKKI	This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where men are men, and women oughta know better?
ARCH	Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole.
NIKKI	You could tie me in chains... Chaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant.
CHAZ	(a low whisper) Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out... The assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly. Which is closed, of course. He looks up, grinning. Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks and moves on.
BUCK	Sh -i-i-t... Kit is hanging back on the dock.
FERRYMAN	Come on if you're coming.
KIT	Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody --
FERRYMAN	It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime.
KIT	But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over. If he misses this... Arch WHISTLES loudly, seeing and alerting them.
ANGLE � LANDING	...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR.
HARVEY	Wait up! Harvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he comes running with his bag, too. He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's invited guests. He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce Springsteen badge.
ROB	(to Kit, kissing her) Sorry... Nik, Chaz... (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know) Rob Ferris... They return greetings.
HARVEY	Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty spot. Stylistically, he's a Martian. Chaz stares at him.
CHAZ	You're friends with... Muffy St. John?
HARVEY	Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal utility curves.
NIKKI	I get it. That's a joke. Preppy Skip adds his greeting.
SKIP	(an ironical nod) Harve.
HARVEY	(correcting him, blithely) Hal... (noticing interest his badge) Springsteen, he's still the Boss!
FERRYMAN	Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day. He slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy with the stubborn motor. His assistant helps. Chaz tapes.
HARVEY	(enthusiastically, putting down his fear) YOU all buddies?
NIKKI	Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met.
KIT	But we will be.
CHAZ	Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin.
HARVEY	(tickled, to Skip) No kiddin'?
SKIP	Distant. Over the horizon. Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited... (frowns, tellingly) Old money never mixes family with friends.
NIKKI	This is true. For as long as I've known her.
KIT	To protect her family, I guess.
SKIP	To keep her friends. He turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and CLICK, a switchblade opens into the lens. SKIP (cont.) Choose your weapons, big guy.
ARCH	(nervously, a laugh) Hey, what's this...?
SKIP	You up for a game of stretch?
CHAZ	(still taping, to Skip) Your fly's open.
SKIP	Eat it.
CHAZ	(undaunted, to Rob) Your fly's open. Ok, so don't believe me. He keeps the tape rolling. Rob discreetly looks down. His fly is open. Kit looks at him dubiously. Rob zips. Chaz beams, getting it all for posterity. The engine finally engages. The ferry lurches.
ROB	(smiles weakly to Kit) We're off! They are indeed.
SKIP	First round, the champ!
HARVEY	Y'know what I find amazin'? Muffy's her real name. I mean, I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so I thought, 'Muffy', it must stand for something... Muffin?
NIKKI	Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster...
HARVEY	I bet you're her oldest friend.
NIKKI	Actually, she's three months older than I am.
HARVEY	You know what I mean.
NIKKI	Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up?
HARVEY	I've given it some thought. Why?
NIKKI	Oh, just a hunch.
HARVEY	First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation... Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter! She just stares at him.
SKIP	Go for it, big fella. Arch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt.
CHAZ	fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books. He carries his own.
CHAZ	(sitting beside her) Whatcha readin'?
NAN	Milton. Paradise Lost. For Professor Russo's course on the English epic... It's a shame. It's a dying form. Not too many people read it nowadays, even in college. What's yours?
CHAZ	Suck and fuck. Naked bodies writhing in heat. Women with their tongues sticking out in desparate desire... Nan tries to control her reaction to his stack of graphic pornographic video catalogues and magazines.
CHAZ	The origins of American pornographic film. I'm taking an independent study this term. (the passion and commitment show) My advisor's really behind me on it. We're not gonna be sheltered college kids all our lives. Someday I'm gonna have kids -- you're gonna have kids � and someday that kid's gonna come up to me and say, 'God, Dad, porn's really a major part of our lives. You were there, how'd it get started?' I wanna be able to answer their questions. Besides, it's research I can do by myself.
KIT	That's not my point --
ROB	You don't want me to hitch, you want me to buy a car. OK, but I'm a state university boy, I don't have the perks like some of you private college kids do.
KIT	Oh, c'mon, don't pull that. Rob just drops his arms in frustration. KIT (cont.) I mean, it may show something about your attitude toward me, always being late.
ROB	Kit... Arch's voice interrupts.
ARCH'S VOICE	(annoyed, loudly, overriding the other conversations) Hey, I'm really not interested anymore --
SKIP	C'mon, just one more The others look up at the interruption.
ANGLE	Arch pushes the knife back into Skip's hand, tired of playing knife- toss.
ARCH	I said, enough's enough--
SKIP	One more try, double or nothing. He flips the knife to Arch, handle first.
ARCH	C'mon, give it a fuckin' rest! He flips it back hard. Something happens. Skip looks up stunned. Arch's voice catches in his throat in horror.
ANOTHER ANGLE	Skip stares back, disbelieving, looking down and pulling his hand away from his chest, where the blood begins to seep and the jackknife sticks out, buried hilt-deep between his ribs.
SKIP	Oh, fuck.
SKIP	Nan screams. Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry. Rob and Chaz leap to their feet. The ferrymen both look up in disbelief. Arch steps forward to help. But Skip, weaving, topples and splashes overboard. He goes under.
ARCH	(panicked, hurrying to the side) I'll get him, I'll get him! But he stops just at the edge of the ferry, immobilized by fear. Rob rushes forward, with Chaz in reserve, pulling Arch out of �the way. But Buck, the assistant ferryman, pre-empts them all, diving in. Arch, frozen, watches from the deck with the others. Buck resurfaces, but without any sign of Skip. Rob doesn't wait any longer. He pulls off his shoes and dives in. Chaz gets ready to follow suit. The panic mounts. Suddenly:
SKIP'S VOICE	Hi, this what you're looking for?
THEY TURN;
ANGLE CHANGE	Skip pulls himself up, dripping, on the other side of the ferry. He holds up the knife -- and the padded sash beneath his shirt he used to imbed the knife -- and grins from ear to ear. The others stare, totally freaked. Arch lets go, jumping in the air. Rob and Buck surface, to see as well.
ARCH	We got 'em! Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em!
CHAZ	(as it dawns, to Skip) April Fools... you crazy jerks. You crazy motherfuckin' jerks... somebody could've gotten hurt out there! Relief descends. Rob isn't laughing. But nobody's more impressed than assistant Buck, still treading water.
BUCK
SH-I-I-I-T
NIKKI	You maniacs... you almost gave us a heart attack! Kit glowers at them and gives Rob a hand to get out.
ARCH	Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelace�is-untied crap!
ROB	(dripping, to Arch and Skip) I owe you one.
SKIP	(smiles, to Buck in the water) How's it goin' out there?
BUCK	That was great!
SKIP	I was really counting on these other turkeys to save my ass.
CHAZ	Oh, too bad. Skip extends a hand to Buck to help him out.
SKIP	Sorry about that. But Buck's in no hurry. The ferryman steps forward.
FERRYMAN	(unamused, to Buck) Ok, c'mon, get out. They are approaching the landing dock on the island.
FERRYMAN	And watch out for the wire! Too late. There's a sickening THUMP I The young assistant suddenly breaks the surface qf the water, panicked and stunned, gasping for air. It happens too fast for any of them to do anything. Buck thrashes, dazed, off-balance, falling back into the path of the ferry as it glides toward the landing.
FERRYMAN	Buck, look out--
ROB	Oh, shit... The ferryman grabs the controls, but it can't help. The ferry, unstoppable, plows into Buck, pinning him against one of the piers. Buck screams.
FERRYMAN	Buck! The ferryman rushes forward to help. For a moment the others are spared the horror of it as the Ferryman's back blocks their view. But then Buck, thrashing in the water, tears himself, loose, screaming and bobbing. up, his head and torso covered in blood, the side of his face and his shoulder hideously deformed. It is awful. It is ghastly. And it is unforgettable.
KIT	Oh, god!
FERRYMAN	Get away from him! Buck is hysterical. The gashes of torn flesh seem to drip from his skull. Seeing Rob and the others, he screams, lunging vainly at� them in agony.
BUCK	They did it... them!
FERRYMAN	Easy Buck... it's OK... OK... There's time for Later... easy... But it's hard for him to restrain his own rage. Constable Potter arrives, throwing the ferryman a towel to use. The ferryman catches it, pressing it against Buck's torn face. One maddened, glaring eye still stares out hideously at the group.
CONSTABLE POTTER	Get him to the hospital, Cal! Take my boat! He helps the ferryman lift Buck. But the powerful ferryman needs no further help, carrying Buck to the Constable's motorboat moored nearby, laying Buck in, untying the line and pulling the motor to life. Buck continues to shriek, terrifyingly. The ferryman cast one last glance back.
CONSTABLE POTTER	All right... Let's have it.
MUFFY	What's going on? Sam... what's wrong?
CONSTABLE POTTER	Tricks. Pranks. Better ask your friends... Buck's been hurt. 'Cal just took him on over to the mainland. Just lucky I was here... She returns his stare in dread silence. He boards the ferry.
MUFFY	No, he's in Sutton Place. Why?
CONSTABLE POTTER	No word from him, or anybody else?
MUFFY	No... He tries the engine. Nothing.
CONSTABLE POTTER	Just like I thought. . Burned out. Worthless... He steps back onto the shore.
MUFFY	We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen, but I think there's an extra one underneath the cushion there. She points to the boat seat. Potter is much obliged.
CONSTABLE POTTER	(to the others, sternly) I'm glad you're stuck here, all o' you. If there's anvthin' else, or anything happens to Buck... I want to know where to find you. The van moves slowly along a narrow road through the forest. From what we can see of its occupants, the mood is pretty grim. Behind it, the old island pick-up truck follows.
SKIP	These goddamn windows! He starts banging violently on the door, on the window.
SKIP	They've never been fixed...
KIT	Look, Skip, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You didn't know.
SKIP	Sure. He leaves off his banging. Pause.
ROB	What a way to start a weekend, huh.
SKIP	Muffy. Nothing bad ever happens to her.
NAN	Oh; Muffy... Rob pulls the pick-up right behind them.
MUFFY	Well, there's an awful lot to be done with this place.
ARCH	You sound as if you own it. She helps with bags, shepherding them on ahead.
MUFFY	I will, if all goes well. Next month when I turn 21. It's my first- stage inheritance.
HARVEY	First stage? What's your second?
NIKKI	Texas. You might be talking to your future boss, Harve.
CHAZ	Mom, I am home! They all look to see him standing in the entrance to the living room.
ARCH	Yeah, I could get real used to this.
MUFFY	We used to spend our summers here before my mother died. This is a very special place to me.
NAN	It's like a dream.
NIKKI	On a clear day you can see the Kennedys.
CHAZ'S VOICE	(from the dining room) Wow, look at this...!
CHAZ	(in mock awe) Look! Our very own place settings... with our very own place cards -- with Ken or Barbie! Outasight!
NAN	Just like in Agatha Cristie.
ARCH	(in the spirit) And sporks...
HARVEY	Sporks?
ARCH	And napkins with little Hallmark bunnies! Gee, Muff, you really spared no expense.
MUFFY	Why not? How do you think father made all his money?
NIKKI	The old-fashioned way. He inherited it.
NAN	(meaningfully, with her Barbie) I used to have all her outfits.
CHAZ	Don't anybody move! Chaz jumps back from the table, whipping out his videocam to record the moment, and panning them all at � .their respective places.
CHAZ	One of us in this room... (bellowing a mystery laugh) ...pulls his wang. He ends the pan on Arch, who gives him the finger.
NIKKI	...if only the choices weren't so limited. God, I'm so ready for a change. Any kind of change.
MUFFY	Well, you know, everything they say about older men? It's true. Kit and Nikki stare at her, open-mouthed.
KIT	Muffy!
NIKKI	Like how much older are we talking about? Twenty-six?
MUFFY	Add about thirty years.
NIKKI	I don't believe �you, St. John!
KIT	I don't want to hear about this.
NIKKI	Come on! �
MUFFY	It was only a weekend. It's over now. (beat, shrugs) I was curious.
KIT	He wasn't married?
MUFFY	How should I know? Kit and Nikki just drop everything and continue to stare at her .
MUFFY	It was quite a weekend. Nikki starts to laugh.
NIKKI	Come to daddy. They all start to laugh now, wickedly, conspiratorially.
NIKKI	Come sit on daddy's knee, little girl... Nikki falls to the floor in hysterics.
KIT	My goodness, daddy, what big ...what big... teeth you have.
ALL	The better to eat you with, my dear.
SKIP	(quietly, with deliberation) The poor boy can say, "Fuck you, Dad. I'm my own person." What is his father going to do? Kick him out of the house? Disinherit him? His life won't have changed that much. He's got nothing to lose.
NAN	His father's love.
SKIP	That's already been lost. Died a long, long time ago.
NAN	Skip, you're giving up. You're giving up before you've even gotten started. Look at how young we all are. How young and foolish and innocent and stupid... Skip raises his glass and gulps down the rest of his drink.
CHAZ	Boy, Muff, you sure know how to make a guy look forward to dessert.
ARCH	Please, God, let it be ding dongs.
NIKKI	St. John hospitality taken to the extreme.
HARVEY	I think it's real friendly. Makes me feel right at home. Everyone starts to sit down at his designated place.
KIT	How friendly will we feel once we've finished with those beans?
ON NAN	As soon as her ass hits the seat, she lets slip an outrageous fart. She springs to her feet, her face turning beet red.
THE GROUP	All conversation stops, each person looking for the guilty party. Nan discreetly sits back down: but again, as soon as her tail meets the chair, another blast escapes her... All eyes are on her as she reaches beneath her and pulls out a whoopee cushion.
NAN	You guys! Everybody laughs.
KIT	So it's going to be one of those dinners, huh? Arch is laughing the loudest when suddenly his chair collapses beneath him and he drops sprawling onto the floor.
WIDER
ROB	I wonder how Buck is doing?
PAUSE
NAN	Do you think we should call or something?
MUFFY	I'll call later.
KIT	I think we should change the subject.
ARCH	Well, Harvey's got his job interview all figured out, but what about the rest of us? Anybody know what they're going to be doing come graduation?
NIKKI	Good choice, Arch.
NAN	I can't decide. I'd like to go to graduate school in English. I love the sound of our language. But I'm afraid there's not much future in it.
NIKKI	I mean, what are you' supposed to do with a liberal arts major anyway?
MUFFY	You fill out a lot of forms, and then some friend of your family gives you a job delivering mail in his �corporation...
ARCH	This is really incredible. Look at us... Here we are... privileged, independent, the hope of the future... and most of us still don't know what we're going to do with our lives!
KIT	Rob knows. He's going to medical school. Rob looks up from his plate.
ROB	Kit...
CHAZ	Hey, no shit? You got early acceptance?
ROB	(reddens, to Kit) We can talk about it some other time.
KIT	Why? You had your meeting with your counselor, didn't you?
MUFFY	Kit... I don't think Rob really wants to talk about it in front of everybody. She gets up from the table and steps over to the sideboard.
ROB	No, I don't mind.
KIT	Why not? We're all friends.
NIKKI	Well, sorta...
ROB	He said to forget it. Kit looks up in surprise. They all stare, quieting. He said my grades might be OK; but that basically I possess an essential lack of seriousness, and that's what they look for.
ARCH	Oh, shit, him too? That's what my guy said! An' I said, you're kidding! How can anybody be serious about anything when some moron can steal a bomb or push a button and blow the rest of us right into Mad Max. He wasn't impressed.
ROB	He's right. That's bullshit on parade.
ARCH	Well fuck you. It sounded good at the time. Muffy turns from the sideboard and sets a tray of champagne glasses in the center of the table. There are eight of them. Each one is filled with a pinkish, bubbly liquid. Everybody reaches for a glass.
CHAZ	What is this? Dom Perignon sparkling rose?
HARVEY	It smells like Ripple.
NIKKI	You've outdone yourself again, St. John. The back screen door slams shut o.s. behind Skip, leaving the house. They look up.
ARCH	Who was that?
MUFFY	Skip.
NAN	Can I make a toast? They turn attention toward her, and she stands, emboldened by their acceptance.
ARCH	I cherish all the friends I make.
NAN	Because... they'll be the friends you cherish most the rest of your life. So, well, here's to us... here's to my life... because I'm very glad to be here, and to be a part of all of you...
KIT	Muffy, anything you want to add to that?
MUFFY	Why me?
NIKKI	Because you're the hostess. Muffy thinks for a moment, then adds...
MUFFY	In his "Life of Johnson" James Boswell said, "We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses, there is at last one which makes the heart run over." Arch has started to make snoring sounds. MUFFY (cont.) So with this toast may our hearts run over and our friendships be formed. They stand unanimously, raise their glasses in agreement, start to drink and spill it all down the front of their shirts. Dribble glasses. Everybody groans.
MUFFY	April Fool.
NAN	Goodnight.
MUFFY	Goodnight. Muffy leads Nikki to a narrow, sparse single, popping open the door.
NIKKI	Oh, great. Quarantine.
MUFFY	Just holler if you need anything.
NIKKI	Another room. Muffy... Muffy turns back to her. NIKKI (cont.) (beat, seriously) I know you and Arch had something going before I met him...
MUFFY	Arch is sweet, but he's only got two expressions. Collar up and collar down.
NIKKI	I found that out-- I guess what I'm trying to say is... you always seem to get there first... but this time Chaz is mine, OK?
MUFFY	What about Hal?
NIKKI '	Harvey? Mr. Junior Achievement? Oh please... Muffy returns her smile,continuing down the corridor.
ARCH	Hey, all right... ladies, we are qonna have privacy... He turns his collar up on his polo shirt, then eagerly pushes the two beds together. The other door (to the connecting bathroom) swings open. Arch's face drops as Chaz walks in, lugging his gear.
CHAZ	(unloading his gear). Unless Muffy knows something about us we don't. He blows Arch a kiss, pulling the two beds apart again.
HARVEY	(to himself; rehearsing) Don't tell me you've never thought of me in that way, Muffy. I felt a spark between us the very first moment we laid eyes on each other... in Econ 345. Why, just think of it, Muffy... with my talent and your... money. He crosses to the closet with his navy blazer.
HARVEY	Why just think of it... Muffers, with my raw... driving talent and your... He opens the closet door.
HARVEY	He puzzles, taking down the clipping, putting it down on the dresser as he moves there to put away his rolled socks. He opens the top drawer.
POV	The same thing. Full of newspaper clippings of awful, fatal car crashes, all circled in the same accusatory red ink.
RETURN � HARVEY	getting nervous. Suddenly, Chaz burst in on him. Harvey turns quickly, shoving the clippings back in the drawer and slamming it shut. They stare at each other for a long, uncomfortable moment.
CHAZ	Wrong room. He ducks back out the door, pulling it quietly closed behind him.
ARCH	Jesus...
MUFFY	Goodnight.
KIT	G'night.
CLOSE ANGLE	A small cassette recorder plays. The tape runs out. The baby's cries stop. Nan rips out the cassette, and sinks back onto the bed, burying her head in her hands. INT. ROB and KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT Rob and Kit are standing together staring INTO CAMERA. REVERSE to see the object of their attention. Hanging on the wall in front of them is a large oil portrait with the eyes out out. Something is moving behind the canvas �watching them. Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the- cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth, like a pendulum marking seconds.
KIT	Rob? No answer.
KIT	You still angry with me? About dinner?
ROB	No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry. He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the bathroom comes on. Beat. He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in and turns off the light... ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead light... ...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still tries to stifle it. Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it and starts to unscrew the bulb instead.
ROB	(burning his fingers) Ouch! Jesus! Kit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into darkness. Silence.
ROB	Very funny. Kit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her.
MUFFY	Arch do you know what time it is?
ARCH	Um-hmm.
MUFFY	(turning down his collar) Goodnight, Arch. Gently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door behind her.
ARCH	Undaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks once softly, and enters.
HIS POV	Nikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz. She catches Arch's stare, signalling him to get the hell out.
REVERSE	Arch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan. The light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also locked. Arch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door for everybody's benefit.
SKIP	Hello? There is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring.
SKIP	Who's there? Pause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear. Finally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter and flicks it on. Something snags him from behind. Skip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed hands tightens around his neck. His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor.
ROB	(hushed, at door) Muffy? No answer. He tries her door, but it's locked tight. A beat. Then: ROB (cont.) Muffy?
MUFFY'S VOICE	Yes?
ROB	You OK?
MUFFY'S VOICE	Yes... Thank you... He pulls back from the door.
ROB	(reluctantly, puzzled) OK... well, goodnight... No response. He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too.
KIT	Good morning! Muffy turns abruptly, startled. Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too.
ANGLE	Muffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe. Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St. John.
RETURN ANGLE	She shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile. Scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner.
MUFFY	I... I was hungry... She bumps against the stove, backing away. She self-consciously runs a hand through her hair. MUFFY (cont.) I... I must look a mess... She scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs beyond, leaving the eggs to burn.
ARCH	Morning! She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs.
MUFFY	I... forgot to get dressed...
ARCH	Who made her night?
ARCH	(always in search of more players) Where's Skip?
CHAZ	That depends on what he's on. Rob and Kit cross their path, heading down to the water in their swimsuits and overshirts.
NIKKI	You gotta be kidding...
ARCH	(teasingly, an invitation) Nan? What about it? Nan watches from the porch, book in hand.
NAN	Oh, no, thanks. Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do... Arch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest, with special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and Nikki. Up on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool shed. Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible sense of disorder about her. She keeps to herself, turning toward the woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand. Nan puts down her book, hurrying off the porch. But by the timeshe looks up again, Muffy is gone...
KIT	Rob? What's wrong? Pause.
ROB	I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday . This isn't what she meant, and he knows it.
KIT	Are you giving up?
ROB	(turning to her; gently) What about you? What about your future? You're the one with the four point.
	...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me.
KIT	I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school.
ROB	You've got a great mind
KIT	...only it's not made up. Smiling sadly, he crosses to her, puts his arms around her.
ROB	Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are?
KIT	It's made up about one thing though.
ROB	Yeah? What's that? She looks up and kisses him softly.
ROB	Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years from now? She takes his hand and leads him down the pier and into the boathouse.
ROB	Skip! You sonofabitch! But there's no response, Skip's body unmoving on the self-powered skiff which continues bobbing out to sea.
ROB	starts to wonder whether it really is a joke. He hurries forward, plunging 'into the water to reach the boat.
ROB	Skip... Skip! But it's too far and getting farther, and the waves are too strong.
CHAZ	(commentary while he tapes) Respectable young Quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of nonviolent sex.
ARCH	Well, how was it?
ROB	Where's Skip? Anybody seen him?
NIKKI	Who wants to know?
ROB	Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer! They sit up with the force. Nan comes out on the porch, hearing .
KIT	We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He looked dead... unless he was joking...!
CHAZ	Well, if it was Skip...
KIT	I saw his face!
ROB	Has anybody seen him since last night? They all realize they haven't. ROB (cont .) Jesus Christ... Rob turns, rushing into the house.
MUFFY	(noticing their distress ) Something wrong? Rob rushes by her.
ARCH	Wait! I'll go with you!
CHAZ	Me too!
ARCH	(aloud: for Skip) Hey, asshole!
CHAZ	Wait a minute! Look at this! He has found on the little pebbled beach beside the dock, Skip's switchblade. It is in pieces. There's blood on the broken blade.
CHAZ	This was Skip's.
ARCH	What do you think? That guy on the ferry?
ROB	I don't know. I don't know what to think.
ARCH	I say we go looking for him, him or Skip. One of them's bound to still be around... somewhere.
CHAZ	You mean split up?
ROB	Let's not take any chances. He was... He was pretty big.
ARCH	No sucker's taken me yet. He rips a loose board off the dock for a club.
NAN	I know why you're avoiding me... I guess it's your idea of a joke... that's why you invited me. How'd you find out? From one of his preppy 'friends'? Who else have you told?... Who else knows, except the father!
MUFFY	I... don't know what you're talking about.
NAN	Oh? The tape just got there? You know very well... my abortion! She comes apart, in tears. Muffy stares, uncomprehending. NAN (cont.) I thought you wanted to be friends... you think you can play with people's feelings just because you're rich and can do what you want. Well, you can't...! She rushes out the rear door. Muffy tries to recover, confused. She continues on to the back entrance to the kitchen.
HARVEY	Sorry... I was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right. He beats a hasty retreat the other way, passing Nikki on her way in Nikki raises an eyebrow at Muffy, misinterpreting the tension in the air.
NIKKI	Harvey? No kidding'? Maybe that explains your clothes.
MUFFY	What d'you, mean?
NIKKI	Oh, c'mon. Muffy exits hurriedly, upset.
ARCH	Hey, shithead! chickendick!... yeah, you! Skip! He moves deeper and deeper into the forest.
LOW ANGLE	Up ahead on the pathway a thick, black viper slithers out of the undergrowth, stops, sensing Arch's presence, and coils itself against his approach.
WIDER	as Arch stalks forward, not looking at the ground.
LOW ANGLE
ARCH	Skip! Arch steps right over the snake and continues on.
WIDER	as Arch hears a noise. He stops. SOMEONE ELSE is here with him, very nearby.
ARCH	Skip? He turns and moves back along the trail, peering into the dense foliage on either side.
LOW ANGLE	as he steps over the snake again going back the other way.
WIDER	He stops again, looks all around him, then turns once more and starts to move very slowly with short little steps back in the other direction.
ARCH	Skip?
LOW ANGLE	He is edging closer and closer to the snake. He is bound to step on it this time. The snake coils itself to strike. Arch's foot comes down just missing it, less than six inches away, when suddenly the ground seems to move. A noose springs up, tightens around his ankle, and Arch is lifted into the air upside down, swinging wildly, dropping his club. Now the viper strikes, and Arch sees it. He is shrieking with horror as he tries to bat the creature away from him. But he keeps swinging into it, and the snake keeps striking at him, trying to find an opening. Suddenly a long, gleaming blade ENTERS FRAME and chops the snake in two. Arch looks up, his face white and frozen into a mask of sheer terror, no longer able even to scream
KIT	(calling to him) No Skip? Chaz now comes out of the woods on the other side of the yard.
CHAZ	No luck.
ROB	Where's Arch?
CHAZ	He isn't with you?
NIKKI	I don't like this... I definitely don't think I like this...
KIT	I think it's about time we called the police. The screen door BANGS again. They look up. It's Muffy. She returns their stares stiffly, without expression . She holds flowers cut with hand shears.
MUFFY	Eight-two-four-eight. Constable Potter has an office at his home.
KIT	I don't think we should wait any longer... Rob moves into the house past Muffy. Kit follows him. MUFFY (to be played like Muffy) Who wants some tea? It'll calm our nerves... She exits toward the kitchen . Nikki. perplexed by her behavior, looks strangely after her.
MUFFY	I didn't know what kind anybody would like so I just... got them all...
KIT	Let me help.
MUFFY	Has he reached the Constable?
KIT	Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet. Muffy eases. Kit turns the tap to fill the kettle. The pipes begin to BANG. The tap sputters and coughs out a spurt of brown water before running dry.
L1UFFY	Oh... �the main... it's probably broken.
KIT	No water? Nikki and Harvey enter, having heard the pipes banging.
NIKKI	What's happening.
KIT	No water.
NIKKI	What!
MUFFY	It happens sometime... But there's still the well all the island homes have some kind of pump... or well... for emergencies. Nikki reaches for a large flashlight beam.
NIKKI	Jesus. I'll go. Just point me in the right direction.
HARVEY	Not without me. Harvey accompanies Nikki out the back door, leaving Kit and Muffy alone again.
MUFFY	(bearing up under Kit's stare) I'm not worried. I'm sure those two... Skip and Art... they're just up to some kind of stupid trick . . . Kit moves out of the kitchen uneasily.
HARVEY	I don't think you should really do that.
NIKKI
	Is that it? The well is the old-fashioned kind. NIKKI (cont.) Boy, when she said `well,' she really meant 'well'. who dug this thing? Pocahontas? She reaches for the wooden bucket attached by metal nook to the thick rope. Harvey pre-empts.
HARVEY	Here, let me do it. I've probably had more experience than you.
NIKKI	You mean, back home on the farm?
HARVEY	I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd like to change your mind about that, if you'd only give me the chance.
NIKKI	Why?
HARVEY	Because, I'd really like to plow your field.
NIKKI	Draw me some water. He's glad to oblige, opening the hinged wood well cover and lowering the bucket slowly. The dark hole seems to go on forever. Suddenly, there's a muffled CLATTER deep within the well.
HARVEY	Aw, crap...
NIKKI	What happened?
HARVEY	I lost the bucket.
NIKKI	Harve.
HARVEY	Hal. The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that.
NIKKI	You didn't.
HARVEY	Here, shine your light down so I can get a fix on it. She rises on her toes, flashing the powerful beam down the dank hole. Harvey bends over to look. A rotted piece of the well cover breaks off in his hand. He lurches forward.
HARVEY	Oh... oh, Jesus! He slams back in ashen horror.
NIKKI
(STARTLED}	...what...
HARVEY	Stay back! Don't look!
NIKKI	I'm a big girl now. I think I �can handle a few spiders and
HARVEY
HER POV	Nan's body lies twisted and jammed among the slime. Her dress is torn, revealing a white breast with veins of blood streaming across it and into the water. Next to her, Arch's severed head gapes up in a rictus grin, joined in its leer by Skip's decapitated head.
NIKKI	It's like the very guts have been torn out of her. She screams, stumbling back.
ROB	What is it?
KIT	You don't want to know.
NIKKI	In the well ! Oh, God, the well! Rob grabs the flashlight from Chaz's hands and leaps up to take a look. After a long, horrifying glimpse he has to step back to control his overwhelming nausea. He shudders violently.
NIKKI	We have to leave, all of us, we have to get away.
ROB	(closing the well cover) We can't get away. Everyone back into the house . Now. Let's go!
KIT	It's okay, Nikki. With the others... they were outdoors. But we're inside now, and we're safe.
NIKKI	It's all because of what happened on the ferry, isn't it?
CHAZ	It was an accident. Don't they know that? Muffy enters from the kitchen with a glass of water. Harvey pulls her quietly aside.
HARVEY	Muffy, where do you keep your guns?
MUFFY	Guns? We don't keep guns in this house. The others turn and look back at them. There is an uncomfortable pause.
MUFFY	(handing Nikki the glass) Here.
MUFFY	It's all right. It's Perrier. Suddenly the phone rings O. S. They all look toward the living room.
ROB	Hello! He listens for a moment, then almost collapses with relief. ROB (cont.) Constable Potter... Thank God it's you... The others stand and start drifting in from the dining room.
POTTER	What are you talking about? That ain't possible . And I'm telling you, I'm here at the hospital now visiting Buck. He came out of surgery last night--It might interest you to know he'll be all right-- and Cal's been here too, the whole time. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the ferryman Cal standing anxiously beside him.
ROB	Constable?... Here. She's all right. With Muffy? What do you mean? He looks up at the others who have gathered around him expectantly.
ROB	Yes, all right... Please... Please hurry. He hangs up. Pause.
ROB	(anything, but jubilant) He's on his way. We're supposed to wait here... to stay together...
CHAZ	What about the ferryman?
ROB	It isn't him. They've been together all day.
CHAZ	What?
KIT	I don't understand. They look at each other ominously.
ROB	I don't either. He's going to send up a flare as he's nearing the dock. Then we're to go down as a group to meet him there. In the meantime... we just wait. He goes out of the living room.
KIT	...doesn't understand. She glances at the walls for more pictures. Muffy enters suddenly, interrupting her. Kit startles, turning. They face each other.
MUFFY	It's my father's study.
KIT	I just came in to make sure everything was secure to lock the windows.
MUFFY	Good idea. Sometimes... with the tides... it can take someone all night to get here from the mainland... and even then, sometimes they don't make it...
HARVEY	(peering out the window) What's taking him so long?
KIT	(quietly; without conviction) It could be the tides.
CHAZ	Wait a minute. Aren't we supposed to be staying together? Where're Muffy and Rob?
KIT	Rob's checking the back of the house.
CHAZ	And Muffy?
NIKKI	She's been acting less than normal anyway.
KIT	(picking up on it) What do you mean?
NIKKI	You mean all day and you haven't noticed?
HARVEY	Well, who isn't?
NIKKI	...and those nurse's shoes.
CHAZ	What nurse's shoes?
NIKKI	The clodhoppers she's been wearing today... crepe soles... It's as though some common nerve of suspicion has been touched. They all stir.
HARVEY	She was arguing with Nan in the hall, before you and Rob... before you came back alone. They turn full attention on him.
HARVEY	About something Nan found in her room.
CHAZ	What?
HARVEY	Something about an abortion. They all pause.
NIKKI	I found somethin"g in my room, too She reaches into her bag and pulls out the black rubber bondage hood.
NIKKI	...only I don't think it was intended for me .
CHAZ	Oh, really?
HARVEY	(to Chaz; defending Nikki) And What did you find?
CHAZ	I didn't find anything.
HARVEY	We're supposed to believe that?
CHAZ	That's right. I spent the night with Nikki. What about you?
HARVEY	What about me?
CHAZ	What's your little secret?
HARVEY	I don't know What you're talking about.
CHAZ	Oh, come on, sport. I walked in on you last night , and you were acting like your ass was on fire...
HARVEY	It wasn't anything... Just some clippings... of some car accidents.
CHAZ	Nothing personal in that, I suppose?
HARVEY	No! Who hasn't been in a car accident? It's a common thing.
CHAZ	I haven't. There is a slight pause. Rob comes into the living room, holding a flashlight and stands just inside the doorway. The others shift uncomfortably.
NIKKI	What I'd like to know is, how did Muffy find out about these things and why -- ?
KIT	Stop it! Just stop it all of you! What is wrong with us? Nhat happened to all our talk about friendship, and undying loyalty? (looking from one to the other) Do you know what we're saying? That we're actually sitting here discussing the possibility that Muffy, a generous friend, has invited us all here to -- She stops suddenly, freezing in mid-sentence, and they all turn, following the direction of her look, to see Muffy standing in the entryway behind Rob.
MUFFY	I'm going upstairs.
ROB	Muffy? We should all stay together.
MUFFY	This is my house. I'll be in my room. She turns and heads up the stairs. Pause.
NIKKI	She's got a point. We're starting to get on each other's nerves.
HARVEY	As long as we all stay within shouting distance of each other...
NIKKI	You coming? He joins her, and they quietly head for the stairs.
ROB	I'm goinq to find the way up to the attic.
KIT	Why?
ROB	I'm sure we can watch for the Constable better from up there. Kit hesitates.
HARVEY	It's all right. I can keep watch on the stairs. Rob ho1ds out his hand to her. She takes it and they walk together toward the stairs.
CHAZ	Nikki, come on...
NIKKI	What do you mean, Nikki, come on? Don't give me any of this Nikki, come on.
CHAZ	What are you doing?
NIKKI	Look, stay if you like. Lock your door. Dig a trench. Hang out. But once I leave this place, I'm never coming back. She walks out the door, and Chaz follows her to...
CHAZ	(catching up to her) We're all supposed to stay together here.
NIKKI	Yeah, that's been real effective... She goes into...
CHAZ	So what are you going to do? Just waltz on down to the pier. By yourself. Check your bag with the porter. Then wait for an ocean liner to happen by and pick you up. Is that it?
CHAZ	What if the Constable never even comes?
NIKKI	Then I'll swim all the way back to the mainland... I can be strong if I have to.
CHAZ	Look, just relax--
NIKKI	Three people are dead and you're telling me to relax?
CHAZ	Nikki, now just hold on a minute, and look at me. Look at me. She stops and looks at him.
NIKKI	Nice image.
CHAZ	No. I mean, come on, babe. Lighten up a little, huh? He quickly slips the S&M mask over his head, clowning around. Look at this. What, me worry?
NIKKI	Very funny, Chaz.
CHAZ	You've got to look on the bright side of things. Everything'll be all right... Huh? Huh?
NIKKI	Don't be a jerk.
CHAZ	Oh. Now I'm turning you on. Right?
CHAZ	Why? I kind of like it in here. (moving blindly toward her) Kiss me, you savage she-devil.
NIKKI	Get out of here. She pushes him and he falls backward across the bed.
CHAZ	Ooooh, stop it some more. I love it when you're rough. She turns and goes out of the room again. Chaz remains lying across the bed.
CHAZ	Course it would help a little if I could breathe in here. For when things start to get really passionate. Nikki? CAMERA FRAMES the open bedroom window for a beat. The curtains luff slightly in response to a gentle breeze wafting in.
NIKKI	Real subtle, Chaz. She continues packing, moving around the room.
NIKKI	(looking at his crotch again) What is this? Show and tell? I'll show you mine if you show me yours? Well, forget it... You may as well just stick it back in your pants. Chaz?... Chaz? Say something, goddammit! She swats his hands away from his crotch. Beneath them, on his pants, is a slowly growing blood stain. Nikki gasps, her mouth contorting into a scream that will not come. She turns suddenly in response to .a NOISE O.S., and sees a DARK FIGURE stepping out from behind the slowly closing bedroom door.
KIT	No one's been up here in years. Rob crosses to the garret windows overlooking the sound.
KIT	Can you see him?
ROB	NO. There must not be a light on the boat.
KIT	Or... he's chosen not to use it.
ROB	Kit? He said something else on the phone, about Muffy.
KIT	What?
ROB	He said not to trust anybody. That's why we were to stay together. No one was to be left alone with anyone else... Then he said, especially not with Muffy.
KIT	So that's why you let her go upstairs?
ROB	That's why I let her go.
KIT	What did he mean by that?
ROB	I don't know. He wouldn't explain it.
KIT	But that's ridiculous...
ROB	Is it? He's known her longer than we have. He sweeps the flashlight back toward the stairs.
KIT	Rob, wait a minute. What's that?
ROB	Where? She takes the flashlight from him and aims it on something near the door--the Barbie and Ken dolls from the previous night's dinner.
ROB	It's just the dolls.
KIT	She's been up here.
ROB	So? She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out. As she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not just been stuck there haphazardly.
KIT	Rob? Rob comes over to join her as we CUT TO:
HER POV	of the dolls as the flashlight moves across them, slowly revealing them one by one. The last to be seen are a Barbie and the heads of two Kens stuck in a bowl of water. ROB AND KlT staring at them, frightened and astonished.
ROB	Jesus...
KIT	Rob? . . .
ROB	It's Arch and Skip and Nan.
KIT	Rob??...
ROB	Wait... He takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them splattered with bright red nail polish.
ROB	What are these other two? Suddenly the room is flooded with light. Rob turns sharply and sees outside the window the Constable's flare hanging in the night sky.
ROB	He's here! O.S. there is a PISTOL SHOT from downstairs. Kit screams.
ROB	Come on! He jumps to his feet, grabs hold of her hand and pulls her with him out of the attic.
ROB	Hal! ...while Kit runs down the hall to Nikki's room and flings open the door.
KIT	Nikki? She isn't there. Kit backs into the hallway. Downstairs O.S. she can hear Rob moving about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening. She hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps inside.
KIT	Chaz?... Nikki?... She turns on the light and sees the bed, both beds: they are drenched in blood. Kit reaches for the doorknob. It comes off in her hand.
KIT	Rob!!! She's frantically pounding on the door and trying to jam the doorknob back in, to get it to work. There's a NOISE outside the window. She turns aghast. Suddenly the door flies open.
ROB	I can't find Hal-- He stops in mid-sentence as he sees the beds. Kit is already through the door. Rob follows her out.
KIT	Rob, what about Muffy?
ROB	Forget her!
KIT	She's my friend! She breaks away from him and dashes down to Muffy's door. Rob has no choice but to follow her.
KIT	Muffy! Muffy!! She tries the door, but it's locked.
ROB	(pulling her away) Let's go. Rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs, Rob suddenly bumps into something, someone there. He screams aloud, dropping his flashlight. It is Harvey. His body dangles from the rafters high above the top of the rear stairs, a thick rope around his neck. Now Rob has become unnerved, and it is Kit's turn to take the lead.
KIT	This way! And they head back toward the main staircase.
ROB	(yanking her away) Forget the doors! Within moments they have crossed the back yard and disappeared into the brush leading down to the water.
ROB	(in guarded approach) Constable... Mr. Potter? No answer. The silence is chilling. They proceed out onto the dock. They come to the boat.
ROB	If there's another flare, we can signal him.
KIT	Maybe he went on to the house. Rob unlashes the mooring, grabbing hold of the line to pull the boat in. It won't budge, the line snagged in the water where it dips in. Rob tugs harder, freeing something to the surface.
CLOSE ANGLE	It is Constable Potter, his body turning once before sinking again under its tethered weights. An animal cries out behind them. Rob wastes no more time, pulling the rope and the boat quickly toward them. They jump in. There is a flashlight in the toolbox. Rob grabs it, shining it onto the controls. But there's no key in the ignition, and no other way to start it.
ROB	Shit... no key! Kit, meanwhile, picks up the LETTER that's lying on the bottom of the boat.
KIT	Rob! He turns. KIT (cont.) Look! She presses it into his hands. He shines the flashlight.
CLOSER ANGLE	Its waterstained, but still legible... The letterhead reads, 'STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE,' and it is dated 'MARCH 31,' addressed to Potter, and reads:
RETURN ANGLE
ROB	"...Pursuant to our previous communication, please be advised that the patient under discussion has still not been found and returned to custody, and it now believed to be attempting to return to her home in your jurisdiction. If encountered, exercise extreme caution and notify us immediately, as Miss St. John has �been a patient here for three years and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely dangerous..." Kit looks up, frantic.
KIT	Miss .St. John? What's it talking about? Muffy hasn't been in any state mental institution for the last three years -- she's been at Vassar!
ROB	I don't know... but we've gotta get this boat started.
KIT	How?
ROB	The house. Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen?
KIT	Oh, no...
ROB	We've got no choice.
KIT	I know.
ROB	Shit.
PAUSE
KIT	Rob?
ROB	Huh?
KIT	Rob, I really don't want to go back there.
ROB	I know.
KIT	Shit. Another pause. Neither one is making the move to go.
ROB	I'd have you stay here, but--
KIT	No.
ROB	Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here, I promise you. We've been through so much together... She has started to cry softly. ROB (cont.) ...it isn't going to end here.
KIT	Okay. He kisses her. Pause.
ROB	Well...
KIT	Yeah...
ROB	Let's go.
KIT	Let's go.
ROB	Let's go. Brief pause, then he turns to go.
ROB	Shit... They move slowly off the dock.
KIT	Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed. Sure enough, the doors they come out by minutes ago, the ones they didn't stop to close, are now shut tight.
ROB	Come on. They move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the house. They stop.
ROB	There. He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot space of clear lawn.
ROB	That's how we're going in. Kit swallows hard. She nods.
ROB	Are you with me? They break from their cover and run, keeping low, to the side of the house. Rob peers through the window into the darkness inside , pushes the transom all the way open, and then drags himself through on his belly.
ROB	(moving through darkness) The stairs... Where are the stairs?...
KIT	What's that? They pause, hearing DRIPPING SOUNDS in the darkness , comi ng from the depths of the utility room. Rob leads the way, cautiously, toward the sound.
REVERSE ANGLE	Kit's eyes widen in growing horrow. Rob turns the beam toward the stains that track across the floor, following them.
KIT	Rob...
KIT	Muffy's clothes...
ROB	I don't get it. The beam momentarily sweeps the wall next to Kit. She sees something.
KIT	(an urgent whisper) Rob! She gets him to turn the beam back to the wall where she is. She helps train it on what she saw.
KIT	Oh, god... oh no!... He doesn't yet understand.
KIT	...the picture of the girls in the study... the letter... what the Constable was trying to tell you... It's not Muffy it's her twin sister, Buffy! She has a twin sister! Rob's eyes have a glazed look. They are fixed somewhere else.
KIT	Rob, don't you see? Rob? She follows his look and sees, on the wall near the growth chart, that he has trained his flashlight beam on the eyeless portrait from the night before. Only now, there are REAL EYES BEHIND THE PAINTING,
KIT	Rob! He casts about for a weapon, coming up with a length of lead pipe.
ROB	Pull it away...
KIT	(too frightened to move) Rob?
ROB	Pull it away! They advance together on the painting, Rob keeping his flashlight on the eyes the entire time. Kit slowly reaces out, lifts the painting from the wall and drops it, jumping back... just as MUFFY'S HEAD rolls forward from a shelf behind the painting, right into Kit's lap! Kit screams as she bobbles the head in her hands like a hot potato, trying to get rid of it. Suddenly a loud NOISE slams at the basement window. Rob grabs Kit, covering her mouth and snapping off .the flashlight. The head falls to the. floor at their feet. They turn...
THEIR POV	...just in time to see the window they entered being nailed shut from the outside. All else they can make out are Buffy's hands and her tell-tale nurse shoes. Then these two move of sight around the outside of the house.
BASEMENT	Rob clicks on the beam in the direction they went and sees the stairs. They race to them, up them, the door to the pantry is not locked. It gives way under Rob's pressure.
ROB	The boat key... it's gotta be here... His flashlight sweeps the walls of shelves. Suddenly, Buffy is at the kitchen door. Though the door in locked, there's no bolt or chain to fully secure it. The knob RATTLES furiously under Buffy's grip, the door SHUDDERS. Rob spots a walk-in cupboard. He hurries to it. Kit gropes along the shelves, searching the objects hanging along the distant wall.
KITCHEN DOOR	A long, ugly-looking knife blade slips in through the crack in the door. Buffy is using it to try to pry open the door.
CUPBOARD	Rob opens the door. Success. His beam falls on the key board on the inner wall.
ROB	Kit... I He steps in, following his beam into the darkness. The cupboard door SLAMS shut behind him. He turns, trapped.
KITCHEN	Kit spins, crying out as she sees:
HER POV	The shadowed figure of BUFFY, barefooted, disheveled, in a smock, dagger in hand. She advances, breathing heavily.
KIT	stumbles back desperately.
KIT	No...
ROB	Kit! Let me out! Let me out of here! Kit!! He is kicking the door, hurling himself at the door, but all to no effect. He barely has room to maneuver.
ROB	Kit! Run, Kit, run!
ROB	Kit! I love you!
KIT	Buffy?... please, we didn't mean any harm... we're leaving... we just want to go home... please... please... Buffy raises the dagger in hand.
ROB	(for all he's worth) Kit! I love you! I love you, Kit! A man's HAND reaches out from the side, lightly touching Rob's shoulder. Rob jumps, turning.
ANGLE	It is Buck, standing practically right beside him, staring at Rob. His face is the same bloody, hideous mess it was the day before, after the accident. Rob screams.
BUCK	I love you too, babe. Rob swings at him, but only succeeds in smashing his knuckles against the door. Buck grabs him and violently plants a kiss on his cheek.
KIT	No... Oh, God... and Buffy strikes. The knife jabs into the door, close to Kit's head. Kit gasps, momentarily spared. She pushes apart the double doors and stumbles back into...
KIT	What.... ? Then she looks back at Buffy who steps into the living room, and smiling, holds up the knife and plunges it into her own hand. The blade is retractable.
KIT	(wrought with emotion) Oh, fuck you!! Fuck you, you guys!! Suddenly everyone in the room comes to life, roaring with laughter.
ROB	Kit! ! Still frightened and confused, Rob hasn't put it together yet. He runs out of the kitchen...
ROB	Ki--! The group laughs louder at the sight of him. Buck walks up behind Rob and claps him on the shoulder. Rob jumps and screams involuntarily. The group laughs louder still...
MUFFY	You guys are really terrific. I love you all. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such good sports.
ROB	Oh, sure. Quite welcome. Any time. He sits, or rather lands, on the sofa next to Kit. Laughter.
MUFFY	Rob, you and Kit, you two were the best. You figured it all out. The clues really worked.
ROB	What clues?
KIT	What's this all about? And don't anyone say "April Fool's" or I'll smack them in the teeth.
MUFFY	How about if I told you it was the script for a weekend special that's going to help me keep this house... Rob and Kit stare, mystified.
MUFFY	Look, next month I get the house as part of my inheritance, it's true, but only if I can show my father that it can carry itself... what with taxes and expenses. Otherwise, he'll just sell it out of the family. So, I'm planning on turning it into a country inn. Not just another stuffy old run-of-the-mill country inn, but one that specializes in offering once-in-a lifetime Whodunit Weekends. I needed a rehearsal. I had to try out the idea on somebody.
ROB	And you guys played along?
ARCH	Don't look at me!
NIKKI	We all got sucked in just as bad as you!
MUFFY	Once they were killed off, yes. Everybody had to cooperate. Otherwise, none of it would have worked!
ROB	So I guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy?
MUFFY	Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy.
NIKKI	His name? Muffy smiles, directing attention toward "cousin" Skip.
CHAZ	Skip?!
KIT	He's your brother?!
ARCH	You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too.
SKIP	Only the set-up. Muffy told me to say I was her cousin and to pull that prank on the ferry. I had no idea what was going to happen with Buck.
MUFFY	Buck Williams. make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood. Buck reaches down and tosses Arch's decapitated head to him.
BUCK	Here, catch. Arch bobbles the head nervously. The others laugh.
BUCK	Just some old props I redressed with the help of photographs Muffy sent me.
NIKKI	It sure fooled me.
ARCH	So what castle are you going to inherit?
CONSTABLE POTTER	Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance.
KIT	(to the Constable) Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either.
MUFFY	Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St. John of St. John et Freres, Wall Street. Uncle Frank smiles and waves at Kit, but Harvey steps right over to him and starts pumping his hand.
HARVEY	Hi! Harvey "Hal" Edison, Jr. Pleased to meet you, sir.
MUFFY	Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy. But this time he made an exception.
UNCLE FRANK	I haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year at Harvard. God, lowe you kids!
FERRYMAN CAL	How'd I do? I never did no acting before. Boy, was I shaking!
MUFFY	Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around here... but I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge.
NIKKI	We have been had.
ROB	You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed.
MUFFY	I almost did with Harvey. And who could know there would be a snake out in the woods with Arch? But with the paying guests, they'll know what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme.
UNCLE FRANK	Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you.
MUFFY	...And I regret that, well, some of those fake clues I planted in the bedrooms I guess were taken too seriously. I'm sorry about that. She avoids looking at Nan so as not to draw attention to her. MUFFY (cont.) But we had fun, didn't we? I mean, come on. She starts passing .out chilled champagne bottles to the men to open, and setting up glasses on a sideboard. MUFFY (cont.) I know I'll never forget this weekend for as long as I live.
ARCH	You're telling me. Man, when I was swinging around out there in the woods, I nearly crapped my pants.
CAL	What do you mean, nearly? I was there, remember? Silence. Arch turns red.
CHAZ	Arch? You browned your trousers?
ARCH	Well... I...
UNCLE FRANK	It's all right, Arch. They'll be out of the dryer soon. Suddenly everyone roars with laughter. Champagne corks start popping, and before you know it, the scene is resembling the locker room of the winning team of a championship series.
ARCH	Great ham.
BUCK	Great eggs.
CHAZ	Just what we need. Another country inn.
UNCLE FRANK	Well, if the food's any indication, it's already half-way there.
SKIP	Pass the toxic wastes, please. Uncle Frank frowns at Skip as Cal enters.
CAL	The St. John Island Bar Harbor ferry leaves in thirty minutes. No stragglers, please.
ROB	Boy, what a difference being alive makes.
KIT	I don't care what Columbia says about you.
ROB	I do.
KIT	Is this the road to med school?
ROB	I think it is. I'm going to try. He takes her by the hand and gazes at her.
ROB	But if I make it or not, no matter what happens, we'll be together? You and me?
KIT	If that's what you want.
ROB	That's what I want. Muffy enters with a stack of dishes, followed by Nan who quietly sets her plate on the counter and leaves.
MUFFY	Where's Nikki?
KIT	I don't know. Too much champagne? o.s. they hear a muffled cry.
NIKKI	God... don't tell me that was something you learned on the farm!
UNCLE FRANK	I'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's signing. I'm so proud of you. I wish I could say the same about your brother.
MUFFY	Oh, Uncle Frank, he's been a great help this weekend, really. Let me get him out here so you can--
UNCLE FRANK	I've already spoken with him. The screen door opens, and Rob steps out onto the porch. He comes over to them, but does not butt into their conversation, and Uncle Frank just keeps going as if Rob weren't even there. UNCLE FRANK (cont.) His conduct and his academic performance remain inexcusable. He knows your father can't be expected to entrust him with anything until he shows some signs of responsibility and initiative.
ROB	(embarrassed to be overhearing) Excuse me. He turns and walks back into the house. O.S. a horn honking.
UNCLE FRANK	Come on! Let's go! Cal is alone behind the wheel of the pickup. Skip walks casually up to the van, then pointedly turns away and heads over to the pickup instead. Uncle Frank scowls.
KIT	Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks. See you back there.
UNCLE FRANK	Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune. Nikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey. They say their quick farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles. Harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her. He knows. Finally Nan comes out of the house. With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on toward the van when...
MUFFY	Nan! She hurries to catch up with her.
MUFFY	Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended.
NAN	And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is done. I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false. So I'll just say goodbye. (beat; an afterthought) Thanks for showing me your house. She turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard. The others callout their last goodbyes. Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy turns and walks forlornly back into her house.
UNCLE FRANK	Cal, I want to thank you personally. You've been a real sport about this.
CAL	Aw, it was fun.
UNCLE FRANK	I know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids. And I'm sure we could make a deal with you. I know you haven't been spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this time it just isn't in the cards.
CAL	It's still in the family.
UNCLE FRANK	Yes, that's the way. He moves on. Others are passing them now. Chaz stops and wags his finger at Cal.
CHAZ	This time, no funny business.
CHAZ	Feeling better?
NIKKI	I'm okay now, thanks. Pause.
NIKKI	Chaz, I'm sorry.
CHAZ	Why? What do we mean to each other anyway?
NIKKI	More than this a couple of days ago.
CHAZ	A couple of days ago... A couple of days ago I was a great, young, budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art. Today I'm just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as much idea as where he's going as... as... He gives up.
NIKKI	Don't be down.
CHAZ	Sure. Pause.
NIKKI	I'll tell you what I've learned from all this. I'm tired of having one fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a boyfriend. Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend? He looks at her, slowly softening. Yes, he will. Rob turns away from Skip now, steps over and surveys the quiet group.
ROB	Some party, huh?
ARCH	You know what I think's weird?... how, when we thought 'Buck here got hurt because of Skip's prank, and when things started happening and we thought maybe some of us were getting killed, how we all just kind of naturally accepted the fact that it was 'oh , yeah, sure, because of the prank.'
SKIP	What're you talking about?
ARCH	Well, it's like pranks really piss people off. It unleashes things, you know? Makes any kind of behavior possible, and we accept it.
NIKKI	When anything g.oes, everything goes.
CHAZ	Yeah.
ROB	What really amazes me is how easy we made it for her. Everyone was just out for himself. We could've stopped Muffy cold if we'd only stuck together, if we'd only worked like a team.
CHAZ	Yeah, she really got us good.
SKIP	Well, I know what I'd do, if I wasn't her brother...
NIKKI	(almost without thinking) Go back and give her a taste of her own medicine, that's what we should do. Nikki steps. Leeks up, hearing herself. Skip returns the stare.
SKIP	(shrugs, smiling) Did I say anything? The others look at each other, a beat, registering.
ARCH	Hey...
CHAZ	Go back and scare the shit outta her for a change? Outrageous!
NIKKI	She sure wouldn't be expecting it...!
HARVEY	Well, I don't know. I got a stack o' books this high...
ROB	(stepping into the fray) Harvey's right. (to them all) Look, what're you talking about? We've had our fun. Now we got work to do.
ARCH	Yeah. Enough's enough. At least for me anyway.
CHAZ	Pussies.
KIT	Well, I kinda like the idea -- and I don't have work to get back to. She squares her shoulders.
ROB	(looks up, in surprise) Kit...
KIT
(DECIDEDLYL	Muffy can dish it out. It might be interesting to see if she can take it.
CHAZ	All right! A real catfight!
ROB	(open-mouthed at her) I don't believe you...
KIT	Just because you've decided to get serious about your life, doesn't mean the rest of us can't have our fun
NIKKI	(whoops, turning) Buck, got any spare professional tricks you could throw our way! Buck looks up, confused, only now plugging in.
KIT	So how many does that make us?
SKIP	Much as I'd like to...
NAN	No, I don't think so, thank you. Nikki continues count. Rob makes it easy for her.
ROB	Four. He meets Kit's stare squarely, giving her time to change her mind. But Kit smiles back, victorious.
CHAZ	(one of the four) Outasight!
KIT	Cal, we want to get back to the island.
FERRYMAN	Now? You just left
KIT	I know.
FERRYMAN
[PONDERING)	...Well, not in this... ...but you might find something around after we dock.
MUFFY	H'lo?
SKIP	Hi, it's me. Surprise.
MUFFY	(grumpily, stirring) What'd you forget now?
SKIP	Nothing. Just calling to tell you the party's not over. She moans.
MUFFY	I know. The clean-up's going to take Clara and me at least a week.
SKIP	No, I mean, some of the gang's planning on coming back to give you some of your own medicine.
CU MUFFY	Coming awake.
MUFFY	You're kidding.
SKIP	Does a bear shit in the woods?
MUFFY	Those bastards...
SKIP	Hey, they're your friends.
MUFFY	Which ones?
SKIP	That wouldn't be very sporting if I told you, would it?
MUFFY	Skip...
SKIP	Rob and Kit and Nikki and Chaz.
MUFFY	Figures... Thanks.
SKIP	Well, Uncle Frank told me about his recommendations. So, I didn't want you to think there were any hard feelings.
MUFFY	Oh, Skip, you dope. You know Daddy'll come around just as soon as you decide to buckle down.
SKIP	Yeah... Anyway, don't let the bastards eat you up.
MUFFY	I'll try not to act too surprised when they arrive.
SKIP	I love you, Sis.
MUFFY	You too, goofball. Skip hangs up.
SKIP	I beg your pardon? ANGLE WIDENS to include Arch, who has been standing beside Skip the entire time.
ARCH	It was even your idea.
SKIP	A petty consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
ARCH	Bullshit. St. John blood is thicker than water, that's what you mean.
SKIP	Don't you know? Old money sticks together. Arch goes to his car and drives away. At some distance, Harvey is �chasing down Uncle Frank as the latter closes in on his Mercedes sedan.
HARVEY	Well, can I look you up in a couple of months? Maybe you could arrange a job interview for me.
UNCLE FRANK	Sure, sure . (reaches into his pocket) Here's my card.
HARVEY	Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. I sure appreciate it, and it's been a real pleasure meeting you. But Uncle Frank is already in the car and starting it up. Harvey looks down at the card.
HARVEY	Hey, wait a minute! There's no phone number here! No address! No nothing! Too late. Uncle Frank is driving away. He speeds past Skip who is walking down the road further along. He doesn't even stop for his own nephew. Harvey kicks the dirt angrily. O.S. behind him a horn toots. Harvey turns and scowls at Nan, who would like to get past. He steps aside, and she peels away but she stops for Skip. They exchange a few words. Then he climbs into the front seat beside her, and she drives off. Now Harvey is alone. He looks around for a beat, then tosses the card away and moves toward his car.
CHAZ	What the fuck was he talking about anyway? We might find something around after we dock? They walk out onto a private peer and eye the boats moored there.
ROB	What the fuck do you think he was talking about?
CHAZ	Oh.
CHAZ	Well, now we've been identified.
ROB	Swell.
CHAZ	It's getting late.
ROB	What a great idea this was. They round a bend and stop dead.
THEIR POV	In the distance, Kit and Nikki are climbing into a boat. Nikki sees them and waves.
NIKKI
(CALLING}	We got one! Rob and Chaz.
ROB	I thought we looked there an hour ago.
CHAZ	Who cares? Let's get this show on the road! He starts running to the boat. Rob reluctantly follows.
CHAZ	(calling back to them) Did you find a key? How're we going to get the motor started?
NIKKI	Muffy, hi! Surprise!
MUFFY	Nikki, what on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong?
NIKKI	No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you.
MUFFY	Oh, great. Where is Chaz? Nikki is already moving into the living room.
NIKKI	Putting the boat up in the old boathouse. He'll be up in a minute.
NIKKI	I wonder what's keeping Chaz? He should have been up here by now.
MUFFY	Maybe he stopped to shit in the woods. You know Chaz.
NIKKI	Still... I'm beginning to not like this.
MUFFY	By the way, where did you get the boat to come back here?
NIKKI	The boat? Oh, Cal gave us one.
MUFFY	I see.
NIKKI	Listen, I need a drink of water. You just stay here. I can get it myself. She walks out of the living room. Muffy looks after her and smiles to herself.
MUFFY	What about your water?
NIKKL	Oh', uh, I drank 'it in there. Listen. Muffy , I'm really getting worried about Chaz. I think we should go out and see what's happened.
MUFFY	That's okay. You go. I'll wait here.
NIKKI	No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last night. Please come with me.
MUFFY	I'm sure Chaz is fine. I'll stay here by the phone just in case. It's safer this way. Do you want a flashlight?
NIKKI	No, that's okay. I'll be fine. She strides out of the living room.
NIKKI	Shit.
NIKKI	Fuck! She comes up sputtering to the surface of a small forest pool she has fallen into.
NIKKI	Fuck!! Who dug the goddamn swimming pool?!? She drags herself out. KIT (o.s.) Nikki?
NIKKI	Yeah! She walks, dripping wet, into a clearing nearby where Kit it making Chaz up to look bloody and gruesome.
CHAZ	She wouldn't come out? Doesn't she care about me? No one answers him. CHAZ (cont.) How do I look?
NIKKI	A lot goddamn, fucking better than I do!
NIKKI	...he's hurt! Oh, Godl! She stops suddenly. Muffy isn't here. Frustrated, Nikki runs back into...
NIKKI	Muffy!! She dashes into...
NIKKI	Muff--!!! ...and stops short. Muffy is lying face down in a pool of blood. Her throat's been cut. The useless phone receiver is clutched in her hand (making that constant phone company noise that lets you know the phone is off the hook).
NIKKI	Muffy? Her throat gags a couple of times, as if she is about to be sick. She turns and flies out of the room. O.S. the front door slams shut behind her. Chaz!! Chaz!! She runs into another clearing (the CAMERA has been here waiting for her) where Chaz is revealed lying on the ground, looking much more hideous than Muffy.
NIKKI	Chaz, get up! �Hurry, Chaz!... come on! He doesn't move.
NIKKI	Chaz, stop playing around! Get up!! She starts kicking him in the side.
NIKKI	Chaz! Chaz doesn't stir, but he does speak now without moving his lips.
CHAZ	(hissing, pretending to be dead) Will you quit kicking me? It hurts.
NIKKI	It's supposed to hurt! The game's over! Get up!
CHAZ	(still not moving) No. I'm dead. You're blowing the whole thing. Where's Muffy?
NIKKI	Muffy IS dead!!! In the house!!! Oh, God...
CHAZ	(sitting up suddenly) What?
NIKKI	(turning to the woods) Kit! Kit, come out! There is rustling O.S., then Kit starts to emerge.
KIT	What's going on?
NIKKI	She's gone! Nothing left, but the pool of blood and a thin trail of smeared drying blood to indicate that she's been dragged away.
KIT	What?...
CHAZ	Look, she's been dragged away.
NIKKI	Chaz! somebody's still in this house!
CHAZ	We could follow the trail.
KIT	Oh, no... what about Rob? Rob!! She races out of the study.
KIT	Rob...? They run over to him.
KIT	(dropping to her knees) Rob? Rob?? (shaking him: wailing) Rob!!! (dissolving into tears) It was only a game!
CHAZ	What the fuck is going on here?!
NIKKI	Chaz, look! Clutched in Rob's lifeless hand is a leather bookmark we may have noticed before. Chaz slips it out from beneath his fingers.
CHAZ	This was Nan's...
NIKKI	Nan... Suddenly there is a loud KNOCK beneath them O.S. They all look up. Someone is coming slowly up the stairs, the loud footsteps O.S.that could only be made by a heavy boot, thundering closer... and closer... Kit and Nikki and Chaz huddle around Rob's body and await their approaching doom. Suddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs. A hand with a knife is raised. �Nikki screams. Chaz spies a lamp on the floor. He turns it on...
NIKKI	Muffy! Muffy walks into the room , lowering the knife.
MUFFY	Good job, you guys. I'm really scared. The fun's over, Rob.
KIT	(tears in her eyes) Muffy, he's dead!
NIKKI	Somebody else is here! In this house!
MUFFY	Sure. Sure. Let's see if the dead are ticklish, shall we?
KIT	(pulling her away; screaming) Don't you touch him!!
MUFFY	Okay, okay, take it easy.
NIKKI	Muffy, it's not a game anymore! Just then there is a loud CRASH o.s. of glass breaking down on the first floor. After the slightest pause there is another crash o.s., and another... Someone is smashing in all the bay windows along the back porch. Nikki screams.
MUFFY	What the--? And she runs back down the attic stairs, followed quickly by the others.
KIT	Muffy! Stop him! Help! He's killing me! Oh, God! He's killing me! Muffy, initially paralyzed with fear, now runs for her life, down the hallway, down the stairs...
SKIP	It's all over, Muffy! Everything'll be mine!
MUFFY	Skip! No! ! ! He makes a move to slit her throat, when Muffy kicks open the swinging door and sees...
HER POV	...standing on the other side, smiling, in various states of fake blood and mess... Rob, Kit, Nikki, Chaz and Nan. Muffy's eyes pop out. Skip's hands relax. And the others burst out laughing.
