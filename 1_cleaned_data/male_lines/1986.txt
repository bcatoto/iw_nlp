Well, thanks, I -- In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska. Ripley... PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES! See you soon. I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid. I'll go. I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point. I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours. The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers. About equal to ten megatons. That's it. See it? Emergency venting. Hard to say. It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves. That's if she exists, of course. Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others. A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all. It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society. That is the question of the hour. We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs. Yes. That follows. I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon.I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this. Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right? And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in. Then no exclusive rights, nothing. Now, wait a second -- You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it. Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life. Corporal Hicks!? Don't make me pull rank, Ripley. This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them -- Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments. Let's move cautiously. First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it -- Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action. She's right. Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built... Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so, all over the planet. They're completely automated. We manufacture them, by the way. I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you. Well, it didn't occur to me. It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board. That's the plan. My word on it. Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi... Yes, and I've read it. You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over... If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo. And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it. You gotta get back on the horse... What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract? Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing? I heard you were working in the cargo docks. Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights. We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.' Hear me out... You are a head case. Have a donut. You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo. Just tell them what happened. The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional. Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there. You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys... Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't licked that one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children. Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age: sixty-six ...at time of death. Two years ago. I'm sorry. Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest... You'd drifted right through the core systems. It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right? We're talking thermonuclear explosion. What's he scanning for? It's insured. Still nothing from the colony? These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant? Look, we don't know what's going on out there. It may just be a down transmitter. But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor. That's all.Fuckin' A! Well you're not reading it right! Let's get these things lit. The corner! Ready? I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand. We got problems. Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose. Are you finished? You okay? Not that tunnel, the other one! Save it. Don't be long, Ellen. We ain't going anywhere. All right! She's alive. I believe it. But we gotta get moving! Now! Stand back. We didn't miss anything. It's game time. Let's waste him. No offense. Wait a minute. We'd know about it. Yeah. I've noticed. Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that. If it comes to that, I'll do us both. Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine. Maybe. Maybe not. Newt time then can walk right up and knock. Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out. They're in the approach corridor. We gotta figure on them getting into the complex. About seventeen days. Poor bastard.Not yet. Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place. We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can. Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey? For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later. You're all through with this now? Who knows you have these? Is Sandy part of this? Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved? Okay? Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift. Jeffrey! Come on in. It's blue. Blue velvet. Blue. It's Blue Velvet. I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance. Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you. Yes. The criminals are winning. Okay. If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures. Jeffrey? And it's horrible too. I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand. I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business. Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy. Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more. But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't. Come into the study a minute. Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way. By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it? Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it. You did? A human ear? Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he? Yes.We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch. You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens. We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it. I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it. Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go. Oh yeah? Have you seen any? Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house? Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on? No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry. Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed. Yeah. How's Dad? I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have. Oh my God. Is her son OK? Does Dorothy know her husband is dead? Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment. Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!! Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom. Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!! Yes sir. Yes sir. I sure am. Only you and the photo lab. No, not at all. I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and... ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this. Yeah. Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you. What color is it? What is this? What color is it? Yeah. I get it. Why do you do it? I guess you've seen some bad things. Is that why you say it's horrible? Anything you can tell me? These are beautiful. How's the case coming? Yes? It must be great. I understand. I'm just real curious like you said. Excuse me, Mrs. Williams. Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did. Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store? Are you Detective Williams? I promise, Dorothy. I promise. Don? Where is he? Who, Dorothy? It's okay. It's okay. Yeah, it's me. Oh no. You look beautiful to me. What? I'll call you. I think I better go. I guess I should go. No. Not really. But also because I really want you to be alright. Yes. You called me Jeffrey. Dorothy. No! I'm glad you do. There's no disease, I can tell you. You what? I didn't mean to hurt you. No, it's not Don. Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! Sometimes I think I do. Do you love me? Look, snap out of it, will ya? Come on Dorothy. Shut up. Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone. That wouldn't be too good, would it? Yes. No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you. Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police. What do you want? Whatiya mean? I'm doing it. Sure I do. That's good. I sure don't hate you. Frank is coming? I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy. Hello. No. I should go. Yes. I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK? No. But you're in very big trouble. Who is Don? No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble? No. Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble? There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it. Nice guy. Who's he? Frank? Can you stand up? Same here. That's not crazy. I like you too. I, uh. Hi, can I come in? OK. Don't say that. Then don't talk about killing. Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. No. What is happening? No. Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!! What was it? What? Yes, I like you. No, please. I won't. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's okay. It's okay. No. I'll go then. Nothing. Are you alright? No. Yes. I, I don't know. Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave. No. Come on. Never before this. Then you got undressed. Well. You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed. I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. Nobody. I wanted to see you. Jeffrey nothing. Jeffrey. That oughta do it. Nope, it's new stuff. No smell. Pest control, gotta do your apartment. Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there? Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me? He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue. Yes. Nothing. What? Here's to Ben. Heineken. On a ride. I don't want to go. No thanks. Hello? Nothing. I'm fine. God, you scared me. Can I use the car tonight? No, I'm just gonna walk around. I'm going out for awhile. Thanks a lot, Mom. What? Yeah? Well. Okay. What time are visiting hours? Be right down. This is it. Mom. For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term. Sandy?... Sandy, please. Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes? That sounds great! Say "goodnight" to Sandy. Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake. Yeah. Yeah. okay. No. No thank you. Yeah, I know. Alright. I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go. Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in? Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed. Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much. No, you're right. Well. No. Good deal Dad. How ya doin' Dad? It's good to see you, Dad. Are you feeling okay? Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good. Hi Dad. Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here. Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me. Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now. Sandy? I should go with her, Sandy. Shhh. I'll tell you. Okay. Let's get her over to your father's. No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house? Yes. Dorothy!... Dorothy! Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you. My father has a gun at home. Frank!!! You want to dance? Let's wait for some slow one. Really. You want to dance with someone else? I can't dance fast. I like that idea, that's a real good idea. You look beautiful. I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime. Where to? Nothing, really! It's good to see you. Just some fatherly advice. Okay. Okay. Great! No. Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on? Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before. Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble. You worry about me really? Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much. I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret. Yeah. Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove? That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today? You want to go talk to him? I'm really sorry. See ya tomorrow. Okay, okay. Can I give you a kiss good night? Okay, Sandy. I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay? I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera. Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl. Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world? That's what I thought. That doesn't bother you, does it? Yeah. I mean a little, you know. Yes. Actually. I've been in twice. I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man. No way. I'm about to blow up. I'm sorry, I didn't... What's with Mike? Well. Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean? Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved. That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay? Okay, thanks. Are you sure? Yeah. Look, it can wait till Sunday. Oh, okay, can I call? I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went. Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit. Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay? It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car? Why not? Here's to. An interesting experience. Two. Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there. First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment. Okay. You better get out before someone sees us. Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good? First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings. I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder. Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that. You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight? Pretty clever. Are you game for more? Yeah. I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh? Yes and no. Did you recognize him? Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened? Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner. Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name? Let's go. Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright? Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think? Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window. Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later. Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan? There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe. I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon. I don't want to cause any trouble. I'd like to talk to you about something. You hungry or thirsty, or both? Yeah. Good bye. I guess I'll see you sometime. Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you. I don't know. He moved away. It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father. I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world. I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice. You really do hear a lot, don't you? Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything? Did they find out anything when they questioned her? Where are they? I guess you have to get back home soon? It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in? The ear is from a missing person maybe? Were all these people questioned this afternoon? Do you know who was brought in for questioning? Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything? What do you know about the ear? Anything? I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital. What else is new? Right? How is Central these days? No. You're not bothering me. You a senior? Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something. Oh yeah? Yeah, how did you know?Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better. Good to see you, son. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Hey Jeff.Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you. He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby. Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs. He's comin' back? What for? Bull. Frank gone?Thank you. I don't believe in luck. What is it? I don't care. I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void. Die in what sense? I think it's the food of the future. I collect spores, molds and fungus. Is that a game? Print is dead. On Earth -- no. But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna. I couldn't do that. You might hurt someone. They're not guns. They're particle throwers. When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly? The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ... Were you recently in the bathroom? Life is just a state of mind. No! Them! Shoot them! Cross the beams. Full-stream with strogon pulse. You talked to Gozer? Who? Yes. After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive. And he wasn't alone. He had close to a thousand followers when he died. They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world. Of course! Ivo Shandor, I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE. He started a secret society in 1920. Oh, shit! He wants to shut down the storage grid. All right, Peter. Good night. All right. I'll try. I agree. Some. I just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now. Venkman? Are you there? Does she want to be? What is it? It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension. Trust me. It will be bad. Don't cross the beams. Wait! Wait! There's something I forgot to tell you. Something was definitely here. Did you see anything? She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is. Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000. I'm always serious. Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here. Oh! You're here. That appears to be the case. And look at this, Peter Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores. The storage facility blew. This one ... ... shut off the protection grid. I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there. And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom. I've got to sleep. Neutronize. System shut. Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now. Ray! Where are you? Are you all right? We'd better adjust our streams. I blame myself. Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious. And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.Yes, sir. Don't worry. We handle this kind of thing all the time. Did you ever report it to anyone? Has this ever happened before? You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out? Look at the structure of the roof cap. It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies. What happened??!!!? I need two new purge valves. How's the grid around the storage facility holding up? Set entry grid. It's working! God, it's ugly! Sorry, Buddy! I just realized something. We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment. You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present. The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man! He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid. We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda! Look! I couldn't help it! It just popped in there! Forget the trapping! Just blast him! As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension. I don't think it's Shandor. He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor. No! Nobody ever built them like this! The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius. The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy. It's not good, Pete. Boy, that was a rough one. I don't know. I'm just guessing. Don't move. It won't hurt you. Sit tight. I'm on my way. Where are you, Pete? All right. Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them. I'm getting high readings near the air vents. It must be using the duct system to get around. See, I told you we'd get something. No sense worrying about it now. They will. How was your date? Why don't I check out the building? It may have a history of psychic turbulence. Fourteen hundred. Everybody can relax. I found the car. How do you like it? Wow! Does this pole still work? But most people are afraid to even report these things. But at nineteen percent interest! You didn't even bargain with the guy. My parents left me that house, I was born there. For what purpose? Do you know what a patent clerk makes? I liked the University. They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything! I've worked in the private sector. They expect results. You've never been out of college. You don't know what it's like out there. This is like a major disgrace. Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod. You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting. If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment. I guess I got a little overexcited. Wasn't it incredible! I'm telling you, this is a first. You know what this could mean to the University? Okay. Okay. I got it. I know what to do. Stay close. I have a plan. Anything! Just make contact. I don't know. Talk to it. I told you it's real. What is it? Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once. What do you mean by "seen?" Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years. The graph we came up with definitely points to something big. No, this one's for real, Peter. Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale. Buried the needle. We're close this time. I can feel it. Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition. It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away. Scared the socks off some poor librarian. What do you mean "choose?" We don't understand. LATER, MAN!! You don't have to worry about that with us, sir. Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world. Judgement Day ... And the seas would boil ... The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy. No. But I liked Jesus' style. Boy! Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325. Mmmhmmm. Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual. Very impressive resume. Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.I was just going to say "eight." You're fantastic! Okay. Just give me a second here. I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me. Definitely. I think you may be a very gifted telepath. Well, I guess some people have it and some don't. Well, you're doing great. Keep it up. Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you? Ready? What is it? It is a star! That's great. You're very good. This is going to cost you, you know. Our fees are ridiculously high. Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work. Nothing! We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen. Whoa!! Nice voice. Right ... You're the Gatekeeper. But I want Dana. Dana, speak to me ... I don't know. You've got two people in there already. It could get a little crowded. I want you to close your eyes and relax. Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer. Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule. Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you. Really? Can't wait to meet him. As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom. Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something? Hey, Dana. What is it? What happened? I'll pick you up at your place. I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat. You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients? I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser. I'm checking on that. I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it. "Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion. One of their gods. Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say? I'll cancel the reservation, I found the name "Zuul" in ... The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects. I don't suppose you've read it. Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant. Is he dying or something? Who's the stiff? I don't have to take abuse from you. I have other people dying to give it to me. You're the best one in your row. Great rehearsal. No kiss? Okay. Then I'll go. Okay, okay. But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me. Don't scream. I want to help you. On a purely scientific basis. I think I should spend the night here. I'm a qualified psychologist. I've got a degree and everything. I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it. If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy. There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings. Yeah, yeah. Damn! I know. It happened by itself. You're quite a housekeeper. Well, let's check it out. Nothing. Is that the kitchen? That's too bad. Thanks. What's in there? No? What do I act like? Yeah, but it's got a great cello break. I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto. You play the cello! It's my favorite instrument. Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over? Spengler, see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature. I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment. It's in the stars. Some people like the attention. Some people are just crazy. So what do you think it was? We're all professionals here, Miss ... Hello. I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you? I see. But why? The students love us! This is preposterous! I demand an explanation. I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus. We'll get back to you. Back off, man! I'm a scientist! One thing at a time. We don't even know what it is yet. Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz. Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry. The EPA? What's he want? Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job. She paid with a Visa card. Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it. Hold all my calls, Janine. ... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions. Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ... The man is a psychopath, Your Honor. You turned off the power! Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back. A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie. At ease, Officers. I'm Peter Venkman. I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can. Hey! Make yourself useful! Go save a tree! Go ahead! Get a court order. Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution. Why do you want to see it? The magic word is "please." Because you didn't say the magic word. No, you may not. Yes, it would. In a storage facility. I'm not at liberty to say. You could say that. I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology. Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman. Great! How's it going? Can I help you? Then my theory was correct. I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability. You volunteered, didn't you? Aren't we paying you for this? Sorry. This isn't your day. Well, just 75 more to go. What's this one? Nervous? Close -- but definitely wrong. Good guess -- but no. All right. What is it? But it's my favorite state. No! You said crossing the beams would be BAD. It'll kill her! And us! On the count of three! One ... Two ... What now? Get a grip on yourself, Egon. I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor. Gozer. She said he was "the Destructor." Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers. Where's the Keymaster? If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences. I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning. You have to keep him there. Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave, He could be very dangerous. Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point. I don't think so. It's more of that Gozer thing. She says she's the Gatekeeper. Does that make any sense to you? I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed. It's Peter, Egon. I've got a problem. What do you mean "bad?" Why not? What? Yeah, I can smell it. Didn't see anything, Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost. I'm starting to worry. You said your graph was pointing to something big. You told me things were going to start popping. Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. What do you think, Egon? Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations. The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams. Wow! Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost? Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head. Do you remember that? What have you got, Egon? Great! The marshmallows are about to get their revenge. AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT? What? What popped in there? Agile bastard, isn't he? Well, that ought to do it. It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any. Who was the architect? I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh? Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up? I can't take much more of this. The pace is killing me. How do you know? It's here, Ray. It's looking at me. Well, hurry up. The needle's going wild. Third floor. Get down here, Ray -- Something's here. So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy. Sure. Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back. No problem. So do I. Do you know when that might be? We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem. It wasn't a date. It was an investigation. Good idea. Were any other words spoken that you remember? Do you think it's wide enough? How much? This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think? We're trying to keep our costs down. You know how it is when you're starting a new company. Maybe. But no one ever advertised before. You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days. You'll never regret this, Ray. To go into business for ourselves. Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason. Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever. I think we were destined to get kicked out of there. You're always so worried about your reputation. We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress. Ray, I apologize. I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced. They did this to Galileo, too. Yeah, but I introduced you guys. You never would've met if not for me. That's got to be worth something. If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize. Oh, yeah. This could be bigger than the microchip. They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us. We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady. "Get her?" That was your whole plan? You call that science? Hey, Lady? Lady! Can you talk? Who are you? This is not working. Think of something else. What do I say? What do we do now? It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly. Uh-huh. I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler. Looked at with your eyes. Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff. You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience. And what have you seen? Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens. Excuse me for a minute. Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here. Can you come back in about an hour?Stop! Stop. Be quiet. You'll not be bringing the church into this. What are you doing man? I'll be back when I can. That is not me. Of course. I am not ready for this. And you? But why be so concerned about me? I feel hardly nothing. I do not think I like the sound of that. What is the fascinatioon? It is only a leaf. You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez. We're raised as riders. If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed. And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt? It's like to kill me first. Impotent cow. Go to hell. Me arm hurts. Why? How can I stop such a man? But we cannot be killed. Aye. Why does he want to kill me? Oh my God. Oh my God I'm lost. Then they were right. I am evil. This is God's punishment. What is to become of me? Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost? This is monstrous. I'll burn in hell for all eternity. This can't be. No! This is madness! No! What? I'm twenty-two. I don't understand. He told me there could be only one. I don't know why. It is less. Yes. Always. You are the same? You know me home. Me name. You're a long way from Inverness. Why are you here? Pheasant. How can you know this? I was driven out. Aye. I did at that. I was nearly killed. Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member. I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here. You're not from these parts. Aye. Afternoon. If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you. You're not talking sense, Mara! I'll not take that kind of talk from you. From those others below, maybe. But not from you. You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins. That's mad. Surely you don't take their word? Who? So why the crazy talk? It's a miracle it is. Saint Andrew has smiled on me. On us. But I did live. What are you saying? I'm standing here as real as you. I don't understand. Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing. I'm your future husband, remember? Do you have cause to bothering us? Far away. Like you. What would you like?He's a MacLeod. Aye. It is his duty. All of ours. Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke. Ah, Conor, how you look a man.Don't be stupid, lady. Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's. I have witnesses that can put the two of you together. What were you doing in Felton? Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house. There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet. I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year. I want Taupin. But we might just give it the 'ole college try. What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that. You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill. Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew. In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder. But there's more. Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware. Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin. All fashionably without heads. What are you going to tell them? That you're protecting a man who's killed four people? You and I should talk first. Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town. And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons. I've got a morgue filling up with bodies. That's my right. A murder. No. I want this to be all ours. Round up who you can and put them on standby. Are you sure? Should have seen him the first night. Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink. Any other I.D.s come up? Yeah. I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff. All I need is time. Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea. A neighbor saw your car leave. Where were you Tuesday night? For the moment. It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood. A claymore to be exact. You wouldn't know anything about it would you? Do you know what this is? You're wrong. What were _you_ looking for? Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street. Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night? Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way. He'd also been in the country less than a week. What is your citizenship? He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week. His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory. Did you know the victim? Mr.- Taupin, what were you doing in that alley? This your present address?Just your pappy scared some. Yes sir. When you get older your priorities change. It's the simple things that count. Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing. Such a pretty day. If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this. Mind you I'm 74 now. Morning Mr. North I'll send them right up. The resemblance is amazing. Sure take after him. Never seen a father and son look more alike. You're one of William's kids, huh? Oh yes, more than enough. When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.Go ahead, Senor. I have my friend to keep me company. With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one. You are young, inexperienced. You do not know what time can do. How it can sap all pity, all love. You must be. You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules. You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you. You will always know when you are in the presence of another. Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time. In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat. People will become a transitory, pathetic lot. The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent. But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all. That is how the others exist. Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last. Keep your soul sewed to the earth. Do not become one of them. I am a small player. But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something. This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal. Some, like you and he, have more. Much more. You have not been fully trained. But you will learn. And you will be good, I can feel that. You have apt- itude. This is why our friend is so concerned. It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds. But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength. The strength of _knowledge_. The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be. As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes. To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing. All living things pay dues, Conor. They must be respected for that. Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod. The Fabric of life. The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another. You have a gift. One you must protect. It will take less effort as you learn. Muy Bien! Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm. Harder! You swing like an impotent cow! Again. Try again. Harder. Concentrate harder. We are brothers. And you are a defense- -of sorts. Hide. Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn. You must learn to defend yourself. In this I can help. There is an imperfection. For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat. Then it is over. The end. It is always less with my living. Far or near. But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before. There is power in this. And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all. You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less? You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod. You will live. Survive. You'd have to die first. Aqui. You are not dead, boy. Accept it. Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate. It is the truth. Listen to me. Hear the words. It is as you are. We are immortal. Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed. Not even a single lifetime. You are still so very young. Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game. You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us. You know this, you can feel it. We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure, permanently. We are brothers. You feel you know me. Does it change with me in the room? Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you? When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me. All thought I would die or be maimed for life. But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different. It was time for our paths to cross. In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth. I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal. You Scots have a way with game. It still has life in it. Spirit. Back home the food is so...domestic. Hmm, que rico. What is it you call this? First food, no? A good meal makes conversation so much easier. And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew. I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation. And a solution. And but for a mark you are well as any man, no? But you lived. Your marks would suggest great injury. Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle? Please go to no trouble. I am from Spain. And I would like a moment of your time. Juan Cid Romirez. Chief surveyor and alchemist. Your name is Conor?It will be horrible. The future. I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing. Nothing but a moment. Maybe two. But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime? Life is only life when it is bounded by death. The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric. The inside. I love you Brenna. Life. It is the gift and the under- standing of life. Not power. Not control. The emptyness. The years and years of void. Nothingness. Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed? I'll destroy you. I've destroyed everything I've ever touched! Oh God... Get out. I'm the last. Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_! I can't stand it. Oh God, I can't stand it! Be careful. Don't stay any longer than you have to. Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most. You should be back by nightfall. All of it finished. It's all the same. Half lives that never go away. Empty. And fear. Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you. It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both. Come here, Brenna. I haven't killed _you_. There are differences. Sometimes innocents become involved. Not the same. I didn't kill the watchman. Perhaps. There is something more. An inheritance. Sometimes I think it's just for something to do. A conquest to be the last. Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away. Some- thing to replace the love that can never work. He is older than I. Yes. I carried that rifle in World War I. This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria. The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College. Class of 1672. It goes on. That would be difficult to explain. You are a very perceptive young woman. Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer. I see. Why are you here? You won't. A factor of age. At least. No. Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to. When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son. Yes. Yes. Follow me. A little dusty. Here, try this. I suppose they're still making women the same as back then. Maybe it would do us both good. They do it each year. Yes. It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg. I wish I could. There was a man once. Just a simple woodcarver. But he understood. More than anyone he could see to the heart of it. It never ends. Today is the same as the first. Tomorrow will be the same as today. So much time. And all of it wasted. You love history? The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better. You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I. The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired. That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg. But that's where you come in. I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin. Not all of them. Richard Taupin has become cumbersome. It would be best if he just disappeared. You are. Now. You've been listening to rumors. You're a fool. You had to do _nothing_! No one knows you're here? He sees me as a threat. Go home. You are being foolish. Why not? I'm sure they'd love to hear your story. Have you gone to the police? You? He's dead. Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now. That bothers you? Not your concern. You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time. At the moment? Carl Smith. Where? Tradition. You'll be safe here. He won't kill in a church. I doubt that. Good day, Miss Cartwright. Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you. I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries. You have an active imagination. I don't know what you're talking about. People like that rarely leave business cards. Probably. Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright? Good day, Miss Cartwright. -All but one out of a hundred, I know. All left to be led like donkeys back home. Now if you will please- Basil the II. Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with. Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do. It's not mine. Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you? Yes. Yes, he was. My father taught me. Fish are creatures of habit. They like their food where they're used to it. At the top, hiding in old leaves. Here. The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest. _Answer_ me. He knows I'm here. How? And the Bulgarian? How many came? What name is he using? Where! You're wrong. I've had a few more concerns. How do you do it, Kahn? How do you live so full of life for so long? You're insane. You were never a kid. I haven't drunk this much since- He found us even there. Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope. Offered the Pope one of his whores. Neuvich, the clown of the crusades. It's good to see you, Kahn. And have you something to settle with me? What are you doing here? How did you find me? How are you? Sit. Kahn? Leave her alone. Go to hell. Tradition. What's the point! You have me, finish it! What's the point? Leave her out of this. Run! Of sorts. You've been here from the start. Not so long. Should I care? And if I refuse? Are you here? I've got all the time in the world. Except right now. If you will excuse me, Lieutenant. Do you? He's mistaken. Home. My condolences. A mystery. Your murder weapon? I presume it's a sword. That's none of your business. What are you getting at? American. It doesn't. No. I was walking by when I heard a shout. Your men came right after. Yes. Nothing to be sorry about. I'm sure that's true. No. Same. When may I expect the cleaners? We were very close. His only kid. The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?-In nomine sanctus esperitu- -Auditorium nostrum- -Luceat ei- -Et lux perpetua- Requiem acer'nam donaei-A moment alone, please. He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer. Back home, we call him the miracle worker. I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it. Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth. He's coming 'round, Jim... Wake up, man, wake up! Tearing of the middle meningeal artery... Cramps. Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine. Oh, joy. It doesn't look all that different. That's crazy! I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself! Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry.. You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket? Now wait just a damn minute. No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him! Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer! Are you sure? That's what I thought. I mean him , back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters. You sure this is such a bright idea? I just wish we could cloak the stench. You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap... It is. No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts. Well nobody's perfect... Guess, Spock. Your best guess. Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot. Naturally. So what is your problem? You, ah... You present the appearance of a man with a problem. Angels and ministers of grace, defend us. Then how.? You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past. ... My God... That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale? I liked him better before he died. Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth? You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death? You're joking...! Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like? Forget it... How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature? Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine. I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes. Hi... Busy? My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient! Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases! How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma? Reading the patient's vital signs. We're just -- observing.Not me, Bones... They did it. Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank... Come on, Pavel... An experimental device, doctor. What did you say she was getting? What do you think, Spock? Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source. Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park. If you have a better idea - now's the time. -- That's the general idea. Would you prefer to do nothing? We've done it before. Spock, start your computations for time warp. Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit. Bones, stay here. Bones -- Mr. Sulu... Take us home... It'll come back to him. What do you mean? We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot. Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control! Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm: Understood. What is your plan? Ah, well done, team 2. Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank. No choice now, Scotty! May fortune favor the foolish. Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed! Shields, Mr. Chekov. That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...? Most prudent. Engine room. Report, Scotty. I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage. Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you? You mean this is -- goodbye? Hey! -- Where you going?! ... You have a point... He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong. Mr. Sulu: full power descent! You tricked me. Thank you. For everything. Beam me up, Scotty. I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The frequency . You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century. All I need is the radio frequency to track them. Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now? Calm yourself, Nurse. Scotty, get us out of here! A spaceship with a missing man. ... Damn! ... Gone?! We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam... It's all real. Look. The storage tanks for the whales. Steady, now. We need your help. Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in... Right. Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be. Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them. It wouldn't be my first choice, no. You asked. Now, will you tell me something? George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency? Noon tomorrow...?! Then tell me when the whales are leaving. You want the details? That's what you think. Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species. All right. The truth? No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space. Who do you think I am? Tell me when the whales are going to be released? What's what? What do you mean now? It's not so much a matter of a place as of time. Hm? If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner? You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted. Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them? How will that be done, exactly? You're upset about losing the whales. So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist? Implicitly. It's his way. Just a little joke. See you later, old friend. Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best. In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine. We can't tell you. Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales. No, ma'am. No dipshit. What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances. What's going to happen when you release the whales? Can I ask you something? Iowa. Memory problems, too. Thanks. We don't want to be any trouble. He's harmless. Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS. There's really very little point in my trying to explain. Back to San Francisco. I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help... How soon? Why's that? It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky... You mean man... You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we sink . Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?! Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands. Spock: Condition report! Then... Where the hell are we? Spock... Did braking thrusters fire? Can we make breakaway speed!? You? Spock, that's extraordinary. Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales. Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program? Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me? Right. Will you help us? Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...? Thank you, Spock. Our mission ! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about that !! Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them! That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two? Status? He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever. It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving. ... I see. They have a right to be... Do you think they'll help us? What else did you learn from your mind meld? You've done it before. Can't you remember? You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate. And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth. Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it. About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them. Spock... Come on, fellah -- speak up! Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins.... You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period. Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question? Yes. ... Simple logic. I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie. Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales. How do you propose to solve this minor problem? And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it. How much? Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically. But you said toxic. Explain. Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device! Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit. Well done, Mr. Spock. Earth... But when?... Spock? You've programmed that from memory...? What are the variables...? Surely you can be more specific... What is our target in time? Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command. Mr. Spock, your computations? But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative? That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth. Is there any other planet where this species exists? Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated? Whales? Spock...? Where are you going?! Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors? Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man? Well, I... find that understandable I mean, you've been through a lot. Station, please. Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...? Permission granted. Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu. Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can -- Picture, Uhura! Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up! Mark, Mr. Sulu... Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power. Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz! Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero. Go, Mr. Sulu. We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem. Picture, please. What is our condition? Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?! Steady!!... Now, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed! Steady as she goes... Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort? Weapons systems? Out of control, and blind as a bat! Mr. Scott -- how soon? Estimate range, ship to whales! On screen. Put them on screen! Bearing! Uhura!... Where! Uhura, you did what was necessary. Keep trying. You'll find him... Any luck...? Everyone remember where we parked. We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales? Right. Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before. From a city? That doesn't make sense.... On speakers. Then, this is what it would sound like underwater? On screen! What is it? Mr. Sulu? Systems report. Communications? Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship. Go on ahead... Close the hatch! The explosive override -- ? The whales...?! On my way...! Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future... Mr. Sulu, if you please. Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of - Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems... Mr. Sulu, impulse climb. Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed? How long, Scotty? Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure? Mr. Sulu? Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better! Oh I see -- Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out. What is it? I thought I told you never to call me -- I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this! Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized? Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott. It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott. You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them. Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece. Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks. That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water? Scotty, how long is this bay? Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott. Prepare for departure. Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway? Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye. You will be in good hands here. Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling? Thank you, Lt. Saavik.Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts? Admiral, you'll be trapped! It's under water! There's no way to reach it... No power to the bay doors. You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off... The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium. Full power, sir. Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work... I'll have to re-energize. Admiral! There be whales here! 10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1. Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve... Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before. I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie... I'll try, sir. Scott out. Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he. It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow. Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now. Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century. Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home. They're giving out. De-crystallizing. Two? Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight? Humpbacked - people.? I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim? About 60 feet, Admiral. We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach. Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard. That's the ticket, laddie. The keyboard... How quaint. Hello? Computer...? Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh? Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water? I notice you're still working with polymers. Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer you . I will. Can my assistant come, too? Well, that's different. I demand to see the owners! I demand -- Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --Humans make illogical decisions... I would accept that as an axiom. I do this because I was there, To Earth. To offer testimony. As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them. The question is irrelevant. I do not understand the final question... You're saying... It is a compliment. ... I don't think he understands... "Guessing" is not in my nature... ... Best shot...? Acceleration is no longer a constant. Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve. Hamlet, Act I scene 4. That is what I said, Doctor. 10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact. Specifically, Humpback Whales. There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man. Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile... Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress. A joke is a story with a humorous climax. It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference. I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines. ... My shoes... Uhura is busy. I am monitoring. Is there something wrong with the one I have? Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor? I was not. The hell they did. They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales. Attempting the hell to communicate. To hunt a species to extinction is not logical. I will, Admiral. No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional. They did, Admiral. Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory. Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will... Make a guess . Admiral, you must wait one damn minute. No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do. Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov. Admiral. Full power is restored. In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail. No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call. The tank will be finished by morning... I meant -- How will playing cards help? I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions. They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man. The hell I can't Exaggerate. I cannot tell a lie. I see. Why not? Yes? Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction. Ah... The giants. For example? Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth... Admiral, may I ask you a question? As you observed, a primitive Culture. How do you know this...? Simple logic will suffice. We need a map. That one should do. Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy? Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels... We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically. If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some. There is a 20th Century possibility. Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time. Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century. I have. Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin. Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory. The late 20th Century. Ready to engage computer, Admiral. In progress, Admiral. There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales. That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily. The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past. The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish. As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales. To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion. A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire. I seem to have misplaced my uniform. Thank you, Admiral. Permission to come aboard. Tell her I feel fine... They are my friends. Most kind, Father. It is kind of you to make this effort. Father...?Arigato. Sayonara. Thank you, honorable sir. Sulu Hikaru. Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii. Yes, this must be true. You talk funny. Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT. YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN... MAVERICK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK. Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang. Can't shake him. OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT! It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject. I'm pulling up. They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted! Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps! Were upside down! Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong! This is crazy! Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up. You. We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage? He better be kidding! What is he doing? It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be. TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY. We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down. No! Now we're inverted! We're not! Trust me! We're okay. You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay! You're crazy. We're level. What? What is it? What is? Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high. Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us. These guys are getting on my nerves. Lordy! Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps! That's missile lock! He's pissing me off! Let's hope you're right! I've got a six strobe. I think he's locked on us. We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them. We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter. Did what? It's not Cougar's place. It's ours. Hey, see any controls back there? And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch! Could use a dash more jet fuel. Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it. This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing. You think you can stay up with us. No shit. The Iceman.... Who's your pilot? This is Maverick. The list is long, but distinguished. Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country. 1000. 3000 feet. I'll do it. Time to go. Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the... Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it. What what are you doing? We're cover! Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood. Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man! Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on! Something bothering you? What the hell is this? Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here. Come on, I got over six bucks on the line. Come on, we're next. Just once, if they take your plane away. You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk! Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there? Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career. I wouldn't call it victory. It's more like...self immolation. Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think? Look, Ma, top of the world! Great move. Great On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT! Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink. Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you? What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty! Gotta keep track of the competition. Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good. What are you doing? Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down. What'd you do? They should have warned you about that one. Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS. No shit! That why they call him Ice? Mav's a great flyer but.... But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best! Skipper, you can't do this! He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun! Don't worry. I'll talk to him.Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you? That's not what I heard. Got you here. What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it? You're a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman any time. You saved our lives. You did it! I guess I owe you one. WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? SHOOT IT. I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT? ON THE NOSE? LOOK OUT! NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM. NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE. STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK. IT'S MY SHOT. GET LOST! GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN. ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.Right on the flight line? Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here? Well what? I hope you find him. Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer. ...Something like that. How could you? I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't.. I was, later. Who's gonna win? One more. That's three. What does it mean? Off me or off you? Now? Goose is dead. What truth? How does it go? You're crazy. That's a pretty silly game. Strip reality! How do you play that? How do you play reality. What kind of games? What do you do when you come here? It does. Hardly ever. That's what I want. Yesterday. I want it back. No. I'm not good company. I should be alone. You don't have to do this. Where are we? Not to me. Maybe I shouldn't take it. I was flying...my responsibility. He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault. What? I'm fine. Pawn shop. What's to eat? Just good luck. Lucky charm. Why, what's gonna happen? . Yeah! You ever fly an F-14? Well no...inverse order. Food...and you...my F-14! Why? Anything. I don't know yet. And now I want you. I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun. You want to go ballistic? Come on. Thanks very much. Care for some suchi?. What? I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements. All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead... When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth. That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it. You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV. They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission. It bothers you, why? You're part of it. Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something. About as much as they think about killing me. Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work. You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs? Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die. It's not suffering anymore. That's true. What are you? It dies. We live. Anything. Let's make it at eight. I'm different. What plane. A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park. How about anything, anything you want to do. Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it? What if he's not? Harmless! I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage. What are you talking about? The what? Evan... or Maverick. I thought there was something... That night in the club... Give me a break, I'm asking you out. I'm special. Too aggressive? Um. You. Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want? That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line. Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something. I'm sorry. It is combat. Every second counts. What would you say, too fast...too quick... What would? You let me make a fool of myself. You know. The finger. Two meters. Two. I was inverted. Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him. On his six. Yes, ma'am. Not in this case. CHARLIE You saw a MiG push negative 4G? It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. It's classified. I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive. I saw one. No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that. And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart. Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick. It would have been really embarrassing! Everybody's got to be somewhere. I thought he'd never leave. Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile. I heard of one once. Yeah, most likely. Save you from a big mistake with that other guy. I could be, too. Well, it is. It is that, too. It's not that. Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted. Yes sir! Sir? Yes, Sergeant? No sir! But you have to be ready. Yes sir! F-14's sir. Yes sir. Sir. I was going Mach point one five. Yes sir. I do, Sir. Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir! NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU. YEAH, COUGAR? EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED. ROLL IT, COUGAR. ROGER, COUGAR. Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt. I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. Gotcha covered, don't nobody move. WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING? Let me do the talking. Any more MiGs? What do I want? Well what? MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY. But I have to! Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it! The plane is fine. Just relax. You go. I'm staying with it. 280, 290, 300 knots. I'm not losing it again! No! Not again! Okay. I can recover. Hold on! I've got it -- hold on! Rudder's left, stick's forward. Yawing right. Roger, I've got it. Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it. I GOT ONE COMING UP. BREAKING LEFT! Okay, okay. Not anymore. Saving them some paperwork. NO. NO GOOD. DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD. Let's go. Eject. Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet! I can't eject. I'm pinned to the panel. I guess that's what I'm doing, then. Wood's okay. I want Viper. I want him! I'm gonna take him, Goose. STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN! Nothing. Let's just go fight. Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks. I've had enough...for now. What? Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll? Come on, relax... It's a victory roll. Right. We did it! He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw. I've lost him -- where is he? What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit? Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead. You ever done this before? Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know? Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing? COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL. No. You can be mine! We did it. You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team. WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU. I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT. GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE. OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM. YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN. COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING. YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN. FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE. COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE. SHIT!! I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian. I think I can work it out on my own. Nope. Figured out what? Helping him in. I...FORGOT SOMETHING. COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU? Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. Morning, Coogan. You didn't help. The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister. It was bad. Didn't everybody? Yes sir.. Yes sir! Sir? Me? He's a good pilot. Would you take me back? Would they? You think I shouldn't fly. How can I go on? I feel so... responsible. It's not true. I never heard that. He was by the book, all the way. I'm nothing like him. I know. You think I should quit?! I don't know... Or.... She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me? I called your house. Skipper, sorry to bother you. He was...my responsibility--my RIO. I know. I was there. All right. The flying. The fighting. I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good. Just give me the jet. For the same reason you are. It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff. I can take care of myself. I lost. ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. I wasn't thinking. I just did it. We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it. I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger... Yes sir. Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir. Yes sir.Three guesses. So have I. It's only been a week. Keep sending him up. WALKED RIGHT INTO IT. Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class. "Maverick!" Tell me one thing. But you continued to fight. The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight? I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men. I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man. Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen. Not something they tell dependents. They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp. You may not think so, but you are. VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse. Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man. I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you. It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday... I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers. Or you can quit. We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that. My wife's house. No bother. My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it. Goose is dead. How do you feel? Oh, you mean the thrill! Then why are you here? Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive. Why do you have to do everything the hard way? Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed. Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that. SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM.. Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane! The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear? Why? Is that how you remember it? A good man. Good flyer. You're father was Marvin Mitchell.. Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign? I like that in a fighter pilot. It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork. Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.You just sit tight, Jason. Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll... Whaddya mean? Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story. Is that all you found? Better call an ambulance first. I'm getting real tired of this maniac. But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it. It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge. Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind. Yes, Megan. Tommy Jarvis is a killer. A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that... And make sure my daughter stays put... ...She's grounded. Rick. Keep and eye on our wacko kid. I'll be back as soon as I can. We have! Trying to track you down. The phone there is disconnected. ...And I said, shut up! He is. Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true... ...You stay put. And I'm not kidding. Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned. You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady. When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you... Megan, take your friends back to the camp. I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors. Megan, get away from him. He's dangerous. Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble. Yeah...They should've paid their bill. If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde. With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy. Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment. We're taking care of it. Sorry for the disturbance. I've seen it. I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass. But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind. No!... ... You kids better leave. This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private. I sympathize with you kids. The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them. You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up. Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out. They were gonna! But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest. In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they... No problem, Rick. Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis. He's got some kinda prank going about... And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you? Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were.... Hold it. Whoa... What's your name, son? Don't piss me off, junior. Or I will repaint this office with your brains. Now you better cool out a minute, boy. You already almost got your head blown to pieces.Yes. And I said, hand me those padlocks. Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks. I hope so. Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began. It probably wouldn't have any effect on him. The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957. I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started. Sorry, Megan. Not this time. Come and get it. 'Cause it stinks. No. So what are ya drawin'? It's just beginning. Okay. There's one. Uh...yes. But... What? I already have a very good idea what could've happened... ...Megan, Jason is out there. He has to be stopped. I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area. He'll keep killing until... Yeah, hi. Listen, I've got to talk to your dad. About Jason. I've got a plan. I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to... Doesn't that tell you something?! You got me where you want me. There's no reason not... Please don't do anything crazy. Jason's not in his coffin! Hawes is! Dig it up! You gotta dig it up!! Please, Sheriff. You'll see we dug it up. I gotta show you Jason's grave. But they have to be warned, Sheriff. Jason will return to the area that's familiar. No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him. Yes! I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them. You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me. If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying. Why didn't you cremate him?! There's no time for this bullshit... Yes, but they released me because... Yeah. Jason murdered them and... Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do something. He's even more powerful now that... Jason is alive. We dug up his body. I was gonna cremate it and... Will you listen, dammit!And then, uh, April...huh? Uh, who gets dropped first? Yeah. Look at this. Well, let's do it. You want to see some? You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them. I get the feeling you tune in to your environment. Are you really interested? Hi. And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs. I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs. Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first. Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you? We could...we could do that. Well... Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh? It does. It's really sad. They fit right in together. And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then... And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it. Yes. And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. The design's deliberately noncontextural. But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions. Yeah. What time do you get off? I'm an architect. I cry at the opera. Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party. You're Holly. Ah! HOLLY Now. Oh no. Not at all. Is this your first job? Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong. I can't resist. Excuse me, are there any more claims?It's nothing. Will you trust me? You know, there's no reason for panic. I just want to rule out some things. Now, don't get alarmed. These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it's, it's nothing. What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests. And it's just in one ear? You've had some dizzy spells. What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that? When did you first notice this? Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus? Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear. Let's take a look. You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness. ...and, uh, he complained of chest pains. You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus... So what's the, uh, problem this time?Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead. Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I told him about your work, and he's very excited. Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it. Lee... And you're in love overnight? Yeah, but we-we made so many plans. But it hasn't been forever. If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you! Uh... I-I-I know. I deserve this. Is something wrong? You've been very cold to me tonight. Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn't need me as much. I'm being presumptuous. Not that you need me. You really do have those thoughts, don't you? Oh, my God. I don't want anyone else ever to have you. This is not an easy situation. I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks. No, no-no-no, I'm sure. Lee... uh... I thought you weren't coming. Your guilt is because you feel the same. Yes, but you, you do care about me. O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out. W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad. But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you? Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions. Tch, w-well, for a million reasons. Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway. Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you. Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her. Hannah and I are in the last stages. I know! I-I-I-I, I realize. I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible. Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you. I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up. I have been in love with you for so long. I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you. Oh! Lee! Lee! Lee, I'm in love with you. And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive. This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically. Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve? Oh, right. Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings? I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites. Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see her wind up settled. She's a tense one. Oh, I would love to hear it. Oh, you-you have that one? He's got like six gold records. Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars. I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together. Oh, that's nice. But I go nuts. It's a conflict. Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods. How's everything? Bye. Page a hundred and twelve. And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve. It reminded me of you. Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime. Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on. And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime. Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this. I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. A poem of his and thought of you last-- You'll be fine, though. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle. She looks at the book. Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much. e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you this. Oh, yes. Who doesn't? Look! How-how's Frederick? Yeah. How are you? Yes. Uh, yes! No! No... No, no. I-I-I understand completely. No problem. Y-you're busy. I-I-I... Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee. Oh, book? Oh, no, I... I'm killing time. I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh... Yes, it's-it's wonderful. Well, i-if-if you have some free time... Yes? Yes? LEE A couple of blocks from here. If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it. I think to myself what problems could she possibly have? I'll never understand it. You're so bright and charming and beautiful. Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy. Where are you headed? Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you? How about you? Well, yes, I'm killing time. I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early. Yes. Yeah, I-I'm kill-- Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore. Hi. Oh, my goodness! Yeah. Like, uh...? Really? So, so, what else? Wh- what are you up to? Oh, great. How's Frederick? He didn't come. You're not lost. It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return! Leave me alone, can you?! Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke. Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject. What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less. You sleep with me less and less. No. Me? Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you. No! But you keep asking these, these awful questions. My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes! What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else. My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No. I didn't say that. No! Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take. You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured. A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut. I-it's all very...preconceived. Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle. But, you got four children! I don't know. Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now. Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea. Was I? I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy. Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I forgot. I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman. You bet. Let's go have dinner, shall we? That's where your talent lies. Great idea. No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well. Your sister is an unbelievable cook. They're fantastic. Mm-hm?I'll either be unconscious or I won't. If not, I'll deal with it then. I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious. How do you know? Of what? I'll be unconscious. Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll be dead. So? Why should I be afraid? But why? We raised you as a Jew. But Catholicism? Why not your own people? How can we be happy?Oh... Jesus...Jesus! You are, you are my only connection to the world! But who? Where did you meet him? Who is it? So you met somebody else? Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back! Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?! You've been with someone! Oh, yes, you have! Oh...Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?! Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now? What are you going to use for money?! Why? Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again? Like what? When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world. I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago. You know, you've been very nervous lately. You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz. More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions. I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?! I don't sell my work by the yard! They're in the basement. ...or films you must see or... Elliot lusts after you. Yeah. Because he likes you. Have I really taught you everything I have to give? I don't think so. Well, there was a time when you were very happy to be only with me. You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music. Hmm? Isn't it enough that I can love you? Lee... you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people. I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone. Absolutely. No, nothing. No, thank you.Like what? Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I won't go to the opera. The hospital? What kind of tests? Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears? Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something? Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha- what do I have? I always, I-I always imagine that I have things. No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me. Really?! Now I ca-can't remember. Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no. No, I'm sorry. It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear. Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. I mean, he's, you know, he's-- Mm-hm. So, so, but it was when I was younger, so-- This time I really think I have something. We-- We nev-- We don't name names! We say the Pope. Read the papers! Half the country's doing it! Could you-- Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? You-- Standards and Practices? Mom, come out! Well, it certainly doesn't look promising. Yeah, I know. But never to exist again! I don't understand. Aren't you frightened? That thought doesn't terrify you? Oh! 'Cause you won't exist! So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision. I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try. Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ? Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought. I don't understand. I thought that you would be happy. I can't stay on this show. I gotta get some answers. Otherwise I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic. Yes! ...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything. I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything! Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you? That makes everything... I went into a store, I bought a rifle. I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself. The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated. I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first. And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath. A week ago, I bought a rifle. Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret? Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind... No, I'm not dying now, but, but you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right. And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay. I'm not going to go tomorrow. But eventually, I'm going to be in that position. Can you understand how meaningless everything is? Everything! I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless. Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by? No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy. I--How was I to know?! Everyone was pointing back here. Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back! You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor! Don't say that! I don't want to hear that word! Don't mention that while I'm in the building. Like what?! What? If there's nothing wrong with me then why does he want me to come back for tests?! I can't keep my mind on the show. Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing? Like-- N-n-no, not that. Oh, Jesus! Look at this guy. No-- You know... Right. We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and... Hannah and I...can't have any children. Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it-- It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to-- With a, with a stranger? With a-- Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea? What, by a st-stranger? What are you talking about? Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one-- Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies? Jesus! How could I ruin myself? What do you mean, ruin myself? I'm so humiliated. I don't know what to say. I mean-- Well, then a third opinion. Gee. Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this. Come on! Hurry up! Let's go! Go right over there. Isn't that great? Mh-hm. You've always had good taste in husbands, so... ...you know? I, uh... ...so I, so I like that. I always like an underconfident person... H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me... The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt? I like him. I think he's a sweet guy. Really? That'll be terrific for him, I think. Oh! Yeah? Let me get a little reaction here. How's Elliot? Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the presents now. How is everything? ...a little, uh, hey! A little hug! What is this? Now how 'bout a little action from the kids? Yeah, aren't you like, you know... I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta-- I got two minutes. I know...I know. Mmm, what? I don't know how you're gonna top that. You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that it's ironic. I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought that I could love anybody else. And here it is, years later and I'm married to you and completely in love with you. The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle. It really is. I... It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister... doesn't work out... many years later... he winds up married to the other sister. It's, you know, it's a... Oh. You look so beautiful. When'd you get here? Hi. How you doin'? Now don't get nervous. It's just your husband. Do you? I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening? So, so you want to go out to dinner again? I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or... I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault. I-- Oh, don't be silly! No! Don't be ridiculous. Oh, yeah? What? Well... I'll tell you. One day about a month ago... Oh, who cares? I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script. I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it. It was just great. Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff. I am. You-you made my day. Fabulous, I mean it! I'm so impressed. ...but who cares? It was just-- It was fabulous. I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but... Well, it was just fabulous! I'm, I, you know... Yes! I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death? It's great. I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless. I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now. I don't know what to say. I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat. I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned. This is not an insult. I'm amazed that you can... It was-- I just thought it was great. I should have kept going. I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and... Well, what about me? You must be joking. I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know. Come over tomorrow and read it to me? Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it. Really? Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote. Yeah. Hmm. You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing. What...what about your script? So what's it about? I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you? ...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it. But-- I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year... I've done no television whatsoever. No. I'm not anymore. I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year. You have. You've always hated my taste in the past. Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you. I don't know why it would. This is it. Yeah. This is really-- HOLLY Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it? Something...that I wrote? Nobody ever said it. No, I am. I am. No, you can tell me. Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff? Have you? Are you, are you out of work or something? Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it? Well... You didn't answer my question. What are you doing? So how are you? ...namely a personality. Well, I hope you've changed. You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you? ...in a really horrible way. Remember slamming the cab door in my face and.. you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... It was a terrible evening. Yeah, really. You do. You do. You look wonderful. Good. How are you? Oh, that's putting it mildly. We did everything but exchange gunshots. ...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh... I was walking past and I saw you in here... Yes, you do recall, right? Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together. ...I had a great time tonight, really. It was like the Nuremberg Trials. Right. Yeah. I had a... Yeah. Me, too. Jesus... I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people. Really. And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time! What do you, what do you do? Carry a kilo around in your purse? Yeah, that's tough! You don't deserve Cole Porter. You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother! Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing. Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me. Can I take you someplace to hear something nice? Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials. My--uh... Can we, can we go? But, no, you've been doing that all night! You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril! Really, don't, please. Don't, no, please. Will you-- No, don't... I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown! I can't hear anything. I can't hear you. I can't hear anything. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear! I'm-- Well, okay. Thank you very much. Uh-huh. Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me. I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I-- Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.Could he handle a direct contact? What's the bottom line? That's when it happened? His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate? Why aren't you ever alone with him? You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic? He doesn't think you run mind games on him. That was Peterson upstairs. I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. Where? Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place... Not the Bible? Book code? Issue the toilet paper tear as a... The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now. That could be the tip of a 't. Here and here. And here. Twenty minutes max. I need to talk to you about Will Graham. I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can... Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you? Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it... Because it's his bad luck to be special. I have to. Wait for the back-up! Will? Stay in the trees. Three minutes. Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach. Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house. You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us. Will...? Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit... Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van. I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field. At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream. See if there's another label underneath. No. It's Bob's Photo Store in... Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it? There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows. It's the guard in the storeroom. It's getting late and... He had to. Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed. What's that? Will? It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM. The full moon is tonight. Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh... What? There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times. There's no connection between the families. VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what? 'Changes?' When are you coming back? Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit. From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning. You got the message Lecktor called... Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece. It means Red Dragon. That mean anything to you? I'll pick you up in... Wait, Will... It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all. It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address. I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you. Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now. What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write? It's your call, Will. What do we do? Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says. We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week. ...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler. Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD. Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes. Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up. How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop? Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds! You. If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley... Is it weird? For Christ's sake, why? See? You do know something about him. Why? No other possibilities? We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack. What's the other? What's one way? You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print... Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you? I know... A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it. What do you want to do? You said the guy down here is good. He's working on the single print index. What time is it? I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect. These are all dead, Will. If you can't look anymore, I understand... You look all right now. That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think. Last two like this we had, you caught. And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors. Why not? Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call? Typed him from semen. He's a secretor. Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive. Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that; How much do you know? I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here... ...twenty-eight minutes. Cryptography at Langley? Let's get to the physical. For Christ's sake get him! Where the hell's Graham! Will. Get right back here. He just called. ...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong. I AM THE DRAGON! Give me your hand. Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered. Do you know what they call the being that visited these people? You can say. Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta. Do you know what I'm talking about? Me. It's me. Yes. I'll see you later. All right? No. Reba...? The developing room. I need to... see you. Reba... Do you want a Coke or something, Reba? I'll get it. Stay right here. You look very good in the sun... I have work to do at the plant. No! Don't go back into the house... It's too nice outside. Yes, are you okay...?! I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa... It's a surprise. Uh-huh. You worked out well. How did you come to Gateway? Tonic will be fine. Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to. Ride with me. I'll take you. It'll do fine. In eight days. The activities of nocturnal animals. Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights. Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock. I want her! I want her alive... I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!! Shut up. Stop. Stop it. No! No. Good. We'll seal your promise with... You will tell the truth? You did very well. I apologize for the crude images. Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights. Now you will read this into the tape recorder. Are you queer, Mr. Lounds? Do you imply that I'm a queer? Are you a man? 'No' what? Do you see? Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see? Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The Dragon rampant. Do you see? Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see? Do you see? Do you see? Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.' Do you see? Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter. You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead. Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds. In a little while I'll help you understand. Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds? Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds? Do you feel privileged? According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said. You know now, don't you? Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds? Atoning, Mr. Lounds. Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back. No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine. Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...! And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home? This ends when I make it over. Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming. The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. Why the mirrors? What have we missed? If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. That's what you were thinking, isn't it? He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor... They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. In thirty-five minutes. He doesn't have anything to cut with. The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply. That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me... Read it. Will Graham, Jack Crawford... It's happening again, Jack... There's somebody in the house, Jack... I'll cover the back. How far away's the back-up? What? This is our boy...! Parking permits... It does, doesn't it? Have him peel the top label back. What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri. We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in. They're in the far corner of the room under the windows. Don't talk to me!! You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered? He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door? That's why the boltcutter. You wanna watch this or what?! It's not over yet. Something Lecktor said. He's a very shy boy... There has to be. He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses. If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him. How do I know?! It's a word. Killing them... His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time. And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again... He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before. It's very important. When I'm done. That's narrow? What's it narrow down to? I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes. No. I won't be here. Get me a plane! Get me a plane... Tell me now. What'd it say? Who is it? We will feel sick for a very long time. Run it. And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon. Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper? Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time. Personal ads? We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it... After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. Where's Lector now? What is it? Who did he ask for? Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds? The mark? Yes. To recover the mind set. ...I'm going to see Lecktor. Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack. You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about. The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop. He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time. We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him. Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right? We'll get him one way or the other. I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me. Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index. ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls... Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes. He is good. Bur not as good as Price. Get him to Atlanta. Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints? Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat. As long as they're dead... I am all right. I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. I came down here to get away from all that. That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing. You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack. The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... No. Somebody hurt him? What else did you keep out of the papers? What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions? I don't want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious? Can you read it to me? Where did you get it?! It's Will Graham... I want to see Lecktor now. No. I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. I don't want to do that, He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet. He's very strong physically. He's misunderstood. He's right-handed. Let's get straight who we've talking about. Are you the man I'm interested in? Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you? I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things. Do you know something about that? I don't understand. This is Will Graham. Can I help you? Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog? Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it? What about the dog? I call him a monster. Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. Eight in Mrs. Jacobi... ...that's all I have. That's all we know about. Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... He bites a lot. He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse. Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy. Everybody else was dead. Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you? The report didn't mention nails and eyes. You got a deal... Yeah. That's great. A little time. I tell you what, buckaroo... See you around. Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick... They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me... Small difference: I'm not dead, yet. What's the problem, Molly? What's this Mama shit? Come home with me. Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to... Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer. I want to see you. Mama was probably asleep. Hello. You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while. I'll come and get you afterwards... No. I have to be in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks. I have to go back to Birmingham. Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time. No. I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you. No. You haven't smoked in two years. Yes. I said this is too good to live... I remember. Good for him. Thanks a lot, Freddie! Kevin. We're going grocery shopping. ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby... Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care... Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... Blue, then. Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow. I have to see somebody. I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. Eating junk food. They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it... Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff. How's Kevin? Tell me about yourself. None you'd notice. I'm lonely... Hey, baby! Where are you? It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. I love you... Molly? I don't care. He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence. If I were? What the hell can I do? We have it good, don't we? I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma? I got a diploma and everything. And you said? What did he want? Tell her I called. I know... 'Out in the good air...' Yes. Is Molly there? Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian, too... It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson? Go on to the house... Go on to the house. Thanks. That's right. Thanks for the lift. No, I'm okay. I just wanted to... ...stop by and... My name's Will Graham. I... Are you George Sherman? Huh? ...yes. ...after a while. No. Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him. With a knife. I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar. I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying. I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait. Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them. No. It's just my job to find him. I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs. We don't know that. I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it? Yes. No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are. What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?' He read the Tattler piece, didn't he? It's a precaution... Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float. Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed. In this hatchery? Forty to fifty. Yeah... Why does it feel good? I don't believe in God. Fight what? I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it. What do you want? Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file. No. I haven't decided yet. When you do have one I'd like to hear it. I want your opinion. Yes. I'd considered it. That's interesting. Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why? Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor. No. Yes. Yes. I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... You're insane. You had disadvantages. No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are. I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for. You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...? I thought you would have some ideas. You read about it, I'm sure. It's about Atlanta and Birmingham. I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor. It's in the transcript. What does it matter now? You've read the transcript. It's all there. Very interesting, even to a layman. Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry. No. Stuart is fine. I got it. Thank you. I keep getting it for Christmas. Let's walk the route. Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times' Kevlar Second Chance. Glaser Safety Slugs? Yes. Pretty well.You like that Colombian stuff, don't you? What kind of coffee do you like? And Hobbs died? She got all right? Did the girl die? You went in the apartment? How? How did it happen? Are you gonna kill him? I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it. This guy wants to kill you? I figured I'd ask you... Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true? Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom? I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom... Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh? How many turtle eggs you think are in here? Will it keep them out?Thank you very much. Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham. Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G. I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone. I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me. Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number. Hi, Linda. .. It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful... You should, Will. God's terrific! He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn. Don't you think that felt good? He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders. When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time! I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us. Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it? You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court. I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will. Do you know how you caught me, Will? I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number? May I keep the file? I don't have one right now. You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you? It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before. Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing. What were the yards like? You haven't threatened to take away my books yet. Do you dream much, Will? Let me have them, and I might consider it. Pictures? Do you have the file with you Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity. You're very tan, Will. What disadvantage? Then how did you catch me, Will? Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me. Pray tell. Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face. Never mind, it's boring. Why should I tell you? In the papers. I don't tear out the articles. I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you? Yes. Yes, I thought so. It doesn't matter to me, Will. No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will? A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it' And? Of course, you don't. I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot. Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will? And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement. Did you get my card? That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.Absolutely, You'll let me go now? 'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand. 'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you. 'I will be a testament to the truth, now. About his work. About his becoming.' No. God, no. Yes. Not me. Please, no. Oh, God. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes... No. I don't want to see you. I don't know... Yes. I'm very scared. Yes. I don't want to know. What am I doing here? Let me lie down. Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame. My back's broken. Tell me the truth. My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned. Was I in an accident?No. It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl. I understand he cut you pretty good... To yourself... What would you call him? What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor? What happened to them? The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago. He killed nine people, didn't he? What's average? He only bit women so far, right? 'Intimate? !" Why do you think he took his gloves off? Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can... I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped. I'll never give up. Oh, God, Dion. I'll just set it right here. That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger. I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you. But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue. I thought you were...for a while. . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue... Come back to me. But I love you. I'll love you forever. Peggy! Where're you going? Come back! What the hell is that? I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain. I love you. It opens, too. Look inside. Of course. You're crazy! You're really out of your mind! What? Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore. Right here. Now sit down. You're going to listen to me. I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you. Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres. That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand. Does this mean you like me again? If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement? Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it. You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why? That's real big of you. Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other. Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with? How'd you know about that? Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while. Rusty's dead. That's Ajax What're you doing here? You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us. ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian! What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me? But what has to be different? What about everything I said to you this afternoon... What are you talking about? Who's Janet? I will be happy if I have you. I love you. Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man. You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this. Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love �� Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted? I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons... Let's go down to the basement. I have to talk to you.. Don't be cruel to a heart that's true. Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you. Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why? Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts. Nothing.. Selling is selling. Save it. You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood. You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late. Who? But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait. What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it? You know I do. I even wrote you into my will. Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in. Yeah I know. But I don't have to flatter you. It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me. As in is, was and always will be. I'm glad dancing was invented. You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites. There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you.. Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry? Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff? I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals? Is this slow enough for you? Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right? Great, isn't it? Yeah. Like that. In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah... I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious. Looking good out there. Would I?!! Why I oughta... Want me to drive you home later? Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents? It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out. And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean? I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again. How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget? You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense. Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night. I call this the staccato. Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today. How do you feel? No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway. I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie. I'm not going. I'll think of a way to sell, them. One day. You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to... You got a Tab? Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office. I mailed it to you on Wednesday. Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it. And nothing will ever change that. But you love me don't you? Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed. ...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something. We're here on the sofa bed... And we're here on the couch... Of course. What would that be, sir? Yes, sir. Trust is a two�way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands. Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school. Yes, sir. Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook. I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something. Can we split now? Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause. What a treat. I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah. You think so? But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together. At least one more time. But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation. Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah. Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us. Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and... Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone. To freedom. That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid. Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one? A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire. Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life? The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club. Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell�O for me, Mom.' The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy. This is great reefer. I thought chicks like you traveled in packs. What're you doing here anyway? A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life! He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author � fat, violent, drunk... Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself. We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you. Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter. She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes. Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you. Hello, Charlie. Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool! Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn? It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now. You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea? That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them. This is your great invention? Would you wear those things? Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats. Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win. That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up. I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business? This morning was good. It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up. Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank. For me? Doing some shopping? Evelyn, take her to her room! I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room! That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into. Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government. All right. But this better be good. Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay. Thank God for that. Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you? Damn that Charlie I If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too? You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits. Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again. Evelyn, put her to bed. I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded. Young lady, you're drunk! Peggy Sue, watch your mouth. We'll make it, we'll be fine. I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of. I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -�how could you do that? Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump. This is not giving blood. This is drunk.Wait! I'll go with you! Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me. Did you break up with Charlie? So are you. You've got a vision. Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip. Not true. I think I'm making real progress on the microchip. What's the matter? Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis. I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest. Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you. One... two... three. You are now awake. No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it. Will you take of f your blouse? You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex? In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her? Silicon is from sand. What will they be made of? Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips? You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. We'll start with something easy. What is your name? No offense, but you're pretty out of it now. Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back. Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before? Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion? Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht. That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny. That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future? What are you doing? High tech. I like the sound of that. What are you talking about? All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's. Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym? Come on. You can't be serious. You're taking advantage of a minor. Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty�fifty. Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner. I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them. No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you... I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help! But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents? The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world. What if you're not here tomorrow? All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy. You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack. Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible. Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door. There's one way to find out. You're giving me the creeps. You look pretty good for a corpse. I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain. But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it? Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule! How, did you know about my grandfather? You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me. Okay. I promise. Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants. You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other. That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland. And then, there's Richard's Burrito. Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed. Are you doing some kind of science project? I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about? All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four�thirty. I have a rocket club meeting. I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy. It really wasn't that difficult. I guess part of us never really leaves high school. Dancing with you. You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that. You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine. The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four�eyed worm. Gee. I'm sorry to hear that. Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh. You look exactly the same. Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!! He's dead! Where?... You saw him? ...but 'Lias is still out there. Where? Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got... Over here! I was wrong. You're wrong man! Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer. Fuck this shit! Then what do you suggest big shot? ...See them go down? Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie!! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!... Crawford! Yeah!

How 'bout you? No! Where's Lerner? They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE! La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE! I'll go with you. Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die? You really think so... us? And you, do you believe? Barnes got it in for you, don't he? That's a nice way of putting it. ...beautiful night. ...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time. Dawn... But what'd she actually do? ...But what'd she do? Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good. Yeah. Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime! Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit. Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it? Who gives a shit! ...there's nobody. Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes... What are the heads? ...you know that night we got hit... I... No, thanks... Nah... Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam... I volunteered. What you got there - beers? Okay - got light duty, three days.I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man.
