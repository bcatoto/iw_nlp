NORTH	m	How many times have I told you to knock?
YETI	m	Warga blarghgha!
NORTH	m	What...? The Globe?
NORTH	m	Shoo with your pointy heads. Why are you always under boot? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 5.
NORTH	m	What is this?
NORTH	m	Have you checked the axis? Is rotation balanced?
YETI	m	Wardle bawddrel.
NORTH	m	Can it be? (then calls off) Dingle!
NORTH	m	Make preparations! We are going to have company. Des Moines, we've got a cuspid at 23 Maple. Head out!
TOOTH	f	It's her first tooth. Have you ever seen a more adorable lateral incisor in all of your life?! Look how she flossed!
BUNNYMUND	?	Ah, it's freezing.
BUNNYMUND	?	I can't feel my feet! I can't feel my feet!
NORTH	m	Sandy, thank you for coming.
NORTH	m	I know, I know, but I obviously wouldn't have called you all here unless it was serious.
NORTH	m	The Boogie Man was here - at the Pole.
TOOTH	f	Pitch? Pitch Black? Here?!
NORTH	m	Yes! There was black sand covering the globe.
BUNNYMUND	?	What, what...what do you mean black sand?
NORTH	m	And then a shadow!
BUNNYMUND	?	Hold on, hold on, I thought you said you saw Pitch.
NORTH	m	Well, ah, not exactly... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 10.
BUNNYMUND	?	Not exactly? Can you believe this guy?
BUNNYMUND	?	Yeah, you said it, Sandy.
NORTH	m	Look, he is up to something very bad. I feel it, in my belly.
BUNNYMUND	?	(his eyes narrow) Hang on, hang on, you mean to say, you summoned me here THREE DAYS BEFORE EASTER - because of your belly? Mate, if I did this to you three days before Christmas--
TOOTH	f	(to her fairies) Argentina. Priority alert! A batch of bicuspids in Buenos Aires.
NORTH	m	Please. Bunny. Easter is not Christmas.
BUNNYMUND	?	Here we go... North, I, I don't have time for this. I've still got two million eggs to finish up.
BUNNYMUND	?	Look, mate, I'm dealing with perishables. Right. You've got all year to prepare.
TOOTH	f	(to her fairies) Pittsburg, boy eight, two molars. Saltwater taffy.
NORTH	m	Why are rabbits always so nervous.
BUNNYMUND	?	And why are you always such a blowhard!
NORTH	m	(turning his attention) Tooth! Can't you see we're trying to argue.
TOOTH	f	Sorry, not all of us get to work one night a year. Am I right, Sandy?
TOOTH	f	(to her fairies) San Diego, sector two! Five incisors, a bicuspid and a really loose molar on stand-by. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 12.
BUNNYMUND	?	Come on, mate, Pitch went out with the dark ages. We made sure of that - remember?
NORTH	m	Aah! Man in Moon! Sandy, why didn't you say something?
NORTH	m	(to Man in Moon) It's been a long time old friend! What is big news?
BUNNYMUND	?	It is Pitch.
NORTH	m	(back up to the moon) Manny...what must we do? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 13.
TOOTH	f	Ah, guys, you know what this means?
NORTH	m	He's choosing a new Guardian.
BUNNYMUND	?	What?! Why?
NORTH	m	Must be big deal! Manny thinks we need help!
BUNNYMUND	?	Since when do we need help?!
TOOTH	f	I wonder who it's gonna be?
TOOTH	f	Maybe the Leprechaun?
BUNNYMUND	?	Please not the groundhog, please not the groundhog.
NORTH	m	Jack Frost.
BUNNYMUND	?	Ah, I take it back! The Groundhog's fine! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 14.
TOOTH	f	(caught admiring Jack) Well, ah, as long he helps to ah...to protect the children, right?
BUNNYMUND	?	Jack Frost!? He doesn't care about children! All he does is freeze water pipes and mess with my egg hunts. Right? He's an irresponsible, selfish...
NORTH	m	Guardian.
BUNNYMUND	?	Jack Frost is many things, but he is not a Guardian.
RUSSIAN BOY	m	(tongue stuck to frozen
ICE)	?	Aahhhhh...! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 15.
JACK	m	Ah, now that, that was fun. Hey wind...

CLAUDE	m	I hope we can find the eggs with all this snow!
CALEB	m	Stop!

CALEB	m	That's what you said about aliens.
CLAUDE	m	And the Easter Bunny.
JAMIE	m	(grabs his sled) Wow, the Easter Bunny is real!

KIDS	m	Ooooh!
JAMIE	m	Cool! A Tooth!
KIDS	m	Dude, that means cash! Tooth Fairy cash! I love the Tooth Fairy!
JACK	m	(his fun cut short) Oh, no...
KIDS	m	That's totally awesome. You lucky bug! Lucky!
JACK	m	No!
JAMIE	m	I gotta put this under my pillow!
KIDS	m	I wish I lost my tooth. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 24.
JACK	m	Ah, wait a minute! Come on, hold on, hold on! What about all that fun we just had? That wasn't the Tooth Fairy, that was me!
KIDS	m	I lost two teeth in one day once - remember that?! What are you gonna spend your money on? What are you gonna buy? How much do you think she's going to leave?
KIDS	m	Let's go...I'm cooold! My ears are freezing. I can't feel my toes. Ah, it's hot cocoa time.
JACK	m	What's a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here!
CUPCAKE	f	(walla; mocking her
FRIENDS)	?	"Oh, I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm co- old." Somebody take a picture. Hey, stop! That was really awesome.
JAMIE	m	-- and then BAM! The sofa hit me, and, and see? (opens mouth, tries to say `my tooth came out!) Ah hoo hay ow!
JAMIE'S MOM	f	Alright you, tooth under your pillow?
JAMIE	m	Yeah. I'm ready.

SOPHIE	f	Hide, hide, hide, hide!
JAMIE'S MOM	f	Uh uh, straight to bed now, mister.
JAMIE	m	Mom...
JACK	m	If there's something I'm doing wrong, can you, can you just tell me what it is? Because I've tried everything, and no one ever sees me. You put me here, the least you can do is tell me, tell me why.
JACK	m	Right on time, Sandman. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 27.
PITCH	m	Ohhhh, I thought I heard the clippity-clop of a unicorn. What an adorable dream!
PITCH	m	(leans down to Cupcake) And look. At. Her. Precious child. So sweet, so full of hope and wonder. Why, there's only one thing missing...a touch of fear.
PITCH	m	Hahaha! That never gets old!
PITCH	m	Feel your fear. Come on. Come on, that's right.
PITCH	m	Yesss. What a pretty little Nightmare.
PITCH	m	Now, I want you to go tell the others the wait is over. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 28.
PITCH	m	Don't look at me like that, old friend. You must have known this day would come. My Nightmares are finally ready. Are your Guardians?
JACK	m	Whoa! Did you leave the windows open again? The garage door is wide open.
BUNNYMUND	?	Been a long time. Blizzard of 68, I believe? Easter Sunday, wasn't it?
JACK	m	Bunny? You're not still mad about that...are yah?
BUNNYMUND	?	Yes.
BUNNYMUND	?	But this is about something else. Fellas...
JACK	m	Hey!
YETI	m	Durbha wahla.
JACK	m	Put me down! What the...
YETI	m	Durtal bardla burdlew.
YETI	m	Dwbard urghwetee.
BUNNYMUND	?	Me? Not on your nelly. See you back at the pole. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 30.
YETIS	m	Bwardla arghl.
JACK	m	Ahhhhhhhhh!
TOOTH	f	(to another fairy) Walla Walla, Washington. We've got a trampoline mishap at 1340 Ginger Lane.
NORTH	m	Quiet.
NORTH	m	Hey, there he is! Jack Frost!
JACK	m	Wow, you gotta be kidding me.
JACK	m	Hey, hey. Whoa, put me down.
NORTH	m	I hope the yetis treated you well?
JACK	m	Oh, yeah. I love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal.
NORTH	m	Oh, good! That was my idea! You know Bunny, obviously.
JACK	m	Obviously.
NORTH	m	And the Tooth Fairy?
TOOTH	f	Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you. And your teeth.
JACK	m	My, my what?
TOOTH	f	(moves in way too close) Open up! Are they really as white as they say? Yes! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 32.
TOOTH	f	Oh, they really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow.
TOOTH	f	Girls, pull yourselves together... Let's not disgrace the uniform.
NORTH	m	And Sandman. (sees Sandy is snoozing) Sandy! Sandy! Wake up!
JACK	m	Hey! Ho! Anyone wanna tell me why I'm here?
JACK	m	That's not really helping. But thanks, little man. I musta done something really bad to get you four together.
JACK	m	Am I on the naughty list?
NORTH	m	On naughty list? You hold record! But no matter. We overlook. Now we are wiping clean the slate.
JACK	m	How come?
BUNNYMUND	?	(more to North) Ah, good question.
NORTH	m	How come? I tell you how come! Because now...you are Guardian! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 33.
JACK	m	What are you doing! Get, get that offa me!
NORTH	m	This is the best part!
JACK	m	Huh?
JACK	m	What makes you think I want to be a Guardian?
NORTH	m	Of course you do! (to the elves) Music!
JACK	m	No music! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 34.
JACK	m	Look, this is all very flattering, but ah...you don't want me. You're all hard work and deadlines, and I'm snowballs and fun times. I'm not a Guardian.
BUNNYMUND	?	Yeah, that's exactly what I said!
TOOTH	f	Jack...I don't think you understand what it is we do.
TOOTH	f	Each of those lights is a child.
NORTH	m	A child who believes. And good or bad, naughty or nice, we protect them. Tooth...fingers out of mouth.
TOOTH	f	Oh, sorry. They're beautiful.
NORTH	m	Okay, no more wishy-washy! Pitch is out there doing who knows what!
JACK	m	You mean the Boogeyman?
NORTH	m	Yes! When Pitch threatens us, he threatens them as well. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 35.
JACK	m	All the more reason to pick someone more qualified!
NORTH	m	Pick? You think we pick? No, you were chosen like we were all chosen. By Man in Moon.
JACK	m	(stares, dumbstruck) What?
TOOTH	f	Last night, Jack. He chose you.
BUNNYMUND	?	Maybe.
JACK	m	The Man in the Moon, he talks to you?
NORTH	m	You see, you can not say no. It is destiny.
JACK	m	But why, why wouldn't he tell me that himself? After 300 years this is his answer? To spend eternity like you guys cooped up in some, some hideout thinking of, of new ways to bribe kids? No no, that's not for me. No offense.
BUNNYMUND	?	How is that not offensive? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 36.
BUNNYMUND	?	You know what I think? I think we just dodged a bullet. I mean, what's this clown know about bringing joy to children anyway?
JACK	m	Uhh, you ever hear of a snow day? I know it's no hard-boiled egg, but kids like what I do.
BUNNYMUND	?	But none of 'em believe in you. (leans in to him) Do they? You see, you're invisible, mate. It's like you don't even exist.
TOOTH	f	Bunny! Enough!
JACK	m	No, the kangaroo's right.
BUNNYMUND	?	The, the what -- what'd you call me? I am not a kangaroo, mate.
JACK	m	Oh. And this whole time I thought you were. If you're not a kangaroo, what are you?
BUNNYMUND	?	I'm a bunny. The Easter Bunny. People believe in me.
NORTH	m	Jack. Walk with me.
JACK	m	It's nothing personal, North. What you all do, it's just, it's not my thing.
NORTH	m	Man in Moon says it is your thing. We will see!
JACK	m	Slow down, wouldja? I've been trying to bust in here for years, I want a good look.
NORTH	m	(peeved - still rushing) What do you mean, "bust in?"
JACK	m	Oh, don't worry, I never got past the yetis.
YETI	m	Rwwarrrrrr.
JACK	m	Oh, hey Phil.
NORTH	m	Keep up, Jack! Keep up! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 38.
JACK	m	Whoa! I always thought the elves made the toys.
NORTH	m	We just let them believe that.
NORTH	m	Very nice! Keep up good work!
NORTH	m	I don't like it. Paint it red.
NORTH	m	Step it up, everybody.
NORTH	m	Fruit cake?
JACK	m	Ah, no, thanks. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 39.
NORTH	m	Now we get down to tacks of brass!
JACK	m	Tacks of brass?
NORTH	m	Who are you, Jack Frost? What is your center?
JACK	m	My center?
NORTH	m	If Man in Moon chose you to be a Guardian, you must have something very special inside.
NORTH	m	Hmmmm?
NORTH	m	Here. This is how you see me, no? Very big, intimidating. But if you get to know me a little-- (hands the doll to Jack) Well, go on.
JACK	m	You are downright jolly.
NORTH	m	Ah, but not just jolly... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 40.
NORTH	m	I am also mysterious. (twist - smaller doll) And fearless. (twist - smaller doll) And caring. And at my center...
JACK	m	There's a tiny wooden baby?
NORTH	m	Look closer. What do you see?
JACK	m	You have big eyes?
NORTH	m	Yes! Big eyes. Very big. Because they are full! Of wonder! That is my center. It is what I was born with. Eyes that have always seen the wonder in everything!
NORTH	m	Eyes that see lights in the trees, and magic in the air!
NORTH	m	This wonder is what I put into the world, and what I protect in children. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 41.
NORTH	m	It is what makes me a Guardian. It is my center. What is yours?
JACK	m	I don't know.
BUNNYMUND	?	We have a problem, mate! Trouble at the Tooth Palace. Boys, ship shape. As soon as impossible.
JACK	m	North, North! I told you, I'm not going with you guys! There is no way I'm climbing into some rickety old...
JACK	m	...sleigh.
JACK	m	Whoa! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 42.
NORTH	m	Hey! Moi deti, moi deti. Quiet, quiet.
JACK	m	Okay, one ride, but that's it.
NORTH	m	Everyone loves the sleigh.
NORTH	m	Bunny, what are you waiting for?
BUNNYMUND	?	I think my tunnels might be faster, mate. And um, and safer.
NORTH	m	Ah, get in. (hoists Bunnymund up) Buckle up!
BUNNYMUND	?	Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are the bloody seatbelts?!
NORTH	m	That was just expression!
NORTH	m	Are we ready?
NORTH	m	Good! Let's go! Clear! (cracks the reigns) Hyah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 43.
NORTH	m	Out of the way!
NORTH	m	Hyah!
BUNNYMUND	?	Ohhhhhh no!
BUNNYMUND	?	Slow down, slow down!
NORTH	m	I hope you like the loopty loops!
BUNNYMUND	?	I hope you like carrots.
NORTH	m	Here we go!
JACK	m	WOOO-HOOOOOO!!!!!!
NORTH	m	Klasno! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 44.
JACK	m	Whoa!
JACK	m	Hey, Bunny--
JACK	m	Check out this view--
JACK	m	Awww...you do care.
BUNNYMUND	?	Ah, rack off you bloody show pony!
NORTH	m	Hold on everyone, I know a shortcut.
BUNNYMUND	?	Oh strewth, I knew we should have taken the tunnels.
NORTH	m	I say, Tooth Palace.
NORTH	m	Hyah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 45.
NORTH	m	What!?
NORTH	m	What are they!?
BUNNYMUND	?	Whoa!
JACK	m	They're taking the tooth fairies!
JACK	m	Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 46.
NORTH	m	Here, take over!
BUNNYMUND	?	Huh?
JACK	m	Hyah!
NORTH	m	Yah!
BUNNYMUND	?	They're stealing the teeth!
NORTH	m	Jack, look out!
JACK	m	Aaaahhhh!
NORTH	m	Tooth! Are you alright? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 47.
TOOTH	f	They, they took my fairies! And the teeth! All of them! Everything is gone! Everything.
TOOTH	f	Oh thank goodness! One of you is alright!
PITCH	m	The Big Four, all in one place. I'm a little star-struck. Did you like my show on the globe, North? Got you all together, didn't I?
TOOTH	f	Pitch, you have got thirty seconds to return my fairies!
PITCH	m	You'll stick a quarter under my pillow?
NORTH	m	Why are you doing this?
PITCH	m	Maybe I want what you have. To be believed in. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 48.
PITCH	m	Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds.
BUNNYMUND	?	Maybe that's where you belong.
PITCH	m	Ah, go suck an egg, rabbit! Since when are you all so chummy?
JACK	m	We're not.
PITCH	m	Oh good.
PITCH	m	A neutral party. Then I'm going to ignore you. But, you must be used to that by now.
BUNNYMUND	?	Pitch! You shadow sneaking rat- bag! Come here!
TOOTH	f	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
PITCH	m	Whoa! Hey, easy, girl. Easy. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 49.
PITCH	m	Look familiar, Sandman? Took me a while to perfect this little trick. Turning dreams into Nightmares.
PITCH	m	Don't be nervous, it only riles them up more. They smell fear you know.
BUNNYMUND	?	What fear? Of you!? No one's been afraid of you since the Dark Ages!
PITCH	m	Oh, the Dark Ages. Everyone frightened. Miserable. Such happy times for me. Oh, the power I wielded!
PITCH	m	Well that's all about to change.
PITCH	m	Oh look, it's happening already.
JACK	m	What is?
JACK	m	What's going on?
TOOTH	f	They, they don't believe in me anymore. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 51.
PITCH	m	Didn't they tell you, Jack? It's great being a Guardian -- but there's a catch. If enough kids stop believing, everything your friends protect - wonder, hopes and dreams - it all goes away. And little by little, so do they.
PITCH	m	No Christmas, or Easter, or little fairies that come in the night. There will be nothing. But fear and darkness and me! It's your turn not to be believed in!
NORTH	m	He's gone.
JACK	m	I'm sorry, about the fairies.
TOOTH	f	(not her bubbly self) You should've seen them. They put up such a fight.
JACK	m	Why would Pitch take the teeth?
TOOTH	f	It's not the teeth he wanted. It's the memories inside them.
JACK	m	What do you mean?
TOOTH	f	That's why we collect the teeth, Jack. They hold the most important memories of childhood.
TOOTH	f	My fairies and I watch over them and when someone needs to remember what's important, we help them.
TOOTH	f	We had everyone's here. Yours too.
JACK	m	My memories?
TOOTH	f	From when you were young. Before you became Jack Frost.
JACK	m	But, I wasn't anyone before I was Jack Frost. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 53.
TOOTH	f	Of course you were. We were all someone before we were chosen.
JACK	m	What?
NORTH	m	You should've seen Bunny.
BUNNYMUND	?	Hey, I told you never to mention that!
JACK	m	That night at the pond...I just, why I assumed...Are you saying, are you saying I had a life before that? With a home? And a family?
TOOTH	f	You really don't remember?
JACK	m	All these years, and the answers were right here. If I find my memories, then I'll know why I'm here. You have to show me.
TOOTH	f	I...I can't, Jack. Pitch has them.
JACK	m	Then we have to get them back!
TOOTH	f	Oh no! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 54.
TOOTH	f	The children. We're too late.
NORTH	m	No! No! No such thing as too late! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Idea!! HAHH!!
NORTH	m	We will collect the teeth!
TOOTH	f	What?
NORTH	m	We get teeth! Children keep believing in you!
TOOTH	f	We're talking seven continents! Millions of kids!
NORTH	m	Give me break! You know how many toys I deliver in one night?
BUNNYMUND	?	And eggs I hide in one day?
NORTH	m	And Jack, if you help us, we will get you your memories.
JACK	m	I'm in.
NORTH	m	Quickly! Quickly!
BUNNYMUND	?	Here we go, here we go...
JACK	m	Hop to it rabbit, I'm five teeth ahead!
BUNNYMUND	?	Yeah right, look, I'd tell you to stay outta my way, but really what's the point -- because you won't be able to keep up anyway.
JACK	m	Is that a challenge, cottontail?
BUNNYMUND	?	Oh, you don't wanna race a rabbit, mate.
NORTH	m	A race? Is it a race??
NORTH	m	This is going to be... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 56.
NORTH	m	EPIC!!
TOOTH	f	Four bicuspids over there! An incisor two blocks east! Is that a molar? They're EVERYWHERE!
TOOTH	f	Ow!
JACK	m	Ah, you okay?
TOOTH	f	Fine...sorry, it's been a really long time since I've been out in the field.
JACK	m	How long is a long time?
TOOTH	f	Ah, four hundred forty years...give or take.
JACK	m	Hmm...
TWINS	m	Yipa!!
BUNNYMUND	?	Jackpot!
BUNNYMUND	?	Looks like you're a bit of a brumby, hey mate.
NORTH	m	Is piece of pie! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 58.
BUNNYMUND	?	Ow!
NORTH	m	That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy!
TOOTH	f	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there, champ! He's one of us! Part of the European division. (to the mouse) Ca va?
BUNNYMUND	?	Huh? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 59.
BUNNYMUND	?	Crikey!
JACK	m	Yes!
JACK	m	No!
BUNNYMUND	?	Haha! Ho, ho, ho!
TOOTH	f	Wow! You guys collect teeth and leave gifts as fast as my fairies.
TOOTH	f	You guys have been leaving gifts, right?
PITCH	m	The lights...why aren't they going out?
PITCH	m	They're collecting the teeth?
PITCH	m	Oh pipe down, or I'll stuff a pillow with you!
PITCH	m	Fine, have your last hurrah. For tomorrow, all you pathetic scrambling will be for nothing. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 62.
JACK	m	Kids, huh?
TOOTH	f	This was always the part I liked most - seeing the kids. Why did I ever stop doing this?

PITCH	m	Teeth? Why do you care about the teeth? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 70.
PITCH	m	Now this is who I'm looking for--
PITCH	m	Whoa--??
JACK	m	Remind me not to get on your bad side.
PITCH	m	(looks up, pleading) Okay, easy! You can't blame me for trying, Sandy. You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated. It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams. So I'll tell you what-
PITCH	m	You can have `em back! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 71.
JACK	m	You take the ones on the left, I'll take the ones on the right?

NORTH	m	Done something? Jack, you stood up to Pitch. You saved us.
JACK	m	But Sandy wo--
NORTH	m	(putting his hand on
JACK'S SHOULDER)	m	Would be proud of what you did.
NORTH	m	I don't know who you were in your past life, but in this life you are Guardian.
JACK	m	But how can I know who I am, until I find out who I was?
NORTH	m	You will. I feel it, in my belly.

BUNNYMUND	?	(twirling his boomerang) Hey, buck up ya sad-sacks. Come on! We can still turn this around! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 78.
BUNNYMUND	?	Easter is tomorrow and I need your help. I say we pull out all the stops and we get those little lights flickering again!

JACK	m	Blood and gums? When was the last time you guys actually hung out with kids?
SOPHIE	f	Peek-a-boo.
NORTH	m	We are very busy bringing joy to children! We don't have time... ...for children.

BUNNYMUND	?	That's a beauty!
BUNNYMUND	?	Now all we gotta do is get him and his little mates through the tunnels, to the top, and we'll have ourselves Easter.
JACK	m	Not bad.
BUNNYMUND	?	Not bad yourself.
JACK	m	Look, I'm sorry about that whole, you know, the "kangaroo" thing.

TOOTH	f	I love her! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 85.

PITCH	m	Maybe not. But you are afraid of something.
JACK	m	You think so, huh? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 89.
PITCH	m	I know so. It's the one thing I always know.
PITCH	m	People's greatest fears. Yours is that no one will ever believe in you.
PITCH	m	Well fear not, for the answer to that...
PITCH	m	Is right here.
PITCH	m	Do you want them, Jack? Your memories? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 90.
PITCH	m	...in this little box.
PITCH	m	Why did you end up like this? Unseen. Unable to reach out to anyone. You want the answers so badly. You want to grab them, and fly off with them. But you're afraid of what the Guardians will think.
PITCH	m	You're afraid of disappointing them. Well let me ease your mind about one thing. They'll never accept you. Not really.
JACK	m	(trying to scramble away) Stop it! Stop it!
PITCH	m	After all, you're not one of them.
JACK	m	You don't know what I am! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 91.

BUNNYMUND	?	They don't see me. They don't see me.
NORTH	m	The Nightmares attacked the tunnels. They smashed every egg, crushed every basket. Nothing made it to the surface.
TOOTH	f	Where did you get that?
JACK	m	I was...it's... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 94.
TOOTH	f	Where's Baby Tooth? Oh Jack, what have you done?

JACK	m	No, listen, listen...I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. He has to go.

PITCH	m	They never really believed in you. I was just trying to show you that. But I understand. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 97.
JACK	m	You don't understand anything!
PITCH	m	No? I don't know what it's like to be cast out?
PITCH	m	All those years in the shadows I thought, no one else knows what this feels like. But now I see I was wrong.
PITCH	m	We don't have to be alone, Jack.
PITCH	m	I believe in you. And I know children will too.
JACK	m	In me?
PITCH	m	Yes! Look at what we can do! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 98.
PITCH	m	What goes together better than cold and dark?
PITCH	m	We can make them believe. We'll give them a world where everything, everything is...
JACK	m	Pitch black...
PITCH	m	And Jack Frost too. They'll believe in both of us.
JACK	m	No, they'll fear both of us. And that's not what I want.

PITCH	m	Very well. You want to be left alone? Done. But first...
JACK	m	Baby Tooth! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 99.

PITCH	m	No. You said you wanted to be alone. So be alone!
JACK	m	No!
JACK	m	Baby Tooth!
JACK	m	You alright?
JACK	m	Sorry, all I can do is keep you cold.
JACK	m	Pitch was right - I make a mess of everything.
JACK	m	Hey?
JACK'S MOTHER	f	Come on Jack, you can't have fun all the time.
JACK'S SISTER	f	Jack, get down from there!
JACK'S MOTHER	f	Be careful.
JACK	m	We will.

JACK'S SISTER	f	Jack, I'm scared.
JACK	m	I know, I know...but you're gonna be alright. You're not gonna fall in. We're gonna have a little fun instead.
JACK'S SISTER	f	No we're not!
JACK	m	Would I trick you?
JACK'S SISTER	f	(fighting back tears) Yes! You always play tricks!

JAMIE	m	If it wasn't a dream and if you are real, then you have to prove it. Like right now. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 108.
JAMIE	m	(desperation creeping in) I've believed in you for a long time, okay? Like my whole life in fact. So you kinda owe me now.
