ALI	m	It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid with me. She can't take care of him anymore. I got into a fight with the guy she's with. I don't know where to go. What do I do with the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more credit... Call me back! He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam.
ALI	m	Move it! His phone rings. He immediately answers.
ALI	m	Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do I get there? I don't know. Today or tomorrow. Yeah... Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny, he looks like a squirrel on his father's back.
SAM	m	I'm thirsty.
ALI	m	We don't have any money.
SAM	m	I'm thirsty!
ALI	m	Stop it. Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their banging.
ALI	m	I said to stop it. The sandals freeze. Cut.
ALI	m	I don't know. A big street that started at the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We just came from there! Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to the beach...
SAM	m	I'm tired.
ALI	m	So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on! Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder.
RICHARD	m	(Southern accent)... A couple miles back I saw a blond guy. (Imitates screeching brakes) I stop short! "You Ali?" I ask. He says "No, me Kurt". Another few hundred feet, another big blond guy! (Screech) I ask "You Ali?" again. This time I didn't even understand what he answered. Another few hundred feet... Ten of them! Ten! Every Kraut and Flemish guy on the coast! So I go call your sister... Ali is thrown for a loop.
ALI	m	(uncertain) You kidding?
RICHARD	m	A little.
SAM	m	(to Ali) Is he a little crazy?
RICHARD	m	(to Sam) What? You don't like my truck?
SAM	m	Yeah I do.
RICHARD	m	(pretending to be shocked) He doesn't like my truck!
SAM	m	I do too like it! Worked up, Sam shrieks, holding his hands over his ears:
SAM	m	(screaming) I like your truck! The road hugs the seashore. Ali watches beaches, homes, a railway line pass by... Voice over, we hear Richard's
RICHARD	m	We all got fired after some Spanish guy bought out the trucking company... Eight truckers. I thought it over, discussed it with your sister and figured I could do it on my own. So I bought this truck with my severance pay... Ali has finished his cream cheese sandwiches. He gets up and opens the old fridge.
RICHARD	m	Oops, poor man, not those! She'll kill you! Start with the expired ones, on the top shelf! They're organized by date. First the top shelf, then move down.... Anna brings it home from the supermarket where she works. As soon as they reach their expiration date, those idiots throw it all away, even if you can still eat it for a week! (to Sam) You want some more?
ANNA	f	(with a hint of Southern accent) Is this all you have for him? Anna Van Versh, Ali's sister, is in her thirties. She is a huge woman, very tall with a pretty face. She wears leggings that make her ass look like a workhorse's and a pair of flip flops. At the bottom of the bag, Anna finds a passport and opens it. It is Sam's.
ANNA	f	She remembered his passport!
ALI	m	She didn't remember anything. It was already in there. She forgot about it, that's all. When they went to Amsterdam, they'd use the kid to smuggle dope...
ANNA	f	You got to be kidding!
ALI	m	That's what she told me. Anna shakes her head in disbelief. A beat.
ANNA	f	How will you tend to the kid? I won't be able to all the time. I work, and so does Richard... Was he in school there?
ALI	m	I don't know.
ANNA	f	You don't know if your kid's in school?
ALI	m	Um, no. (turns to Sam) You in school? No answer. Sam is watching TV.
ANNA	f	Back at your mom's place, did you go to school?
SAM	m	Yes.
ANNA	f	I can try to enroll him at the school. I'll see... We also need to get him some clothes. He can't go like that... I'll ask the neighbors. (gives the child her hand) Come with me to
ANNA	f	You want to pet them? She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh.
ANNA	f	Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws. They're just babies. Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up.
ANNA	f	(to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next month. Brings in some money. Otherwise, Richard and I were thinking 300 a month for you and the kid... That okay?
ALI	m	Yeah.
ANNA	f	"Yeah" what? Is that too much?
ALI	m	It's not too much, but I don't have it. I had to pay for the train...
ANNA	f	So what are you going to do?
ALI	m	I don't know. Find a job. Whatever.
ANNA	f	Yeah, whatever... You think there's any work around here? You think there's any more here than there? Where has that ever been the case? When you told me you were coming down,
ALI	m	What should I have done with the kid? Where should I have gone?
ANNA	f	I have no idea, but if you stay here you have to pay your share, or else go somewhere else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy: we can't! How long were you thinking of staying?
ALI	m	I don't know. She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house, calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel, giggling in delight. He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special 50 moped, plastic junk, etc. Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights shining.
SECURITY GUARD	m	Unzip your jacket! Empty your pockets! Ali keeps his cool.
ALI	m	Unzip it yourself! Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges: The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off.
ALI	m	Hey! Here I am! Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who is sniffling, tears in his eyes.
ALI	m	No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all alone. Ali unlocks the moped.
ALI	m	Are you happy here? Sam nods.
SAM	m	Mm.
ALI	m	What do you like the most at Auntie's?
SAM	m	The dogs.
ALI	m	Is that all? Nothing else besides the dogs?
SAM	m	The truck.
ALI	m	The dogs and the truck. The house? Auntie? The ocean?
SAM	m	The dogs and the truck. Ali nods. Sam watches his Dad's fat fingers assemble the plastic toy from his Happy Meal.
ALI	m	We have it good here... Ali's fingers stop. Sam looks up to find his father watching some girls in swimsuits go by. They go for a swim, horsing around and making noise.
OWNER	m	No criminal record? You never fucked up?
ALI	m	No. The boss is in his fifties. He sits behind some files. His hair is short and white, it looks like he's wearing a helmet. He is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie. He stares at Ali.
OWNER	m	Is that the truth? We'll be checking anyway... Ali nods. The owner reaches out.
OWNER	m	Your papers... Ali hands him his tattered paper ID. The owner writes down the number. Ali is 13-14 on the picture.
OWNER	m	What was your last job?
ALI	m	I worked in a slaughterhouse. Not for long. It closed.
OWNER	m	Ever work in security?
ALI	m	Yeah. I was a night watchman in a stadium for 6 months. Working for the city. In a parking lot too. I did replacements.
OWNER	m	Ever do any combat sports?
ALI	m	Karate, for 6 years. I even won Junior Division. And two years of boxing. Thai.
OWNER	m	You gave it up?
ALI	m	It was my trainer who gave up.
OWNER	m	Why?
ALI	m	He died. A beat.
OWNER	m	And how are you physically? You stay in shape?
ALI	m	Yeah.
OWNER	m	You don't smoke?
ALI	m	No.
OWNER	m	Drink? He shakes his head "no". The boss notes something in a file.
FOUED	m	Okay, I'll let you through because I'm outnumbered. Four against one, I don't stand a chance! The girls smile and disappear inside. Ali watches them vanish.
FOUED	m	You say something nice, anything. That way, when they leave, they remember you and you can hit on them. If they're a little plastered, if things didn't go too well for them, you're there with a nice thing to say...
ALI	m	And it works?
FOUED	m	Sometimes. But you can't be dressed like that. Like a parking lot attendant... They are interrupted by the bouncer.
THE CAUCASIAN	m	(pointing) Fight! They go running. Three guys are fighting like savages. Ali and Foued clean house. Foued gets rid of gawkers. Ali delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off
ALI	m	Are you okay? Breathe out of your mouth. In and out. Put your head back. Walk a little. Walk and breathe... He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her to walk. She looks groggy.
STEPHANIE	f	I have to go home...
ALI	m	You have friends here?
STEPHANIE	f	No, I came alone. I have my car in the lot. I'll be fine.
ALI	m	You can't drive like that.
STEPHANIE	f	I'm fine. I'm fine, I said. Thanks.
ALI	m	You can't drive like that. I'll call you a cab.
STEPHANIE	f	How do I get my car afterwards? Seriously, I'll be fine. Trust me! We hear a voice from the parking lot.
ANGRY MAN	m	Bitch! Stephanie looks back.
ANGRY MAN	m	Yeah... you, you cunt. Bitch! She ignores him, pretending not to see him. She then notices the blood stains on her T-shirt.
STEPHANIE	f	Shit.
ALI	m	Where's your car?
ALI	m	Still bleeding? Keep your head back. Wait... He manipulates the knob to push her seat back. He grimaces in pain.
ALI	m	Shit!
STEPHANIE	f	Did you hurt yourself? He shows her his right wrist.
STEPHANIE	f	It's swelling up. He rests his hand on the wheel. After a beat:
ALI	m	You often go to the Fever?
STEPHANIE	f	No.
ALI	m	Why do you go alone? No answer.
ALI	m	To dance?
STEPHANIE	f	Yes.
ALI	m	To find a guy? She turns and looks down her nose at him:
STEPHANIE	f	Oh yeah?
ALI	m	You're dressed like that just for dancing?
STEPHANIE	f	How am I dressed?
ALI	m	I don't know... Look. He points to her skirt, riding up her thighs.
STEPHANIE	f	Yeah, so what?
ALI	m	You look like a hooker.
STEPHANIE	f	Excuse me?
ALI	m	How would you call it?
STEPHANIE	f	I don't believe this. Pull over here!
ALI	m	What?
STEPHANIE	f	Stop this car on the double!
STEPHANIE	f	It's MY car! If I tell you to stop, you stop! Still no reaction, as if she hadn't said a thing. She is about to scream again, but remains silent, although open- mouthed. She finally settles back down on the back of her seat and looks elsewhere. A beat.
ALI	m	Dressed like that, it's no surprise that...
STEPHANIE	f	That's enough now! They ride in silence.
STEPHANIE	f	How will you get back?
ALI	m	I don't know. She takes out her wallet.
ALI	m	No, stop!
STEPHANIE	f	For a taxi.
ALI	m	Don't worry. Got any ice at your place? He shows her his wrist.
ALI	m	Ice cubes.
STEPHANIE	f	Wait, I'll go check.
ALI	m	I can come up.
STEPHANIE	f	No! Even she is surprised by the brusqueness of her response.
STEPHANIE	f	(embarrassed) Someone's up there.
ALI	m	So what?
STEPHANIE	f	Wait here. I'll be right back. She takes a few steps, fumbling for her keys. She hesitates, then looks back.
STEPHANIE	f	Okay, come on up.
SIMON	m	What the hell? What's going on?
STEPHANIE	f	Nothing. A fight...
SIMON	m	Are you okay?
STEPHANIE	f	Yeah, I'm fine.
SIMON	m	(pointing to Ali) Who's he?
STEPHANIE	f	The bouncer from the Fever. He drove me home.
ALI	m	(introducing himself)... Ali.
SIMON	m	The Fever? What the hell were you doing there? Ali opens the refrigerator.
SIMON	m	What are you looking for?
ALI	m	Ice cubes.
STEPHANIE	f	He hurt his hand... Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom. Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl. Ali's hand in the bowl. He looks around. There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back of a killer whale, Stephanie posing with a group of young people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo, Stephanie rising out of the water on Niska's rostrum, etc. From the nearby bedroom, he hears snatches of Simon's
SIMON	m	If you decide to go out, call me. That's all! Who were you with there?
STEPHANIE	f	Philippe and Christine.
SIMON	m	I thought you went out to dinner.
STEPHANIE	f	We decided to go out for a drink after.
SIMON	m	You get my text messages? Why didn't you answer me? Stephanie comes back into the kitchen. She has changed her T-shirt. She seems tense.
STEPHANIE	f	Feeling better?
ALI	m	Is that you in the picture with the orcas?
STEPHANIE	f	Not orcas. Just one orca. Her name is Niska.
ALI	m	Is that your job?
STEPHANIE	f	Yep... Ali nods vaguely admiringly.
ALI	m	Fuck... I didn't think that...
STEPHANIE	f	That what? A whore could train whales? Well, you see... Simon is at the door. He is wearing a jean.
SIMON	m	(To Ali) Okay, are you done now? Can you leave us alone? Ali stares him down.
ALI	m	You talking to me? It's as if Ali's calm, peremptory tone suddenly let Simon know who he was dealing with.
SIMON	m	Yes, but...
ALI	m	But what?
SIMON	m	Nothing, forget it... In one second, Stephanie sees Simon's face undergo a metamorphosis, his nervous authority suddenly disappear. She glances at Ali as if to say ‘Please go now.' He gets up and wipes his hands on a dish rag.
ALI	m	Okay, I'm going. So long. (pointing to a piece of paper on the table) I left you my number if ever you need it...
SIMON	m	Are you okay? Are you upset?
STEPHANIE	f	No, I'm not upset. She drinks the aspirin.
STEPHANIE	f	I saw your face before...
SIMON	m	Before?
STEPHANIE	f	With that guy who dropped me off. I saw your face. I saw how you piped down.
SIMON	m	I piped down? Me?
STEPHANIE	f	Yes, you piped down... (pause) Don't tell me what I should do, how I should live my life. Don't give me any more orders, Simon.
SIMON	m	What does that mean?
STEPHANIE	f	Don't give me any more orders, that's all. She turns on the faucet and runs her lips under the water.
TRAINER	m	Coming? No answer. Tension. He leaves without a word. Louise looks up. She has been crying. Stephanie looks at her, impassive. Louise swallows her tears.
LOUISE	f	Really... this isn't fair.
STEPHANIE	f	No, Louise, there are lots of things you can say but not that. The pools are my responsibility and all I care about are the animals. I have to see to their environment and that starts with their trainers. Do you understand?
LOUISE	f	What are you trying to make me believe, that I wasn't up to par?
STEPHANIE	f	No, listen.
LOUISE	f	Lacking in maturity? Skills?
STEPHANIE	f	You're not consistent. We've already discussed that. The foundation of the relationship with the orcas is stability. During your internship you've had your ups and downs. It's not your competence that...
LOUISE	f	You know this has nothing to do with my internship. You couldn't care less if I was competent or not! It has to do with that I fucked Michael. Just say so.
STEPHANIE	f	Oh, please...
LOUISE	f	And in fact what really bothers you is not that we fucked, but that he told me about you. How you think you're so... How you've become such a bitch. That's why you're firing me. That's what you should write in your report.
STEPHANIE	f	Okay, are you done? We can stop here. No need to spoil the rest of your internship. Louise stands up.
STEPHANIE	f	What... What happened?
LOUISE	f	Tom and Niska... They got in each other's way. Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving suit. She tries to find a pressure point. Stephanie sees Louise's face wet with tears:
STEPHANIE	f	Stop it, calm down. I'm fine! Her hand searches for something at thigh level, without finding it. She faints.
ALI	m	Sam! No answer. There is some noise over at the kennel. He goes and finds Sam in the kennel, talking to the puppies.
ALI	m	What are you doing here?
ALI	m	You're gross! You stink! Who's taking care of you? Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down. The water is freezing cold. Sam hops from one foot to the other and screams.
SAM	m	Stop it, Dad! It's cold. Stop! Sam shrieks. An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee- shirt comes out of a neighboring house: Joelle, the neighbors' daughter.
ALI	m	Aren't you supposed to be taking care of him? What the fuck are you up to?
JOELLE	f	I was next doing the laundry.
ALI	m	Take a look at him!
JOELLE	f	I'll put him in the shower.
ALI	m	(to Sam, crying) Don't go in there. It's disgusting. You hear? Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside. Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel. Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on the back of a killer whale.  Il manque une phrase
JOELLE	f	There was an accident at Marineland. Ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen.
ALI	m	I know her. Sam pulls off his towel. He watches his father who is riveted to the screen, glued to the looping footage of the accident.
LOUISE	f	Help! Help! Please! On the linoleum, two stumps stick out of Stephanie's nightshirt: two thick bandages surround her thighs that look like two wrapped hams.
STEPHANIE	f	My legs! What did you do with my legs? Two nurses arrive. Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms. Louise rocks her gently. Stephanie's eyes struggle against sleep. She wants to scream again, but doesn't have the strength. She
LOUISE	f	I stopped by your place. I saw the cleaning woman. She didn't want me to pay her. She was... in shock. She's scared to come here. She sends her regards. She closes her eyes. Black. She opens them. - A blonde, pretty woman in her fifties is sitting behind Stephanie, her face is close to hers. It is her mother. She speaks with a slight accent.
MOTHER	f	I spoke to your brothers. They wanted to talk to you but I didn't think it was the right time. We'll all come with Hugo during the next school break... I was afraid I might lose you. I don't know what I'd have
MOTHER	f	(in German) Hugo wanted to say goodbye to you. We're leaving tomorrow but we'll pray for you, honey. Her eyes remain open. Black.
GILLES	m	(to Stephanie) Want me to tell you something?
GILLES	m	You haven't finished mourning, that's all!
STEPHANIE	f	Really? Mourning who?
GILLES	m	Your legs.
STEPHANIE	f	Mourning my legs?
GILLES	m	Yes. He sounds as serious as a civics teacher. She looks at him, incredulous. Raphael sticks his head up front.
RAPHAEL	m	Pass me the joint... Gilles' pincer and joint go for Raphael's lips. He takes a long hit.
GILLES	m	They were a part of you. When a man dies, he gets buried. There's a ceremony, a prayer... Now a piece of you ended up in a hospital trashcan without a prayer, without any time for meditation. A beat. She is dumbstruck. She cannot believe what she's hearing. In the backseat, Raphael exhales some smoke into Julia's open mouth. GILLES (cont'd) You have to think about it symbolically...
STEPHANIE	f	Yeah, it's really symbolic...
GILLES	m	I know where my arm is. We buried it under a nice oak tree behind my house in the scrubland. My wife and kids came and we sang... Stephanie has a fit of the giggles.
GILLES	m	(a bit vexed) You think I'm kidding?
STEPHANIE	f	No, it's the grass. I'll stop... She laughs so hard she cries.
RAPHAEL	m	Shit, it's a laugh riot up there. (to Gilles) Can you take us home? She looks back and, between the seats, notices the girl toying with Raphael's fly.
GILLES	m	I'm too beat. I'll take a nap, then go. (to Stephanie) How are you getting home?
ALI	m	What do you want?
MARTIAL	m	To come in. The guy takes out a card and presses it against the glass door: it's the business card of ALTA SECU, the security agency.
ALI	m	Hey, Kadhi, come here! Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy.
KADHI	m	Okay, okay... Are you Martial?
MARTIAL	m	Yeah.
KADHI	m	Give me your keys.
ALI	m	Who's he?
KADHI	m	It's fine. The boss told me he was coming. He works for the company. Ali hands him the bunch of keys.
ALI	m	Will this do?
MARTIAL	m	Perfect. Put it down there. Martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf.
MARTIAL	m	Imagine you're the manager of a big store like this and the union reps have been busting your balls. What do you do?
ALI	m	Fire them.
MARTIAL	m	You think that's how it works? What do you do before you fire them? He checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole, then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket monitor.
MARTIAL	m	Well, beforehand you try to see how long they spend in the restroom, if they take extra-long coffee breaks, smoke on the premises, steal from the stockroom, rip customers off with the sales receipts... When you know all that, you put the pressure on them and you fire the ones who don't leave. Can you give me a stroll down the aisle?
ALI	m	A stroll?
MARTIAL	m	Walk down the aisle. No, further down, like you came out of that door there. Good, perfect... Ali twice passes within the camera's field of vision. Martial climbs down his ladder.
MARTIAL	m	That's it.
ALI	m	Okay, then I'll be getting back.
MARTIAL	m	Hold on! Martial pulls a 10 Euro bill from a jacket pocket.
ALI	m	It's fine.
MARTIAL	m	Take it. Angle on the bill in Ali's hand.
ALI	m	Hello?
STEPHANIE	f	It's Stephanie. Remember me? We met at the Fever. Ali is taken by surprise.
ALI	m	Yeah... How are you doing? She sniggers. Her speech sounds slow and thick.
STEPHANIE	f	You know what happened to me?
ALI	m	Yeah... I saw the papers… the news on TV… How are you?
STEPHANIE	f	(sniggering) How do you think I am? A beat. Ali is at a loss to answer.
STEPHANIE	f	How are you?
ALI	m	Okay... normal.
STEPHANIE	f	Still a bouncer?
ALI	m	No, not really.
STEPHANIE	f	You want to get together?
ALI	m	Yeah, but nights are tough. I'm a security guard now. Three nights a week.
STEPHANIE	f	I'm... crazy busy too. Every day and every night. I don't know how to manage... A beat.
STEPHANIE	f	Now.
ALI	m	Huh?
STEPHANIE	f	Come now.
STEPHANIE	f	Come in. She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote control. She activates it and the door closes behind Ali. Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T- shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom whose legs hang limp.
STEPHANIE	f	Have you been waiting long?
ALI	m	No... I just got here.
STEPHANIE	f	Was that you who rang before? She looks exhausted but feverish.
ALI	m	No.
STEPHANIE	f	Come in. Sit down. He sits down on a small couch.
STEPHANIE	f	Want something to drink? A coffee?
ALI	m	Yes.
STEPHANIE	f	I only have instant.
ALI	m	That's fine. It takes two tries to activate the wheels on her wheelchair.
ALI	m	Need any help? She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen. He sees her pajama legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap.
ALI	m	Have you been living here long?
STEPHANIE	f	I don't know... Three or four months.
ALI	m	(looking around)... It's nice. She comes back.
ALI	m	Are you alone? You got no one to help you?
STEPHANIE	f	Help me what? Walk?
ALI	m	No, for the cleaning and everything...
STEPHANIE	f	Yeah there are people. They come and go. Hold on. She manages to navigate from the living room into her bedroom. He stays in the living room. He hears a kettle whistle in the kitchen. He goes into the kitchen and pours water into the glass/mug. He finds her hunched over in her
ALI	m	Hey, are you okay?
STEPHANIE	f	I'm fine. He opens the window.
STEPHANIE	f	Does it stink here?
ALI	m	Yeah, a little.
STEPHANIE	f	It's me. He opens the curtains and looks outside. It is getting hot out. The automatic sprinklers have gone on.
ALI	m	Let's go out. (No answer) Hey, you hear me?
STEPHANIE	f	Yes.
ALI	m	Let's go out.
STEPHANIE	f	No.
ALI	m	Get dressed.
STEPHANIE	f	Leave me alone.
ALI	m	Where are your clothes? He opens the closet.
ALI	m	Here. Ali hands her a pair of sunglasses.
ALI	m	Where should we go?
STEPHANIE	f	I don't know. You're the one who wanted to go out...
ALI	m	Should we go to the ocean?
STEPHANIE	f	I don't care. He tries to push the wheelchair, but she stops him:
STEPHANIE	f	Stop it. I want to puke. He notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a sprinkler area. He goes to free it and gets splashed... Heavy chain, padlock... he comes back with soiled hands. When he comes back, she's gone. He sees the wheelchair moving toward the seafront avenue. He goes to join her.
ALI	m	I want to go in.
ALI	m	I feel like swimming!
STEPHANIE	f	Go ahead.
ALI	m	You don't want to?
STEPHANIE	f	Huh?
ALI	m	You don't feel like swimming? She looks daggers at him.
ALI	m	You don't have a bathing suit?
STEPHANIE	f	Do you realize what you're saying?
ALI	m	Who the fuck cares? There's no one here!
STEPHANIE	f	Forget it. He wavers a moment, then finally crosses the seafront avenue.
STEPHANIE	f	Actually I think I will go in. He looks at her. She covers herself with a towel and wiggles out of her pants, revealing what remains of her legs. Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their extremities.
STEPHANIE	f	You have to carry me. Help me...
ALI	m	(makes a gesture)... How, like this?
STEPHANIE	f	Yes. He lifts her up and carries her to the water. He takes her far enough in until she begins to float.
ALI	m	You okay?
STEPHANIE	f	Don't let me go! Not right away... Do it gently. She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually. She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread water. He joins her. She grabs onto him.
ALI	m	So?
STEPHANIE	f	I can't stop. If I do, I sink. Wait... She gesticulates...
STEPHANIE	f	This is bothering me! She takes off her T-shirt and hands it to him. Her breasts press against Ali's chest.
STEPHANIE	f	Okay, you can let go. She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put, holding her t-shirt. Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a burst of laughter. Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time to see how she's doing. She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She motions for him to come and get her. He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on to him, still out of breath.
ALI	m	You swim like a real pro!... She shuts her eyes.
STEPHANIE	f	Fuck that's good! The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away. They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe.
STEPHANIE	f	Thanks.
ALI	m	Huh?
STEPHANIE	f	Thanks.
FOUED	m	I have to get back. I need to train. Ali nods, without actually looking at him.
ALI	m	I'm still at the gym. I'm leaving... I said I'm leaving! He hangs up. They continue.
LOUISE	f	Steph! Made up and well-groomed, she looks older than she actually is. Stephanie answers from the bathroom.
STEPHANIE	f	I'm in here! Louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters the bedroom. Stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom, her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel.
LOUISE	f	Shit, you're not ready! The appointment is in a half hour!
STEPHANIE	f	It's fine!
LOUISE	f	What do you mean? You're a freaking pain! I have to get back to work. Come on, let me help you. She grabs the arms of the wheelchair and pushes Stephanie toward the closet.
STEPHANIE	f	Let go of me! Stop, I can manage alone.
LOUISE	f	Oh yeah? Okay, so manage then! She lets go of the wheelchair and leaves the bedroom.
STEPHANIE	f	(annoyed) I can do the seat belt! In front of the open trunk, Louise struggles to fold the wheelchair.
LOUISE	f	Can't you call them to tell them we're going to be late?
VITIAS	?	We'll order two pairs of prosthetic devices, one for everyday life and one for the sport you do. Stephanie pages through the various brochures.
STEPHANIE	f	Don't you have something simpler, classier?
VITIAS	?	What do you mean by classier?
STEPHANIE	f	I don't know... like a wooden leg with a piece of rubber at the end?
VITIAS	?	(smiling) No, sorry. We don't make those models anymore. Louise shuts her eyes, visibly exasperated.
STEPHANIE	f	Or just a plank. A plank with wheels and straps. And irons to move forward with.
LOUISE	f	(furious) Can you cut it out?
STEPHANIE	f	What? If I want...
LOUISE	f	I've had enough of your schtick, you hear me?
STEPHANIE	f	Come on...
LOUISE	f	Shut up! Stephanie shuts up. Vitias still looks patient as Job.
STEPHANIE	f	Go if you want… I'll take a taxi.
LOUISE	f	I told them I was with you.
STEPHANIE	f	And that works? If you tell them you're with me, do they let you do what you want?
LOUISE	f	Well...
STEPHANIE	f	Cool. If ever you want a day off, just tell me. I'll write you a note. Louise looks at her. She's not going to let her get on her nerves. There is a knock at the door. A nurse enters. She checks the resin bands, looks at her watch.
NURSE	f	10 more minutes, just to make sure. Then Doctor Vitias will come for you. She smiles and closes the door. The two young women are again left alone. Stephanie stretches out her hand. Louise takes it. And they remain like that.
KADHI	m	Look at the next one! Watch how he whacks him. A change of scene on the small screen: a courtyard between two tower blocks, with new combatants, but with the same amateur images and the same violence.
KADHI	m	(pointing to the screen)... I know him. I fought him twice in Nationals. He's not bad. He was at the boxing club in Marseille. Martial watches Ali, fascinated by the images, as if he were sizing him up.
MARTIAL	m	He says he's done Thai boxing. He can fight. He's enormous. He's not afraid of taking punches, and he's white.
COUSIN	m	I see. The cousin turns to Ali. He takes his time sizing him up.
COUSIN	m	Is that true? You like to fight?
ALI	m	Yeah.
COUSIN	m	Okay, so I organize the fights. I pick the fighters. I see if the money's there. I ref. I collect the dough... I take a third of the bets. The rest goes to the winner...
MARTIAL	m	A third of how much?
COUSIN	m	We don't fight for less than 800. Ali does the division in his head.
MARTIAL	m	So? Ali hesitates.
ALI	m	(to Martial) There's something I don't get: how much do you take?
MARTIAL	m	I don't know. You tell me. How much do you need? I'll take 20% of what you win. How's that?
ALI	m	And how much does your cousin give you?
MARTIAL	m	Oh, I introduced you to him, didn't I? How's that?
ALI	m	Okay. The cousin stands up. They all shake on it.
ANNA	f	Keep Sam with you for 5 minutes! She hurries to find some papers in the drawer of a commode. Ali hasn't budged.
ANNA	f	Oh! Hear me? I don't want your son in the garden.
ALI	m	Yeah, I heard. He gets up and goes to get Sam who is playing behind the house. Anna finds her papers and leaves in another direction.
ALI	m	Sam! Come here! I want to show you some stuff! He lifts Sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer.
ALI	m	Look how they fight... He clicks on an image and the fight continues... the audience's noise as well. Sam watches, intrigued. Ali
ALI	m	Look at him, in red. See how strong he is?
SAM	m	Is he the good guy?
ALI	m	No, he's the bad guy. Look how he tries to grab his legs. Wait. His phone vibrates. He takes it from his pocket. It's Martial. He answers.
ALI	m	Hello? Yeah...
SAM	m	Why is the red one the bad guy? Daddy?
ALI	m	I don't know. Look and tell me who wins. He turns down the sound, settles Sam on the stool and gets up to go speak.
ALI	m	(into the phone) So? What did he say? Which others? How many? Sam watches the fight in silence. Dogs bark in the garden. Sam feels something coming. He looks out the window, then goes running. Ali hasn't noticed a thing and continues his phone conversation.
ALI	m	What is this bullshit? What do you mean, a tournament?
MARTIAL	m	Last one standing gets the money. I know, but he says it's better that way. Do you think you're in a position to negotiate a percentage? Where did you get that idea from? He gave me a website if you want to see the others. He takes out a small spiral notebook.
ALI	m	Tell him to give the website to his mother. All I see is me doing more fights and him making more dough. Ali goes to the window. Outside, near the kennel, Sam has lunged at a guy in a jumpsuit who is helping Anna get the puppies into a metal cage. Sam is screaming. Anna tries to take him into her arms. Sam clutches the bars of the cage. The puppies bark. Anna finally manages to rip Sam free and drag him back into the house.
ALI	m	(into the phone) He's changing the rules and so am I... I couldn't care less. Anna storms into the living room. Sam is shrieking, having a tantrum. He kicks and bites.
ALI	m	I'm on the phone!
ANNA	f	What the hell? I asked you to watch him for 5 minutes!
ALI	m	(into the phone) I'll call you back. Ali hangs up.
ANNA	f	(to Sam) He's taking them to the country. They'll be so happy there.
SAM	m	Leave me alone. They're my babies! Sam refuses to calm down. Anna looks at her brother.
ANNA	f	What are you doing? Are you his father or not?
ALI	m	You're such a pain in the ass.
ANNA	f	Don't talk to me like that! Ali rips the child from his sister's grip. Sam struggles.
ALI	m	Stop it now! I said stop! Calm the fuck down!
SAM	m	Let go of me! Let go! Sam kicks out. Ali shakes him.
ALI	m	Cut it out, dammit! You're such a pain! He flings the child away. Sam's head hits the coffee table. Silence. Anna rushes over and picks up Sam, who has stopped crying. He's been knocked out. Anna is frightened. She examines his scalp, she strokes his head. She trembles. A cut on his head begins to bleed. She kisses the wound. Ali comes over, upset.
ANNA	f	Don't touch him! Don't touch him I said! You know what? You're... you're a bad person. Huddled against Anna's breasts, Sam opens his eyes.
STEPHANIE	f	What kind of boxing? Thai? Do you use your feet?
ALI	m	No, just fists I think. We bash each other's faces and whoever's still standing at the end wins. Hey, you're strangling me! He puts her down on her chair.
STEPHANIE	f	Is it the first time you're doing this?
ALI	m	Yeah.
STEPHANIE	f	And you're not scared?
ALI	m	Of what?
STEPHANIE	f	How much do they pay you for this?
ALI	m	I don't know. About 500, 1000 maybe.
STEPHANIE	f	You're doing that for 500 euros?
ALI	m	Um, yeah.
STEPHANIE	f	You're going to get whacked on the face and risk your health for 500 euros?
ALI	m	Risk my health? What are you talking about? Why are you getting so worked up?
STEPHANIE	f	I'll give you the 500! Cancel it and I'll give it to you tomorrow.
ALI	m	You can give it to me if you have too much money, but I said I was doing it and I am. That's all.
STEPHANIE	f	If it's not for money, why then?
ALI	m	I didn't say it's not for the money!
STEPHANIE	f	Why are you doing it?
ALI	m	Oh, stop driving me crazy! I'm doing it to fight. For fun. Why did you clown around on your fish? For the fun of it, right? She grins.
STEPHANIE	f	Yeah and look how I ended up.
ALI	m	Spare me. You turn on the waterworks when you feel like it.
STEPHANIE	f	Your fight, if you do it...
ALI	m	Mm?
STEPHANIE	f	You think I can come along?
HOMEBOY	m	Who's she?
MARTIAL	m	His girlfriend. Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial drives in.
ALI	m	(under his breath) Motherfucker's acting like he's on Canal Plus.
STEPHANIE	f	Who are the other guys?
ALI	m	I don't know. Guys with money. Dealers. A beat.
STEPHANIE	f	You okay?
ALI	m	Great. Martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into the passenger seat.
MARTIAL	m	It's okay. Let's go. Fall against the big one in black shorts. I told you. They're big guys.
ALI	m	Okay. And the bets? How much is there?
MARTIAL	m	A little over 2000 for the time being. But it'll go up during the final match.
STEPHANIE	f	What do I do?
MARTIAL	m	No girls. Stay in the car. (To Ali) You ready? Ali nods.
COUSIN	m	You and you. Ali pulls off his T-shirt, staring down his adversary. Martial takes the T shirt and leans over to Ali.
MARTIAL	m	If you get into trouble, don't insist, just fall. Ali doesn't flinch. The cousin, the bettors and the other fighters move away.
ALI	m	I have to go. Another combat begins, while Ali jogs around the hangar. Stephanie watches other combats, whether featuring Ali or not.
STEPHANIE	f	It's nothing, just a cut. (to Martial) Got anything to disinfect it with?
MARTIAL	m	(driving) No.
STEPHANIE	f	(to Ali) Keep this on it. It's the only one I have. Ali looks up at her.
ALI	m	You liked it.
STEPHANIE	f	Yes.
ALI	m	Me too. He again lowers his head.
STEPHANIE	f	Put this on it. It's the only one I have. Ali straightens up, covers himself with the towel and remains like that: invisible, out of breath, clearing his throat and spitting out the window... Stephanie observes the welts on his body. A big service station appears a bit farther down the road. Ali sits back up.
ALI	m	Pull over here. I'll go rinse off my face. (puts out his hand) Give me 50. Martial uses his turn signal.
MARTIAL	m	Have you known him for long?
STEPHANIE	f	No, not very. Alone in the back seat, Stephanie looks out at the service station.
STEPHANIE	f	What do you want to know? If I knew him before the accident? Martial looks back.
MARTIAL	m	What?
STEPHANIE	f	You find it weird that we're together? You wonder what he's doing with me?
MARTIAL	m	No, since you know him, I just wanted to know if you've seen him like that before?
STEPHANIE	f	No. Martial finishes counting the bills.
MARTIAL	m	He freaks me out. He takes his share and hands Stephanie the envelope.
MARTIAL	m	1200 for him. She looks at the envelope without taking it.
STEPHANIE	f	Why are you giving me that?
MARTIAL	m	It's for Ali.
STEPHANIE	f	Exactly. So why give it to me? He looks at her, suddenly surprised.
MARTIAL	m	Hey, you make it complicated. Either you take it or you don't. And either I talk or I keep my mouth shut. He tosses the envelope at her. She looks away. Ali finally gets back into the car with a big box. It's a toy: a green John Deere tractor with all the accessories.
ALI	m	For my kid.
STEPHANIE	f	You have a kid?
ALI	m	Yep.
ANNA	f	You see what you're like with him? You're not around and when you are, you scream at him. Damn, you hit him! Why did you take him along if you act like that? You should have left him.
ALI	m	Cut the shit. He's not dead. I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry about it. Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls out the envelope of money and hands it to her.
ALI	m	Here.
ANNA	f	What's that?
ALI	m	Money. What I owe you plus the next few
ANNA	f	Where did you get this? (pointing to his new clothes) Same place?
ALI	m	I won a fight.
ANNA	f	A fight? What kind of fight? Is that the only job you could find? Is that why you have marks on your face?
ALI	m	Hey, will you take the money or not? Why are you looking at me that way?
ANNA	f	Nothing. He leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest of the group. They are packing away ice chests and folding things up. Sam and his little friends are playing in the sand with the John Deere tractor. Sam has a bandage on his forehead. Ali sits down in the sand next to him.
ALI	m	(pointing to the tractor) You like it? Sam continues to play, ignoring him. Behind them, Richard is folding up parasols with the help of Che, a bearded neighbor who is also there with all his family.
RICHARD	m	Have you eaten?
ALI	m	Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
CHÉ	?	You don't want to drink something before I
ALI	m	(to Sam) You want to go for a swim?
ALI	m	Give me a kiss.
SAM	m	I don't want to.
ALI	m	Give Daddy a kiss!
SAM	m	No.
ALI	m	(using a deep voice) Give Daddy a kiss!
SAM	m	(deep voice too)... No! Ali kisses him and hugs him tight.
MARTIAL	m	Hey! I'm here.
ALI	m	They told me 429. Martial motions him in.
MARTIAL	m	Normal. This one is for the equipment. Boxes of equipment are piled up under the window and the small table has been converted into a work surface. A camera is plugged into the TV set. It shows a still picture: an empty location, one sector of an industrial site filmed from above.
MARTIAL	m	I have to watch this. Have a seat. You wanted to see me. Ali sits on the edge of the bed. Martial watches the screen out of the corner of his eye.
ALI	m	I need to find a coach. A real one. Someone who has me work on my takedowns.
MARTIAL	m	Foued?
ALI	m	Foued doesn't know jackshit. Just jiu-jitsu and rap stuff. You need to ask Cousin. His guys must train somewhere.
MARTIAL	m	Think so?
ALI	m	Yeah. And I'll need some time to train.
MARTIAL	m	I'll talk with Alta Secu. We'll be able to work something out.
ALI	m	Work it out how?
MARTIAL	m	I'll have my company pay you and I'll bill them what you cost me. They'll keep paying you but now you'll work directly for me. You won't have to spend your nights there. There is some movement on the screen. He interrupts himself. Gray silhouettes cross the screen, open a door and disappear before coming back to cross the screen once again.
ALI	m	Where's that?
MARTIAL	m	At the Mousquetaires. Martial rewinds and zooms in on some faces.
MARTIAL	m	I'll make a copy and you'll take it to the
RICHARD	m	Look who it is! Go on, honk!
RICHARD	m	We're going to school. Want to come along? Ali shakes his head and continues jogging. The truck disappears.
ALI	m	Where are you? I can't see you. Where? He looks every which way until he sees her, a few feet away. She is standing upright, in a light pair of pants, with her canes hidden behind her back. It takes some time to register. She smiles at him.
ALI	m	That's fucking amazing! I was looking for a wheelchair...
STEPHANIE	f	Stop looking. No more wheelchairs!
ALI	m	Since when?
STEPHANIE	f	Two days.
ALI	m	You could have told me!
STEPHANIE	f	Why? Is it a problem?
ALI	m	No, I don't know. You're like before.
STEPHANIE	f	Well, not exactly.
ALI	m	Go on, let's see. She takes a few steps forward, leaning on her canes. He whistles in admiration.
STEPHANIE	f	I need to get my balance but supposedly that doesn't take long.
ALI	m	It must be like walking on stilts...
STEPHANIE	f	I don't know. I've never walked on stilts before.
ALI	m	You look taller. Does it hurt?
STEPHANIE	f	A little, but it feels good too.
ALI	m	Want to go for a swim? She stops.
STEPHANIE	f	The beach... pff, I don't know... It's different today... I don't think I want to get undressed.
ALI	m	Is this all you have?
STEPHANIE	f	Look in the fridge. There must be some cheese left.
ALI	m	You don't have any pate?
STEPHANIE	f	No, I don't have any pate. He gets up and opens the fridge. He takes the cheese, sniffs it, then takes some yoghurt too. He notices a box of cereal on a shelf and takes it. He returns to the fridge for some milk. She watches, her mouth open in suspense.
STEPHANIE	f	You're a good eater, aren't you?
ALI	m	I'm hungry. He begins with the cheese.
ALI	m	No bread?
STEPHANIE	f	There are crackers up there. Do you have a girlfriend? He shakes his head.
STEPHANIE	f	You don't have anyone?
ALI	m	Yes, but they're not girlfriends.
STEPHANIE	f	What are they? Quick fucks?
ALI	m	Yeah. She hesitates.
STEPHANIE	f	A lot? He looks at her.
STEPHANIE	f	You mind talking about this?
ALI	m	No, I don't care. (pause) How about you? Did you have a lot of boyfriends?
STEPHANIE	f	When, before?
ALI	m	Yeah.
STEPHANIE	f	I was with Simon...
ALI	m	That's all?
STEPHANIE	f	No, there were others. But not a lot either. I... I wasn't very... In fact, I liked it when guys looked at me... I liked to feel that I turned them on... Afterwards, I don't know... they bored me. Ali looks at her, strangely attentive, as if he didn't understand, or didn't believe her.
ALI	m	And now?
STEPHANIE	f	Um, nothing. I don't even know what it looks like anymore... I don't even know if it still works...
ALI	m	You don't want to?
STEPHANIE	f	Did I say I didn't want to anymore? Of course I still want to...
ALI	m	How do you go about it?
STEPHANIE	f	How do you think I go about it? If I were a guy I'd say I jerk off to a porn video... I'm a girl. Ali is dumbstruck.
STEPHANIE	f	Okay, let's change the subject... She begins piling up plates and silverware.
ALI	m	You want to fuck? She is thrown for a loop.
STEPHANIE	f	Huh?
ALI	m	You want to know if it still works, so let's fuck and that way you'll know. He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous laugh.
STEPHANIE	f	Just like that?
ALI	m	Um, yeah. Give me that. He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the dishwasher.
STEPHANIE	f	I... I don't know if I can like that...
ALI	m	Whatever you want... You tell me... She hesitates.
STEPHANIE	f	Wait. She wheels herself away from the table and into the bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table.
ALI	m	What do I do?
STEPHANIE	f	Wait! He waits. Then:
STEPHANIE	f	Come here.
ALI	m	Okay? Ready? Unsure of herself, she pulls a face.
STEPHANIE	f	Let's try. He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away gently.
STEPHANIE	f	(a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't kiss?
ALI	m	No. Your breasts... can I?
STEPHANIE	f	Yes. He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering her. She tries to wriggle herself free.
STEPHANIE	f	You're crushing me!
ALI	m	Maybe you should stop talking now...
STEPHANIE	f	Okay, I'll stop. His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets herself go. She grabs hold of him.
STEPHANIE	f	Gently!
ALI	m	Are you okay? How was it? She blushes.
ALI	m	Is it still working?
STEPHANIE	f	Um, yes... no... I don't really know. It's different... It's hard to tell after just one try...
ALI	m	Yeah but I don't have time right now. I have to go!
STEPHANIE	f	(blushing) No, no! That's not what I meant... I just meant that it's too soon to tell... like too many things are happening at once... Ali doesn't understand.
ALI	m	But did you enjoy it or not?
STEPHANIE	f	I did. A beat.
ALI	m	When you're up for it and you can't find anyone, ask me. If I'm oper, we'll do it.
STEPHANIE	f	What's "oper"?
ALI	m	Operational... If I'm available. If I can, I mean!
STEPHANIE	f	If you're "oper" we...
ALI	m	Yeah. She sketches a vague gesture.
ALI	m	What? Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer.
STEPHANIE	f	Nothing. Great.
STEPHANIE	f	Louise? Louise, are you here? Is anyone here? No answer. She looks over the office she once knew so well and that hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names, etc...
LOUISE	f	(gently) Stephanie? Stephanie looks back to discover Louise and three other ex- colleagues. They have been there a moment, surprised, unsettled and ill at ease.
STEPHANIE	f	I stopped by the office but there wasn't anyone. Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes. The guys rush over to help her. They hug and kiss. All four remain like that for a moment.
LOUISE	f	(softly) See? It wasn't hard! They smile at each other and return to the conversation in progress. Stephanie's cell phone vibrates on the table. She discreetly checks the answer, and when she looks up, exchanges a glance with Louise. From that glance, we cut to:
STEPHANIE	f	When I feel like it, I send him a text message and ask if he's oper. If he is, we hook up. Louise reacts.
LOUISE	f	What's oper?
STEPHANIE	f	If he's up for it. If he's free. If he is, we fuck.
LOUISE	f	Is that all?
STEPHANIE	f	Yes, that's all. What else do you want?
LOUISE	f	I don't know. Is that enough?
STEPHANIE	f	For me it is.
LOUISE	f	What does he do? Stephanie hesitates a moment, as if worried about how Louise will react.
STEPHANIE	f	He fights.
LOUISE	f	What kind? MMA?
STEPHANIE	f	No. Illicit fights in the projects. Louise reacts.
STEPHANIE	f	Whatever I say, you make a face.
LOUISE	f	Just give me a second to react... Are you in love? She hesitates.
STEPHANIE	f	He does me good.
ALI	m	Shit!
STEPHANIE	f	Who is it? He looks for his clothes...
ANNA	f	I didn't know you were here. You scared me. What were you up to?
ALI	m	I was talking?
ANNA	f	You're not alone?
ALI	m	I'm with a friend.
ANNA	f	You bring girls back to my place now?
ALI	m	She's a friend, I said. Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie:
ALI	m	(to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my sister! (to Anna) This is Stephanie. You know the girl from Marineland. Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth:
ANNA	f	Oh, my God. Poor thing!
STEPHANIE	f	So that's him? They are sitting around the garden table. Anna comes carrying a tray.
ANNA	f	They were out of grapefruit. I took tropical fruit. She puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on the table. Through a hole in the oilcloth, Stephanie can watch Sam playing under the table.
ANNA	f	I'll make tea. I have some cookies. You drink tea, don't you?
STEPHANIE	f	Don't bother. This is perfect, I swear. Thanks. Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the way back to the kitchen.
ALI	m	You don't want to get going?
STEPH	?	Wait, your sister...
ALI	m	You freak her out. Can't you see? She feels like a cashier with you. Pathetic with her tea and cookies. It's a pain. Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up.
ALI	m	What are you doing?
STEPH	?	I'm going to help her.
ALI	m	No need to overdo it.
STEPHANIE	f	So this is where you sleep? It's a nice room. Sam nods in agreement. He gives her a strange look.
STEPHANIE	f	Why are you looking at me like that? Does it scare you? You want to see them, is that it? He nods. She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis underneath. Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand, touches it carefully.
SAM	m	Does it hurt? Stephanie smiles at him.
STEPHANIE	f	No... Want to touch it? Sam reaches out his hand.
STEPHANIE	f	Here. He applies it to his eyebrow. She displaces a bloody strand of hair and replaces it with another. We see Martial return to the car and open the front door.
MARTIAL	m	You okay? He puts a wad of money in the glove compartment.
MARTIAL	m	You ready? Ali nods ‘yes'. He opens his door, gets half out and empties the bottle of water over his head. Stephanie is left alone in the car. She hears the spectators' cheers. She closes the window and turns on the air conditioning full blast.
ALI	m	... All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's like it tasted like bone. A taste of rust and bone.
STEPHANIE	f	Because you think bone has a taste?
ALI	m	Yeah, there I did. Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something: sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a pair of shorts… He also sees the heads of the tough guys who turn back to look. He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of blood and returns to the task at hand. His opponent tries to get up. Ali jumps on him to finish
MARTIAL	m	(to Ali, pointing to the manager) Go get the equipment. I need to see him. Ali obeys.
UNION REP	m	Don't bother. We're the ones who will call the police. The police and the press. That way they'll know you spy on your workers! The manager looks away, accompanied by his two guards.
UNION REP	m	At least have the courage to look at me when I talk to you!
WOMAN	f	What are you doing there? She's a young employee in the store uniform.
ALI	m	(suspicious) Packing up.
WOMAN	f	Is it your stuff?
ALI	m	No. He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a picture.
ALI	m	Don't you take a picture!
WOMAN	f	You work for them? She continues to manipulate her phone.
ALI	m	I said no picture!
WOMAN	f	Why shouldn't I? You film us! He straightens up menacingly.
ALI	m	I'm going to slap you! A hand grabs his arm. It's Martial.
MARTIAL	m	Forget it. Let's get out of here!
ALI	m	And the equipment?
MARTIAL	m	Forget about it. We're fucked here. The cops are going to question the managers and the managers will turn us in. They leave.
MARTIAL	m	In here. Stephanie looks back, surprised. Martial motions her in.
MARTIAL	m	I have to go away for work. 3 or 4 months, I don't know yet... Since Ali wants to keep fighting, I thought maybe you tend to that while I'm not here... She is thunderstruck.
STEPHANIE	f	Is he okay with that?
MARTIAL	m	He's the one who asked me to call you.
STEPHANIE	f	Why me?
MARTIAL	m	I guess he trusts you.
STEPHANIE	f	(laughs, thrown for a loop) Yes, sure but.... I don't know anything about that scene... I don't know those guys! He hands her an old spiral notebook.
MARTIAL	m	I wrote it all down here. As for the rest, ask me your questions and I'll answer them.
STEPHANIE	f	How do I do the bets?
MARTIAL	m	You can count on your fingers, can't you?
STEPHANIE	f	Honestly, can you see me dealing with those beasts?
MARTIAL	m	Yeah. A beat.
MARTIAL	m	And you need money to cover the bets, and you have money. She looks at him.
MARTIAL	m	What? You're not rich? What did the insurance company give you for your legs? 200,000? 300,000? Those jobs must have good health plans. Am I wrong?
STEPHANIE	f	No. A shadow crosses Stephanie's mind. She looks at the open bags and suitcases, without really seeing them. The place looks like it's expecting a police raid.
STEPHANIE	f	Where are you going?
MARTIAL	m	Grenoble, then Vienne.
STEPHANIE	f	Austria?
MARTIAL	m	No, in the Isère.
STEPHANIE	f	Was the insurance money your idea?
MARTIAL	m	Yes. A beat. He gives her time to wrap her head around that one. Then, since she still looks troubled, he taps her on the hand.
MARTIAL	m	It's me, I said. Don't worry. I'm the bad guy.
FOUED	m	The Cousin's waiting for you inside. Table to the left of the bar. Ali knows and greets everyone. Stephanie is in the middle of the group. She holds herself up on the shoulders of these big, caring guys and lets herself be carried along. She feels good
ALI	m	Want to boogie? She doesn't understand.
ALI	m	(loud) You want to dance?
ALI	m	Come on!
STEPHANIE	f	No, no!
ALI	m	Whatever you say. He goes to the dance floor and begins to rock. He dances badly, clumsily. Martial pours champagne.
COUSIN	m	Can I talk to you? She nods "yes".
COUSIN	m	There's something I'd like to know... The fish that ate your legs... She wasn't expecting that.
STEPHANIE	f	Yes?
COUSIN	m	Is it true it's still there?
STEPHANIE	f	Yeah... where else would it be?
COUSIN	m	They didn't shoot it? Or put it down, whatever?
STEPHANIE	f	Why would they do that?
COUSIN	m	I don't know... when a dog attacks you, they kill it. And the fish gets off. Don't you mind that the thing that ate your legs is living it up in its shitty fucking aquarium?
STEPHANIE	f	No. And I don't want anything to happen to it. Now more than ever! He looks at her, incredulous, but with admiration.
COUSIN	m	(imitating her) "Now more than ever". Listen to you! He takes another drag.
COUSIN	m	(imitating her) Tututu-tu-tutu... They laugh.
STEPHANIE	f	Do I sound like that?
COUSIN	m	Tututu...
STEPHANIE	f	(loud) Huh? I can't hear you...
GUY	m	(loud) No problem. What are you drinking?
STEPHANIE	f	(loud) Champagne? The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He might be thought to resemble Simon.
GUY	m	What's your name? I'm Pierre.
STEPHANIE	f	Hey there. I'm Marie.
GUY	m	Come here often? Stephanie is on automatic pilot. When she turns to the room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her. She can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts under her T-shirt. She answers his questions, she returns his smiles. When she finishes her glass and puts it down on the counter, he kisses her. She doesn't push him away immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time to put a good face on it.
STEPHANIE	f	No... No, please. I don't feel like it. Not tonight. I can't... The guy looks disappointed, then manages a ‘good loser's' smile.
GUY	m	Okay, no problem...
STEPHANIE	f	It's best I go. Good night and thanks.
GUY	m	Sorry. I couldn't know. Stephanie freezes.
STEPHANIE	f	You couldn't know what?
GUY	m	Huh?
STEPHANIE	f	You couldn't know what, asshole? Foued runs to warn Martial, Khadi and Cousin that something is wrong. When Martial arrives, he sees Stephanie collared by a bouncer three times her size. She lashes out with one of her canes, while under the bar, another bouncer tries to help the blond guy back to his feet. There's a deep gash on his skull. Cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand.
ALI	m	You okay?
STEPHANIE	f	Fine.
ALI	m	Did you stay late?
STEPHANIE	f	I can't remember. Afterwards the cousin took us to a club at la Colle sur Loup... It sucked and it was 5 a.m. And you?
ALI	m	Normal. (to the waiter) A large coffee with milk and bread with butter! A beat.
STEPHANIE	f	You think it's good that we're having this conversation?
ALI	m	What conversation?
STEPHANIE	f	That I ask how it was with the girl last night and you answer normal.
ALI	m	What do you want me to say?
STEPHANIE	f	Nothing. He grimaces at her mood.
ALI	m	Oh la!
STEPHANIE	f	"Oh la" what? You think it's normal leaving with that bimbo in front of me? What would you say if I did the same thing?
ALI	m	Nothing.
STEPHANIE	f	Oh yeah? You wouldn't care?
ALI	m	You're pissing me off. What's your problem?
STEPHANIE	f	Wait, let me put it differently. What I am for you? A friend? A pal? Sort of a buddy, like Foued and the others?
STEPHANIE	f	Tell me something: do you and your buddies fuck every now and then? He snickers.
STEPHANIE	f	No? Really? Never? That's the difference. Her looks at her.
STEPHANIE	f	Dammit, stop looking at me that way!
ALI	m	How am I looking at you? The waiter arrives with Ali's order. She tones her voice down a notch.
STEPHANIE	f	You wanted us to continue... Isn't that what you told Martial?
ALI	m	What are you talking about, fucking or fighting?
STEPHANIE	f	Well, we have to go about it well. We have to show each other manners, and consideration...
ALI	m	Manners?
STEPHANIE	f	Hey! Stop acting like an idiot. Do the words bother you? You know what I mean.... Tact... You've never stopped being tactful with me. A beat. He looks away.
STEPHANIE	f	So... is that a plan? She waits for his mind to come back before continuing.
STEPHANIE	f	We'll continue... but not like animals. He smirks, with a flick of the chin.
STEPHANIE	f	Cat got your tongue? Ali stirs his cup without answering. He feels her eyes on him. He smiles.
ALI	m	I'm oper now.
STEPHANIE	f	What?
ALI	m	You made me oper. It's you! It's because it's all you're talking about!
STEPHANIE	f	(softly) You are really a dog. He stands up.
STEPHANIE	f	What are you doing?
ALI	m	I'm getting out of here.
STEPHANIE	f	Why?
ALI	m	I'm fed up.
STEPHANIE	f	You're bored?
ALI	m	Yeah.
STEPHANIE	f	What I'm saying bores you?
ALI	m	Yeah.
STEPHANIE	f	Are you acting like a jackass on purpose?
ALI	m	Aren't you being an ass by putting words everywhere? He sits back down. She watches him eat his sandwiches.
STEPHANIE	f	I'm the one who's leaving. She gets up. Ali finishes his coffee.
FOUED	m	He saw me at la Ciotat. We spoke a few times on the phone. When he has it in for you, he never lets up. Leonardini is well-known.
ALI	m	So are you going to Strasbourg?
FOUED	m	What do you think? I'd be an idiot...
ALI	m	And when are you leaving? Leonardini enters the locker room.
FOUED	m	Mr. Leonardini, this is my buddy Ali. Ali Van Versh. Leonardini shakes his hand.
ALI	m	Pleased to meet you.
ALI	m	How much is there?
STEPHANIE	f	3400. Are you ready? Walking with a slow, deliberate sway - aware of the effect she's having - she ceremonially opens the passenger door. The remarks cease.
ALI	m	Where are you?
STEPHANIE	f	Here. He sits up. She is embarrassed.
STEPHANIE	f	No, don't look!
ALI	m	What are you doing?
STEPHANIE	f	I'm going to pee.
ALI	m	Is it early?
STEPHANIE	f	Five.
ALI	m	Shit, I collapsed... Ali slips out of bed, naked, yawning and groggy. He comes and leans over her...
STEPHANIE	f	I don't like it when you see me like this...
ALI	m	Hold on. She hangs onto his neck. He lifts her up and, both naked, he carries her into the bathroom.
STEPHANIE	f	I called the numbers they gave me at the gym. I spoke to an organizer, Günther Bower. She yawns.
STEPHANIE	f	There's a gala in Turin next week. He told me that we'd have time to meet there. I'm going to go.
ALI	m	Yeah. And when do I see him?
STEPHANIE	f	Later, in his gym in Dortmund. He wants to organize a test match, to see what you're worth. To see if you've got the "Göttlicher Zorn""... Ali comes out of the shower.
STEPHANIE	f	Turn on the water.
ALI	m	Huh?
STEPHANIE	f	Turn on the water when you pee. It's disgusting. He runs some water.
STEPHANIE	f	How's your nose?
ALI	m	Mm.
STEPHANIE	f	It doesn't seem broken.
ALI	m	No. They look at each other. He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her. Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving. She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock. She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away, surprised.
ALI	m	Now we're allowed? No answer. They make love. In CU: the tattoo on Stephanie's left thigh. A red and black arrow with, in industrial characters: "LEFT".
STEPHANIE	f	(in German) Mr. Bower?
GÌNTHER	?	(in German) Yes?
STEPHANIE	f	(in German) I'm Stephanie Granget. Günther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of those years in the ring.
STEPHANIE	f	(in German) Can you get me a ticket for tonight?
GÌNTHER	?	(in German) I don't know. I'll see what I can do. (pointing to her legs) What happened to your legs?
STEPHANIE	f	An accident. In another life. I was an animal trainer. I worked with orcas... The show took a turn for the worse.
GÌNTHER	?	(it dawns on him) Oh, of course! In France! The accident! It was you?! I'm talking to a star! Stephanie makes a face.
GÌNTHER	?	Yes, I am... Amazing. What courage! Bravo! I'm very honored, really. I was an idiot before!
STEPHANIE	f	Why?
GÌNTHER	?	I acted like an arrogant business man. I'm so ashamed. Will you forgive me?
STEPHANIE	f	Of course, Mr. Bower.
GÌNTHER	?	Call me Günther. Of course you can come tonight. As my guest!
GÌNTHER	?	(in German) Funny, huh?
STEPHANIE	f	(in German) What? That?
GÌNTHER	?	That... and you!
STEPHANIE	f	So do I. He draws her inside. The door closes.
COLLEAGUE	?	So?
ANNA	f	I got fired.
COLLEAGUE	?	Come on. There's something we want to show you.
ALI	m	You okay? No answer.
ALI	m	You don't seem it. He goes to open the fridge.
ANNA	f	What are you doing?
ALI	m	I'm hungry.
ANNA	f	Close it! Don't eat here. Ali stares at her, stunned.
ANNA	f	Don't eat here.
ALI	m	What the hell is going on?
ANNA	f	I was fired this morning. I'm unemployed.
ALI	m	Shit... But what's the problem if I eat here? Anna stands up.
ANNA	f	They had cameras in the storeroom... They filmed us when we took the expired food. They fired us. Ali's head spins.
ANNA	f	You had your sister fired. How does it feel? How much did you get for that? You get paid per person or a flat rate? Nothing to say? I take you in, I take care of your son and you have nothing to say?
ALI	m	I couldn't know...
ANNA	f	You couldn't know? You couldn't know what? That you were screwing us out of jobs? That you were hurting people? Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand delivers a resounding slap. He takes it like a man. A moment passes. Ali is red from the slap, red with shame… until he suddenly straightens up and knocks over the table.
RICHARD	m	Calm down. Calm down, I said! Ali looks back. He sees Richard's grim face at the other end of a hunting rifle.
RICHARD	m	Take your stuff and get out of here. We don't want to see you around here anymore.
ANNA	f	Go to your room. Go upstairs immediately.
ANNA	f	In his message he said he was in Strasbourg. No news since. I don't know what he's doing
ANNA	f	Did you try the gym?
STEPHANIE	f	Yeah. They don't know.
ANNA	f	If I had an address or a number, I'd give it to you... Even if I think it's dumb. Do you believe me?
STEPHANIE	f	Yes.
ANNA	f	After what he did to me... Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door. She's about to leave.
ANNA	f	He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck about anything. All he ever cared about was himself. He's totally selfish. Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light.
STEPHANIE	f	You don't know him.
ANNA	f	Me? What did you expect with him?
STEPHANIE	f	I don't know. Not this. Fade to black. Black.
LEONARDINI	m	1,2... 1,2,3,4... Faster! 1,2,3. Yes. Faster! Move! You're stepping back! Ali pounds harder and harder. He times his respiration to match the movement of his fists.
RICHARD	m	I can't come in any further or I won't be able to get back out! Ali checks out the huge semi.
ALI	m	Looks like you changed trucks!
RICHARD	m	Bosses, in fact. I'm back to being exploited. Ali doesn't insist. Richard opens his door to let out Sam who is already trampling him, trying to get out.
RICHARD	m	(to Sam) Got everything? Your bag, your coat, your hat, your mittens? You haven't forgotten anything? Now give me a kiss. Sam gives him a kiss. Richard slips him out and into Ali's arms.
ALI	m	How are things there?
RICHARD	m	They're okay.
ALI	m	My sister?
RICHARD	m	She found a job at a school cafeteria. She seems to enjoy it.
ALI	m	Does she know about today?
RICHARD	m	Yes. She says it's good for the kid.
ALI	m	Tell her I can't help out for the time being but that as soon as I have a little money...
RICHARD	m	Don't worry. When's your fight?
ALI	m	Next month. On the 9th. Richard smiles admiringly.
RICHARD	m	Keep us posted if you win.
ALI	m	Sure I will.
RICHARD	m	Yeah, right... Okay, I'm off. I'll deliver my load in Colmar and pick up the kid at around 7, okay?
ALI	m	Okay.
RICHARD	m	No later, because I have to be back tomorrow at 11. The two men say good-bye. Sam waves good-bye.
SAM	m	I want to skate too!
ALI	m	They're not skating. They're skiing.
SAM	m	No, they're skating.
ALI	m	They're skiing, I said!
SAM	m	Skating. A few steps on:
ALI	m	Skiing.
SAM	m	You're annoying me. They take a break at a picnic area, where they eat some sandwiches and drink orange soda.
ALI	m	(his mouth full) Does Auntie still have dogs?
SAM	m	No, now it's chickens.
ALI	m	In the garden?
SAM	m	Yeah, in the cage. They lay eggs.
ALI	m	That's good.
SAM	m	But Auntie doesn't want me to take the chicks in my room.
ALI	m	She's right. They're disgusting. (pointing to his sandwich) Finished? You want some
ALI	m	You can go. But not too far! Sam starts slipping and sliding. He falls down. He lies on the sled and lets it glide. Ali pees behind a tree. Sam is far away.
ALI	m	Come on, we have to head back!
SAM	m	5 minutes.
ALI	m	Now!
SAM	m	(showing his fingers) 5 minutes!
ALI	m	5 minutes. And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is forming over him.
SAM	m	Daddy! Daddy!
ALI	m	Shit! Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over. He kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole. Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise, blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawls
NURSE	f	We'll take care of you. Come with me. He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred fingers, his broken, bloodied hands.
RICHARD	m	Here. She wants to talk to you.
ALI	m	Anna? Richard shakes his head.
ALI	m	Hello?
STEPHANIE	f	It's me. (pause) Do you mind?
ALI	m	No.
STEPHANIE	f	How is he?
ALI	m	Okay. He woke up an hour ago.
STEPHANIE	f	Is he injured?
ALI	m	No, I don't think so.
STEPHANIE	f	And how are you?
ALI	m	I fucked up my hands on the ice.
STEPHANIE	f	Is it serious?
ALI	m	They're broken. A beat.
ALI	m	How are you?
STEPHANIE	f	I'm okay.
ALI	m	What are you up to?
STEPHANIE	f	You mean in general? In my life?
ALI	m	I wanted to say that...
STEPHANIE	f	I'm not asking for anything. I'll be going. I'll call you back to see how Sam's doing. Give him a kiss him from me...
ALI	m	Don't hang up.
ALI	m	Don't hang up!
STEPHANIE	f	I won't hang up...
ALI	m	He was in a coma for 3 hours... Three hours... For three hours he was dead... I was scared to lose him. His eyes well with tears.
ALI	m	Don't leave me.
STEPHANIE	f	I won't leave you. Black.
ALI	m	I love you.
ALI	m	Wake up, kiddo. It's over. We're going home.
SAM	m	Did you win? He smiles and kisses his biceps.
