CHINGACHGOOK 	?	We're sorry to kill you, Brother.  Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and  speed, your strength ...
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Halloo! John Cameron!
CAMERON	m	Alexandria! Set three more places. How is Chingachgook, then?
CHINGACHGOOK	?	The Master of Life is good. Another year pass ...  How is it with you, John?
CAMERON	m	Gettin' along. Yes, it is.  Nathaniel.
HAWKEYE	m	Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see.
CAMERON	m	Yes, I did.
ALEXANDRIA	f	If Uncas is with you, that means he has not  found a woman and started a family yet.
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron.  They see into my heart.
UNCAS	m	Your farm good to you this year, John?
CAMERON	m	It was a good year for corn.
UNCAS	m	Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on  the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's field.
CAMERON	m	You take much fur?
HAWKEYE	m	That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
JACK	m	Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
UNCAS	m	No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver. French & English want to buy with wampum  & brandy.
HAWKEYE	m	So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
JACK	m	A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's  heading south to war against the English. I'm  here to raise this county's militia to aid the  British defense.
HAWKEYE	m	Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
JACK	m	We'll see in the morning ...
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Fathers of England & France, both, take more  land, furs, than they need. They're cold & full  of greed ...
JACK	m	Few'd deny that? Where you headin'?
HAWKEYE	m	Trap over the fall and winter among the  Delawares in Can-tuck-ee.
UNCAS	m	So I can find a woman and make Mohican  children so our father will leave my brother  & me in peace.
JAMES	m	A son like me?
UNCAS	m	No. You are too strong. Turn me old  too fast!
ALEXANDRIA	f	That's what he's doin' to his mama ...
CAMERON	m	Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits of our labor with plenty. Amen.
MARTIN	m	My father says he was driven out of France by  the black robe priests and he would fight them  now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his  place.
ONGEWASGONE	?	John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ...  Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les  Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les  Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ...
ONGEWASGONE	?	Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais.  My brothers have asked me to lead them in this  war so I speak for the Twin River Council.
LIEUTENANT	m	His Majesty King George II is very grateful for  your support.
IAN	m	How far up the valley?
LIEUTENANT	m	To Fort William Henry.
COLONIAL #1	m	... two days from here.
LIEUTENANT	m	It should be enough to remind you France is  the enemy.
HAWKEYE	m	Your enemy ...
LIEUTENANT	m	What did you say?
HAWKEYE	m	I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours.
LIEUTENANT	m	Really? Do you want them to overrun all  New York colony?
HAWKEYE	m	First place, you started it with the French over  fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on  their hands ...
LIEUTENANT	m	Will you men help us stop the French?
HAWKEYE	m	... and while they are cooped up in your fort,  what if the French send war parties to raid  their homes?
IAN	m	What then, Lieutenant?
LIEUTENANT	m	For your own homes, for king, for country, that's  why you men ought to join this fight!
HAWKEYE	m	You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
LIEUTENANT	m	You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
HAWKEYE	m	... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject  at all.
COLONIAL #2	m	Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll  try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of  my bean field.
AD LIBS	m	Yes. Yeah. No ...
CAMERON	m	I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes, his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he  comes back.
JACK	m	Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to  fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb  accepts a few terms I got in mind ...
AD LIBS	m	Webb? what's that, Jack ...?
IAN	m	You boys marchin' with us? What do you say?
UNCAS	m	We had our say, Ian.
REGIMENTAL SGT. MAJOR	m	Shoulder arms!  Order arms! Handle cartridge!  Prime!  Load! Draw ramrods! Ram cartridge! Return ramrod! Make ready! Pre-sent!  Make ready! Pre-sent!  Fire!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Prime! Load!
JACK	m	... if they are not allowed leave to defend their  families if the French or Hurons attack the  settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort  William Henry.
HEYWARD	?	You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage.
LIEUTENANT	m	They will report or be pressed into service!
LARGE COLONIAL REP	m	Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into  forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that  leave ya, then?
LIEUTENANT	m	They will be found! Arrested ...
WEBB	m	I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence,  would ever object to his American subjects  defending their hearth & home, their women & children,  if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages,  aroused to such excess by our enemy, the  ever-perfidious French.
JACK	m	Does that mean they will be granted leave to  defend their homes if the settlements are  attacked?
WEBB	m	Of course.
JACK	m	You got yourself a colonial militia, General.
HEYWARD	?	Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir!
WEBB	m	Duncan. How was your journey?
HEYWARD	?	I didn't experience anything so surprising from  Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
WEBB	m	And what is that?
HEYWARD	?	The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
WEBB	m	I know. One has to give Americans "reasons" and make  agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
HEYWARD	?	I thought British policy is 'Make the  World ... England', sir.
WEBB	m	You will take command of the 62nd Regiment  of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel  Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
HEYWARD	?	Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard  from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to  rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them  to the fort.
WEBB	m	Yes. You may. You there. What does Munro call you? The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies  to guide you.
WEBB	m	The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's  house. A company of the 33rd will accompany  you and Magua will show you the way.
HEYWARD	?	By your leave, sir.
WEBB	m	Explain to the Major we care little about toying  with colonial militia because we have little to  fear from the French. They have not the nature  for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with  their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would rather make love with their faces than fight.
WEBB	m	Dismissed.
HEYWARD	?	Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See  to it you're there.
CORA	f	Heyward! Duncan Heyward.
HEYWARD	?	My God it's good to see you.
CORA	f	I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so  long apart and after you've traveled so far ...
HEYWARD	?	And by sea!
CORA	f	You still have an aversion to the water?
HEYWARD	?	Aversion? No. ... "Hatred" ... "Loathing" ...
HEYWARD	?	But it was worth it all to end in a garden by  your side.
CORA	f	Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest  friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect  you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings  don't go beyond that. Do you see?
HEYWARD	?	Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis  for a man and woman to be joined? And all  else may grow in time ...?
CORA	f	Some say that's the way of it.
HEYWARD	?	"Some"?
CORA	f	Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ...
HEYWARD	?	Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined,  we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let  those whom you trust, your father, help  settle what's best for you. In view of your  indecision, why not rely on their advice and  judgment as well as mine?
HEYWARD	?	Will you consider that?
CORA	f	Yes. Yes, I will.
ALICE	f	Duncan!
HEYWARD	?	My God, you've grown up.
ALICE	f	We leave in the morning?!
HEYWARD	?	Yes, miss.
ALICE	f	I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman  Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded,  red men in the wild!
CORA	f	My God, Alice.
HEYWARD	?	It can be dangerous ...
ALICE	f	Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us  if it were dangerous.
AMBROSE	m	Atten-shun!
AMBROSE	m	Shoulder arms!
AMBROSE	m	Form two companies of nine ... MARCH!!
CORA	f	Alice, did you see that ...?
CORA	f	Alice?
HEYWARD	?	Are you alright?
ALICE	f	Can we rest soon?
HEYWARD	?	Absolutely.
HEYWARD	?	You there, Scout!
HEYWARD	?	We must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired.  You ... understand?
MAGUA	m	I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
HEYWARD	?	No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the  ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you  understand?
MAGUA	m	"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women. When his women want to eat, he lay aside his  tomahawk to feed their laziness."
HEYWARD	?	Excuse me. What did you say?
MAGUA	m	Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
AMBROSE	m	Form company! Left face! March!
AMBROSE	m	Company make ready!
AMBROSE	m	Present!!
AMBROSE	m	Fire!!
AMBROSE	m	Load! Prime!
AMBROSE	m	Present! Present!
CORA	f	No, Duncan!
HAWKEYE	m	 ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment.
ALICE	f	Stop it!
ALICE	f	We need them to get out of here!
HEYWARD	?	... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?!
UNCAS	m	... too easy to track ... they can be heard for  miles ... find yourself a musket ...
HAWKEYE	m	Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
HEYWARD	?	We were headed ...
HAWKEYE	m	... Fort William Henry.
HAWKEYE	m	... take you as far as the fort.
HAWKEYE	m	If we are goin' to take you, we need to move.  Fast ... And the fort is well off our course.  So if you all rather wait for the next Huron  war party to come by, we'll be on our way.
HEYWARD	?	How far is it, scout?
HAWKEYE	m	Day and a half  Where did you get ... the guide?
HEYWARD	?	Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our  Mohawk allies.
HAWKEYE	m	He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
HEYWARD	?	What?!
HAWKEYE	m	Dark haired ...
HEYWARD	?	Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on  her before today.
HAWKEYE	m	No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
HEYWARD	?	Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
HAWKEYE	m	Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
HEYWARD	?	Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
HAWKEYE	m	No.
HEYWARD	?	Fort Edward, then?
HAWKEYE	m	No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
HEYWARD	?	I thought all our colonial scouts were in  the militia?
HAWKEYE	m	I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn  militia.
HEYWARD	?	Then you are one of those who would allow  England to fight alone while she protects  you from France?
HAWKEYE	m	England does not protect me and does not  war against France on our account. She uses  us to war against France on her own account ...  of greed for land and furs.
HAWKEYE	m	Clear it up any?
HEYWARD	?	I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
HAWKEYE	m	Do not let gratitude get in the way ...
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Yengeese no good in woods. Make more  noise, I kill him.
HEYWARD 	?	Anything to be done?
UNCAS	m	All dead ...
HEYWARD	?	Who were these people?
HAWKEYE	m	Ottawa!
HEYWARD	?	Excuse me ...
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Ottawa.
UNCAS	m	Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside.
HAWKEYE	m	Movin' fast, not able to carry much ...  this was a war party?
HEYWARD	?	Let us look after them ...
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Leave them.
CORA	f	Though they are strangers, they are at  least entitled to a Christian burial!
HAWKEYE	m	Let us go, miss.
CORA	f	I will not. I have seen the face of war  before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as  cruel is your indifference.
HAWKEYE	m	Miss Munro. They are not strangers ....  And they stay as they lay ...!
CORA	f	Why didn't you bury those people?
HAWKEYE	m	Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would  see it as a sign of our passing ...
CORA	f	You knew them.
CORA	f	You were acting for our benefit. And I  apologize. I misunderstood you.
HAWKEYE	m	Well that is to be expected. My father ...
CORA	f	Your "father"?
HAWKEYE	m	Chingachgook. He warned me about  people like you.
CORA	f	He did?
HAWKEYE	m	Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them  understand you."
CORA	f	What?!
HAWKEYE	m	Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and  they make no sense ..."
CORA	f	Why did they turn back?
CORA	f	"We're a breed apart and we make no  sense" ...?
HAWKEYE	m	In your particular case, miss, I would  make some allowance ...
CORA	f	Thank you so much.
CORA	f	You called Chingachgook your "father"? Where is your real family?
HAWKEYE	m	They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with  two French trappers - raised me up as his  own.
CORA	f	I'm sorry.
HAWKEYE	m	I do not remember them. I was one or two.
CORA	f	How did you learn English?
HAWKEYE	m	My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend  Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds ... though  we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yous.
CORA	f	And what were the consequentialities of  European culture you didn't bother with?
HAWKEYE	m	The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas  about the government of men. My father's  people already know each man is his own  nation. And only he can have dominion  over himself. Not kings. No man is better  than any other man.
CORA	f	In London those radical ideas could land  you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this  defenseless place ...?
HAWKEYE	m	'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years  indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave ...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
HAWKEYE	m	My father's people say ... at the birth of the  sun and of his brother, the moon, their  mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth  her body, from which was to spring all life. And he drew forth from her breast the stars. The stars he threw into the night sky to  remind him of her soul.  So there is the Camerons' monument ...  my folks', too, I guess.
CORA	f	You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not  understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be,  thinking of it in Boston and London ...
HAWKEYE	m	Sorry to disappoint you ...
CORA	f	On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ...  to my blood ... ... than any imagining could possibly have  been ...
CORA	f	Much further?
HAWKEYE	m	Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are  downhill of it.
ALICE	f	Will we be able to bathe?
CORA	f	Thunder ... Papa will arrange something.
HEYWARD	?	The men of the regiment will fetch water from  the lake, build fires and provide every comfort  you desire, Alice ...
ALICE	f	Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora  doesn't marry you, I shall.
CORA	f	Alice!
ALICE	f	I can't wait to see Papa ...
CORA	f	And you, Duncan? What are you looking  forward to?
HEYWARD	?	Posting to a different continent.
CORA	f	I think it's very important and exciting.
CORA	f	Lightning?
HEYWARD	?	I'm Major Duncan Heyward!
BEAMS	m	Captain Jeffrey Beams. We didn't think  you'd make it through!
HEYWARD	?	Where's Colonel Munro? His daughters are  here, too.
AD LIBS	m	Uncas! Nathaniel ...
IAN	m	Thought you and Nathaniel weren't  joinin'-up.
UNCAS	m	Didn't!
HAWKEYE	m	Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'.
ALICE	f	Papa, Papa!!
MUNRO	m	Why are you here?!
MUNRO	m	Why did you allow them to come? ... And where the bloody hell are my reinforcements!!
MUNRO	m	Told you to stay away from this hell hole! Why did you disobey me?
CORA	f	When? How?
MUNRO	m	My letter ...
CORA	f	There was none!
MUNRO	m	What?
CORA	f	There was no letter.
MUNRO	m	I sent three men to Webb!
HEYWARD	?	One called Magua arrived.
CORA	f	He delivered no such message.
MUNRO	m	Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
HEYWARD	?	Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does  not know to send reinforcements!
MUNRO	m	What happened to you?
HEYWARD	?	Ambush ... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it. ... eighteen killed. It's these men who  saved us. They guided us here ...
MUNRO	m	Thank you. How can I reward you?
HAWKEYE	m	Help ourselves to a few horns from your  powder stores.
MUNRO	m	What else?
UNCAS	m	Some food.
MUNRO	m	I'm indebted to you. And get your side sewn up,  young man.
MUNRO	m	Mr. Phelps!
PHELPS	m	Miss Cora! How are you?
CORA	f	Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a  suturing needle?  And we could use some rum, clothes, and  a place to wash ...
MUNRO	m	What a place for them ...
HEYWARD	?	Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given  that I've seen of the French engineering from  the ridge above?
MUNRO	m	 Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine  and he has more of them. They keep our heads  down while his sappers make thirty yards of  trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a  two hundred yard range, so when they're close  enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive  rounds over our walls and pound us to dust.
HEYWARD	?	They look to be three hundred yards out.  You have three days.
MUNRO	m	Bloody murderers.
HAWKEYE	m	A man, here, can make a run straight through  to Webb.
MUNRO	m	... not enough time to get to Albany and back  with reinforcements ...
HEYWARD	?	Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to  Fort Edward two days ago.
MUNRO	m	Webb's at Edward?
HEYWARD	?	Yes, sir.
MUNRO	m	Only twelve miles away! He could be here day  after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you  the message.
HAWKEYE	m	John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last  night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And  it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French.
MUNRO	m	Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
HAWKEYE	m	It was a war party. It means they're on the  attack up and down the frontier.
MUNRO	m	Thank you.
HAWKEYE	m	Many men here, their homes are in the path.
MUNRO	m	That's all, sir.
HEYWARD	?	Things were done. Nobody was spared ...
MUNRO	m	Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.  Our duty is to defeat France. That hangs  on a courier to Webb.
SENECA CHIEF	m	... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left  us no time to put our cabins in order before telling  us our French father had need of our aid. We rolled  our blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we  are not the first and closest to my father's campfire.
MONTCALM	m	For my children and the children of the true  faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ...  I will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow  I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the  great council house.
MONTCALM	m	Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your  English friends?
MONTCALM	m	Louis Antoine, join us.
MONTCALM	m	Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ...
MAGUA	m	English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward  with 33rd Regiment. He does not know my  father's army attacks Fort William Henry.
BOUGAINVILLE	?	But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't  get through. He'll send another.
MAGUA	m	The Grey Hair will try.
BOUGAINVILLE	?	Four or five, including two women entered the  fort ...
MAGUA	m	The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's  knife but escaped. They'll be under it again.
MONTCALM	m	Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
MAGUA	m	When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat  his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his  children under the knife so the Grey Hair will  see his seed is wiped out forever.
MONTCALM	m	My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through  the night, now. You may have your opportunity  soon.
PHELPS	m	First assisted me in Austria when she was  fourteen. I would say she does ...
HAWKEYE	m	She does not shy away from much ...
PHELPS	m	What's that?
HAWKEYE	m	Nothin'.
PHELPS	m	Miss Cora? Gentleman looking for you.
CORA	f	Mr Poe?
HAWKEYE	m	Miss.  May I?
HAWKEYE	m	You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro?
CORA	f	What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
HAWKEYE	m	Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
UNCAS	m	You told him about the raid?
HAWKEYE	m	He does not want to hear it.  But he is gonna have to.
JACK	m	Get together by the West Battery James & Ian,  Sharitarish & William.
UNCAS	m	Tight weave.
HAWKEYE	m	Another forty yards?
HEYWARD	?	Sergeant! Form three ranks!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left-about! March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	First rank! Second rank! Present arms!
HEYWARD	?	Fire!!!
HEYWARD	?	Advance, Sergeant Major!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Shoulder arms!  Present!
HEYWARD	?	Fire!!!
HEYWARD	?	Sergeant Major!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Sir!
HEYWARD	?	Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Atten-hut!
HEYWARD	?	Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll  come back another time ...
CORA	f	Alice ...
ALICE	f	Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ...  I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.  I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ...
HEYWARD	?	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ...
CORA	f	Her nerves are shattered. She's trying  to be brave.
HEYWARD	?	Cora, I adore you and, when we come together,  we will be the happiest couple in England ...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others  who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ...
CORA	f	Duncan ...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You  have complimented me with your persistence  and patience ... But the decision I've come  to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes  than surrender my own judgment.
CORA	f	And it's been unfair to you, while I search  myself for feelings, which, if they were there and as strong as they ought to be,  would've made themselves known long ago ... Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan.  And please take this as my final answer.  It must be no.
HEYWARD	?	I see ...
CORA	f	I am sorry, Duncan ...
HAWKEYE	m	... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The  cabin was attacked by a war party. They are  sweeping south down the frontier spreading  terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos  all the men are here.
IAN	m	And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of  Cameron's!
MUNRO	m	I must receive proof more conclusive than  Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our  defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
JACK	m	Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken  together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand  or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements,  not these colonials' presence.
MUNRO	m	I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not  you.
HAWKEYE	m	That judgment is not more important than their  right under agreement with Webb to defend their  farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John  Cameron's. He saw what it was.
MUNRO	m	What did you see, Major?
HEYWARD	?	I saw nothing that would lead me to the  conclusion it was other than a raid by savages  bent on thievery.
HAWKEYE	m	You're a liar!
HAWKEYE	m	And the blood is on your hands!
MUNRO	m	I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman.  Not a butcher.
HAWKEYE	m	Easy for you to suppose. While it is their  women and children, not yours, alone in  their farms!
MUNRO	m	You forget yourself!
JACK	m	We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
MUNRO	m	British promises are honored. And the militia  will not be released. Because I need more  definite proof than this man's word!
JACK	m	Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a  long time before you got here!
MUNRO	m	This interview's over! The militia stays!
JACK	m	Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
HAWKEYE	m	And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe  these people would do better makin' a peace  with the French!
HEYWARD	?	That is sedition! Treason!
HAWKEYE	m	That is the truth!
HEYWARD	?	I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
HAWKEYE	m	Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have  a serious disagreement.
MUNRO	m	Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving  Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition.  Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion.   My decision is final. Get out.
HAWKEYE	m	... got no kin in the settlements. If I did,  I'd be long gone.
IAN	m	You didn't think it right to be here in the  first place.
HAWKEYE	m	By my light that's how I saw it then and I  see it that way now ...
IAN	m	But we are under English military authority.
JACK	m	I believe if they set aside their law as and when  they wish, their law no longer has rightful  authority over us. All they have over us is  tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here ... Anyone  caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each  man make your own decision ... Those who  are goin', be back here in an hour.
HAWKEYE	m	Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east  side of the swamp until you clear the French  picket line. Head north over the ridge, then  come about southeast and fork left in Little  Meadow and you're free of the outpost and  skirmishers ...
A COLONIAL	m	 Should've skinned outta this long ago.
COLONIAL #2	m	Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay  and give 'em a hand even though ...
HAWKEYE	m	I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
JACK	m	You're not coming with us?
HAWKEYE	m	Got a reason to stay.
JACK	m	That reason wear a blue dress and work  in the surgery?
HAWKEYE	m	 It does and it is a better lookin' reason  than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French  outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack.
SERGEANT	m	You! Halt!
SERGEANT	m	As you were!!
SERGEANT	m	Take him!
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Why do they make my son prisoner?
HAWKEYE	m	I helped Winthrop and the others leave ...  This fight is not yours, father. I love  you and my brother. And you should leave  this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ...
CHINGACHGOOK	?	What will they do with my white son?
GUARD	m	Get back from him!
CORA	f	He saved us! We are alive only because  of him ...
MUNRO	m	The man encouraged the colonials to desert  in this very room, in my presence. He is  guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged  like any other criminal, regardless of what he  did for my children.
CORA	f	He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ... Duncan, do something.
HEYWARD	?	He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
CORA	f	You know he wouldn't send me ...! You  misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ...
MUNRO	m	Not with enough certainty to outweigh British  interests in this fort.
HEYWARD	?	And who empowered these provincials to pass  judgment upon England's policies in her own  colonies? To come and go without so much as  a "by your leave."
CORA	f	They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ... They hack it out of the wilderness with  their own two hands, burying their dead and  their children along the way.
HEYWARD	?	 You are defending him because you've become  infatuated with him.
CORA	f	Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable  qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong  to have thought so highly of you.
MUNRO	m	But the man is guilty of sedition and subject  to military justice and beyond pardon.
CORA	f	"Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the  sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for  these people.
MUNRO	m	You do not know what you are saying!
CORA	f	Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of  sedition, too!
HAWKEYE	m	Sorry ... can't ask you in.
CORA	f	They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
HAWKEYE	m	Because what I am interested in is right  here ...
CORA	f	What would you have me do?
HAWKEYE	m	Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If  that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class  among the English.
CORA	f	No. I will find you.
HAWKEYE	m	Do not.  Promise me.
CORA	f	The whole world's on fire, isn't it?
HAWKEYE	m	This part of it sure is ...
CORA	f	What is it?
HAWKEYE	m	I don't know. Whatever happens you stay  with your father. You stay among the officers.
MONTCALM	m	Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant  antagonist. I am happy to make your  acquaintance as a friend.
MUNRO	m	And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
MONTCALM	m	Please accept my compliments for the strong  and skillful defense of your fortress. Under  the command of a lesser man it would have  fallen long ago given the superior numbers and  material ... mere chance has allowed me to  array against you ...
MUNRO	m	Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a  diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
MONTCALM	m	You have already done everything which is  necessary for the honor of your Prince. I  will forever bear testimony that your resistance  has been gallant and was continued as long as  there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen  to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to  consider my terms for your surrender.
MUNRO	m	However I may apprise such testimony from  Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is  strong and stands.
MONTCALM	m	Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may  be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to  us every opportunity to reconnoiter your  works and I am possibly as well acquainted  with your weak condition as you are yourselves.
MUNRO	m	Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the  Hudson and he knows the size and imminence  of the army of Webb ...?
MONTCALM	m	My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended  for you.
MONTCALM	m	Read the dispatch.
BOUGAINVILLE 	?	"Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have  no men available to send to your rescue. It is  impossible. I  advise you to seek terms for  surrender. Signed Webb."
HEYWARD	?	This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather  than spend the war in a French prison hulk  in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
MUNRO	m	 You have heard your answer, Monsieur le  Marquis.
MONTCALM	m	Sir.  I am incapable of mistreating brave men.  I beg you not to sign the death warrant  of so many until you have listened to my  terms.
MUNRO	m	Such as ...?
MONTCALM	m	My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is  no privilege that will be denied. None of  your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they  return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to  their farms.
MUNRO	m	Their arms?
MONTCALM	m	They may leave the fortress fully armed, but  with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask  what you wish.
MUNRO	m	The honors of war?
MONTCALM	m	Granted.
MUNRO	m	My colors?
MONTCALM	m	Carry them to England to your King with pride.
MUNRO	m	Allow me to consult with my officers.
MUNRO	m	I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And  a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
HEYWARD	?	General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back  and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our  mission is to fight.
MUNRO	m	Death and honor are sometimes thought to be  the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
HEYWARD	?	Sir!
MUNRO	m	The decision is final.
MUNRO	m	I am deeply touched by such unusual and  unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours  under the condition that we be given until  dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and  women for their march and turn our wounded  over to your surgeon.
MONTCALM	m	Granted, Monsieur.
SENTRY	m	Qui vive?
MONTCALM	m	France.
SENTRY	m	Le mot d'ordre?
MONTCALM	m	La victoire.
SENTRY	m	C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin,  monsieur!
MONTCALM	m	Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
MAGUA	m	Is the hatchet buried between the English  and my French father?
MONTCALM	m	Yes.
MAGUA	m	Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men  become friends.
MONTCALM	m	My master owns these lands and your father  has been ordered to drive off the English  squatters. They have consented to go. So  now he calls them enemies no longer.
MAGUA	m	Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will  be buried.
MONTCALM	m	But so many suns have set since Le Renard  struck the war post. Is he not tired?
MAGUA	m	Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people,  they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell  all of their lands to enrich the European masters  who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have  been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
MONTCALM	m	That Le Renard has the power to lead his people  into the light, I know well.
MAGUA	m	Does my father know that?
MONTCALM	m	That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
MAGUA	m	And this?
MONTCALM	m	My son has been sadly injured. Who did  this?
MAGUA	m	Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark ...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt.  Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks  who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife  believed he was dead and became the wife of  another. The Grey Hair was the father of all  this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk  to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day  when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
MONTCALM	m	My son Magua's pain is my pain.
MAGUA	m	Does the chief of the Canadas believe the  English will keep the terms?
MONTCALM	m	Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight  the same men again when I move south. And yet, I cannot break the terms of the  capitulation and sully the lilies of France ...
MAGUA	m	Many things my French father cannot do,  Magua can.
MONTCALM	m	As the English march away, our soldiers  and the Canadiens will be drawn to the  looting of the fort ... except for a small  guard ...
MAGUA	m	I wonder at the blindness and pride of the  white man. He believes only he knows  how to speak falsely to make other men do  his bidding.
MUNRO	m	Monsieur, the fort is yours.
MUNRO	m	Steady! No one fires!
HEYWARD	?	Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Yes sir!
MUNRO	m	Do not break ranks! I want these ranks  to hold ...!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Right - about face! March! First rank present!
HEYWARD	?	Fire!
SERGEANT MAJOR	m	Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward!  Present!
HEYWARD	?	Fire!
HAWKEYE	m	Cora!
MUNRO	m	Cora! Alice!
HEYWARD	?	Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime!  Load! Third rank! Present!
MAGUA	m	Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your  living chest in front of your eyes. As you die,  know that I will put under the knife your  children and wipe your seed from this earth  forever ...
HEYWARD	?	Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two,  present! Rank two, hold!
HEYWARD	?	Rank two, six paces back! Rank one,  present!
CORA	f	No!
HAWKEYE	m	You got nothin' better to do today on  Lake George than shoot me, Major, then go ahead ...
CORA	f	Stop it!!
HEYWARD	?	When you fall into British hands again,  Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged.
REDCOAT #1	m	Can't ... keep it up ...
HAWKEYE	m	Pull!
HEYWARD	?	How long?
HAWKEYE	m	Only chance we got is ...   ... to get more distance on 'em and go  to ground!
HAWKEYE	m	Pull!!
HAWKEYE	m	Pull ...!
REDCOAT #2	m	Spent.
HAWKEYE	m	Head for ... for the white water.
HEYWARD	?	Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall ... into British hands ... What white water?
HAWKEYE	m	Here's where it gets tricky ...
HAWKEYE	m	Don't move ...
HEYWARD	?	Where do we go from here?
HAWKEYE	m	We don't.
HEYWARD	?	I don't understand!
HAWKEYE	m	This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're  lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have  come this way and must've beached our  canoes and headed cross land. If we're  very lucky, they'll figure we went over  the falls.
HEYWARD	?	Then what?
HAWKEYE	m	Then we take the south rim down the  mountain and it's 12 miles cross country  to Fort Edward.
HEYWARD	?	And if we're unlucky?
HAWKEYE	m	You will have to forego the pleasure of  hangin' me.
HEYWARD	?	Any powder?
HAWKEYE:	?	Only one or two loads.
CORA	f	Are we safe?
HAWKEYE	m	Maybe ...
CORA	f	Our father? Did you see my father?
CORA	f	Tell me!
CORA	f	Say nothing to Alice ...!
ALICE	f	Uncas ...
CORA	f	Yes. Go ahead.
HEYWARD	?	What the bloody hell plan is this?
HAWKEYE	m	In this there is a chance. If I live, I can  try to free you. If we don't go, there is  no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here,  in that there is no chance. None. I can do  nothing. Do you understand?
CORA	f	Yes. I want you to go.
HEYWARD	?	Coward! Coward back at the fort.  Coward here.
CORA	f	You try. With all you have. To save  yourself. If the worst happens, and  only one of us survives, something of  the other does, too ...
HAWKEYE	m	 If they don't kill you, they may take you  north up into Canada. A warrior may take  you for a wife.
HAWKEYE	m	Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're  strong. You stay alive. I will find you ...  no matter how far, how long it takes ...
CORA	f	 ... never doubt what you are doing.
HEYWARD	?	If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers  ... will receive many gifts.
MAGUA	m	Gifts?
HEYWARD	?	Three, four oxen ... much wampum.
MAGUA	m	Wampum?
HEYWARD	?	Yes.
MAGUA	m	Does Yengeese Major have property  across salt sea?
HEYWARD	?	Yes.
MAGUA	m	Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum,  many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
HEYWARD	?	Gold could be arranged.
MAGUA	m	For Munro children?
HEYWARD	?	Yes.
MAGUA	m	How much gold has the master of the  Yengeese?
HEYWARD	?	The King? The King has mountains of  gold!
MAGUA	m	Not enough.
HEYWARD	?	What is enough?
MAGUA	m	Heart. Give Magua new heart.
SACHEM	m	The tomahawks of your young men have  been very red.
MAGUA	m	Many of the Yengeese are dead, great  Sachem.  I have brought three of my prisoners,  to honor you. Two are the children of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my  lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from  his chest.
MAGUA	m	... the earth was pale. Our tomahawks  were bright. Now they are dull from war.  And the Huron rich with the trophies of  honor ... Magua will sell the English  officer to Les Francais and the reward is  my gift to you, wise one ... The women -  children of the white war chief - will burn  in our fires so all can share in this.
CORA	f	Nathaniel!
HAWKEYE	m	Translate for me, Major. Into French.  Every word ... as I say it.
HAWKEYE	m	I come to you unarmed and in peace to  unstop your ears, wise one. Because the  Hurons are mislead by the words of the  wolf who's never spoken the truth.
HAWKEYE	m	Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro  go free and take the fire out of the English  anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
MAGUA	m	Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the  Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron  do not fear English anger.
HAWKEYE	m	Wise one, the French fathers made peace  and swore to their honor not to break the  friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that  the French would not be friends, still, to  the Huron.
MAGUA	m	It made our French father happy to never  have to fight the same Yengeese again.  He told me this without telling me this.
HAWKEYE	m	So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
MAGUA	m	No.  Huron serve no one. The French father  believes he fooled Magua because he is so  proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it  is the Huron path that Magua walks down,  not the French one ... Now, Les Francais,  also, fear Huron. That is good. When the  Huron is strong from their fear, we will make  the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we  will trade as the white man trades. Take land  from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk  & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over  other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong  as the whites.
HAWKEYE	m	Magua would use the ways of Les Francais  and the Yengeese ...
MAGUA	m	The red man put down the bow, picked up  the fire stick and became the best warrior  in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
HAWKEYE	m	Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers  foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell  them for gold to the white man? Would the  Huron have greed for more land than a man  can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would  the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the  animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But  sell the fur to the white man for gold? ...   Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les  Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron  men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make  himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become  Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ... Magua's way is false. It is like the white  sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness  and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye,  adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican  people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go  free ... I speak the truth.
SACHEM	m	The white man comes like a day that has  passed. And night enters our future with  him ...  Our council talks since I was a boy:  What is the Huron to do?  But Magua would lead Huron down paths  that make us not Hurons.  Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted  heart of Magua.
SACHEM	m	Munro daughter with moon in her hair  must be Magua's wife so Munro's seed  doesn't die.
SACHEM	m	 ... and Yengeese officer not go to Les Francais, but back to Yengeese so their  hatred burns less bright. La Longue Carabine,  go in peace.
HAWKEYE	m	No! listen.  Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!!
HAWKEYE	m	I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a  great honor to the Huron. Take me!
MAGUA	m	This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to  the Hurons of the Lakes! You are women.  Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca,  beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind.  Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ... I spit on you!
HAWKEYE	m	I said to trade me!
HEYWARD	?	... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
CORA	f	What are they doing to Duncan?  Duncan!
HAWKEYE 	m	And my compliments to you ...
CORA	f	Alice?
CHINGACHGOOK	?	UNCAS!!!
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life ...
HAWKEYE	m	... a warrior goes to you swift and straight  as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him  and let him take his place at the council fire  of my people.  He is Uncas, my son.  Bid them patience and ask death for speed;  for they are all there but one - I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans.
HAWKEYE	m	Will you go back to England?
CORA	f	I have nothing to go back for.
HAWKEYE	m	Then will you stay in America?
HAWKEYE	m	And will you be my wife?
CORA	f	Yes.
CORA	f	Where will we go?
HAWKEYE	m	Winter with the Delaware, my father's  cousins. And in the spring, cross the  Ohio and look for land to settle with my  father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
CHINGACHGOOK	?	The frontier moves with the sun and pushes  the red man of the wilderness forests in front  of it. Until one day there will be nowhere left.  Then our race will be no more, or be not us ...  The frontier place is for people like my white  son and his woman and their children.
HAWKEYE	m	That's my father's sadness talking.
CHINGACHGOOK	?	No. It is true ... One day ... there will be no  more frontier. Then men like you will go, too.  Like the Mohicans.  And new people will come. Work. Struggle  to make their light ... One mystery remains.
HAWKEYE	m	What is that?
CHINGACHGOOK	?	Will there be anything left to show the world  that we ever did exist?
