 SAM	m	Mommy got sick and it happened  just like that and there was  nothing anybody would do.
 SAM	m	 If we start asking why we'll gocrazy.  So, rule number one. We don't ask why.
 ANNIE	f	 Why? I just want to know why?That's my first rule.  I alwaysask why.  Come on.  Tell me. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
 SETH	m	 There's no why, Annie.  I'mjust not up for it.  I neversaid I was.
 ANNIE	f	 Is there somebody else?
 SETH	m	 Nope.
 ANNIE	f	 You don't love me, is that it?
 SETH	m	 Nope.
 ANNIE	f	 How about ... you're toonarcissistic to commit toanother human being in a long-  term way.
 SETH	m	 That's good.
 SUZY	f	 Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutesand done.  Ready to eat.  Doyou know how to make juice?
 SAM	m	 Microwave.  Five minutes.
 ANNIE	f	 You take the microwave?
 SETH	m	 What am I going to do with amicrowave?
 ANNIE	f	 You turn it on, you open it andyou stand in front of it for avery long time.
 SETH	m	 So you're angry.  Big deal.
 ROB	m	 Young man, it's none of mybusiness, but maybe you shouldtalk to someone.  I myselfhave consulted a professional. I used to be up tight.
 SAM	m	 Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...  Loss of Spouse support groups...  Single parent discussion nights...  Parents without partners.  Partners without parents. People who need people.  Guyswho go into the woods, beatdrums and bond.  Get a shrink. Hug a friend.  Hug yourself.
 SAM	m	 Don't mind him.  He's the guywho just lost his wife.  What I really think is we needa change.
 ROB	m	 Good idea.  Take a few weeksoff, get some sun, take Jonahfishing --
 SAM	m	 A real change.  New city. Someplace where every time I goaround a corner I don't thinkof Maggie.
 ROB	m	 Where you going to go?
 SAM	m	 I was thinking about Seattle.
 LAURIE	f	 Honey, he wasn't right for you.
 ANNIE	f	 I know.
 LAURIE	f	 He wasn't even wrong for you,like cosmically wrong, so don'tbeat up on yourself forwasting...however long it was.
 ANNIE	f	 I know.
 LAURIE	f	 Maybe you should see a shrink.
 LAURIE	f	 Go home for the weekend.
 ANNIE	f	 That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'mgoing back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high-  five?
 JONAH	m	 Dad says I'm going to get usedto it, but I don't think youcan ever get used to adesignated hitter.
 SUZY	f	 Eventually, in a few months,you'll start seeing women,you'll meet someone.
 SAM	m	 Move on.  Right.  That's whatI'm going to do.  In a fewmonths, boom, I'll be fine,I'll just grow a new heart.
 SUZY	f	 I'm sorry --
 GREG	m	 Sam, she didn't mean --
 SAM	m	 I know, I know.  Look, it doesn't happen twice.
 ANNIE	f	 I'm going to meet someone,someone nice and stable whowears a hat so he won't catch acold, and I'm going to marryhim and have three childrenand live happily ever after. I mean, I am not cut out for this
 DIANE	f	 For what?
 ANNIE	f	 For life as we know it.
 LAURIE	f	 Just make sure he isn't fatlike my Michael or you'll spendyour whole life worrying he'sgoing to drop dead.
 JUDITH	f	 God, you guys are so romantic.
 ANNIE	f	 Do you know how long romancelasts?  That long.
 DIANE	f	 Steven still brings me flowersevery Friday and we've beenmarried 10 years.
 LAURIE	f	 Honey, nobody wants to hearthat.  Here, darling, have some TicTacs.
 ANNIE	f	 The next time you see me I amgoing to be incredibly happy.
 SAM	m	 I'm your dad.  Don't everforget that.  That's rulenumber two.  It's you and me, kid.
 ANNIE	f	 I guess it's just us.
 WALTER	m	 The short one with black hairis your cousin Irene --
 ANNIE	f	 -- who's married to --
 WALTER	m	 Harold, who ran away with hissecretary but came back --
 ANNIE	f	 -- because Irene threatened toput the dog to sleep if hedidn't --
 WALTER	m	 And your brother Tom is apsychology professor and ismarried to...Betsy --
 ANNIE	f	 -- who is the most competitivewoman in the world --
 WALTER	m	 Your Uncle Milton lost all hismoney in a Puerto Ricancondominium that went belly up,don't mention the IRS or theFederal prison system.  Yourmother is Barbara, your fatheris Cliff --
 ANNIE	f	 I hope he doesn't get out hisslides.
 WALTER	m	 Am I what they had in mind?

 ANNIE	f	 No.  Not yet.
 BETSY	f	 Oh.  Well.  How will anyoneknow?
 TOM	m	 Because you're going to callthem all and tell them. Congratulations, Walter.
 CLIFF	m	 Are you all right?
 WALTER	m	 It's nothing.  Nothing.
 ANNIE	f	 It's probably just the flowers --
 BARBARA	f	 We'll move them --
 WALTER	m	 Don't touch them.  I feelterrible sneezing at a timelike this.  This is a bigmoment for me --
 ANNIE	f	 He's allergic to everything,don't worry about it --
 HAROLD	m	 Bees.  I'm allergic to bees.
 CLIFF	m	 Not salmon I hope --
 ANNIE	f	 If he eats one tiny piece of anut --
 WALTER	m	 My head swells up like awatermelon and I drop dead.
 IRENE	f	 It's the same with Harold andbees.
 CLIFF	m	 Your mother and I had salmon atour wedding, and I really thinka wedding without cold salmon --
 WALTER	m	 I'm not allergic to salmon.  Idon't think.  But you neverknow.
 HAROLD	m	 You never know.
 BARBARA	f	 Oh, honey, I feel terrible, weused up this magnum ofchampagne we were saving onsomething else, what did we useit for?
 TOM	m	 Uncle Milton's parole --
 BARBARA	f	 Right.
 UNCLE MILTON	m	 And it was delicious.
 BARBARA	f	 It was, wasn't it, Miltondarling --
 BETSY	f	 When are you getting married,Annie?
 CLIFF	m	 In early June.  In the garden.
 HAROLD	m	 Does it have to be in the garden?
 IRENE	f	 What about Harold and bees?
 BARBARA	f	 We'll spray you.
 CLIFF	m	 Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumbersalad.  Strawberries.
 WALTER	m	 I'm afraid I'm allergic tostrawberries.
 CLIFF	m	 No strawberries.
 ANNIE	f	 Is that all right with you?
 WALTER	m	 Today I consider myself theluckiest man on the face ofthe earth.
 IRENE	f	 What are you wearing?
 ANNIE	f	 I don't know.
 BETSY	f	 I wish you would wear my dress. I only wore it once, and you'llbarely have to do anything toit except take it in in thebust --
 BARBARA	f	 I have something that might do
 BARBARA	f	 The Historical Society wantedthis and I never would give itto them --
 ANNIE	f	 Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
 BARBARA	f	 I notice these things are backin fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
 ANNIE	f	 I know.  He's wonderful, isn'the?
 BARBARA	f	 Are his folks nice?
 ANNIE	f	 You'll love them.  We're goingdown to D.C.  tonight to be withthem Christmas morning.
 BARBARA	f	 How did it happen?
 ANNIE	f	 It's silly, really.  I mean,I'd seen him at the office,obviously I'd seen him, he'sthe associate publisher, andthen one day we both orderedsandwiches from the same place,and he got my lettuce andtomato sandwich on whole wheat,which of course he was allergicto, and I got his lettuce andtomato on white.
 BARBARA	f	 How amazing.
 ANNIE	f	 It is, isn't it? You makemillions of decisions that meannothing and then one day youdecide to order takeout and itchanges your life.
 BARBARA	f	 Destiny takes a hand.
 ANNIE	f	 Oh, please.  Destiny's justsomething we've inventedbecause we can't stand the factthat everything that happens isaccidental.
 BARBARA	f	 Then how do you explain thatyou both ordered exactly thesame sandwich except for thebread? How many people in thisworld like lettuce and tomatowithout something else liketuna?
 ANNIE	f	 It wasn't a sign.  It was acoincidence.
 BARBARA	f	 I was in Atlantic City with myfamily.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking outfor a midnight walk on theSteel Pier.  I've probably toldyou this a million times, butI don't care.  And then he heldmy hand.  I was scared.  Allsorts of thing were goingthrough my head.  But after awhile I forgot about them.  Atone point I looked down, at ourhands, and I couldn't tellwhich fingers were mine andwhich were his.  And I knew.
 ANNIE	f	 What?
 BARBARA	f	 You know.
 ANNIE	f	 What?
 BARBARA	f	 Magic.  It was magic.
 ANNIE	f	 Magic.
 BARBARA	f	 I knew we would be togetherforever, and that everythingwould be wonderful, just theway you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formalname, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knewwas that your father and I weregoing to have a wonderful time  ... in the sack I believe youcall it --
 ANNIE	f	 Mom!
 BARBARA	f	 Of course it took several yearsbefore everything worked likeclockwork in that department,so don't be worried if it takesa while --
 ANNIE	f	 Mom, we already...
 BARBARA	f	 Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle dadee.  And how's it working?
 ANNIE	f	 Like... clockwork.
 BARBARA	f	 So you'll get married in a newdress.
 ANNIE	f	 It's a sign.
 BARBARA	f	 You don't believe in signs.
 ANNIE	f	 They loved you.  I told youthey would love you and theydid.
 WALTER	m	 I love you.
 ANNIE	f	 I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call youanything other than Walter?
 WALTER	m	 Nope.
 ANNIE	f	 Even when you were young?
 WALTER	m	 Nope.  Not even when I wasyoung.
 WALTER	m	 You sure you don't want todrive with me?
 ANNIE	f	 How will I get back toBaltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present foryour stepmother -- I took itinside by accident.
 WALTER	m	 I'll wait.
 ANNIE	f	 Don't be silly.  I'll just beten minutes behind you.

 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 No last names, Jonah.  Hellothere, you sound younger thanour usual callers.  How comeyou're up so late?
 JONAH	m	 It's not that late in Seattle.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Got me there.  What's yourChristmas wish, Jonah?
 JONAH	m	 It's not for me.  It's for mydad.  I think he needs a newwife.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 You don't like the one he wasnow?
 JONAH	m	 He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Where's your mom?
 JONAH	m	 She died.
 ANNIE	f	 I don't believe this --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
 JONAH	m	 I've been pretty sad, but Ithink my dad is worse.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 And you're worried about him.
 JONAH	m	 I'm worried about him, he'sworried about me, I ride mybike to school, he follows inthe car, like I'm not supposedto know he's there.  Now it'sChristmas, and you know whathappens to people at Christmas.
 ANNIE	f	 They lose their minds and callcrackpot doctors on the radio --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Have you talked to your dadabout this?
 JONAH	m	 No.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Why not?
 JONAH	m	 It's very hard for him to talkabout this stuff.  It's like itmakes him sadder.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 You want me to talk to him?
 ANNIE	f	 Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
 JONAH	m	 And you crazy? He thinks showslike this are dumb.  If youdidn't have an 800 number Icould never get away with this
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Is he home right now?
 JONAH	m	 Yeah.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Well, I think I can help alittle more if I talk to himdirectly.
 JONAH	m	 I don't know --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 I'm sure he won't be angry oncehe realizes how concerned youare about him.
 JONAH	m	 Okay, but if I get yelled at,I'm never gonna listen to thisshow again.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Fair enough.
 JONAH	m	 Dad --
 SAM	m	 What is it?
 JONAH	m	 There's somebody on the phonefor you.  His name is Sam.
 ANNIE	f	 This is completely disgusting.
 SAM	m	 Hello.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Hello, Sam, this is Dr. MarciaFieldstone on Network America.
 SAM	m	 I'm probably not interested inwhatever you're selling.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 I'm not selling anything.  Yourson called and asked for adviceon how to find you a new wife.
 SAM	m	 Who is this?
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Dr. Marcia Fieldstone ofNetwork America.
 SAM	m	 Jesus, are we on the air?Jonah, for God's sake --
 JONAH	m	 Don't be mad at me, Dad.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 He feels that since your wife'sdeath you've been very unhappy.He's genuinely worried about you.
 SAM	m	 I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'mnot mad at you.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 I think it's hard for him totalk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and itwould make him feel a littlebetter.
 JONAH	m	 Please --
 ANNIE	f	 This is a grotesque violationof this man's personal life,but never mind --
 SAM	m	 All righ...
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Good.  How long ago did yourwife die?
 SAM	m	 It's been about a year and ahalf.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Have you had any relationshipsince?
 SAM	m	 No.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Why not?
 SAM	m	 Look, Doctor, I don't want tobe rude, but --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 And I don't want to invade yourprivacy --
 ANNIE	f	 Sure you do.
 SAM	m	 Sure you do --
 SAM	m	 Look, we had a tough time atfirst, but I think I'm holdingmy own as a dad, and Jonah andI will get along fine again assoon as I break his radio.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 I have no doubt that you're agood dad.  You can tell a lotfrom a person's voice.  Butsomething must be missing ifJonah feels that you're stillunder a cloud.
 JONAH	m	 Tell her how you don't sleep atnight.
 SAM	m	 How do you know that?
 JONAH	m	 I can hear you walking aroundsometimes.  At first I thoughtit was a robber.  Go ahead,tell her, Dad.
 SAM	m	 I don't think I have to now.
 SAM	m	 Look, it's almost Christmas --  A kid needs a mother --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Could it be that you needsomeone just as much as Jonahdoes?
 ANNIE	f	 Yes.
 ANNIE	f	 I'm losing my mind.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 We've been talking to -- well,let's just call him Sleeplessin Seattle, and we'll be rightback after this break withlistener response, yourresponse, to the things we'vebeen discussing.  The number tocall is...
 SAM	m	 What's she talking about?
 JONAH	m	 This is where other people getto call in and dump on what yousaid.
 LORETTA	f	 I'll bet he's tall, with a cutebutt.
 HARRIET	f	 I'll bet he hasn't shaved in aweek.  I'll bet he stinks.
 LORETTA	f	 Shut up, Harriet.  What'll it be?
 ANNIE	f	 Coffee, please.  Black.  To go.
 LORETTA	f	 Maybe I should hustle myselfout to Seattle.  Give him alittle present for New Year'sEve.
 HARRIET	f	 You can go there if you wantbut don't open his refrigerator. They don't cover anything whenthey put it in the fridge. They just stick it in and leaveit there till it walks out byitself.
 LORETTA	f	 Harriet, ever since youdivorced your last husband,you've been no fun.  I'mlooking, and this guy pops mytarts.
 TRUCK DRIVER	m	 Come on, Loretta, you're goingto have to jump-start this guy. His battery's dead.  And lookat me.  Mister Ever-Ready. Every six minutes, anothercharge.
 LORETTA	f	 I'm looking for someonesensitive.
 ANNIE	f	 Come on, nobody wants a guywho's sensitive on the radio.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Let's take a call before we getback to Sleepless.  Knoxville,Tennessee, you're on.
 SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE	f	 Yes, I would just like to knowwhere I could get this man'saddress?
 LORETTA	f	 Honey, get on line.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Do you think there's somebodyout there you could love asmuch as your wife? Maybe evenmore?
 SAM	m	 It's hard to imagine.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 What are you going to do, Sam?
 SAM	m	 I don't know.  When I met mywife, it was so clear.  I justknew.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 What was it that made you know?
 SAM	m	 I don't think I could reallydescribe it.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Why not?
 SAM	m	 And if I could describe it,it probably wouldn't be on a radioshow.  But what the hell.  It's notone specific thing.  It's moreof a feeling.
 SAM	m	 You touch her for the firsttime, and suddenly... you'rehome.  It's almost like...
 ANNIE	f	 Magic.
 SAM	m	 Magic.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Well, it's time to wrap up,folks --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 We hope you'll call again soon.
 WALTER	m	 Annie?
 WALTER	m	 Annie?
 ANNIE	f	 I'm sorry, Walter.  I justheard the most amazing thing onthe radio.
 ANNIE	f	 People call up these shows andyou can't believe the stuffthey say.  It's the end ofprivacy as we know it, thiscountry is just one big globalvillage with everyone out theregoing blah blah blah --
 SAM	m	 The hopes are perfect --beautiful, identical, smooth --and they are for somethingreally amazing I feel it in mybones --
 JONAH	m	 It's a spice rack.
 SAM	m	 We desperately need a spicerack.  Desperately.

 SAM	m	 Thanks, but... we've got plans.
 LULU	f	 Well, here's the number.  Ifyou ever find yourselfSleepless, give us a call.  Wealso... do babysitting.
 JONAH	m	 Not.
 SAM	m	 My feelings exactly.
 SAM	m	 How many people do you thinkheard that thing last night?
 JONAH	m	 It plays in 50 states.
 SAM	m	 What?!
 JONAH	m	 Nobody else is going to know itwas us.
 SAM	m	 You're right.  You better hope so.
 KEITH	m	 This man sells the greatestsoup you've ever eaten, there'sa line around the block, and heis, I am not kidding, the meanestman in America.  I feel strongly about this,Becky.  This is not just aboutsoup.
 BECKY	f	 Do it.  What else?
 WYATT	m	 New Year's Eve.  Please don'tmake me write it.
 BECKY	f	 Wyatt, I do not mean to remindyou of your mother, but if youdon't put that game away, no TVfor a week.
 WYATT	m	 Would someone look this up,don't tell me where.
 BECKY	f	 Listen to this.  Phone servicein the greater Chicago area wastied up for two hours ChristmasEve because some kid called aphone-in show to get a wife forhis father.  Two thousand womencalled in for the number.
 KEITH	m	 Jesus.
 ANNIE	f	 I heard it.  This kid calls upand says my dad needs a wifeand I'm talking to myself inthe car saying, this iscompletely disgusting, you'retaking advantage of a child,and then the father gets on andthis shrinkette says, do youwant to talk about it? And hesays no as a matter of fact Idon't, and I am saying, bravo!Right on! Don't talk to her,it's none of her business --  -- and then suddenly, for noreason at all, he's talkingabout how much he loved hiswife, and how he just --  fell in love with her and I amcrying.  Me.  A tear isactually rolling down my face. It was like what happens when Iwatch those phone company ads. I don't have to see the wholead, I just have to see the partwhere the daughter gives hermother a refrigerator with abig red bow on it, have youseen that one?
 BECKY	f	 You should write somethingabout this.
 ANNIE	f	 About what?
 BECKY	f	 Whatever it is.
 KEITH	m	 What it is is, there are a lotof desperate women out therelooking for love.
 WYATT	m	 Especially over a certain age.
 KEITH	m	 It is easier to be killed by aterrorist after the age of 40than it is to get married --
 ANNIE	f	 That is not true.  Thatstatistic is not true.
 BECKY	f	 It's not true, but it feelstrue.
 ANNIE	f	 There's practically a wholebook about how that statisticis not true --
 WYATT	m	 Calm down.  You brought it up --
 ANNIE	f	 I did not, Wyatt.
 BECKY	f	 So where were we?
 WYATT	m	 New Year's Eve.  I'll do it,okay?
 BECKY	f	 Okay.
 ANNIE	f	 If someone is a widower, why dothey say he was widowed? Whydon't they say he was widowered?
 ANNIE	f	 I was jus wondering.
 BECKY	f	 What was that about up there?
 ANNIE	f	 What was what?
 BECKY	f	 What's with you?
 ANNIE	f	 Nothing's with me.
 BECKY	f	 "Sleepless in Seattle"?
 ANNIE	f	 That's what she called him onthe show.  Because he can'tsleep.
 BECKY	f	 And now 2,000 women want hisnumber.  The guy could be acrackhead, a psychopath, aflasher, a junkie, atransvestite, a chain-sawmurderer, or someone reallysick, like Rick.
 ANNIE	f	 Actually, he sounded nice.
 BECKY	f	 Oh? Oh, really? Now we'regetting down to it.
 ANNIE	f	 Not.
 BOB LANGMAN	m	 Now she wants a circularstairwell off the den.
 JAY	m	 Punch me, punch in right here.  And she wants the Sub-Zero withthe side-by-side doors --
 BOB	m	 Which means --
 SAM	m	 The cabinets have to be redone
 BOB	m	 So we thought --
 JAY	m	 Since you're on the make again
 SAM	m	 Great.  This is great.  Thewhole town knows.  Just out ofcuriosity, how do you two know?
 BOB	m	 Grace heard it.
 SAM	m	 Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
 BOB	m	 The point is, take the clientout to dinner and ask her tomarry you and then maybe wewon't have to redo the kitchencabinets.
 SAM	m	 Why me? What about Jay?
 JAY	m	 Hey, my plate is full.
 SAM	m	 Well, okay.  What's the bigdeal?  If she'll forget thenew fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the rightdirection.
 JONAH	m	 Dad, I don't know about thisone --
 SAM	m	 Oh, you're changing your mind
 JONAH	m	 No, I'm not, but --
 SAM	m	 What's the matter with thisone? Wouldn't you like to haveImelda Marcos as your mother?
 JONAH	m	 Dad --
 SAM	m	 We better take the measurementsfor the new cabinets.
 BOB	m	 Sam, if you're not doinganything New Year's --obviously you're not doinganything New Year's -- we'rehaving some people over, all ofthem married, not one evenremotely interested in playingaround.  Does that sound greator what?  I can't think of the last timeI was at a party when anythingactually happened.
 SAM	m	 Thanks, but I'll pass.  It'skind of a big night.  I don'tlike to leave Jonah alone.
 SAM	m	 Does red pepper go under R or
 SAM	m	 What?
 JONAH	m	 I forgot to mention.  Jedcalled --
 SAM	m	 Just out of curiosity, do youhave any friends whose namesdon't begin with a J?  I feellike it was a failure of theimagination on our part namingyou Jonah.(looking at the spices)  What is marjoram? Does anyoneknow? 
 JONAH	m	 Jed is having a slumber partyNew Year's Eve and he invitedme.
 SAM	m	 Fine.  Fine.
 JONAH	m	 So I can go.

 JONAH	m	 Look at this, Dad.  They'reall for you --
 MAILMAN	m	 If you're having troublesleeping, you might want to trydrinking a glass of water fromthe other side.
 JONAH	m	 I thought that was for hiccups.
 MAILMAN	m	 Does it work for hiccups?
 JONAH	m	 For hiccups, a spoonful ofsugar, you hold it in yourmouth for a minute.
 MAILMAN	m	 Really?
 SAM	m	 Just out of curiosity, how didthey get our address?
 JONAH	m	 They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive manI've ever laid ears on."
 SAM	m	 How did they get our phonenumber?
 JONAH	m	 You have to give them yourphone number or they won't letyou go on the air.
 JONAH	m	 "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: Iam an SWF"--  What is that?
 SAM	m	 Thank God.  Something you don'tknow.  It's a single whitefemale.
 JONAH	m	 This is no good.  She's lookingfor someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: Ilive in Tulsa." Where is that?
 SAM	m	 Oklahoma.  Do you know wherethat is?
 JONAH	m	 Somewhere in the middle.
 SAM	m	 I'm not going to think aboutwhat they're not teaching youin school.  I am not going tothink about it.  Generally speaking I think weshould rule out people whodon't live somewhere near here
 JONAH	m	 She's willing to fly anywhere.
 SAM	m	 She looks like my third gradeteacher.  I hated my thirdgrade teacher.  Hold it! Waita minute! She is my thirdgrade teacher!
 JONAH	m	 Dad, you're not taking thisseriously.
 SAM	m	 This is not how you do it.  You want this on an Englishmuffin or a bun?
 JONAH	m	 English muffin.  How do you doit?
 SAM	m	 You see someone you like, youget a feeling about them, youask them if they want to have adrink or --
 JONAH	m	 -- a slice of pizza --
 SAM	m	 But not dinner necessarily onthe first date because by thetime you're halfway throughdinner you might be sorry youasked them to dinner whereas ifit's just a drink, if you likethem you can always ask themfor dinner but if you don't youcan go home if you see what Imean.  I wonder if it still works thisway.
 JONAH	m	 It doesn't.  They ask you.
 SAM	m	 I'm starting to notice that.
 JONAH	m	 If you get a new wife, I guessyou'll have sex with her, huh?
 SAM	m	 What do you think?
 JONAH	m	 Will she scratch up your back?
 SAM	m	 What?
 JONAH	m	 In the movies women are alwaysscratching up guy's back andscreaming and stuff.  Whenthey're having sex.
 SAM	m	 Whose show was this on?
 JONAH	m	 Jed's got cables.
 SAM	m	 Go to sleep.
 JONAH	m	 Kiss Howard.  G'night, Howard.
 ANNOUNCER	f	 Up next, "You and YourEmotions" with Dr.  MarciaFieldstone, clinicalpsychologist and the bestfriend you never had.
 WOMAN'S VOICE	f	He says he doesn't love me any  more.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Why do you want to be withsomeone who doesn't love you?
 ANOTHER WOMAN	f	 Every time I come close toorgasm he stops and goes tomake himself a sandwich --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Why don't you make him asandwich beforehand?
 SAM'S VOICE	m	 When I met my wife, it was soclear.  I jus knew.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 What was it that made you know?
 SAM'S VOICE	m	 I don't think I could reallydescribe it.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Why not?
 SAM'S VOICE	m	 And if I could describe it, itprobably wouldn't be on a radioshow.  But what the hell.  It's notone specific thing.  It's moreof a feeling. You touch her for the firsttime, and suddenly... you'rehome.  It's almost like...magic.
 ANNOUNCER	f	 We'll be back after thiscommercial with Dr. MarciaFieldstone.
 ANNIE	f	 I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happilymarried?
 TOM	m	 What?
 ANNIE	f	 I mean, why did you getmarried? Was it all fireworksand trumpets and --
 TOM	m	 I got married because Betsysaid we had to break up or getmarried.  So we get married.
 ANNIE	f	 But when you met her, did youbelieve she was the only personfor you? That in some mystical,cosmic way, it was fated?
 TOM	m	 Annie, when you meet someoneand you're attracted to them,it just means that yoursubconscious is attracted totheir subconscious,subconsciously.  So what wethink of as chemistry is justtwo neuroses knowing that theyare a perfect match.
 ANNIE	f	 I don't even know him.  ButI'm having all these fantasiesabout a man I've never met,who lives in Seattle.
 TOM	m	 It rains nine months of theyear in Seattle.
 ANNIE	f	 I know, I know.  I do not wantto move to Seattle.  But what Ireally don't want to do is endup always wondering what mighthave happened and knowing Icould have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it?Everyone panics before they getmarried, didn't you?
 TOM	m	 Yes, I did.
 ANNIE	f	 Thank you, Tom.  I feel so muchbetter just having blown thisoff.
 TOM	m	 Any time.
 JAY	m	 Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda  ... She's a weightlifter, butit's not like her neck isbigger than her head oranything --
 SAM	m	 I'm not asking you to set meup, Jay.  That's not what Ineed your help for.  I want toknow what it's like over there.
 JAY	m	 And that's what I'm trying totell you.  What women arelooking over, okay? Pecs and acute butt.
 SAM	m	 You mean, like, "He has thecutest butt"? Where did I hearthat recently?
 JAY	m	 Everywhere.  You can't eventurn on the news withouthearing about how some babethought some guy's butt wascute.  Who the first babe tosay this was I don't know,but it caught on.
 JAY	m	 When's the latest time you wereout there?
 SAM	m	 Seventy... eight.
 JAY	m	 Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go onfor years.  Then you havetests.  Then you get to do itwith a condom.  The good news is, split thecheck.
 SAM	m	 I don't think it could let awoman pay for dinner.
 JAY	m	 Great.  They'll have a paradein your honor.  You'll be Manof the Year in SeattleMagazine.  Tira misu.
 SAM	m	 What's tira misu?
 JAY	m	 You'll find out.
 SAM	m	 What is it?
 JAY	m	 You'll see.
 SAM	m	 Some woman is going to want meto do it to her and I'm notgoing to know what it is.
 JAY	m	 You'll like it.
 SAM	m	 This is going to be tougherthan I thought.
 SAM	m	 Jonah?
 SAM	m	 Jonah?
 SAM	m	 Jonah?
 SAM	m	 Jonah?
 JONAH	m	 Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
 SAM	m	 It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
 JONAH	m	 Dad, this is amazing.  If youplay this backwards, it says"Paul is dead."
 SAM	m	 I know.
 JONAH	m	 How do you know?
 JONAH	m	 Dad, could you close the door?
 JESSICA	f	 H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
 SAM	m	 Get a life.
 SAM	m	 Hi, Victoria?... It's SamBaldwin, I don't know if youremember me.  Oh?  Well, great. I was wondering if you wantedto have a drink... Friday,say... Dinner?... Sure, dinnerwould be fine.  Sure.  Dinner.
 ANNIE	f	 Now those were the days whenpeople knew how to be in love.
 BECKY	f	 You're a basket case.
 ANNIE	f	 They knew it.  Time, distance,nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It wasright.  It was real.  It was...
 BECKY	f	 ... movie.  That's your problem.  You don'twant to be in love.  You wantto be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
 ANNIE	f	 "Dear Sleepless and Son..."
 BECKY	f	 It sounds like the name of amattress store --
 ANNIE	f	 "I am not the sort of personwho listens to call-in radioshows" --
 BECKY	f	 And this woman is a writer!That's what everyone writes atthe beginning of letters tostrangers.
 ANNIE	f	 I know that.  You think I don'tknow that? "I know that's adumb way to begin, but it's theonly way I can think of toconvey what happened to me theother night when I heard thetwo of you on the radio.  Onthe other hand, maybe I'm justlosing my mind."
 BECKY	f	 You are.  You're losing yourmind.  What about Walter?
 ANNIE	f	 I'm going to marry Walter.  Ijust have to get this out of mysystem.
 BECKY	f	 Right.
 ANNIE	f	 I should say something in thisabout magic.
 BECKY	f	 What?
 ANNIE	f	 I don't know.  I mean, what ifI never meet him? What if thisman is my destiny and I nevermeet him?
 BECKY	f	 Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
 ANNIE	f	 "I want to meet you..."
 BECKY	f	 "On top of the Empire StateBuilding at sunset onValentine's Day."
 ANNIE	f	 Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in NewYork with Walter, I can squeezeit in.
 BECKY	f	 You want to hear about destiny?If my husband hadn't gone on adiet, which caused me to leavehim, I would never have been onthat flight to Miami, and metRick, and ended up having sexin the bathroom of a 727 withthat nob you slide that says"vacant-occupied, vacant-  occupied, vacant-occupied" --
 ANNIE	f	 You never told me you left yourhusband because he went on adiet.
 BECKY	f	 He lost all the weight...there.
 ANNIE	f	 That's impossible.  A guy can't
 BECKY	f	 Can too.
 ANNIE	f	 No.
 BECKY	f	 Yes.
 ANNIE	f	 And then you left him? He lostweight there and you left him?
 BECKY	f	 Plus he fell in love with atemp.
 ANNIE	f	 Listen to this, I love thispart --
 BECKY	f	 Men never get this movie.
 ANNIE	f	 I know.
 BECKY	f	 Do you think at the end of themovie when she's in thewheelchair they can still doit?
 ANNIE	f	 I always wondered about thattoo.
 SAM	m	 It's okay, it's okay.  I'mhere.
 JONAH	m	 It was sinking.
 SAM	m	 What was?
 JONAH	m	 Our house.  There was watercoming in all the windows.
 SAM	m	 You're worried we're going tobe all right.  We're going tobe all right.  I remember sometimes you'd havenightmares as a baby.  Your momwould hold you and rock you andsing you a song.
 JONAH	m	 Bye bye blackbird.
 SAM	m	 Is that what she used to sing?
 JONAH	m	 I miss her.  What do you think happens tosomeone after they die?
 SAM	m	 I don't know.
 JONAH	m	 Like do you believe in heaven?
 SAM	m	 I never did.  Or the whole ideaof an afterlife.  But I don'tknow any more.  I have thesedreams about... your mom... andwe have long talks about...about you, and how you are,which she sort of knows but Itell her anyway.  So what isthat? It's sort of an afterlife,isn't it?
 JONAH	m	 I'm starting to forget her.
 SAM	m	 I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And aslong as I have you, I have yourMom.
 SAM	m	 I... uh... have a date withsomeone Friday night.
 JONAH	m	 Good.

 JONAH	m	 This is a good letter, Dad.
 SAM	m	 The heels on these shoes arevery large.  Why have I nevernoticed this? The heels onthese shoes are grotesque.
 JONAH	m	 Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
 SAM	m	 Now I'm late.  Bye.
 JONAH	m	 Listen to this --
 SAM	m	 Not now, Jonah --
 JONAH	m	 Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellentthird-baseman for as long as Ior anyone else can remember,and I guarantee you will notget one past me"
 SAM	m	 Jonah, I'm leaving --
 JONAH	m	 Dad!
 SAM	m	 Everyone thinks Brooks Robinsonis the greatest.
 JONAH	m	 It's a sign.
 SAM	m	 Oh, right.
 SAM	m	 Come here.  I want to show yousomething.
 SAM	m	 Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Caseclosed.
 JONAH	m	 She doesn't want us to go toBaltimore.  She wants to meetus in New York City onValentine's Day.  On top of theEmpire State Building.
 SAM	m	 Perfect.  We'll be there.
 SAM	m	 Hi.
 VICTORIA	f	 Hi.
 SAM	m	 You look good.
 VICTORIA	f	 You look good yourself.
 VICTORIA	f	 I thought you were never goingto call me.
 SAM	m	 You did?
 VICTORIA	f	 I really wanted you to call me,and I thought you were nevergoing to --
 SAM	m	 You could have called me --
 VICTORIA	f	 No way.  No way I was going tobe the first woman you went outwith after...  There is no percentagewhatsoever in being the firstwoman anyone goes out withafter...
 SAM	m	 You are the first woman I'mgoing out with.
 VICTORIA	f	 Oh.
 SAM	m	 So whatdya say? I'll get thecheck, and I'll call you ineight months.
 VICTORIA	f	 Oh, you are funny --
 ANNIE	f	 Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has isbeing repossessed, includinghis filthy, dented mobile home.
 WHEEDLE	?	 He's got a houseboat.
 ANNIE	f	 I hate boats.
 WHEEDLE	?	 It sounds nice.
 ANNIE	f	 Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hatethem.
 WHEEDLE	?	 Houseboats don't go anywhere.
 ANNIE	f	 Boats.  All anyone talks aboutis the wind.  Is it up, is itdown.  I can't live with a manwho only talks about the wind.
 WHEEDLE	?	 It's not a boat boat.  It'sreally a house.
 ANNIE	f	 But it's on the water.
 WHEEDLE	?	 It's on the lake right in themiddle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of theyear in Seattle.
 ANNIE	f	 I hope I don't have to pay forthat piece of information.
 WHEEDLE	?	 No, that's free.  He's anarchitect.  Used to do bighigh-profile projects.  Hescaled it all back when hiswife died.  Now he remodelspeople's homes.  He works ina small firm, makes a goodliving.
 ANNIE	f	 He's real.
 JONAH	m	 I figure we could go to NewYork, catch the Knicks, andsince we'd be there anyway,obviously we'd go to the EmpireState Building --
 SAM	m	 There she is.
 JONAH	m	 Why is she bringing that bag?
 SAM	m	 She's going to cook somethingfor us?
 VICTORIA	f	 Hi, Sam.  And let me guess --you must be Jonah.
 JONAH	m	 Hi.  He should book now because wecan get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travelagents and --
 SAM	m	 Not now, Jonah.
 SAM	m	 We can't finish the job.  She'son her sixth painter, now she'sthinking maybe she wants thefireplace rebricked --
 VICTORIA	f	 I know her pretty well.  MaybeI could call her --
 SAM	m	 I've already solved it.  I'vehired a hit man.
 VICTORIA	f	 Oh that is so funny, you are sofunny.
 SAM	m	 Every time she wants to changesomething, she talks in thislittle baby voice --  "Couldn't you just move thestairway a teeny tiny bit?"--
 JONAH	m	 Do you like baseball?
 VICTORIA	f	 Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm hasbox seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
 JONAH	m	 What about camping?
 VICTORIA	f	 What about it?
 JONAH	m	 Do you like it?
 VICTORIA	f	 I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in abrook and floss with a weed.
 JONAH	m	 We ought to start campingagain, Dad.
 SAM	m	 Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
 JONAH	m	 It's only ten o'clock.
 SAM	m	 Jonah!
 JONAH	m	 Okay.
 SAM	m	 Thank Victoria for dinner.
 JONAH	m	 Thanks for dinner.  I never sawanybody cook potatoes that way.
 SAM	m	 I'm glad you liked it.  Goodnight, Jonah.
 ANNIE	f	 Hello.
 BECKY	f	 Turn on your radio!
 ANNIE	f	 What?
 BECKY	f	 The kid is on.  You've got melistening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
 WALTER	m	 Who is it?
 ANNIE	f	 Oh, it's just Becky, she'shaving trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm goingdownstairs.
 JONAH	m	 This is a complete disaster.  Iwanted him to find a wife, buthe's got the wrong one --
 ANNIE	f	 How am I going to explain thisto Walter?
 BECKY	f	 Shhh, listen to this --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Shouldn't your father be thejudge of whether she's rightor wrong?
 JONAH	m	 Please, please don't make mesick.  He's not sane enough tojudge anything.  She's a ho.
 JONAH	m	 My dad's been captured by a ho.
 VICTORIA	f	 Is he there?
 SAM	m	 No.  After he was born, every timewe started to make love, hewould cry.  He had an uncannysense of timing.  We reallyshouldn't do anything hereanyway.
 VICTORIA	f	 Absolutely.  Right.
 JONAH	m	 Oh God, it's major.  He'skissing her on the lips.  Ihave to stop this.
 ANNIE	f	 Come on, Jonah --
 BECKY	f	 Do something --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	f	 Jonah, you can't butt in here.
 JONAH	m	 Yes, I can.
 WALTER	m	 Miss Scarlett.  In the broomcloset.  With the radio.
 ANNIE	f	 I gotta go.  I'll see you atwork.  Walter, you scared me.  Don'tever do that again.
 SAM	m	 Don't ever do that again.
 JONAH	m	 I thought I saw a black widowspider.
 SAM	m	 What are you doing up?
 JONAH	m	 I was thirsty.
 SAM	m	 There's a bathroom upstairs.
 JONAH	m	 The water tastes better in thekitchen.
 SAM	m	 That's true.  Why is that?
 ANNIE	f	 Becky heard this woman on theradio complaining about thisguy she was sure was Rick,which meant he was cheating onher.  She was completelyhysterical.  Then it turned outthe woman lived in Duluth.
 WALTER	m	 That doesn't make any sense.
 ANNIE	f	 I know.  It makes no sense atall.  Thank God my life is inplace.
 JESSICA	f	 Write her.
 JONAH	m	 You think so?
 JESSICA	f	 It's Y. O. H.
 JONAH	m	 Yeah.  What's that?
 JESSICA	f	 Your only hope.
 ANNIE	f	 I thought I would look intodoing a story about those radioshows.
 BECKY	f	 You'd probably have to gosomewhere to really look intoit.
 ANNIE	f	 Definitely.
 SAM	m	 Get in the car right thisminute.
 JESSICA	f	 I'll call you later.
 SAM	m	 Did you call that radio stationagain?
 JONAH	m	 No.
 SAM	m	 Everyone at work heard you.
 JONAH	m	 I just called for a second.
 SAM	m	 Long enough to call Victoria aho.
 JONAH	m	 It's a short word.
 SAM	m	 This is not a joke.  Thank GodVictoria doesn't know.  Itwould really have hurt herfeelings.
 JONAH	m	 If she knew, she'd neverforgive me.  It would behopeless for the two of you.
 SAM	m	 Don't open your mouth again. Ever.
 WALTER	m	 Couldn't you just do a phoneinterview?
 ANNIE	f	 Not for the kind of place Iwant to do.  I won't be inChicago that long.
 WALTER	m	 When you get back, I'll begone --
 ANNIE	f	 And then I'll see you in NewYork --
 WALTER	m	 Okay, okay.
 PILOT'S VOICE	m	 This is Captain Fosterwelcoming you aboard Flight 132to Seattle.  Our flying timetoday...
 ANNIE	f	 Do you believe that any lie isa betrayal? That's what HaroldPinter says, but it seems to meit's a very harsh way ofdrawing the line.
 VICTORIA	f	 Can I bring something back foryou? A souvenir?  Does he like those little snowscenes?  You know -- you shake them upand the snow floats down?
 JONAH	m	 Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
 VICTORIA	f	 Well...
 JONAH	m	 I think they're announcing yourflight.
 SAM	m	 He's ten.
 VICTORIA	f	 He's good at it.
 SAM	m	 I read an article about this
 VICTORIA	f	 I read the same article...
 SAM	m	 It takes time --
 VICTORIA	f	 Absolutely.  When I come back,maybe the two of us shouldspend some time together, onour own.  What do you think?
 SAM	m	 Sure.  Sure.
 SAM	m	 Jonah, this isn't fair.  Youdon't know Victoria.  I hardlyknow her myself.  She is, infact, a mystery to me.  Shetosses her hair a lot.  Whydoes she do this? I have noidea.  Is it a twitch? Doesshe need a haircut? Should sheuse barrette so it doesn'tkeep falling in her face?These are things that I'mwilling to get to the bottomof, and that is why I am datingher.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can youappreciate the difference?That's what single people do,they try people on and they seeif they fit.  But nobody fitsperfectly, everyone is anadjustment.
 JONAH	m	 Was Mom an adjustment?
 SAM	m	 I'm never going to meet anyonewho's going to measure up toyour mom in your eyes? What doyou think? There's a perfectwoman walking around out there?
 SAM	m	 There's no such thing as aperf --
 SAM	m	 God, she's beautiful.
 JONAH	m	 Victoria? She's okay.
 JONAH	m	 Dad, I was talking to Jessicaabout reincarnation, and shethinks that probably you knewAnnie in another life.
 SAM	m	 Who is Annie?
 JONAH	m	 The one who wrote us.
 JONAH	m	 But Jessica says you and Annienever got together in thatlife, and your hearts are likepuzzles with parts out of themand when you get together thepuzzle's complete.
 SAM	m	 God dammit.
 JONAH	m	 The reason I know this and youdon't is that I'm younger andpurer so I'm more in touch withcosmic forces.
 SAM	m	 I sincerely hope you are notgoing to marry Jessica.
 ANNIE	f	 Hello, Mr.  Baldwin? No. Hello, Sam?  I'm Annie Reed.  I'm Annie Reed.  I'm Annie Reed.  I'm Annie Reed.
 ANNIE	f	 I heard about you calling Dr.Fieldstone, and well, I justhappened to be out here on...
 ANNIE	f	 business...
 ANNIE	f	 vacation...
 ANNIE	f	 for no good reason at all...  business... and I thought I'ddrop and...  say hello...
 ANNIE	f	 invite you to lunch...
 ANNIE	f	 take a shower with you...
 ANNIE	f	 shoot myself.
 ANNIE	f	 I watched him play with his sonat the beach.
 BECKY	f	 Did you talk to him?
 ANNIE	f	 I couldn't do it.  How did Iget here?
 BECKY	f	 You told a lie and got on aplane.
 ANNIE	f	 That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over theretomorrow and talk to him.  Iam.
 BECKY	f	 Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
 ANNIE	f	 Becky?
 BECKY	f	 What?
 ANNIE	f	 Is this crazy?
 BECKY	f	 No.  That's the weirdest partabout it.
 ANNIE	f	 Thank you.  I love you.
 BECKY	f	 I love you, too.
 ANNIE	f	 Good night.
 SAM	m	 God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
 SUZY	f	 He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
 DRIVER	m	 Lady, what the hell are youdoing?
 SAM	m	 Hello.
 ANNIE	f	 Hello.
 ANNIE	f	 How could I have been such anidiot?
 BECKY	f	 You were standing in the middleof the street?
 ANNIE	f	 You know that dream whereyou're walking down the streetnaked and everyone is lookingat you?
 BECKY	f	 I love that dream.
 ANNIE	f	 That was nothing compared tothis humiliation, nothing.
 BECKY	f	 But he saw you, right?
 ANNIE	f	 He said hello.
 BECKY	f	 And what did you say?
 ANNIE	f	 All I could think of to say washello.
 BECKY	f	 It's a sign --
 ANNIE	f	 It's a sign I've watched thismovie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minuteI listen to that stupid programon the radio, I've been acomplete jerk.
 BECKY	f	 You don't know who she was,Annie --
 ANNIE	f	 I saw her.  She looked justlike this --
 BECKY	f	 This is a photo of hair.
 ANNIE	f	 Well, it's the same woman.  Andhe was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
 ANNIE	f	 Becky?
 BECKY	f	 So I mailed your letter.
 ANNIE	f	 "Dear Annie: Thanks for yourletter.  It was great.  We'revery excited about meeting youin New York on Valentine's Dayand seeing if we are M.F.E.O.Sleepless in Seattle."
 ANNIE	f	 Made for each other.
 BECKY	f	 It's cute.  It's like a littleclue.
 BECKY	f	 So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is ahighly overrated thing in aguy, and our pathetic need forit is what gets us into so muchtrouble.
 ANNIE	f	 I'm going to run back toWalter's arms, if he's stillhave me.
 BECKY	f	 What about the letter?
 ANNIE	f	 It doesn't mean anything.  Itwas written before I went outthere.  Before the ho.
 SUZY	f	 You saw her in the airport andthen here?
 SAM	m	 I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
 GREG	m	 Well, at least you're out thereseeing people again.  That'sterrific.
 SAM	m	 Well, just one really.
 SUZY	f	 How's Jonah taking it?
 SAM	m	 It'll take him a while to comearound.  A month ago he calledone of those radio call-inshows and told them I needed awife --
 SUZY	f	 You're kidding --
 SAM	m	 Now that I'm seeing someone,it's a whole other thing.
 SAM	m	 He's become obsessed withsome woman who wrote me --
 GREG	m	 Are you serious?
 SAM	m	 She wants to meet me at the topof the Empire State Building.
 SUZY	f	 It's a little derivative.
 SAM	m	 What do you mean?
 SUZY	f	 "An Affair To Remember." Didyou ever see it? Cary Grantand Deborah Kerr.  Before thatit was called "Love Affair WithIrene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
 GREG	m	 Women love this movie.
 SUZY	f	 They met at the Empire StateBuilding, only they didn't. Never mind.
 GREG	m	 What kind of person would writeto someone they heard on theradio?
 SAM	m	 I got hundreds of letters fromwomen all over the country --
 GREG	m	 Desperate women --
 SUZY	f	 Just because someone's lookingfor a nice guy doesn't makethem desperate.
 GREG	m	 How about rapacious and love-  starved?
 SUZY	f	 No.
 GREG	m	 It is easier to be killed by aterrorist --
 SUZY	f	 It is not --
 GREG	m	 Right, right.
 SAM	m	 Anyway, Victoria's nice.
 SUZY	f	 Would you follow her through anairport?
 SAM	m	 Look, I met somebody.  She'sgood, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spendyour life chasing afterfantasies.
 ANNIE	f	 Hi.
 SAM	m	 Hi.  So far so good.  So.  Whatshould we talk about? Howinsecure we were in highschool.  Shirley Votypka, thefirst girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health?Did you know that eating sixmacadamia nuts is theequivalent of eating a steak?
 ANNIE	f	 Shhhh --
 BECKY	f	 You're going to miss the train.
 ANNIE	f	 No, I'm not.
 BECKY	f	 What are your plans in NewYork?
 ANNIE	f	 We're going to the Rainbow Roomand the symphony tomorrow night.
 BECKY	f	 I love the symphony.
 ANNIE	f	 I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally Ifeel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything elseis what happens when you watchtoo many movies and completelylose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone aboutwhat happened.  "Sleepless inSeattle" is history.
 JESSICA	f	 This is the best movie I'veever seen in my life.
 JONAH	m	 I don't get it.
 JESSICA	f	 You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
 JONAH	m	 Do you know how much it coststo go to New York?
 JESSICA	f	 Nobody knows.  It changespractically every day.  Howmuch money do you have?
 JONAH	m	 Eighty dollars.
 JESSICA	f	 I have forty-two.  So thatwould definitely covertaxicabs, I think.
 JONAH	m	 But how am I going to getthere?
 JESSICA'S MOTHER	f	 Honey, I'm going out for a fewminutes.  Could you keep an eye on thingsout front till I get back?
 JESSICA	f	 Sure.
 JESSICA	f	 Do you want an aisle or awindow seat?
 JONAH	m	 Window.
 JESSICA	f	 Do you want a fruit plate?
 JONAH	m	 I don't know.  Do I?
 JESSICA	f	 I'd rather die than eat on anairplane.  I'm telling them you're twelveso you can fly unaccompaniedand they won't make you becarried around by a stewardessand everything.
 ANNIE	f	 You go.
 WALTER	m	 Ever since Christmas, you'vebeen different.  Kind ofdistracted, distant.  But Ifeel like you're coming backfrom wherever you were.
 ANNIE	f	 I am.  I was just... I just got... Ithink I got nervous.  It'snormal, right? Don't you everfeel nervous about, you know?
 WALTER	m	 What?
 ANNIE	f	 About forever.
 WALTER	m	 No.
 ANNIE	f	 Well, I did.  And you know whatI think? I think that it wasalmost... too perfect.
 ANNIE	f	 I started to wonder whether wewere the human equivalent oftwo rights making a wrong, youknow?
 ANNIE	f	 It was like kismet but not, ifyou see what I mean.
 ANNIE	f	 You have to grow up.  You can'thave all these adolescentdreams about how exciting yourlife is going to be --
 ANNIE	f	 Don't hate me but I love thispattern.
 ANNIE	f	 I do.
 WALTER	m	 It's just like my grandmother'schina.
 SALESWOMAN	f	 How many place settings shouldI put down?
 ANNIE & WALTER	f	 Ten.
 WALTER	m	 Exactly.  Eight is too few andtwelve is too many.
 ANNIE	f	 Walter.
 WALTER	m	 It was my mother's.
 ANNIE	f	 It's so beautiful.  It's justwhat I would have picked out ifI'd had every ring in the worldto choose from.  You see what I mean.  There arepeople who would like arelationship to be full ofsurprises, but I am not one ofthem.  Surprises are highly overrated.
 ANNIE	f	 Promise me something, Walter. Promise me you will never havea surprise party for me.  Ever. You know what happens, you walkin the door in some horriblesweater you put on that morning,and there are hundreds of peoplein their best clothes shouting"Surprise!"
 SAM	m	 Have you seen my wallet?
 JONAH	m	 It might be in the kitchen.
 SAM	m	 I'm only going to be away onenight, okay, and Clarise willbe here.  You'll have a swelltime.  You'll watch a littleGeraldo, some Nightmare on ElmStreet 12, I'll never know.
 JONAH	m	 Are you going with her?
 SAM	m	 Yes.
 SAM	m	 I have to have a life.  I haveto do things that I want withpeople my own age.  It's noneof your business who I am goingout with.  I don't give a goodgoddam if you're angry --
 JONAH	m	 This is the one I like.
 SAM	m	 I don't care who you like. It's who I like.  But the truthis you're never going to likeanyone because it isn't yourmother.
 JONAH	m	 Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
 SAM	m	 Thank you, Jonah.  But thepoint is, I am not askingpermission.
 JONAH	m	 What's wrong with Annie?
 SAM	m	 Shut up.
 JONAH	m	 Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom neverdid that.  Mom never said shutup to me.  Mom never yelled atme.
 SAM	m	 This conversation is finished.
 JONAH	m	 You said we could go to NewYork.
 SAM	m	 Did not.

 JONAH	m	 No.
 SAM	m	 I mean, so far, have I screwedit up for you?
 JONAH	m	 No.
 SAM	m	 I can't believe you flew firstclass.
 JONAH	m	 It was all they had.
 ANNIE	f	 I don't know what to say aboutit, Walter.  It was a form oftemporary insanity.  But I hadto tell you about it because --
 WALTER	m	 -- it was a betrayal.
 ANNIE	f	 Yes.  But it wasn't really.  Itwas just...
 WALTER	m	 So what happened?
 ANNIE	f	 I told you.  Nothing --
 WALTER	m	 At the top of the Empire StateBuilding --
 ANNIE	f	 I'm not at the top of theEmpire State Building.  I'mhere.
 WALTER	m	 Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let'sleave that out of it.  I don'twant to be someone you'resettling for.  I don't want tobe someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growthstocks, I have a paidsubscription to Home RoxOffice, I have no sexualdiseases, I have been steadilyemployed in a part of theeconomy that isn't soft, I haveexpectation in the way ofinherited wealth, I dressnicely, I am a member of theprivate sector, an independentvoter, I don't watch MondayNight Football, the only thingwrong with me is that I amallergic to wheat,strawberries, penicillin,pollen, nuts and wool.  Thereare plenty of women who see meas the brass ring.  If youdon't -- marriage is hardenough without bringing suchlow expectations into it, isn'tit?
 ANNIE	f	 Oh, Walter.  I don't deserveyou.
 WALTER	m	 I think that's what I'm saying.
 ANNIE	f	 You okay?
 WALTER	m	 Yes.  Some people will do anything toget out of going to a symphony.
 ANNIE	f	 Oh!
 WALTER	m	 What?
 ANNIE	f	 Look!
 WALTER	m	 Go for it.
 ELEVATOR OPERATOR	m	 Last call.  Closing time.
 JONAH	m	 This is pretty dumb, wasn'tit?

 JONAH	m	 Sure.
 SAM	m	 Let's go home.
