ALEXI	m	Snow, maybe?
DIMITRI	m	What, you gonna ski on this?
DIMITRI	m	Come on, let's bag this.  It's beer time.
ELLY	f	Guess the picnic got rained out.
ELLY	f	Oh, scary.
ELLY	f	What are you, like, the night watchman?
MICKEY	m	What this place needs is a good natural catastrophe.  Earthquake, tornado...
ALBRECHT	m	You gotta put the mustard underneath first.
MICKEY	m	Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.
ALBRECHT	m	Here, let me do it.
ALBRECHT	m	Come on... onion.  Don't cheap out on me.  Lotta onions.
MICKEY	m	Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.
ALBRECHT	m	How do you ride that thing on a  wet street?
ELLY	f	Talent. Hi.
ALBRECHT	m	Care for a hot dog?
ELLY	f	You buying?
ALBRECHT	m	I'm buying.
ELLY	f	No onions though, okay?
ALBRECHT	m	No onions?
ELLY	f	They make you fart.
MICKEY	m	What's goin' on, Elly?
ELLY	f	I went to see a friend of mine.
MICKEY	m	Well, how's your friend?
ELLY	f	She's still dead.
ERIC	m	What the hell are you?
SKULL COWBOY	m	Interested?  Follow the crow.
T-BIRD	?	Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof accelerator.  I squirt you with this, you could jump in the  Detroit river and burn all the way to the bottom.
T-BIRD	?	You know, Lake Erie actually caught on fire once, from all the crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen that.
T-BIRD	?	We're ready to rock.
SKANK	m	What about working girl?
T-BIRD	?	What about her?
SKANK	m	I say we leave her here to fry, man.
T-BIRD	?	No.  Let's take her with us.
TB	m	Skank, shut her the fuck up!
SKANK	m	Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!
ALBRECHT	m	Goddammit.
MICKEY	m	Call it in?
ALBRECHT	m	Yeah, do it! Stay right there!
MICKEY	m	You want I should save this for you?
SKANK	m	Dump her, man, dump her!
ALBRECHT	m	Here now!  You're gonna be okay! Can you understand me?  I'm a police officer...
WOMAN	f	He touched me and it stopped.  The pain.
ALBRECHT	m	What did you say?
WOMAN	f	I saw a ghost...
ALBRECHT	m	Oh no... don't go, darlin', you stay with me, now... shit!
ERIC	m	Fire.  In the rain.
NGO NWA	m	He will see me... unannounced.
LAO	m	(formal greeting) 
NWA	m	(dismissiveness, contempt, then chastizing anger as:)
LAO	m	(phony assuagement)
NWA	m	(knows it's bullshit)
NWA	m	(respect is required)
LAO	m	(begrudging agreement)
NGO NWA	m	(why give me this?)
LAO	m	(sinister punchline)
LAO	m	When I spoke of an offering, I didn't mean an offering to you.
GRANGE	m	You gonna smoke his bones now, or however it is you do it?
ERIC	m	"My kitten walks on velvet feet, and makes no sound at all.  And in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness fall.  I think he loves the lady night..." Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something else?  Something in between?
ERIC	m	Thanks for sharing that.
GIDEON	m	Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the  night, here they come.  Tweedledum and Tweedledummer.
SKANK	m	Hey, blow me, fat boy!
GIDEON	m	Blow yourself, bigmouth.
T-BIRD	?	Whoa, hey, whoa. Business.
GIDEON	m	Whatcha got?
T-BIRD	?	Coupla more rings... 24k.
GIDEON	m	18k.  Crap.
T-BIRD	?	...necklace... pearls...
GIDEON	m	Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
T-BIRD	?	Leather purse...
GIDEON	m	What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right? Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
T-BIRD	?	Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a  favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
SKANK	m	You wouldn't want Top Dollar not  to smile.
ERIC	m	All right.
ERIC	m	Gotcha.
ERIC	m	Thanks.
ERIC	m	Where're we going next -- the sewer?
ERIC	m	Are we finished yet?
ALBRECHT	m	Victim's name is Shelly Webster. The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
ERIC	m	"Draven, Eric."
BOUNCER	m	Hey!  You got any ID?
ELLY	f	Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my, sides.
ELLY	f	Mom --?
DARLA	f	I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
ELLY	f	I lost my key.
FUNBOY	m	Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
DARLA	f	Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
ERIC	m	No!  Don't look!  No! No!
ERIC	m	Stop it.
FUNBOY	m	Let's have some fun.
TIN-TIN	f	You're outta your fuckin' mind.
T-BIRD	?	No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.
SKANK	m	Fuck you, T-Bird.
T-BIRD	?	I love you too, you madman.
FUNBOY	m	Hey, pussycat.
FUNBOY	m	More fun than a torture chamber.
TIN-TIN	f	I hate this goddamn thing...
ERIC	m	We have company.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Having fun yet?  No? I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
ERIC	m	Shelly?
SKULL COWBOY	m	Miss her?
ERIC	m	Yes.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
SKULL COWBOY	m	You must use your eyes.
ERIC	m	Goddammit.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Get it?
ERIC	m	Leave me alone -- !
SKULL COWBOY	m	Do something about it.
ERIC	m	I guess I'm not ready to leave... just yet.
ERIC	m	The last time we saw each other, I didn't do so well. Huh, Gabriel?
ERIC	m	I bet you need some cat food... right?
TIN-TIN	f	Three hundred and your a  gunslinger.
RATSO	m	Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good for the money, man, I promise, Leslie put me up to it, please, man, don't --
TIN-TIN	f	Ratty -- shut the fuck up.
ERIC	m	Another satisfied customer?
TIN-TIN	f	Who the hell is that? Come on out man, I won't hurt you.
ERIC	m	Hello, Tin-Tin.
TIN-TIN	f	Little early from trick-or-treat, homie. This dick trying to bushwack me.
ERIC	m	Murderer.
TIN-TIN	f	Guess you got that goddamn right.
ERIC	m	Try harder.  Try again.
ERIC	m	A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
TIN-TIN	f	Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah... Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
ERIC	m	You cut her.  You raped her. You watched!
TIN-TIN	f	Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
ERIC	m	I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
TIN-TIN	f	I don't know you...
TIN-TIN	f	Holy shit... you're dead, man...
ERIC	m	Victims.  Aren't we all.
ERIC	m	Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...
SHELLY	f	Your scary quotient needs work.
SHELLY	f	I think red's my color, don't you?
SKULL COWBOY	m	Glad to see you're finally with the program.
ERIC	m	Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
SKULL COWBOY	m	You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
ERIC	m	Forget this.
ERIC	m	She always red red was her color.
ERIC	m	All right, bad guys...
ERIC	m	Here I commme -- !
TORRES	m	Couldn't have happened to a nicer  couple.
ALBRECHT	m	Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
TORRES	m	You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
ALBRECHT	m	This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
TORRES	m	Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
ALBRECHT	m	He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
TORRES	m	Was.
ALBRECHT	m	This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
TORRES	m	And you're gonna tell me who.
ALBRECHT	m	Who ever made that.
TORRES	m	What in the hell... do you call that?
ALBRECHT	m	I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
GIDEON	m	Piss off, we're closed.
GIDEON	m	Fucking creatures of the night; they never goddamn learn.
GIDEON	m	HEY!!
ERIC	m	"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door." You heard me rapping, right?
GIDEON	m	Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing asshole, you're breakin' and enterin' and you just bought me a fucking door!
ERIC	m	I'm looking for something in an engagement ring.  Gold.
GIDEON	m	You're looking for a coroner,shit- for-brains!
ERIC	m	I repeat: a gold engagement ring. It was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, I believe was... "T-Bird"?
ERIC	m	Cute nickname, don't you think?
GIDEON	m	I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
ERIC	m	Wrong answer.
GIDEON	m	All's I got is in a box!  Behind the counter!
ERIC	m	No... no... no... no...
ERIC	m	Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of breath.  You have one chance to live.
GIDEON	m	No fucking way.  He'll kill me.
ERIC	m	Who would waste time killing you... besides me?
GIDEON	m	Top Dollar.
ERIC	m	Another jolly nickname?
GIDEON	m	You want those assholes, you want  Top Dollar.
ERIC	m	T-Bird?
GIDEON	m	Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
ERIC	m	A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
ERIC	m	You feed off the living.
GIDEON	m	You walk outta here Top Dollar will erase your ass!  Top Dollar owns the fucking street here and you can't dick with me, you son of a bitch!
ERIC	m	One chance to live.  Take it.
ALBRECHT	m	Don't move! I said don't move.
ERIC	m	I thought the police always said "freeze:.
ALBRECHT	m	I'm the police and I say don't move, Snow White.  You're under arrest; I don't care what else is  wrong with you!  You move and you're dead.
ERIC	m	And I say I'm dead... and I move.
ALBRECHT	m	No further.  I'm serious.
ERIC	m	Then shoot, if you will.
ALBRECHT	m	Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
ERIC	m	You must listen carefully:  the  Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the  alley who needs assistance. As Shelly Webster once needed your  assistance, and as you are shortly  going to need my assistance.
ALBRECHT	m	You wanna run that back for me one time?
ERIC	m	Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
ALBRECHT	m	You don't say.
ERIC	m	I know Top Dollar has turned your  streets into his hell.
ALBRECHT	m	Fucking A, my friend.
ERIC	m	The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht.
ALBRECHT	m	Watch it...
ALBRECHT	m	You're the one who did Tin-Tin...
ALBRECHT	m	Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up looking like a mime from hell. Least he didn't do that "walking against the wind" shit;  I hate that.
DICKEY BIRD	m	T-Bird.  Thrill me.
T-BIRD	?	Business.
PORN QUEEN	f	I don't know how to describe how I feel, Lance -- so restless --
PORN KING	f	You're my Moon Queen, Angelique. Oooh -- I want you're rocket right now in my Sea of Tranquility --  Lance --
TOP DOLLAR	m	Wild fucking night.  I hear our pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.
T-BIRD	?	And Gideon's just burned all the down to the foundation.
T-BIRD 	?	I didn't have nothin to do with that.
TOP DOLLAR	m	Bet that pisses you off, right?
T-BIRD	?	Top, what the fuck is going on tonight?
TOP DOLLAR	m	Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all hotwired and aggressive.  No combat moves until I check this out.
ELLY	f	What are you supposed to be?  A clown?
ERIC	m	Sometimes.
ELLY	f	You look like a rock star without a job.
ERIC	m	I dabble.  May I?
ELLY	f	If you're not some kinda child  molester.
TOP DOLLAR	m	I thought Halloween was tomorrow night.
TOP DOLLAR	m	Get outta my way, you mooks.
LAO	m	An unexpected pleasure.
TOP DOLLAR	m	Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
LAO	m	Who got himself what?
TOP DOLLAR	m	One of mine.  And it wasn't a  standard hit.
LAO	m	I had heard something like this. Describe it for me.  The "hit".
TOP DOLLAR	m	I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
LAO	m	I know of no one. But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity  to deal with?
TOP DOLLAR	m	Anybody violates my turf -- our  turf -- I'll rip out there heart  and show it to 'em.
LAO	m	To be sure.  Now tell how your  friend died.
ALBRECHT	m	Annie?
ANNABELLA	f	Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
ALBRECHT	m	Annie, I need a file.
ANNABELLA	f	Speak up. Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
ALBRECHT	m	This is special, darlin'.  Please?
ANNABELLA	f	Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
ALBRECHT	m	Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
ELLY	f	My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
ERIC	m	Who?
ELLY	f	Mister Funboy.
ERIC	m	Mister Funboy lives there?
ELLY	f	He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
ELLY	f	Can you play that thing or do you just carry it around everywhere?
ERIC	m	I can pick out a tune now  and again.
ELLY	f	Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?" It used to be her favorite.
ERIC	m	Does she have a name?
ELLY	f	No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
ELLY	f	Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?
ELLY	f	Do you feel okay.
ERIC	m	No.
ELLY	f	You gotta go now, I bet.
ERIC	m	I have to go.
GRANGE	m	Top Dollar?
BOUNCE	m	Never heard of him.
GRANGE	m	Funboy?
BOUNCER	m	Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin' Darla.  Pay for your own beer and they'll prob'ly be down before you  can drink it.
ANNABELLA	f	Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
ALBRECHT	m	I knew that.
ALBRECHT	m	Another nice white girl with a cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.
ALBRECHT	m	Shelly Webster.  And her nice  white boyfriend, Eric Draven.
ANNABELLA	f	Your last little wild goose chase got you busted back to the Beat  Patrol, just like in a bad detective story, Eddie. Are we doing the wildgoose thing again?
ALBRECHT	m	Could be.
ANNABELLA	f	You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's  chocolate you, know.
ALBRECHT	m	Well, hello there...chocolate,
ANNABELLA	f	Don't thank me.
ALBRECHT	m	Thanks, babe.
ERIC	m	It's a Raymond Chandler evening And the pavements are all wet, And I'm lurking in the shadows, for it  hasn't happened ...
ERIC	m	... yet.
DARLA	f	Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.
DARLA	f	It's a big fucking bird...
FUNBOY	m	It's a squab.  Here bird, Here, birdie...
ERIC	m	Here Funboy.
FUNBOY	m	Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
DARLA	f	Fun -- look at that guy...
FUNBOY	m	It's just the dope, don't worry
DARLA	f	Fun, he's not going away; he's  scaring the piss outta me!
FUNBOY	m	Not me.
FUNBOY	m	Time for you to take your bird and  leave, freako.
ERIC	m	Take your shot funboy.  You got  me, dead bang.
FUNBOY	m	You are seriously fucked up, man. Just look at yourself.
FUNBOY	m	BANG!  He shoots, he scores!
ERIC	m	Bull's eye.  Good shot.
ERIC	m	Stay.
ERIC	m	Morphine is bad for you.
FUNBOY	m	How the hell did you do that?
ERIC	m	Magic.
FUNBOY	m	Either die or do a solo.
ERIC	m	Neither.
FUNBOY	m	Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
FUNBOY	m	I hate trespassers! I hate prowlers! I hate peeping toms! And right now I hate you!
FUNBOY	m	Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five shots left.
FUNBOY	m	Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
ERIC	m	Does it hurt?
FUNBOY	m	Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
ERIC	m	I have some pain killer right here.
FUNBOY	m	No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
ERIC	m	Your pain ends now.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Howdy You look a mess.  Like an ole cooter dog.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
ERIC	m	Go away.
SKULL COWBOY	m	You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
ERIC	m	Shut up.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Maybe I was wrong about you.
ERIC	m	Your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you.
ERIC	m	Go.  Now.
BOUNCER	m	Hey, g'night, Darla. That there is Darla.
GRANGE	m	Funboy?
ERIC	m	Freeze.
ALBRECHT	m	Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!
ALBRECHT	m	I told you cops don't say "freeze".
ALBRECHT	m	You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
ERIC	m	I saw it, too.
ERIC	m	Walk with me.
ALBRECHT	m	You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
ERIC	m	I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
ALBRECHT	m	You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the  hospital.
ALBRECHT	m	Hey, you asked, man. She held on for thirty hours in  intensive care.  Hemorrhage, trauma.  He body just finally gave it up. I saw it and couldn't do jack for  her.
ALBRECHT	m	You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
ERIC	m	The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
ALBRECHT	m	You gotta understand -- I was  hoping she'd talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with. But she only said one thing to me  before she died.
ERIC	m	My name.
ALBRECHT	m	I'm sorry as hell, man.
ERIC	m	Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
ERIC	m	Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
ALBRECHT	m	I should be trying to stop you.
ERIC	m	Thank you.  For giving a damn.
ALBRECHT	m	My pleasure.
ERIC	m	Don't smoke these.
ALBRECHT	m	Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.
GRANGE	m	The son of a bitch winked at me. The he jumped.  Three stories.
LAO	m	Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
GRANGE	m	No.  I saw a guitar. This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it? There was a drawing on the wall  that looked like a bird.  In  blood.
LAO	m	Good. It could've been a chicken...
SKANK	m	I wish to hell I had torched Gideon's, that fat fuck.
T-BIRD	?	I wish to hell I knew who it was that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo doll last night.
T-BIRD	?	We need some smokes and some road beers.
SKANK	m	Got it.
T-BIRD	?	What the fuck are you supposed to be, man?!
ERIC	m	I'm your passenger.  You drive. And stop talking.
SKANK	m	What's all this happy horseshit?
AXEL	m	Alright, alright, alright -- everybody be cool and stay exactly where you are.
CHOPPER	m	Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.
ERIC	m	Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're a hell of a wheelman; you know you can drive faster.
T-BIRD	?	You call it, blood -- you got the gun. You just tell me where you want to go.
ERIC	m	That's good.  We're going  someplace you've never been before.
MJ	?	Smells like rain.
SPEEG	?	Smells like a septic tank.  You got that cream stuff?
MJ	?	In the bag.
SPEEG   	?	I hate this cream stuff.  They can't even call it cream, legally.
MJ	?	What in the crap?
SPEEG	?	Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!
ERIC	m	You caught one.  Drive faster.
T-BIRD	?	Man, you gonna get us killed dead and I don't even know what you want!
ERIC	m	I want you to stop talking.  And  drive.  Drive faster.
ERIC	m	You're very popular.  Thought you could handle this thing.
T-BIRD	?	To hell with you.
ERIC	m	Naturally.
T-BIRD	?	So what -- you gonna rape me now?
ERIC	m	Time for your reward, T.  Payback with interest earned.
ERIC	m	A little restrictive?  Good. You held her down and raped her. You were the first.  She burned while you were inside of her. What's the lag on this?  About twenty seconds, would you say?
ERIC	m	I've comrades in hell, T-bird. Give them my best.
ERIC	m	All gone.
DARLA	f	I never was too good at this  domestic shit.
ELLY	f	Don't say "shit". That's okay.  Corn Flakes are okay.  Anything.
IRATE VOICE	f	Hey, shut the fuck up!
MICKEY	m	Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
ELLY	f	Mom tried to cook.
MICKEY	m	Oh.
CUSTOMER	m	Hey, Mickey, I need a special with everything.  No sawdust.
MICKEY	m	Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.
GRANGE	m	You're Elly, right?  I know your mom.
ELLY	f	A lot of people "know" my mom.
GRANGE	m	I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
ELLY	f	I don't know you.
GRANGE	m	I'd like to get in touch with him.
ELLY	f	You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
GRANGE	m	I'm looking for a good guitar man.
ELLY	f	Right.
ELLY	f	You buying? He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
GRANGE	m	I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
ERIC	m	That's better.
ERIC	m	It's almost time.
SKANK	m	Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face all painted white like some kinda fuckin' kabuki homo!
LAO	m	Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
TOP DOLLAR	m	"Our" Crow...?
LAO	m	Come now.  You've seen the  graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top? You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
TOP DOLLAR	m	The night is young.
SKANK	m	The found T-bird flash-fried to what was left of his fucking car!
TOP DOLLAR	m	Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's against the law!
TOP DOLLAR	m	I don't give a shit what kinda bird this guy is.
LAO	m	I am sitting over here.
LAO	m	Do you think this childish machismo impresses me? When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one  block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no  one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
TOP DOLLAR	m	Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
LAO	m	Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
TOP DOLLAR	m	Whatever you say, I can do.
LAO	m	That's reassuring.
SKANK	m	What was that -- !?
TOP DOLLAR	m	Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.
TOP DOLLAR	m	You want my attention, man you got it.
SKANK	m	It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!
ERIC	m	You have to be SKank. One moment.
ERIC	m	Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down.
MJ	?	OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!
ALBRECHT	m	Jesus Christ...
ERIC	m	Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
TOP DOLLAR	m	Five large, in the drawer right  over there.  I never saw you.
ERIC	m	Do you know what you destroyed?
TOP DOLLAR	m	Take the dope, too.
ERIC	m	A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
TOP DOLLAR	m	That's ancient history.
ERIC	m	It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
TOP DOLLAR	m	Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
ERIC	m	You don't even remember...
TOP DOLLAR	m	I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
ERIC	m	Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps  for you.
ERIC	m	You're a detail man, Top -- you need to see more.
ERIC	m	All of her pain, Top.  Thirty hours.  All at once...
ERIC	m	...all for you.
ERIC	m	I didn't think you could handle it either.
LEAD SWAT	m	That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You stand down now, and that's an order!
LEAD SWAT	m	The fire escape's covered.
TEAM LEADER	m	On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep firing!
LEAD SWAT	m	Holy shit, it's spiderman.
LEAD SWAT	m	What're you boy scouts staring at! Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!
CHOPPER PILOT	m	He's off the roof.  We can't see him.
LEAD SWAT	m	Dammit to hell! Come on.
ALBRECHT	m	Come on!
ALBRECHT	m	Keep your head down!
ALBRECHT	m	I figured you might need a ride  home.
ERIC	m	It's done.
ALBRECHT	m	I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
ERIC	m	Funboy had to leave this mortal  coil.
ALBRECHT	m	Yeah, among others. Hey, man -- you're hit.
ERIC	m	It's only a flesh wound.
ALBRECHT	m	It's only fourteen or fifteen  flesh wounds.
ERIC	m	You shouldn't smoke these.
ALBRECHT	m	Great.  Litterbug of the Living Dead.
ERIC	m	I'm finished.
ERIC	m	I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
ALBRECHT	m	Right. You sure I can't just take you to  the emergency ward?
ERIC	m	They couldn't do anything for me.
ALBRECHT	m	How 'bout the morgue?
ERIC	m	No.  I have one more thing to do.
ALBRECHT	m	You're gonna kill somebody else. We're gonna stop and get a shit-load of Band-Aids?
ERIC	m	I have to prepare for an  anniversary.  This coming night.
GRANGE	m	What... the hell is that?
LAO	m	This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
GRANGE	m	That thing is poisonous.
LAO	m	Extremely so. You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form  of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
GRANGE	m	Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
LAO	m	I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
GRANGE	m	Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
LAO	m	Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
GRANGE	m	Like some sort of zombie on a  revenge trip.
LAO	m	Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
GRANGE	m	Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die.
LAO	m	To the contrary...
LAO	m	...all the dying tonight will be  done by the former Eric Draven.
LAO	m	Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
GRANGE	m	Kill a dead guy?
LAO	m	Truly kill him.  So I may crush his skull and smoke it.
LAO	m	Let it suffice that I need him... and to get to him, we'll need his  little friend.
ELLY	f	What's going on...?
ERIC	m	A remembrance. A closure.
ERIC	m	Better now.  I feel good.  How are you, Elly, my friend?
ERIC	m	What is it?
ELLY	f	I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even with the makeup and stuff you wore. You really loved her, didn't you?
ERIC	m	You brought flowers.  As long as  you don't forget her, Elly, she  lives.
ELLY	f	She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
ERIC	m	Elly...
ERIC	m	Sometimes the people we care about are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes that's really tough.  I cry.  But if  the people we love are gone, we keep them --
ERIC	m	-- right here.  It's a big responsibility.  And that makes it  okay to mourn. I know that if you weren't here, I'd be very sad.
ELLY	f	You look funny without your white face on.  Like it's your day off or something.
ERIC	m	Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?
ELLY	f	I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
ERIC	m	I think he's yours, now.
ERIC	m	I have something else for you.
ELLY	f	Nobody ever gave me something like that before.  Ever.
ERIC	m	Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her  every time you see it...
ELLY	f	And she'll be alive.  Up here.
ELLY	f	You're gonna like it here.
DARLA	f	I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to -- Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
ELLY	f	He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
DARLA	f	We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
GRANGE	m	Hi, Elly.  Remember me?
DARLA	f	I don't remember you.  And I don't remember inviting...
GRANGE	m	If she opens her face again, shoot her in the head.
ELLY	f	Mom -- !
GRANGE	m	You should listen to your mother. She said no cats.
ELLY	f	Gabriel!
GRANGE	m	Now that's the expression I want.
GRANGE	m	Say cheese.
CREATURE KID	m	Trick or treat!
SKULL COWBOY	m	Stop screwing around.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
ERIC	m	Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I  might die. I've already done that.  I don't  need anyone's help.  Yours  included.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return. No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
ERIC	m	Fine with me.
SKULL COWBOY	m	You'll be alone.
ERIC	m	I'm already alone.
GRANGE	m	We've got company.
LAO	m	Is he inside?
GRANGE	m	He's just out front talking to himself.  You tell me.
ERIC	m	Don't waste my time.
SKULL COWBOY	m	Very well, it's your ass.
ERIC	m	But why are you still here?
LAO	m	I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow. Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
ERIC	m	I can see her.
LAO	m	Of course you can.
LAO	m	Don't permit your rage to cloud the issue.  I believe in barter. I propose a simple trade.
LAO	m	You intended to finish this evening in the cemetery.  I am  here to help you on your way.
GRANGE	m	I've got him if you want him.
LAO	m	No shooting.
GRANGE	m	Move in, guys.
LAO	m	I wish to possess what you have now.
ERIC	m	I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
LAO	m	I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
LAO	m	Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
ERIC	m	You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he  turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take.
LAO	m	I don't believe that.
LAO	m	Time for you to die for me. Funny, how the dead can still bleed.  How they need air.
LAO	m	Break its neck.
ALBRECHT	m	Had to go get yourself hip-deep in shit, didn't you, my friend.
ALBRECHT	m	Give it a rest, huh?
LAO	m	I said no shooting!
ALBRECHT	m	You sorta looked like you might need my help.
ERIC	m	This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
ALBRECHT	m	You're welcome.
ERIC	m	Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
ALBRECHT	m	The hell you say.  This isn't just  about you any more.
ERIC	m	Don't interfere.
ALBRECHT	m	You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
ALBRECHT	m	You won't mind if I just take the stairs, then, smartass...
ERIC	m	Here I am.
LAO	m	Can you fly, Crow man?
ALBRECHT	m	I ain't cut out for this superhero shit.
LAO	m	Face me!
ALBRECHT	m	Is he dead yet?
LAO	m	No.  You are.
LAO	m	You've caused another death, Mister Draven!  The girl will die as well -- because of you!
ELLY	f	You go to hell, you pervert!
ERIC	m	And how many lives have you destroyed?
LAO	m	I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
ERIC	m	You're right, I'm not an avenger.  Not any more.
ERIC	m	Time for a sacrifice.
LAO	m	I don't need eyes to take what I want from you.
ERIC	m	Can you fly?
ELLY	f	Don't let me fall!
ELLY	f	Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
ERIC	m	In a better place.  I hope.
ELLY	f	You're not gonna come back, are you?
ERIC	m	I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
ELLY	f	You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
ERIC	m	For you, I'll try.  Promise.
ERIC	m	Leave me now.
DARLA	f	Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new job, gotta go.
DARLA	f	You sure you're gonna be okay?
DARLA	f	At least it finally stopped raining.
ELLY	f	It can't rain all the time.
