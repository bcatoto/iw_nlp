JOE STEVENS	m	Your mother okay?
JOE JR.	m	Yes, sir.
JOE STEVENS	m	Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't  you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear  me?
JOE STEVENS	m	You hear me, goddam it?
JOE STEVENS	m	What do you want for Christmas?
JOE JR.	m	I don't know.
JOE STEVENS	m	You don't know?? You gotta know what  you want, boy, if you ever expect to  get it.
JOE STEVENS	m	Wait here. This won't take a minute.
JOE JR.	m	Daddy!!
STORE OWNER	m	Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...
JOE STEVENS	m	Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks. I'm sorry...
JOE JR.	m	Please, Mister...
CARVER	m	Officer Leland? You know the  difference between a black man and  nigger?
CARVER	m	Yeah, most niggers don't.
CARVER	m	Nice to meet you.
CARVER	m	So, Winston, what's the difference  between a black man and a nigger?
WINSTON	m	Who the fuck do you think you're  talking to?
CARVER	m	Thanks for coming in.
STEVENS	m	The nigger's the one who falls for  your bullshit.
CARVER	m	Gerald Carver, United States District  Attorney. Call me Gerry.
STEVENS	m	He ought to be wearing a sign.
CARVER	m	You can tell he's a cop?
STEVENS	m	He keeps looking for his back-up.  Now, the other guy knows it, too.
CARVER	m	Then why's he taking him to the room?
STEVENS	m	To rip him off.
STEVENS	m	Too late.
TAFT	m	Oh, Bobby... Jesus, Jesus... Get an ambulance -- and back up.  Now!
STEVENS	m	Who is he?
CARVER	m	Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.
STEVENS	m	He's a good cop.
CARVER	m	He's a great cop. Two [names citation]  and a [another citation]. As tough  as they come and twice as honest.
STEVENS	m	But the cops aren't getting it done  here, are they? Gotta try something  new...
STEVENS	m	Who's John Hull?
CARVER	m	You are. If you want to be. Most undercover guys don't know what  they're doing because it's a day  gig. I need somebody who goes under and  stays there; six months, a year,  five years...
STEVENS	m	What does he have to do?
CARVER	m	Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me  information.
STEVENS	m	He's a snitch.
CARVER	m	He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A  scumbag. But for the right side. I want you to come to Los Angeles on  loan to the Justice Department as a  federal agent. Your experience there  will be credited toward your seniority  here. And you'll come back to  Cleveland a P3 or higher.
STEVENS	m	I can't do that. I've got a wife and  kids.
CARVER	m	You're separated from your wife,  she's filled for divorce. You see  your kids every other weekend.
STEVENS	m	All my life I've stayed away from  that stuff. I've never touched drugs.
CARVER	m	Come on, a little grass...?
STEVENS	m	Not grass. Not nothing. I never even  had a drink. Never have, never will. You don't  understand. I made a choice in my  life.
CARVER	m	What's to understand? You saw your  father killed when you were ten, and  you decided you wouldn't be like  that. I'm God, I know everything. You wanted  to be a good boy, so you became a  cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's  why you got the hard-on for Taft.
STEVENS	m	It's not that simple.
CARVER	m	I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're  never going to be a Taft.
STEVENS	m	I don't believe that.
CARVER	m	You ever take a look at your  psychological profile? You score  almost like a criminal. "Resents authority..."
STEVENS	m	I do not.
CARVER	m	"...Exaggerated moral standards, but  with no underlying value system."  Look at the anger, the repressed  violence, it's almost off the scale...
STEVENS	m	Let me see that...
CARVER	m	Why'd you join the force?
STEVENS	m	I wanted to be of use.
CARVER	m	Well, now you can be. You won't be  Taft, but maybe you'll be something  more... interesting. There's a man named Ramon Gallegos  who supplies 60% of the cocaine to  the West Coast. He's smart, smooth,  and sufficiently elusive that we  don't even have an adult photograph  of him. However, his uncle is Hector  Guzman, an important Latin American  political figure. Gallegos uses  Uncle's connections to get product  into the country, and everyone we've  sent after him has ended up like  that...
STEVENS	m	Why would I be different?
CARVER	m	You already are, that's the point... You've got the ability and the  personality to go underground and  blend in completely. That's what the  others couldn't. Some part of them  showed. That's why they're dead.  See, there's only one rule in this  game.
CARVER	m	Don't blow your cover.
STEVENS	m	Joe-J, Carmen...
STEVENS	m	What were you doing with those kids?
JOE-J & CARMEN	f	Playing...
STEVENS	m	Your mom lets you play with them?
JOE-J & CARMEN	f	Yes, sir... Yes, sir.
STEVENS	m	I thought we talked about this. The  older brother up there's got a sheet  with --
TERRY	m	Lay off it. They're just kids...
TITO	m	Hey, Joe.
STEVENS	m	Tito...
STEVENS	m	They're real nice, honey. Is that a  horse?
CARMEN	f	Daddy! It's a bunny...
CARMEN	f	I don't want you to go away, Daddy.
STEVENS	m	It's my work. I've got to.
STEVENS	m	What happened to you there, baby?
CARMEN	f	Tito did it.
STEVENS	m	He hit you?! God damn it, what's he doing touching  her? I'm gonna...
TERRY	m	She was running behind his chair  when he got up. It was an accident. A complete... total... accident.
BLONDE WOMAN	f	Television mostly. I was on "Sky  King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle."  That was a silly show. The jungle  was mostly flats...
BLONDE WOMAN	f	You want my advice, I'd stay away  from that bitch.
EDDIE	m	On the day of the King's castration,  all the counts and no accounts were  down on the deck with Georgia Tech  taking turns in the back seat...
HULL	m	Whatta you got?
13-YEAR-OLD DEALER	m	Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent  shit.
IVY	f	What the fuck I tell you about being  here?
13-YEAR-OLD DEALER	m	No, wait...
IVY	f	Too fuckin' late.
IVY	f	Get down, motherfuckers!
CROWD	m	Who is he?... Why'd they shoot him?...  Ivy did him, man... He's in the wrong  fuckin' place... That poor boy...  Get his beeper...
EDDIE	m	He done done, ain't he?
BARTENDER	m	How's it going, John?
HULL	m	I'm in there.
EDDIE	m	"Where's the Queen," said the King.  "She's in bed with laryngitis." "Is  that bastard still in town?... Fuck  the Queen," said the King, and ten  thousand knights straaaained at their  utmost... Pina colada times two and a white  wine.
EDDIE	m	How you doin', Dudley...
HULL	m	John.
EDDIE	m	John, man, right...
HULL	m	Eddie something... a motormouth...  he supplies the street dealers...  buys from him... David Elias... who apparently buys  from a guy named Barbolla or  something. But I haven't seen him.
CARVER	m	Barbosa, Felix.
HULL	m	There was also a woman, but she's  not here. I saw a kid killed. Twelve, thirteen  at the most. Turf war.
CARVER	m	Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa.
HULL	m	You can't rush this stuff.
CARVER	m	Rush it, please. I want art, John,  not reality. Budget hearings start  in April, and I need Gallegos by  then. They won't give us funding for  three ounce buys.
HULL	m	We're not just doing this for the  funding, are we?
CARVER	m	Without funding, we aren't doing it  at all.
EDDIE	m	My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley...
HULL	m	Eddie, man, I need...
CHORUS OF COMMENTS	m	Whatever happened to that Drug Czar  motherfucker?... He gave up 'cause  he finally realized he didn't know  nothing about any of that shit...
EDDIE	m	So what is it you need so bad, blood?  Need, need, need??
HULL	m	A whole K, quick as you can get it.
EDDIE	m	Comin' in the world, Dudley.
HULL	m	All because of my man...
EDDIE	m	Give me a day.
EDDIE	m	Stick around, let the bitch Hoover  you, too.
HULL	m	Only if you Clorox him first.
TAFT	m	Eddie Shitface! Where you been, boy?
TAFT	m	Eddie, I don't think I introduced  you to my new partner, Michael  Hernandez...
HERNANDEZ	m	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shitface...
HERNANDEZ	m	You have the right to remain silent...  You have the right to an attorney...  You have the right to go back to  Ontario for eight-to-ten on a second  offense...
EDDIE	m	Oh, man, I can't go back in there, I  just can't.
TAFT	m	'Course you can't, child, 'course  you can't. That's why you're gonna  start giving us some help.
ELIAS	m	Again. Three times four.
MIRANDA	f	Seven.
ELIAS	m	No. You're adding again, you have to  multiply. Three and four is seven.  Three times four is...
MIRANDA	f	Twelve.
ELIAS	m	Three times five.
NANCY	f	Can you get that?
MIRANDA	f	Eight.
ELIAS	m	Damn it.
MIRANDA	f	Why can't I just use a calculator?
ELIAS	m	What are you doing here?
BARBOSA	m	We've got a problem, David.
ELIAS	m	Call me on the phone.
BARBOSA	m	Your friend Eddie just started bending  over for the cops.
BARBOSA	m	They busted him, and he's dealing to  save his ass.
GOPHER	m	Which is how he'll lose the skinny  little thing.
ELIAS	m	Did he give us up?
BARBOSA	m	Not yet, but he will if he has to,  and eventually he'll have to.
MIRANDA	f	Daddy! I thought we were doing my  homework.
ELIAS	m	I don't think he'd talk about us.  He'd try not to.
BARBOSA	m	If we whack him, he definitely won't.
MIRANDA	f	Daddy!!
ELIAS	m	Just a second. Not yet. Let me check on this, first.
BARBOSA	m	Nobody said you had to do the dirty  work, David. I'll take care of --
ELIAS	m	Felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill  him. I'll kill him myself.
ELIAS	m	Nancy, get out of here.
NANCY	f	For you; it's Eddie.
BARBOSA	m	You got a tasty wife, David. No wonder  you don't want us coming here.
ELIAS	m	Don't talk about her that way.
GOPHER	m	He can't help it, David, it's his  nature.
ELIAS	m	Eddie... Sure, man, what do you need?
EDDIE	m	David, this is John, John, David.  Eddie, this is Eddie. Everybody ready?
HULL	m	So what's this, you want to meet me?
ELIAS	m	I like to know the important  customers.
ELIAS	m	You're taking a lot of weight for a  guy we hardly know. Where're you  moving this stuff, John? We haven't  seen you around. We like to have a  sense who your customers are.
HULL	m	Ah, come on, man, do Macy's tell the  Gimbel motherfuckers?
ELIAS	m	Eddie, forget this guy, he's a cop.
HULL	m	What is this shit, Eddie? I thought  you were the man.
EDDIE	m	Nobody's the fuckin' man. Go to your  place. I'll call you.
TAFT	m	This is our collar?
TAFT	m	Who is he?
HERNANDEZ	m	Some scumbag...
EDDIE	m	He's no cop, David. He's an animal.  You see his eyes? You never see a  cop with those eyes. I know this  shit, man, you don't.
ELIAS	m	What's going on, Eddie?
EDDIE	m	Twenty-six thousand cash is what. We  need it, David. We're behind.
ELIAS	m	I want him to get it all, Eddie.
BELINDA	f	Mr. Hull... Mr. Hull...
HULL	m	What's happening, Belinda?
BELINDA	f	Now you know, Mr. Hull, I was to the  welfare this afternoon, but the bus,  you know what I'm saying?... the one  bus, and then the other, and when I  got there they'd gone and changed  the time on me, without notification.  They's supposed to give notification,  ain't they? They said I got a thing  in the mail, but I don't remember, I  don't think they sent it, so now I'm  off the welfare, plus I forgot to  take James for his shot... for the  school? Which otherwise they let him  go. And he's gotta learn, he's gotta  learn, don't he, Mr. Hull, you tell  him, so's he can better hisself.
HULL	m	You had any food today, James?
JAMES	m	I had Ding-Dongs.
HULL	m	You go to the Mexican place over  there, and get the chicken tostada  or the beef and bean burrito or both.  And a milk.
JAMES	m	I don't like milk. I want a --
HULL	m	You get the milk! And get something  for your mother, too. What do you want?
BELINDA	f	Now, Mr. Hull, if you just --
HULL	m	Two tostadas, two burritos, two milks.
BELINDA	f	You now, I look out for my James  best I can, Mr. Hull, but it's hard.  Now you like the boy, don't you?
BELINDA	f	I know you do. And I was thinkin' if  you wanted to take care of him, that  might be good for him. Give him a  male figure to look up to.
HULL	m	Look, Belinda, I can't...
BELINDA	f	If you could just give me something  for him. Say five thousand dollars... Or maybe four thousand. I couldn't  give up my boy for less than four  thousand...
HULL	m	It's me. I'm here... Where?... five  minutes.
BELINDA	f	Or you could just give me a part  now...
BELINDA	f	Let me do somethin' for you, Mr.  Hull. Let me do a little somethin'  for you.
BLONDE WOMAN	f	No solicitin' in the halls. I told  you that before.
BELINDA	f	I ain't doin' shit. Bitch...
AMPLIFIED VOICE	m	This is the police. Remain inside  the vehicle. Place your open hands  against the windshield so that they  are clearly visible...
HULL	m	Christ...
EDDIE	m	Spread the floor, Dudley. A-ga, a-ga, a-ga, a-ga...
TAFT	m	Thank you kindly...
TAFT	m	How you doin', child?...
HULL	m	You...
TAFT	m	Me? Of course, it's me. You know me?
TAFT	m	Hurts, huh?
TAFT	m	Here, I want to show you something.  You have kids?
TAFT	m	These are mine. Aren't they the most  beautiful children you ever saw?
TAFT	m	Yeah, I know, they kind of leave you  speechless. So let me ask, if someone  put a gun to your baby's head,  wouldn't you kill him if you could?
TAFT	m	Me, too. And you're the bastard with  the gun.
HULL	m	You know the difference between a  nigger and a black man?
TAFT	m	Don't jive me, boy.
HULL	m	The nigger's the one covers Whitey's  ass by puttin' the brothers in jail.
TAFT	m	You ain't my brother.
PUBLIC DEFENDER	m	Hi, I'm Shelley Weissbrod. This is  only an arraignment, a preliminary  hearing, but if you don't have money  for an attorney, the Public Defender's  office can...
BAILIFF	?	You've got counsel. Over there.
HULL	m	You're a lawyer??
ELIAS	m	I'm your lawyer.
HULL	m	Who hired you?
ELIAS	m	It's pro bono. If you don't want me,  there's Shelley. She's good. She  just can't provide special services...
HULL	m	Like what?
VOICE	m	John Hull...
ELIAS	m	Getting your case called first.
ELIAS	m	Your Honor, I believe the preliminary  police toxicology report will show  that the substance seized from my  client was Mannitol, a baby laxative.  We move for immediate dismissal.
ELIAS	m	We're out of here, Dude.
TAFT	m	Baby laxative, they sold you some  bad shit.
DRUNKEN PRISONER	m	You have a constipated baby, and  you're in jail? What kind of a father  are you?
TAFT	m	A father who don't know his own  children, ain't that right?
HULL	m	You sold me Mannitol, motherfucker.
ELIAS	m	If it hadn't been, asshole, you'd be  in jail right now... Come on, I want  you to meet some people.
EDDIE	m	Dudley, Dudley, Fo-Fudley...
ELIAS	m	Surprised to see him, Eddie?
ELIAS	m	John got busted and kept his mouth  shut. Can't say that for everybody,  can we?
EDDIE	m	What are you saying? Are you saying  me? Are you saying something about  me?
GOPHER	m	Tell the truth, Eddie. Be honorable.  It's all you got left.
EDDIE	m	Shut up, you little faggot.
ELIAS	m	The cops made you give them somebody.  We know it.
EDDIE	m	All right, so what? I mean, so what,  man? You got the money. Twenty-six  G. Twenty-six, David. Count it.
ELIAS	m	Next time you might trade us.
EDDIE	m	Never. Never, Felix, never. Come on, man,  you know I'd never...
BARBOSA	m	I know you never will.
EDDIE	m	Felix, no. Don't be... I'm worth  money to you. Let me give you money.
BARBOSA	m	Why? You don't owe me anything.
EDDIE	m	Another twenty-six grand... Just to  show you... Fifty.
BARBOSA	m	Why not a hundred?
EDDIE	m	A hundred??? Felix...
EDDIE	m	Okay, a hundred.
BARBOSA	m	Give it.
EDDIE	m	Tomorrow. Twenty-four hours.
BARBOSA	m	Now. Ten seconds.
EDDIE	m	Felix, I need time. I --
BARBOSA	m	One... two...
EDDIE	m	I don't have it right now. But I can --
GOPHER	m	Then goodbye, Eddie. I forgive you  for what you said to me.
EDDIE	m	Twelve hours. Tomorrow morning.
BARBOSA	m	Six... seven... You want to do it, David?
BARBOSA	m	Nine...
BARBOSA	m	Piece of shit!
BARBOSA	m	What'd you think?
HULL	m	At least it was clean.
BARBOSA	m	What about you, bar mitzvah body?  First time you saw somebody die?
ELIAS	m	No. At camp... when I was fourteen... a  friend of mine was water skiing...  The motorboat ran him over... A junior  counsellor was driving.
BARBOSA	m	You should kill a man some day, David,  it's liberating... Summer camp. I'm in business with  somebody who went to summer camp.
ELIAS	m	Eddie, man... He was always nice to  my daughter.
HULL	m	How'd a guy like you get into this?
ELIAS	m	The way most drug lawyers do: clients  paid me in product, and I had to  move it. Soon I was doing more dealing  than law. But this was '83, '84,  there was so much money we thought  it would never end.
HULL	m	Yeah. And now...?
ELIAS	m	The road gets rougher. Cocaine's a  dying business.
HULL	m	Then what are we doing here?
ELIAS	m	People are always going to want to  get high. Every society has ways to  alter consciousness.
HULL	m	Because they can't bear reality.
ELIAS	m	We all need our delusions, only the  means change: psychedelics, opiates,  prayer, orgies, human sacrifice...
HULL	m	What's next?
HULL	m	Why aren't you selling it?
ELIAS	m	I know how to make it and market it.  But I need capital. That's the only  reason I'm hanging out with an asshole  like Barbosa. And because I can't get to the big  guys.
HULL	m	Who are the big guys?
ELIAS	m	Gallegos, et cetera.
HULL	m	Why can't you get to them?
ELIAS	m	What do you care?
ELIAS	m	Anyway, designer drugs have a bad  name: ice, ecstasy, tar -- there's a  limited market for Parkinson's  disease. But what about completely  safe, almost legal, terrific shit  you can go to work on and do your  job better than you ever did it  straight?
HULL	m	Sounds like a dream.
ELIAS	m	In dreams begin responsibilities.
HULL	m	Tell me about this new shit.
ELIAS	m	Some other time, John, when we know  each other better. Hey, bunnela. Five times two.
MIRANDA	f	It's too early. Don't bother me.
MIRANDA	f	Seven.
MIRANDA	f	Oh, yeah... Ten... Who's he?
ELIAS	m	That's my friend, John. This is  Miranda.
HULL	m	Hi, Miranda.
NANCY	f	Come on, honey...
ELIAS	m	Nancy, this is John.
ELIAS	m	That's not about you. It's, she's...  judgmental about what I do.
HULL	m	That's more than I bought.
ELIAS	m	Half we owe you. The other half's on  consignment. A token of our esteem.
HULL	m	You're having trouble moving it.
HULL	m	Make me your partner. I'll help you  get your capital.
ELIAS	m	I don't need a partner. I need a  salesman.
CARVER	m	I can't buy this much shit. I haven't  got it in the budget.
HULL	m	What am I supposed to do with it?
CARVER	m	You're a drug dealer, John. Deal  drugs.
HULL	m	You know how this goes, Gerry. It  won't stop here. You know what they're  going to ask me to do pretty soon,  to prove I'm down. What am I supposed  to do then?
CARVER	m	Don't blow your Carver.
CARVER	m	You're still thinking like a cop,  John. Forget that. Cross the line.  Be what you are. You're a criminal.  You don't give a shit about other  people. You're just trying to survive.
HULL	m	I can't do this shit. I just can't.
CARVER	m	But you want to be of use. You want  to get drugs off the street, don't  you?
HULL	m	That's why I'm here.
CARVER	m	Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go  grow flowers someplace.
HULL	m	You can't back down with them. You've  got to project strength, from inside,  you know?
HULL	m	Cocksucker...
DEALER	m	What'd you do that for?
HULL	m	'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I  can.
HULL	m	...Touch her again, motherfuckers,  I'm gonna mess you up.
HULL	m	Is David Elias here?
ELIAS	m	Momentito...
ELIAS	m	Jacqueline, ho-ney...
ELIAS	m	"Who's making love to your old lady...  while you're out make love...?" How come I like balling black chicks  so much?
HULL	m	'Cause you're a racist asshole. You  feel like you're fucking a slave,  and it gets you off.
ELIAS	m	Oh, don't mau mau me with the Malcolm  X shit. Tell me you're not chasin'  white pussy every chance you get.
HULL	m	I don't dig white women. Even if I did, it wouldn't mean the  same thing.
ELIAS	m	Sure, it'd be the slave fucking the  master. Hegel talks about it. Just  like me, but the other way around.
HULL	m	Fuck Hegel. Who the fuck is Hegel?  Some smart-ass kike that talks  backwards?
ELIAS	m	Everybody digs the other, John. They  dig their own, and they dig the other.
HULL	m	Does your wife dig black guys, David?  Did she fuck Eddie? Does she want to  fuck me?
ELIAS	m	Ooo... you mean with that great big  purple dick of yours? I hope not.  She'd never be impressed with my  little thing again.
HULL	m	You think what impresses her now is  your dick?
ELIAS	m	What does impress her?
ELIAS	m	Betty, this is John, my new associate.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Your new Eddie. I hear the old one  wore out.
ELIAS	m	Factory recall. John's going to be a  good customer. He does a lot of wash.
HULL	m	So how's this place work?
ELIAS	m	Betty wires the money to a store in  Aruba in payment for things they  never sent her. They deposit the  money in a bank there that turns  around and loans her money she never  has to repay. That way it doesn't  turn up as income for the IRS. Welcome  to the laundromat.
MCCUTCHEON	?	David, you talk too much.
ELIAS	m	She doesn't trust you.
HULL	m	How much is this?
MCCUTCHEON	?	More than you can afford.
HULL	m	I'll take it.
ELIAS	m	By all means.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Come on, Eddie 2... you're up.
HULL	m	No, thanks.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Who is he, my mother?
HULL	m	Never have, never will.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Oooh... Cocaine, I love it and I  hate it and I love it. The disease  is the cure.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Don't look at me. Elias, tell him  not to look at me. I don't like the  fucker.
ELIAS	m	John's an ascetic Negro; he wants to  make sure you know he's not a jungle  bunny.
HULL	m	Watch your mouth, David.
ELIAS	m	But he's got another side. You should  seen him on the street the other day  with these two USC kids. Do the spade  bit for her, John. I'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga...
HULL	m	Don't call me a spade. And don't  tell me to play black.
ELIAS	m	Come on, John, you do it so well. Ah ain't playin', muthafucka. Ah  ain't playin'.
ELIAS	m	Don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka.  Fucka... fucka... fucka a... fucka  b... fuck b-hive... fucka, fucka,  fucka...
HULL	m	Say it again, and I'll kill you.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Grow up, assholes!
DEALER	m	...The guy ripped me off, man, so I  don't got the money, I don't got the  stuff and --
HULL	m	You gotta pay anyway.
DEALER	m	Oh, but, man...
HULL	m	Shit...
HULL	m	Bijoux!!
ELIAS	m	It wasn't your fault. What could you have done?
HULL	m	She worked for me. I'm supposed to  protect her.
ELIAS	m	We have to kill him.
ELIAS	m	Or we lose all authority with the  other dealers. And one of them'll  kill you.
ELIAS	m	You've got to assert now, or you're  dead.
ELIAS	m	And if we kill Ivy, we control this  whole territory.
HULL	m	That guy who works for Barbosa can  do it, Chino.
ELIAS	m	No. If we use Chino, it's Barbosa  who's asserting. It'll be Barbosa's  territory. It's gotta be us.
HULL	m	Right.
ELIAS	m	And if it's us, it's gotta be you.
HULL	m	Don't blow your cover.
ELIAS	m	What?
HULL	m	If I do this, we're partners. Equal  partners on everything.
HULL	m	Let's go.
ELIAS	m	Now...?
HULL	m	Go wait around back.
ELIAS	m	I want to see you in that alley.
IVY	f	What're you looking at?
IVY	f	You want to suck it, bitch? Or drink it?
IVY	f	Oh, I know you. You're the bitch  whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't  you?
IVY	f	I gotta take care of you, too, huh?
HULL	m	...Carmen, it's me. It's Daddy...
CARMEN	f	Daddy!!
HULL	m	Hi, baby. How are you? I miss you!
CARMEN	f	What?
HULL	m	I miss you...
CARMEN	f	I miss you, too, Daddy...
VOICE	m	The maze leads in two directions. At  one end the rat can obtain a food  pellet. At the other... ...it receives electrical stimulus  to a very specific area of the  cerebellum...
VOICE	m	This rat, like 86% of the others in  the experiment, chose the electrical  stimulus repeatedly and exclusively.  It continued to do so until it died  of malnutrition.
CAL TECH	m	This is an addictive amphetamine  with time-space distortion, delusions  of grandeur -- or maybe they're real --  tending to be impulsive, sometimes  violent behavior. Psychotropic  adaptation for late monopoly  capitalism. It's illegal, and you  can buy it on any street corner.
CAL TECH	m	This increases energy, attention,  cognitive powers, yet with a smooth,  almost opiate-like emotional surface.  Ideal for the post-political, post- rationalist global marketplace and  24 hour lifestyles. It's completely  legal and can only get it here, in  my lab.
ELIAS	m	Randy's a genius. His professor told  him he could win the Nobel prize.
CAL TECH	m	Nobel prizes are for wussies.
HULL	m	What does this shit do to you?
CAL TECH	m	I'm on it now. It's like cocaine  only better. Want some?
HULL	m	I don't take drugs.
CAL TECH	m	Your mistake. This is designed for  the top end of the market. For people  who want to master reality, not avoid  it. Because it's synthetic, you don't  grow it, refine it, or -- best of  all -- import it.
ELIAS	m	What would it take to manufacture  this stuff in quantity?
CAL TECH	m	With a million dollars, I could  produce enough for a limited market  at about two bucks a pop. But then with five million, or better  yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty  cents, and we'd have enough for the  whole world.
ELIAS	m	I'm going to put two hundred fifty  thousand into your corporate account.  You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your  bladder for a bagpipe. We're going to put Barbosa out of  business.
CARVER	m	Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20  segment...
CARVER	m	So, what was it like?
HULL	m	What was what like?
CARVER	m	Popping Ivy...
HULL	m	You knew.
CARVER	m	I'm God, remember?
HULL	m	Then you should know how it was.
CARVER	m	You didn't clear it with me. You're  getting independent. That's good.
CARVER	m	How're we coming on Gallegos?
HULL	m	He supplies Barbosa. To get to him  we'll have to take quantity.
CARVER	m	Then you've got to --
HULL	m	That's what killing Ivy did. I'll  get to him soon.
HULL	m	Is that it?
CARVER	m	I want you to get a new apartment.  Something expensive.
HULL	m	I like where I am.
CARVER	m	That shithole? You're big time now.  Act it. And get some clothes. Spend  money. Have fun. That's an order.
HULL	m	Whether I'm here or not, no one else  uses that room. And change the linen  twice a week, just like now. And make sure James gets what he  needs. And something for you.
ELIAS	m	Nice place. Nice suit.
HULL	m	Hey...!
ELIAS	m	You pick all this shit out yourself?
HULL	m	A Jewish lady in the store helped  me.
ELIAS	m	Aw... Very nice. Understated. I'm  impressed.
HULL	m	Fifty bucks, fifty fucking bucks...
ELIAS	m	You sold it all?
ELIAS	m	I'll order a couple more keys from  Barbosa.
HULL	m	Order ten.
ELIAS	m	Ten??
HULL	m	Better twenty.
ELIAS	m	I don't want to push it.
HULL	m	I do. We've got a bigger territory,  we need more product. I want to deal  directly with Gallegos. It would  save us money.
ELIAS	m	Barbosa'll never let us near him.
HULL	m	If we buy twenty, Gallegos'll come  to us himself.
ELIAS	m	How do you know?
HULL	m	When I bought a key from Eddie, you  came to me.
HULL	m	Who's above Gallegos?
ELIAS	m	Guzman, but he's... Don't ask so  many questions.
HULL	m	How else will I learn? Call Barbosa, David, put in our  order... Because we have to split  this, and there isn't enough here  for both of us.
BETTY'S VOICE	f	Nobody's home, go away.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Look, I'm tired, why don't you...
MCCUTCHEON	?	Why do you look at me like that?
HULL	m	How do I look at you?
MCCUTCHEON	?	Like you know something I don't.  Like you're better than me.
HULL	m	I don't think I'm better than you. I  don't think I'm better than anybody.
HULL	m	But I do know something... You can't  stop thinking about me.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Let's go back here...
MCCUTCHEON	?	Do this... do it with me.
MCCUTCHEON	?	This is where I'm at. You want to be  with me, it's gotta be there.
HULL	m	I don't do that.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Never have, never will.
HULL	m	It's for fuck-ups.
MCCUTCHEON	?	What do you think, you're not a  nigger? You're a nigger as much as  me.
HULL	m	More.
ELIAS	m	Having fun? I talked to Barbosa. He'll see us  now.
BARBOSA	m	Ten kilos? You're always late on  two.
HULL	m	Not ten... twenty.
HULL	m	The more we have, the more we can  move. There're markets we can't open  because we don't have the inventory.
BARBOSA	m	Finally some balls on this team... Come work for me, John. I'll give  you your own franchise. You can supply  Elias, lean on him when he's late.
ELIAS	m	Go fuck yourself.
HULL	m	I'm with David.
BARBOSA	m	Why? He give you his "designer drugs"  pitch. He's never going to do it.  He's a shmuck.
ELIAS	m	Don't talk to me that way.
BARBOSA	m	I'm not talking to you at all. I'm  talking to John.
GOPHER	m	It's the cocaine. Don't listen to  him. Felix, you've had enough...
BARBOSA	m	Shmuck.
GOPHER	m	Praise God they don't let guns in  here.
CALMING VOICES	m	"None of that in here..." "Take it  outside..."
BARBOSA	m	David, you've been working out, you're  getting strong. Are you quick, too? Come on, I'll give you a shot at me.
ELIAS	m	Any time, any place.
BARBOSA	m	Right here, right now. Do this.
ELIAS	m	This? What is this?
BARBOSA	m	You know, you slap me, I slap you. Come on, it's fun. Like summer camp.
HULL	m	Don't waste your time.
BARBOSA	m	Stay out of this. Come on, you can do it, David, you're  not a shmuck.
BARBOSA	m	Slap my hands. Just slap them.
BARBOSA	m	Now it's my turn.
GOPHER	m	It's Barbosa's turn. He's gonna kill  the white boy.
ELIAS	m	One more.
BARBOSA	m	No, you went, Davey, now it's my  turn. First to four wins, like the  World Series.
GOPHER	m	Oh, God, I can't look.
BARBOSA	m	You remember the rules? If you flinch,  I get to hit you.
BARBOSA	m	Again, shmuck.
GOPHER	m	One.
ELIAS	m	That was two.
BARBOSA	m	No, this is two.
GOPHER	m	Oh, and it hurts. Mercy, it hurts.
GOPHER	m	Three.
A VOICE	m	Felix! No mas. Finito.
SOMEONE	m	Gallegos...
GOPHER	m	The fight is over! The Ambassador  from the South has spoken!
ELIAS	m	One more.
ELIAS	m	One more! We're not finished! Four was the match.
BARBOSA	m	Four.
HULL	m	Okay, that's it. Get away.
ELIAS	m	Look at me. Look at me, damn it!
HULL	m	Why did you do it?
ELIAS	m	I needed it. They taught me what I  needed to know. That I'm not part of  them, and I never will be. That they  don't respect me. That I don't deserve  respect. Because I'm a shmuck, John.  I'm a shmuck...
BARBOSA	m	David, I'm sorry. It's a crazy time,  and... you know... I'm doing a little  too much coca... I'll buy your kid a  pony... anything you want... Let's  forget about it.
GOPHER	m	I am so proud of you. You can be  cruel, and you can be kind. And just  now you were kind. Proud, proud, and  more proud. That's me.
BARBOSA	m	Shut up.
BARBOSA	m	I got nothing to give you, my man.  I'm an il-liquid son of a bitch.
HERNANDEZ	m	Felix, I keep telling them, "I have  informants down there, I'm working  guys, I can't say who..." If you  don't have money, give me busts, or  they're gonna start wondering about  me.
GOPHER	m	They're already wondering.
BARBOSA	m	You can have Gopher.
GOPHER	m	Oh Gawd...
BARBOSA	m	How about a lawyer?
GOPHER	m	Felix, don't do this.
HERNANDEZ	m	Great, lawyers are great, Jewish is  best. But I need spades, too. The  politicians want dark facts to scare  the suburbs so they'll vote  Republican.
BARBOSA	m	Lawyers and spades; I got the  trifecta: two dealers and a girl who  does their wash. Two niggers and a  kike; all Democrats.
HERNANDEZ	m	You're my man. And afterwards...
BARBOSA	m	When this is over, I'll send you to  Hawaii, Maui. It's very beautiful in  Maui, it's a very spiritual place.
HERNANDEZ	m	I just want money.
GOPHER	m	I wouldn't trust that man when he's  out of rifle range.
GOPHER	m	Don't do this, Felix. It'll go wrong.  Kill Elias if you have to, honey,  but don't set him up for this. It  damages your prestige.
BARBOSA	m	David, you're awake, I'm impressed...  I'm sorry about what happened...  Listen, I'll get you twenty boxes,  like you wanted. You were right, you  should have what you need... Tomorrow  night... Bring your partner and that  girl with the store, Betty... I need  her advice on something. I want us  to have fun, like we used to. We'll  go to that shrimp place, okay?...  Good... Me, too, David. Yes!
HULL	m	We're getting twenty kilograms  tomorrow. Tonight. I made it happen. I pushed  Elias, now he doesn't make a move  without me.
CARVER	m	You run Elias.
HULL	m	I control him. Barbosa's selling it  to us because he thinks I can move  it... And last night I met Ramon Gallegos.
HULL	m	We're getting the dope from him;  it's still coming through Barbosa,  but Gallegos will approach me soon  on his own. We're going to get him,  Gerry. We're going to bring him and  the whole thing down.
HULL	m	What's your problem?
CARVER	m	My problem? My problem is that you  don't really know what's happening.
HULL	m	Oh, so, tell me what's happening,  Gerry.
CARVER	m	Barbosa is setting you up tonight.
HULL	m	Bullshit.
CARVER	m	He's dealing you to Taft and  Hernandez. You're going to be taken  down as you receive the drugs. They're  putting together the arrest team  right now.
HULL	m	What do we do?
CARVER	m	You stay away. We're going to take  them down.
HULL	m	Who? Elias and Betty? Don't be silly.
CARVER	m	My boss wants a bust right now. He  goes before the oversight committee  next week. He needs something to  justify the budget.
HULL	m	I'll get him something. Give me ten  days, and I'll get him Gallegos on a  plate.
CARVER	m	Too late. The whole thing's set up.
HULL	m	Gerry, what are you telling me? I  need Elias... and Betty. You arrest  them, and you're throwing away  everything I've set up.
CARVER	m	It's out of my hands.
CARVER	m	John, don't go near that bust.
HULL	m	We shouldn't go to them. Maybe them  come to us.
ELIAS	m	He wouldn't.
HERNANDEZ	m	Here they are. Nobody move until we  see the green suitcase.
BARBOSA	m	I'm sorry for dragging you out so  late, but I have to be careful.
MCCUTCHEON	?	It gives me confidence.
HULL	m	Let's see what we've got.
HULL	m	Don't touch it.
BARBOSA	m	What is this?
HULL	m	Something's wrong. What's that van  doing there?
HULL	m	This is a bust. The minute we take  the stuff, they'll be over us.
BARBOSA	m	He's crazy, David. I thought you  were the crazy one, but it's him.
HULL	m	Chino, pick up the suitcase and give  it to Elias. I'll only kill him if  something goes wrong.
BARBOSA	m	No!!
ELIAS	m	Fucking A, John...
HULL	m	Okay, everybody in the car.
TAFT	m	We have a problem.
HERNANDEZ	m	Shit! Shit! Shit! Enough of this...
TAFT	m	No!
BARBOSA	m	Don't shoot... Don't shoot...
TAFT	m	Goddam it, what the hell are you  doing?
MCCUTCHEON	?	I asked for this... I asked for it...  It's my fault...
HULL	m	Relax. We'll make it.
BARBOSA	m	He's a cop. He has to be. How else  would he have known?
HULL	m	If I was cop, you'd be face down  back there.
MCCUTCHEON	?	How did you know?
HULL	m	The whole thing smelled. Changing  his mind about the stuff. Meeting us  way out here. And I'd seen cops in  that van before. Hernandez is dirty,  that's who he's using.
ELIAS	m	Get out of the car.
HULL	m	David, not now.
ELIAS	m	Yes, now!
TAFT	m	Who are you, man? Who the fuck are  you?
HERNANDEZ	m	I'm me.
ELIAS	m	He traded us to the cops. Just like  Eddie. Eddie, who was nice to my  daughter, had to die because that's  the rule. And you were vulgar about  my wife, Felix, so at the very least  the same rule applies to you.
BARBOSA	m	I'll give you money. I'll give you a  million. Anything you want.
ELIAS	m	I want you to get out of the car.  Get out of the fucking car. Out of  the fucking --
MCCUTCHEON	?	No, no... we can't do this.
HULL	m	Stop it, David, or we're...
ELIAS	m	Look at my hands!
ELIAS	m	Get out of the car.
MCCUTCHEON	?	No!
HULL	m	Goddammit!
ELIAS	m	Stay out of this, or you'll die.  You'll both die. Everyone'll die.
BARBOSA	m	I can't...
ELIAS	m	I had him!
HULL	m	You want to kill a cop?? Don't be  stupid.
ELIAS	m	Everything is different. We're the  Colombians now. This is the greatest night of my  life. Terrible but great. Felix was  right...
MCCUTCHEON	?	About what?
ELIAS	m	He said I should kill a man. He was  right.
MCCUTCHEON	?	My God.
ELIAS	m	Barbosa was a roach. Do you miss  him? Will anybody in the world miss  him?
MCCUTCHEON	?	Are you a roach, too?
ELIAS	m	Yes. Thank God.
MCCUTCHEON	?	What about you?
MCCUTCHEON	?	Stop the car.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Stop it!
MCCUTCHEON	?	No more laundering, no more anything.  I'm finished with this.
ELIAS	m	She knows too much. We have to kill  her.
HULL	m	No! She's with me. She's not going  to talk. You touch her, I'll kill you.
ELIAS	m	She's your responsibility then.
ELIAS	m	We're going to get the money now,  John. Enough for the new drug. We're  going to be rich. We're going to be  so rich that we're going to leave  the world of ordinary people and  going to a higher realm. I mean that.
HULL	m	They're going to come after us.
ELIAS	m	It's a hardball game. We're hardball  players.
HERNANDEZ	m	It wasn't my fault.
MOLTO	m	It never is.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk.  I swear. Please.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Don't look...
HULL	m	Tell me about you.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Everything worth knowing you just  found you.
HULL	m	Don't hurt her.
ELIAS	m	Who's grave?
GALLEGOS	m	My wife's. She died of leukemia three  years ago. I like to be among the dead. They  never interrupt you. Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny  fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee  businessman in Bogata hotels. He  grew up. He made himself strong and  rich, but getting there made him  sick, and that killed him. So he  lost everything for the same reason  he'd gotten it in the first place.  Now we'll see if you can do as well.
GALLEGOS	m	Felix owed me one million eight  hundred thousand dollars.
GALLEGOS	m	When you killed him, you bought the  debt; now you owe it to me; you get  to keep thirty percent, like he did.  You have three days.
HULL	m	Who did Barbosa collect from?
GALLEGOS	m	If you don't know, you shouldn't  have killed him.
GALLEGOS	m	Cute... Can I have that?
GOPHER	m	I don't want you in here. You killed  the man, and I loved him. I don't  want to have anything to do with  you.
GOPHER	m	I'm a sixty-three-year-old man! I'm  a grandfather! Would you hit a sixty- three-year-old white man? Would you  hit your own grandfather?
ELIAS	m	Listen, you fucking monkey, you know  who owed him money, and we know you  know. Tell us or --
HULL	m	He'll tell us. Gopher, just...
GOPHER	m	You can't tell anyone it was me.
HULL	m	Where the hell is all the money?  We're still a million short.
ELIAS	m	I gotta get laid.
HULL	m	David, we've got thirty-six hours.
ELIAS	m	Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the  morning.
HULL	m	Sooner than that.
CARVER	m	Get in.
HULL	m	What are you doing here? You're going  to get me killed.
CARVER	m	Where the hell have you been?
HULL	m	Doing my job.
CARVER	m	You violated a direct order to stay  away from that bust. As a result, a  police informant is dead, a state  senator was critically injured in  the tunnel pile up and a city  policeman was subsequently murdered.
HULL	m	I didn't blow my cover.
CARVER	m	Don't get smart with me, motherfucker.
HULL	m	Don't be a shmuck, Gerry. I'm talking  to Gallegos. I'm collecting his money.  We can set him up right now.
CARVER	m	Never have, never will. I want you to give me your gun. You're  coming in right now.
HULL	m	Coming in where?
CARVER	m	Your assignment has been terminated.  You're not going out there again. If  I have to, I'll put you in custody.
HULL	m	I'm going to have Gallegos in two  days.
HULL	m	You're protecting him. You're  protecting Gallegos.
HULL	m	No, of course. That's why you wanted  to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting  close, and you wanted to cut this  off then... What is he, the new  Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so  you let him sell drugs to the niggers.  Two birds with one stone.
CARVER	m	You violated orders, so you're  through. Don't make a conspiracy  theory out of it.
HULL	m	I'm through...? Then, I might as  well have a drink after all.
HULL	m	Now tell me the truth or they're  going to decide your troubles got  the best of you.
CARVER	m	You're insane.
HULL	m	All the more reason to do what I  say. Jesus, Ger, I'm having trouble  holding on...
CARVER	m	All right!
HULL	m	Say it!
CARVER	m	It's the State Department.
CARVER	m	I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a  big deal down there.
HULL	m	Guzman.
CARVER	m	Guzman, right. Our government supports  Guzman because he's a moderate. That's  a right-winger who's pro-U.S. If Gallegos got busted here, it would  hurt Guzman's political career there.  It's politics, John, not drugs.
HULL	m	Drugs is politics. Politics is  drugs... Christ, Gerry, I dealt drugs. I killed  a man. Others died. What did I do  all this for? For nothing.
CARVER	m	I'm going to Washington, John. I'll  bring you with me. We'll have clout,  money...
HULL	m	I didn't do this for clout or money.  You said we were gonna do some good.
CARVER	m	We tried.
HULL	m	Trying's for college boys. If all there is is power and money...  If all there is... then what am I  doing here? 'Cause I can get more  power and money out on the street, I  got more there already, than I'd  ever get kissing your ass in  Washington...
CARVER	m	But you can't do that, John. It's  not you.
HULL	m	Me? There is no me. We took care of  that. First I was a cop pretending  to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer  pretending to be a cop. Why not stop  pretending...? Quit the force. Be a  dealer.
CARVER	m	It's not that simple.
HULL	m	My assignment's already terminated.  All I have to do is quit. I hereby  quit. My first one. Not so bad.
CARVER	m	Don't blow your cover.
MCCUTCHEON	?	What's the matter?
HULL	m	Who are you, my mother?
MCCUTCHEON	?	Tell me.
HULL	m	Tell you what?
MCCUTCHEON	?	What you came to say.
HULL	m	What did I come to say?
MCCUTCHEON	?	Then tell me anything. Something  about you. Something real.
HULL	m	When I was young, I occasionally  stole things. My father died when I was ten. Right  in front of me.
HULL	m	Heart attack. He just fell down. He  said, "I love you," then died in my  arms.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Oh, baby...
MCCUTCHEON	?	Tell me what's going on, John?
HULL	m	You're not doing the stuff anymore,  are you?
MCCUTCHEON	?	No. Don't change the subject.
HULL	m	How is that?
MCCUTCHEON	?	It's hard. John...!
HULL	m	Things are getting, they're getting  a little... confusing. I had certain  plans, and people haven't come through  exactly as they promised.
MCCUTCHEON	?	What do you expect with those people?
HULL	m	It's not just those people. It's...  it's bigger than that. It's of  everybody. Present company excluded.
MCCUTCHEON	?	You've got to stop this, John, you  know that. You gotta get out.
HULL	m	I can't.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Of course, you can.
HULL	m	No! This is what I'm supposed to do.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Supposed to? Who said you're supposed  to?
HULL	m	The whole fuckin' world. You think I  didn't try something else? But  everything funnels you right back  here. Like it's where you had to go  all along.
MCCUTCHEON	?	But you know what you're doing, don't  you, selling this stuff? Doing to  our own.
HULL	m	If I tried to get out now, they'd  kill me.
MCCUTCHEON	?	I can't be with somebody's who  involved in drugs.
HULL	m	There've got to be more. We have a  million two, we owe Gallegos one  eight.
GOPHER	m	I told you everyone. Everyone who  owed him, everyone he... One eight?  He's lying. Barbosa barely owed him  a million.
TAFT	m	I got every money transfer, every  phone call, all your laundry tickets.
MCCUTCHEON	?	What do you want?
TAFT	m	John Hull.
MCCUTCHEON	?	I can't!
TAFT	m	Or you'll go away 'til you're a dried  up old woman, and when you come out,  ain't nobody gonna want you.
HULL	m	What are you laughing at?
HULL	m	It isn't one eight. It's a million one. That's all Barbosa  owed, it's all we're paying.
GALLEGOS	m	Big brass balls. Collecting money  makes you strong.
ELIAS	m	What's that?
GALLEGOS	m	I'm telling our suppliers they got  paid. They'll be very happy. I'm  happy.
ELIAS	m	And we're happy. Everybody's happy.  It's a happy world.
GALLEGOS	m	So, how can I express my gratitude  for a job well done?
ELIAS	m	We want Barbosa's business.
GALLEGOS	m	Done. Of course.
ELIAS	m	And, also, your business. All this.  Your money, your dope, everything.
GALLEGOS	m	You're tougher than I thought, but  not that tough.
ELIAS	m	How tough is enough?
HULL	m	No!
ELIAS	m	Thank you, John. I couldn't have  done that without you.
HULL	m	Jesus Christ...
ELIAS	m	You taught me to take my work  seriously.
HULL	m	What's going on here, David?
ELIAS	m	We're taking over.
HULL	m	You're doing too much stuff.
ELIAS	m	No, I'm very clear. I'm very, very  clear. Ahora, usted nos assistamos. Enteindo?
ELIAS	m	Donde esta?
HULL	m	What the fuck's the matter with you?
ELIAS	m	It works, John. It works.
HULL	m	Jesus...
ELIAS	m	Disce a Senor Guzman que... ...that we have his money, and we're  willing to talk as soon as he comes  to town. We'll know how to reach  him. Okay?
ELIAS	m	Approximating the cubic capacity and  depending on the denominations of  the bills, it's somewhere between  fifty million and two hundred million  dollars. Right back there.
ELIAS	m	Think I'm crazy?
HULL	m	Yes. I can't believe you got us into this.  All of fucking Latin America is going  to be after our asses, including  Renaldo Guzman who's friends with  fucking George Bush.
ELIAS	m	I know they're coming after us. I  want them to. We'll give them the  money, but we'll make a deal for  ourselves. We'll get what we need  for the synthetic drugs. I've thought  it all out. I've been thinking it  out for years.
ELIAS	m	We're going to have everything. Don't  you want everything, John?
HULL	m	They're going to get your family,  David. They'll kill your wife and  daughter.
ELIAS	m	Nancy and Miranda left the country  two days ago.
HULL	m	You knew about this then?
HULL	m	What about Betty?
MCCUTCHEON	?	Hi, my name is Betty.
EVERYONE IN THE ROOM	m	Hi, Betty!
MCCUTCHEON	?	My name is Betty, I'm a drug addict.  And I've been clean for nineteen  days.
MCCUTCHEON	?	I've been using drugs and selling  them, and I've wanted to stop for a  long time, and the only way I did  was because I met a man I loved and  who loved me. I know that's not what  I'm supposed to say. I'm supposed to  say there was a higher power, and  maybe there was, behind it all, but  this man is strong and his love made  me strong enough that I could start,  or at least think about a life that  didn't have drugs in it...
MCCUTCHEON	?	I've got to get clothes.
HULL	m	You can't go back.
BLONDE WOMAN	f	She got a fever and just burned up.  She just burned up all of a sudden.  It must have been bad stuff.
MCCUTCHEON	?	He shouldn't be here.
BLONDE WOMAN	f	Come on, James, we'll go get a  burrito.
TAFT	m	Cute kids...
HULL	m	Give me that.
TAFT	m	Tell me something, who the fuck are  you?
TAFT	m	'Cause I don't think you're quite  the asshole you're trying to be.
HULL	m	Look, Mr. Taft, that's your name,  right? Leave me alone. I got things  on my mind.
TAFT	m	I'd think you would. You better have  your goddamn life on your mind, or  it's gonna get away from you. It's  gonna burn up like that poor woman  across the way. Like all of you's  gonna burn...
HULL	m	And what do you do, Mr. Taft, except  chase bad guys up and down the street  with your dirty partner, never  catching anybody important?
TAFT	m	I do what I can. Do you do what you  can? Maybe my partner was dirty. Maybe  the chief's dirty. And the mayor.  And the President. Maybe God Himself's  taking something on the side. That's  their problem. But I'll bust 'em if  I can.
HULL	m	Get out of my room.
TAFT	m	Don't deny who you are.
HULL	m	They're my children. They live in  Cleveland with their mother. I'm  divorced from her. I haven't seen  them in... some time. I want to, but  I haven't been able to arrange it.
MCCUTCHEON	?	How much else don't I know about  you?
HULL	m	Everything else... Everything else  is... I don't know.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Taft has all the evidence about my  laundering.
MCCUTCHEON	?	He's going to put me in jail for a  long time unless I give you up.
HULL	m	Do it.
MCCUTCHEON	?	I can't. So, I've got to get away.  Far away. But I need money.
HULL	m	Money? I got money...
HULL	m	International terminal. I'll meet you there in a week.
MCCUTCHEON	?	You know the first time, when I saw  you in the bar...?
HULL	m	You wouldn't even look at me.
MCCUTCHEON	?	'Cause I knew what you were thinking.  You were judging me.
HULL	m	No, I wasn't, I was...
MCCUTCHEON	?	You were. Your eyes were like an  angel in my heart telling me I should  be good, and I didn't want to hear  it.
MCCUTCHEON	?	That's you, too. Maybe this is you,  I don't know, but I know that's you.
HULL	m	What if we forget all this? Take ten  million each and disappear. Leave  the country. New identities, new  lives...
ELIAS	m	What's the matter, John? Having  doubts?
HULL	m	Yeah.
ELIAS	m	Yes... Where?... No! No way... We  pick the time and place... Otherwise  no meet... Got a pencil?
ELIAS	m	We have a proposal to make. We regret  what happened to your nephew...
GUZMAN	m	Say what you have to say.
ELIAS	m	We all know that your cousin's  business is coming to an end. Costs  have climbed while profits and the  market --
ELIAS	m	We have developed a new product:  simpler, cheaper to manufacture,  superior quality and completely  synthetic. Therefore, no growing, no  refining, no peasants, no importing,  no customs agents... Here's a detailed  prospectus with anticipated cash  flow and so forth.
GUZMAN	m	The racist Americans just want to  cut us poor Hispanics out of the  market.
ELIAS	m	There are no Americans anymore, Mr.  Guzman, you know that. No Hispanics,  no Japanese, no blacks, no whites,  no anything. There are only rich  people and poor people. We're rich,  so we're on the same side.
TAFT	m	Do they have money in there?
GOPHER	m	I don't know.
TAFT	m	They wouldn't meet here otherwise.
TAFT	m	Okay, everybody, here's the play...
ELIAS	m	We're prepared to give you 80% of  the money. The remainder you invest  in our business with proceeds paid  out according to the figures there.
GUZMAN	m	This looks interesting. I'd have to  confirm everything, of course. Do  you have a sample of the product?
MOLTO	m	Buy it!
GUZMAN	m	Where is our money?
GUZMAN	m	You set this up.
HULL	m	They're after us, not you.
TAFT	m	Where are the rest of them?
ELIAS	m	We did it. Twenty million. Twenty  fucking million. We're going to have  synthetics. We're gonna be rich.  We're gonna...
ELIAS	m	What's the matter, John? Be happy.  Your whole life has just been solved.
VOICE	m	Stop! Police!
ELIAS	m	John, where are you going?
HULL	m	Oh, Jesus, no...
ELIAS	m	John, what the hell are you doing?  Let's get out of here.
HULL	m	He's dying.
ELIAS	m	Let him die. Let him die twice. Come  one.
HULL	m	[Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained  policeman would say in this  situation.] Get help.
ELIAS	m	Are you kidding me?
TAFT	m	Oh, man, you're a cop. You're a cop,  aren't you?
HULL	m	Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop...
ELIAS	m	Oh, really? Where's you badge?
HULL	m	I don't have one. I'm undercover.  Get help, David.
ELIAS	m	John, that's a cop. He tried to kill  you.
HULL	m	He didn't know.
ELIAS	m	Oh, he didn't know. I don't know.  Maybe you don't know. Maybe you think  you're a cop because... because...
HULL	m	Drop the gun, put your hands against  the car. Spread your legs... Police!
HULL	m	My God! Please...
ELIAS	m	Okay, let's say you're a cop. Be a  cop.
ELIAS	m	We've still got the money. We put it  into Randy's chemistry set. In five  years we're worth five hundred million  each, minimum. You'll be one of the  richest black men in America. Richer  than Cosby. Who gives a shit how you  got it? You think the white ones  were honest?
ELIAS	m	Is this asshole all that stands  between you and greatness? Let me do  you a favor.
ELIAS	m	Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme  reaction.
POLICEMAN	m	Fucking nigger...
HULL	m	What about Guzman?
CARVER	m	He vanished, thank God, or we'd both  be in deep doo-doo. At least you got  Gallegos.
HULL	m	Elias did. And everything goes on as  before.
CARVER	m	That's the drug game. Plus a change...  I want you to come back to work for  me. You'll beat all charges on a  technicality and go back to who you  were.
HULL	m	Who was I, Ger?
CARVER	m	Does anyone really know?
HULL	m	I have other things to do.
CARVER	m	Like travel? Tangiers, maybe?
CARVER	m	I'm God, remember?
CARVER	m	Go back to work, she walks out of  here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple  counts, and I'll see to it the judge  runs them consecutively.
MCCUTCHEON	?	They want me to testify against you.  I said I wouldn't.
HULL	m	You have to. It's all set up. That's  how you're getting off.
HULL	m	My father didn't have a heart attack.
HULL	m	He was shot robbing a liquor store.  Trying to rob it. I lied about that.
MCCUTCHEON	?	Baby, why are you telling me this?
HULL	m	I had to start somewhere... There're  other things you don't know...
CARVER	m	Betty walked out of court free this  morning. That's my side of the deal.
HULL	m	You two run on ahead.
CARVER	m	Her probation gets revoked the minute  you fuck up. I want you to stay away  from her altogether.
HULL	m	You know the difference between a  black man and a nigger?
HULL	m	The nigger's the one who'd even think  about doing what you tell him.
CARVER	m	Don't blow your cover.
