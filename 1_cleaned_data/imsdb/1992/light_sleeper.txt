LETOUR	f	Labor Day weekend. Some time for a  sanitation strike. Everybody crazy  to stock up. They decide to score at  the last minute and want it now.  Never fails. The faces look alike.  You gotta use memory tricks: each  has some peculiarity -- it keeps you  sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug  dealer starts writing a diary it's  time to quit. I started writing after  that. Not every night -- now and  then. Just to burn off the night.  Fill up one book, throw it out, start  another.
ANN	f	Darling.
LETOUR	f	Ann.
ANN	f	Have we made New York safe for another  weekend?
LETOUR	f	Robert.
ROBERT	m	Get a job.
LETOUR	f	Sad what ten years without sex can  do.
ANN	f	Any hundreds?
LETOUR	f	Twenties -- and tens.
ROBERT	m	Tens!
ANN	f	Goddamn cash machines.
ROBERT	m	Did what's-his-name give you a hard  time?
LETOUR	f	You mean --?
ROBERT	m	Yeah.
LETOUR	f	Cash Before Delivery.
ROBERT	m	Fucking investment bankers.
ANN	f	These Wall Street kids deal with  fake money all day, they think cash  is a theoretical concept -- like it  doesn't apply. I see 'em at two,  shudder to think at nine they're  buying and selling -- turned me off  the stock market.
LETOUR	f	It's late. You staying?
ROBERT	m	It's over.
LETOUR	f	I'm gonna crash -- try, at least.
ANN	f	Tomorrow will be easier. Maybe we  can all eat together. Go on. You  look tired. Here, take a couple of  C's. I'll pick up anything that comes  in.
ANN	f	Sleep tight.
ROBERT	m	Pick up the trash.
LETOUR	f	Yeah -- big kiss.
LETOUR	f	"Labor Day." "Union Movement" --  there's a contradiction in terms. I  know about long hours. It's worse  when I'm off -- I just walk and walk.  Where am I going? There's an element  of providence to it all. Like rolling  numbers. Luck. You're walking down  the street, some guy that looks maybe  a little like you does a stick-up  four hours ago, there's an APB  description out and a cop pulls you  in cause he's cold and wants to go  inside -- they grab your stash. Your  number's up. You're busted for  nothing. For bad luck.
JEALOUS	m	Are they "faced"?
LETOUR	f	Don't bore me.
JEALOUS	m	Is it so much work to face them the  same direction? You don't do it, I  got to. It's time -- my time --
LETOUR	f	Jees --
JEALOUS	m	We've been through all this. This nineteen-gram shit is a drag.
LETOUR	f	We pay you more, you put up with  more. White drugs for white people.  Twice the price, twice the safety.
JEALOUS	m	I can't believe Ann's been working  as long as she has -- never busted.  She's something.
LETOUR	f	Never made any big money either.
JEALOUS	m	Sure.
LETOUR	f	She blows it.
JEALOUS	m	You believe that? What you gonna do  after she quits? How long you been  with her?
LETOUR	f	She always says that. We'll see,  Jealous.
JEALOUS	m	She's out. You should pick up her  trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you.
LETOUR	f	No way. I'm not the management type.  I get in charge, I'll start using  again -- not for me. I know music  people. I'm gonna get in recording.
JEALOUS	m	Yeah.
JEALOUS	m	Tour.
LETOUR	f	What?
JEALOUS	m	Normally this wouldn't matter to  you, but you may get hassled.
LETOUR	f	Why?
JEALOUS	m	You read the papers? The Park murder.  All over the Post. Mariah Rangel --  nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch  dead in Turtle Pond coked to the  fucking gills. All of a sudden they're  hot after mid-level dealers. They're  buzzin'. You know her?
LETOUR	f	I look like an encyclopedia? Who  knows? Thanks for the warning.
ROBERT	m	Jack.
ROBERT	m	You pick up from Jealous?
LETOUR	f	Yeah, nineteen grams after four times  last night. We're certainly not his  favorite people.
ROBERT	m	We don't make the laws. Nineteen is  carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him  be stupid.
LETOUR	f	He took my hundreds.
ROBERT	m	Take over for a while. I'm getting  contact high.
LETOUR	f	Who's Her Majesty talking to?
ROBERT	m	The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona.  She's trying to get them to come  here -- or, better, Europe.
LETOUR	f	That's where the money is.
ROBERT	m	All mark-up -- the "Big One."
LETOUR	f	Don't dress. You really think she means it?
ROBERT	m	That's what she says. New Year's Eve  and out -- no Acid House, no product,  no deliveries.
LETOUR	f	That's just her mouth talking.
ROBERT	m	Next year -- strictly Akasha.
LETOUR	f	"Akasha"?
ROBERT	m	Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling  the company now --
LETOUR	f	-- this week. I don't get it --  marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd  anyone pay to put weeds on their  face?
ROBERT	m	Why'd anyone pay to put them up their  nose? I like cosmetics. I need  cosmetics. You should come in with  us.
LETOUR	f	You forget: she hasn't asked me.
ANN	f	Johnny! Robert! Come here!
ANN	f	Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen  hundred Ex at thirty each and the  delivery's here.
ANN	f	Whatja think?
LETOUR	f	Of what?
ANN	f	The face cream. Almond, marigold,  chamomile, egg, aloe -- the "Almilk"  formula. I remixed it.
LETOUR	f	Very nice.
ANN	f	Reminds me, if you get downtown stop  at Enhancements and pick up some  almond oil -- not the California. What should we order?
LETOUR	f	How about Indian?
ANN	f	Darling, it's Saturday.
ROBERT	m	Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while.
ANN'S VOICE	f	"Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a  message, we'll get back to you --  sooner than you think."
ANN	f	Answer that. He'll call back every  five minutes.
ROBERT	m	The night begins.
ANN	f	"Ped Srilom"? -- it's Northeastern.  Duck.
LETOUR	f	I'm going veggie. Get me the "Puk  Ob."
ROBERT	m	Me too.
LETOUR	f	Use it for facial cream.
ROBERT	m	Remove unsightly hair!
ANN	f	Laugh, one day you'll be watching me  on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel.
LETOUR	f	Forgive us.
ROBERT	m	Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top  Lady. God knows what happened to his  shit yesterday.
ANN	f	You take it -- call in.
LETOUR	f	It was supposed to be light tonight.
ROBERT	m	Don't you watch TV?
LETOUR	f	Don't have one.
ROBERT	m	Well if you were the normal stupid  fuck you should be so lucky to be  and had one, you'd know it's supposed  to rain --
ANN	f	Good for the trees --
ROBERT	m	Some farmer whacked his numerology  on us.
ANN	f	It's started.
ROBERT	m	The Farmer's Almanac is based on  numerology.
LETOUR	f	Raining?
ANN	f	Take a coat. And you, clean up the product before  the food delivery comes.
EDDIE	m	Le Tour! -- finally. What took so  long?
LETOUR	f	Traffic. It's raining.
EDDIE	m	How's things?
LETOUR	f	Okay.
EDDIE	m	I need a quarter -- you got it?
LETOUR	f	Robert said he sold you a quarter  yesterday.
EDDIE	m	Some friends came over. How much is  that? Fourteen-hundred?
LETOUR	f	Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down.  I've known you, what, like eight  years?
EDDIE	m	Yeah...
LETOUR	f	Knew you from the other job, the one  before the last one you fucked up. I  knew your wife -- remember her? We  used to sit and talk and talk --
EDDIE	m	You don't know what she was like --
LETOUR	f	This is no good. I'll sell you a  gram and some downs, but I ain't  gonna put you in the emergency room.  Cool it. Go to bed. Sleep it off.
EDDIE	m	You charge $200 for what goes for  ninety on the street -- and you're  not gonna sell?
LETOUR	f	So go to the street.
EDDIE	m	I'll call Ann.
LETOUR	f	Go ahead. You know what she'll say.  Phone's over there.
EDDIE	m	I'll tell the fucking cops.
LETOUR	f	Fuck you. That's it. You're out. Don't call again. Catch you next  lifetime.
EDDIE	m	Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right.  I didn't mean that. I'm quitting  anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry.
LETOUR	f	Okay.
EDDIE	m	Two hundred?
LETOUR	f	You got downs? One more thing. I gotta use the phone.
MID-TWENTIESH MAN	m	...but -- if there's no God, how can  man conceive of him? The idea of God  presupposes the existence of God.  That's the Ontological Argument.  Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen  hundred -- I'm not sure --
LETOUR	f	I've got to go.
MID-TWENTIESH MAN	m	Let me finish. Okay, if the idea of  God is implanted by God -- the sensus  divinitatus, the sense of the divine --  what is the role of human thought?  Not faith, thought...
LETOUR	f	Everybody wants to talk. It's like a  compulsion. My philosophy is: you  got nothing to say, don't say it.  They figure you can tell a D.D.  anything, things they would never  tell anyone else. He understands. Of  course they're stoned to start. If I  could tie together all the hours of  coke talk I've heard, that would be  a lot of string. It was Robert's  idea to add twenty-five dollars to  home deliveries cause it's such a  hassle. Fifty is more like it.
FIRST STUDENT	m	C'mon, Tour, stick around.
SECOND STUDENT	m	Yeah.
FIRST STUDENT	m	There's only four of us and like  seven of them -- and we're paying  for the dope. See her, over there,  the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? --  she's gonna model for Elite.
LETOUR	f	Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me  like an old horse.
SECOND STUDENT	m	Shit, dude --
LETOUR	f	Nah. Thanks anyway. I gotta go. Have fun.
LETOUR	f	Carlos. Wait a second.
LETOUR	f	Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll  give you a ride.
LETOUR	f	John. John LeTour.
MARIANNE	f	John?
LETOUR	f	Get in. You're getting soaked.
MARIANNE	f	Hi...
LETOUR	f	Where are you going?
LETOUR	f	I didn't know you still lived here.
MARIANNE	f	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.  I should get out.
LETOUR	f	Don't be crazy. It's pouring.
MARIANNE	f	I'm not supposed to be around --
LETOUR	f	-- former drug associates.
MARIANNE	f	It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol,  no cigarettes, no nothing.
LETOUR	f	I heard. I'm happy for you.
MARIANNE	f	It's still not easy.
LETOUR	f	I know. Mar, you don't need to avoid  me. I'm straight -- two years. It  came that time. I tried to tell you.  I wrote. I called.
MARIANNE	f	I should get out.
LETOUR	f	Honest.
MARIANNE	f	But you're dealing.
LETOUR	f	No. I stopped.
MARIANNE	f	What's in the bag?
LETOUR	f	Almond oil. You can check. Look.
LETOUR	f	Shit.
MARIANNE	f	What's that for? In case someone  needs almond oil in the middle of  the night?
LETOUR	f	I still deal a little, but I'm  straight -- that part's true. Believe  me.
MARIANNE	f	Stop here. Now. Stop!
LETOUR	f	I won't say anything. I promise.  I'll just sit here. I'll just give  you a ride.
MARIANNE	f	Goodbye, John.
LETOUR	f	Where do you live? Mari...
DRIVER	m	Sir?
LETOUR	f	Eighty-third Street.
TERESA	f	Coffee?
LETOUR	f	Thanks.
TERESA	f	Black?
LETOUR	f	Yeah.
TERESA	f	Here.
LETOUR	f	I'm not sure how this works.
TERESA	f	Have you ever been to a psychic  before?
LETOUR	f	No, but I've, well, I've heard about  it.
TERESA	f	Do you need advice? John?
LETOUR	f	No... it's not that... I don't know --  I just decided to come. I thought...
TERESA	f	Be comfortable. How did you hear about me?
LETOUR	f	A recommendation. Somebody from work.  Two hundred dollars, right?
TERESA	f	It's a lot of money?
LETOUR	f	I don't care.
TERESA	f	I look at you. I give you my  impressions. I feel your "vibrations" --  I don't like that word, it sounds  phony, but I can't think of anything  better. You're anxious. More than usual. Your aura is very  strong. I feel a very strong vibration  from you. A change is coming. You're  worried about money. You say you  don't care about money but that's  not true.
LETOUR	f	Yeah.
TERESA	f	Your livelihood is endangered. You're  worried about the future. You don't  have much money saved. What will you  do?
LETOUR	f	I don't know.
TERESA	f	I see a woman who has betrayed you.
LETOUR	f	My mother?
TERESA	f	Who will betray you.
LETOUR	f	Not... I...
TERESA	f	Keep it in mind. I have a strong  feeling about this woman, a woman  close to you, she will betray you.  You're in the entertainment business,  aren't you?
LETOUR	f	Yes.
TERESA	f	But you're not happy. You want to do  something else. Is it music?
LETOUR	f	Yes...
TERESA	f	You have a talent for music.
LETOUR	f	As a child.
TERESA	f	You still have it. It's strong. I  see music in your future. A career  opportunity will come in the music  field. Take it. It won't seem  promising. Take it anyway. You're full of stress. Are you  exercising?
LETOUR	f	No. I --
TERESA	f	You should exercise more. You must  let go of this stress. It's not good  for your health. I'm not saying you're  going over to the other side, but  it's not good for you. You're still  drinking, aren't you? You have a  drinking problem? It's interfering with your health  and your life too. You've had other  problems. Drug addiction.
LETOUR	f	Yes.
TERESA	f	This was very important in your life.
LETOUR	f	Yes.
TERESA	f	You are in the balance. Everything  you do -- positive or negative -- in  this life is a drop that will carry  over in the next. Every act, every  decision matters.
LETOUR	f	Teresa?
TERESA	f	What is it?
LETOUR	f	I'm thirty-eight years old. Forty.
TERESA	f	You're young.
LETOUR	f	I have trouble sleeping. Look. What do you see around me? Is  there anything? Is it dark? Have I  run out of luck? Is there luck?
TERESA	f	I see a glow. Everything you need is  around you. The only danger is inside  you.
ANN	f	Your pay's on the table.
YOUNG HASID	m	One hundred thirty-one, let's make  it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small  bills. One percent commission, $130  to you -- add tens or whatever if  you want.
YOUNG HASID	m	Same time?
ANN	f	Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while.  We'll order kosher. We'll tell you  dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism.
YOUNG HASID	m	I'm late already. I only come 'cause  I like you. Sure you're not Jewish?  I don't want to see you hurt. Find a  man. You should do something else.
ANN	f	Invest in my cosmetics line.
YOUNG HASID	m	Don't mix business with friendship.
YOUNG HASID	m	Shalom.
ANN	f	Shalom. See you next week. Don't eat any hot dogs!
LETOUR	f	Jealous said something about a yuppie  murder in the Park. You know anything  about it?
ANN	f	It's all over the news.
LETOUR	f	Jealous said to be careful.
ANN	f	We are careful.
ROBERT	m	We're too small time. Besides, she  wasn't one of ours -- not directly. Tis is at St. Luke's. He wants  somebody over right away. Second  floor waiting room.
LETOUR	f	A hospital? What's he doing there?
ROBERT	m	He says he needs you to come to St.  Luke's. I'd go but I got the other  thing.
LETOUR	f	The --?
ROBERT	m	Yeah.
ANN	f	Go. Keep on his good side. He set up  Arizona.
ANN	f	Let's have lunch. Tomorrow.
LETOUR	f	Me?
ANN	f	One o'clock. C�te Basque. Is that  too early?
LETOUR	f	No. Yeah -- sure.
ROBERT	m	Tonight?
LETOUR	f	I vote Japanese.
ANN	f	Fine.
ROBERT	m	Okay.
LETOUR	f	Mixed sushi. Oshitashi.
LETOUR	f	What's going on?
TIS	?	You got some valiums?
LETOUR	f	-- 'n 'ludes.
TIS	?	Just a valium -- a ten.
LETOUR	f	What is it?
TIS	?	You won't believe it. What a  nightmare. I brought in this chick.  She O.D.ed -- man, I didn't even  know her. I didn't have to bring her  in. The cops are coming back to talk  to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down.
LETOUR	f	Here.
TIS	?	Make it two.
TIS	?	Thanks.
LETOUR	f	She okay?
TIS	?	Who?
LETOUR	f	The girl.
TIS	?	Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A  walking vacuum cleaner. What a  nightmare. Underage.
LETOUR	f	You need a lawyer?
TIS	?	He's here. Thanks.
LETOUR	f	Any time.
RANDI	f	John!
LETOUR	f	Randi?
RANDI	f	I can't believe it. Marianne's here  too. She flew in. It's been so long.  You look great.
LETOUR	f	You too. Randi, what's wrong? Why  are you here?
RANDI	f	Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne  tell you?
LETOUR	f	Serious?
RANDI	f	More chemo.
LETOUR	f	Can I see her?
RANDI	f	She's sleeping. She sleeps most of  the time. She'd like it, though. She  still talks about you.
LETOUR	f	I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman.  I was crazy about her. God.
RANDI	f	It's John. What a coincidence.
MARIANNE	f	Yes. Hi.
LETOUR	f	Randi told me about your mom. I'm  sorry.
MARIANNE	f	Thanks.
LETOUR	f	She's sedated?
MARIANNE	f	Yeah.
RANDI	f	She would be so happy to see John.
MARIANNE	f	I don't think that would be a good  idea.
LETOUR	f	You both look so tired.
MARIANNE	f	One of us has to be here.
RANDI	f	The hospital lets us stay in her  room.
LETOUR	f	Let me buy you some coffee or  something -- the cafeteria's  downstairs. It helps to talk.
RANDI	f	You go, Marianne, it's my turn with  mom.
MARIANNE	f	I shouldn't.
RANDI	f	Go. You haven't eaten. Go on. Go on.
MARIANNE	f	I...
RANDI	f	Bring me a coffee.
LETOUR	f	This way. Kiss your mother for me.
LETOUR	f	I like your mom.
MARIANNE	f	She liked you. You know this will  happen someday, but when it does...  Your mother -- that was a shock.
LETOUR	f	She's been sick a while?
MARIANNE	f	A year.
LETOUR	f	Your father?
MARIANNE	f	Not this time. His new wife -- he'll  make it to the funeral.
LETOUR	f	What have you been doing? Where do  you live?
MARIANNE	f	It's... I don't want you to know about my  life.
LETOUR	f	Anything? You married? Have children?  A dog? House plants?
MARIANNE	f	Details just open the door.
LETOUR	f	The door to what? It's not like we're strangers. We  were married.
MARIANNE	f	We were not.
LETOUR	f	There was a ceremony.
MARIANNE	f	He wasn't even a minister. He was an  astrologer.
LETOUR	f	He was also a minister. "Universal  Harmony."
MARIANNE	f	He was a Pisces.
LETOUR	f	You're a Pisces.
MARIANNE	f	It was not legal.
LETOUR	f	In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're  still --
MARIANNE	f	I was on the cusp.
LETOUR	f	We were happy.
MARIANNE	f	We were miserable. We were either  scoring or coming down -- mostly  coming down.
LETOUR	f	There were good times. Area, out on  the street, laughing, dancing with  friends -- we were magical.
MARIANNE	f	You took off for three months without  telling me and called once. That's  how magical we were. You were an  encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies --  I heard them all. Nobody could clear  a room like you, John. And the  friends, you may have noticed, turned  out to be mine, not yours. I envy  you. A convenient memory is a gift  from God.
LETOUR	f	You exaggerate.
MARIANNE	f	In rehab they call this "euphoric  recall." You only remember the highs,  never the lows.
LETOUR	f	We were happy.
MARIANNE	f	I was drowning.
LETOUR	f	It wasn't me --
MARIANNE	f	You watched --
LETOUR	f	You jumped --
MARIANNE	f	You did nothing -- "It wasn't your  business, you weren't responsible" --  you still think like that. Actions have consequences; so do --
MARIANNE	f	-- inactions.
LETOUR	f	I didn't -- I meant well.
MARIANNE	f	You always meant well.
LETOUR	f	We were in love?
MARIANNE	f	Yes.
LETOUR	f	We were happy?
LETOUR	f	You bought it for me. It's inscribed  inside.
LETOUR	f	Ann's quitting. I've got to find  something else to do.
MARIANNE	f	Ann? I'll believe it when I see it.
LETOUR	f	It's true.
MARIANNE	f	Are you really straight?
LETOUR	f	Yeah.
MARIANNE	f	Let me see your eyes.
MARIANNE	f	Eyes are deceiving. Congratulations.
LETOUR	f	If I could do that, I could do  anything.
MARIANNE	f	What do you mean?
LETOUR	f	We could do anything. We could start  over.
MARIANNE	f	What was that? I think I heard  something.
LETOUR	f	I'm serious.
MARIANNE	f	You're crazy.
LETOUR	f	This is crazy.
MARIANNE	f	I have to get back.
LETOUR	f	I'll walk you.
LETOUR	f	I can always find another way to  make a living. I never planned this  in the first place -- not like Ann.  She came up to sell, have parties,  make contacts. She was so glamorous.  I just wanted to be around her. She'd  sit up listening to coke stories.  Now it's me and Robert. The whole  crowd was the same age. Everybody's  younger now. She made me.
ANN	f	You have any money saved?
LETOUR	f	There's some. Not much. A thousand  or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure.
ANN	f	What do you do with your money?
LETOUR	f	I don't know. It's not that much in  the first place -- as you know.
ANN	f	It's tax free --
LETOUR	f	Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs --  what about your money?
ANN	f	Kitty Ford once told me, "Ann, the  only person I know that lives as  well as you is my grandmother." All  the money I've made, all the money  I've spent -- it never adds up. This  last two years cosmetics' been taking  everything.
LETOUR	f	I wish I could help.
ANN	f	You still go to meetings?
LETOUR	f	No, but I'm okay. What are the odds  of meeting someone you haven't seen  in years twice in two days?
ANN	f	Ask Robert to make up a chart for  you; the other person -- who is it?
LETOUR	f	Just a contact -- you don't know  him.
ANN	f	What's the plan?
LETOUR	f	The plan?
ANN	f	What you gonna do?
LETOUR	f	My future?
ANN	f	Too conceptual?
LETOUR	f	We had this conversation two years  ago. We'll have it two years from  now.
ANN	f	This time it's for real.
LETOUR	f	I'm thinking of some music courses.  Mixing, sound editing --
ANN	f	You took that before.
LETOUR	f	That was acting.
ANN	f	Modeling.
LETOUR	f	Why all this concern? Suddenly you  care?
ANN	f	I have feelings too -- you may have  noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm  tough, you gotta to be tough,  especially in this business, it's  one thing to act tough -- I've seen  Zipporah twice this week.
LETOUR	f	She helps you?
ANN	f	-- harmonizes, she's encouraging me  to get out of this into the cosmetics  thing --
ANN	f	Nomination for Best Picture. I knew  every girl he fucked -- how, why. I  knew when he had trouble shitting.  Like this. His wife says he gets straight or  she cuts him off. Old money. I  remember the last thing he said to  me: "See you soon." Yeah, sure. That  was five years ago.
ANN	f	You'll still talk to me, won't you?
LETOUR	f	You --? Of course I will.
ANN	f	It'll be strange without you around.  I hadn't thought of it -- it hit me.
LETOUR	f	We'll always have Paris.
ANN	f	John.
LETOUR	f	Ann, you want me, call, write a  letter, tell a wino -- I'll be there.
LETOUR	f	I'm sorry. I...
LETOUR	f	I always thought my father would die  first. He would die, then my mother  and I would reconcile. Just her and  me. I hated him for living.
MARIANNE	f	It's like a joke. It's not a real  feeling. It's like a feeling of a  feeling.
LETOUR	f	My old man bawling in the hospital,  me popping in and out of the john  getting loaded. I miss you.
MARIANNE	f	You tried to kill me. You took ten  years of my life one way or another. I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too  busy hating you.
LETOUR	f	I thought I was just killing myself.
LETOUR	f	Selfish.
MARIANNE	f	I remember.
LETOUR	f	What?
MARIANNE	f	What it felt like. What this tasted like.
LETOUR	f	I see you and my heart starts  thumping.
MARIANNE	f	John.
LETOUR	f	Excuse us. Let's go.
MARIANNE	f	Come. Come with me.
LETOUR	f	Have you ever had sex totally  straight?
MARIANNE	f	Not with you.
LETOUR	f	Neither have I.
MARIANNE	f	Such an erection.
LETOUR	f	Never had anything like it stoned.  Feel it.
MARIANNE	f	Weird.
LETOUR	f	Wow.
MARIANNE	f	I'm dripping.
LETOUR	f	Let's disappear.
LETOUR	f	Kiss, kiss, kiss.
MARIANNE	f	Kiss, kiss, kiss.
LETOUR	f	Together.
LETOUR	f	You need to go back?
MARIANNE	f	This is the end. It was wonderful.  I'm glad it happened this way. It  will never happen again. You will  not see me, you will not call me  again. I'm happy for you. I wish you  the best. I'm leaving. I'm going  back to the hospital. I shouldn't  have left -- but I don't regret it.  Please dress and leave as soon as  possible. I have a key. Goodbye.
LETOUR	f	Marianne...
MARIANNE	f	It's my fault.
LETOUR	f	I love you.
ANN	f	Johnny, what is this? Your beeper  broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two  hours: where have you bee?
LETOUR	f	There was a mix-up --
ANN	f	How you gonna survive on your own?  The U.N.'s got some conference in  two days. The holiday's over --  ragheads everywhere trying to score.  U.N. security at every hotel -- little  creeps with lapel pins. Even I've  been out. This is where our money  is: Europe, Asia, not the streets --  you wouldn't know crack from  crackerjacks.
LETOUR	f	Where's Robert?
ANN	f	Busting his ass. He's out doing your  job.
LETOUR	f	It was a confusion.
ANN	f	Get confused on your day off.
LETOUR	f	When is that?
ANN	f	Don't get wise. What do you want me  to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A  raise? No way. Get out there. There's  a list on the TV. I love you. Get  your ass outta here before I kiss  it.
LETOUR	f	I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me.
TIS	?	Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this  is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas.  They're here for a show.
LETOUR	f	Enchant�. How'd it turn out?
TIS	?	Questo � un vero Americano. What?
LETOUR	f	St. Luke's.
TIS	?	No problem, but -- can you believe  this? -- she's out of the hospital  in one day, calls me up, wants to  "get together." Some people are just  born for losing. Want to go in back?
LETOUR	f	Not now.
TIS	?	Huh?
LETOUR	f	Look at the bar. Black-haired guy,  late twenties, brown suit, drinking  tonic? He's casing you. Not me, you.  Undercover, whatever -- he's on you.
TIS	?	You know him?
LETOUR	f	Just a feeling. You holding?
TIS	?	No. Need help?
LETOUR	f	Leave a message. Robert or I will  come by later.
TIS	?	Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway. Who am I trying to impress? Make it tomorrow. A half -- no, three- quarters.
LETOUR	f	Nineteen is the top. I'll make two  trips.
TIS	?	Nineteen is fine.
LETOUR	f	A domani. Take care, girls.
LETOUR	f	I feel my life turning. All it needed  was a direction. You drift from day  to day, years go by. Suddenly there  is a direction. What a strange thing  to happen halfway through your life.
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD	m	Paramount Hotel.
LETOUR	f	Marianne Jost, please.
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD	m	Just a moment.
HOTEL MESSAGE	m	"Welcome to the Paramount. Your party  is out. If you would like to leave a  message for --
'MARIANNE JOST'	m	-- please do so after the beep."
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD	m	Paramount Hotel.
LETOUR	f	Marianne Jost.
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD	m	Just a moment.
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD	m	I'm sorry. Ms. Jost checked out this  morning.
LETOUR	f	She was there yesterday.
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD	m	She checked out this morning.
LETOUR	f	Did she leave a forwarding number?
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD	m	No.
LETOUR	f	Thank you.
ST. LUKE'S SWITCHBOARD	m	St. Luke's -- Roosevelt Hospital.
LETOUR	f	Mrs. Jost. JoAnn Jost. She's a  patient.
ST. LUKE'S SWITCHBOARD	m	Just a moment.
MEDICAL VOICE	m	Who is this calling?
LETOUR	f	Skyline Floral. We're trying to  confirm a delivery.
MEDICAL VOICE	m	Mrs. Jost passed away last night.
LETOUR	f	Are the funeral arrangements local?
MEDICAL VOICE	m	Just a sec -- yes, Plaza Memorial.
LETOUR	f	Thank you.
MEDICAL VOICE	m	You're welcome.
LETOUR	f	Can I help you, officer?
GUIDONE	m	What?
LETOUR	f	I hope I haven't made a mistake. You  are a cop, aren't you?
GUIDONE	m	Yes.
LETOUR	f	Could I see a badge?
GUIDONE	m	Bill Guidone.
LETOUR	f	What is it?
GUIDONE	m	You think you're invisible, don't  you? You think we don't know you,  LeTour -- that's the name you use,  right?
LETOUR	f	My father's a partner in a powerful  law firm. If you have anything in  mind, do it by the book.
GUIDONE	m	You? Who the fuck cares about you? I  could grind you right here! -- maybe  I will! -- and nobody would give a  fuck! You're not worth the paperwork.  I look like Narcotics? I'm Homicide --  I'm investigating the Park murder.
LETOUR	f	I don't follow the news.
GUIDONE	m	Downtown's interested how a Barnard  honors student with fancy parents  got a quarter of uncut coke on her  when she was murdered. I mean, we  just don't see this girl cruising  Alphabet City trying to score.  Somebody sold her, somebody upscale  and classy -- you're classy, I hear --  and that somebody knows something we  need to know. Delivery boy!
LETOUR	f	I wish I could help. I don't even  know who's president.
GUIDONE	m	Let me put it this way. Here's my  card Ask around, take a week or so. Call  me. Tell me something I don't know.  Either that, leave town, or get your  ass busted day in, day out.
MARIANNE	f	Get out.
LETOUR	f	Marianne...
MARIANNE	f	Every time you come into my life  something terrible happens. I thought  I was rid of you. How'd you get here?  I don't want you here! I don't want  you around me, I don't want you around  my mother! Damn you!
LETOUR	f	Marianne...
MARIANNE	f	Get out!
LETOUR	f	I didn't...
RANDI	f	I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You  shouldn't have come. Marianne has  been up all night, crying and crying.  She wasn't there when Mother passed --  died -- she blames herself. It  wouldn't have made any difference.  She just slipped away. Marianne's --  I'm worried --
LETOUR	f	It's...
RANDI	f	Don't try.
LETOUR	f	How are you?
RANDI	f	Me?
LETOUR	f	Yes, you. I can't think of anything,  but if there was anything I could  do...
RANDI	f	Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean,  we've been expecting it. It'll hit  me later.
LETOUR	f	I saw her.
RANDI	f	Who?
LETOUR	f	Your mother. I came in the room. You  were sleeping. I just watched.
RANDI	f	Oh. I'd better get back. Marianne's  probably flipping out.
ANN	f	Have some shu mai. Just delivered.
LETOUR	f	No.
ROBERT	m	I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis  called. He said before ten. He said  you were right.
ANN	f	About what?
LETOUR	f	An undercover cop. Not a narc. The  Park murder. Jealous was straight on  that -- you hear anything?
ROBERT	m	Remember the time that cop called  here? Wanted to know if we had "nose  candy"? Ann says, "John Candy?" "John Candy?"
ANN	f	What's wrong baby? You like like  shit. Something wrong?
LETOUR	f	No.
ANN	f	You can't fool me. I can read you.
LETOUR	f	What do you care? You're leaving me.  A few more months -- sayonara. You too. John who? What was his name  again? Le --? I mean it's not exactly like I got a  pension plan.
ROBERT	m	Jack.
ANN	f	Johnny, it's not that at all. Is  that what you think? You hate  cosmetics. You don't care about it.  You told me that.
LETOUR	f	I know.
ANN	f	Who knows what will happen?
ROBERT	m	I got a friend -- a D.D. -- got into  lapidary. I'll introduce you. You  have to pass a test.
LETOUR	f	Lapi --?
ROBERT	m	Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds.
LETOUR	f	Any more about the Park murder?
ANN	f	What's with this thing?
ROBERT	m	Stay away.
ANN	f	You want in? We'll make a place for  you.
LETOUR	f	No.
ANN	f	It's --
EDDIE	m	"Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come.  The other thing is over. I'll be  home all night. 749-2876."
ROBERT	m	Shit.
ANN	f	Don't answer it. Let him call all  night. He's trouble. I don't want to  deal with him.
LETOUR	f	It's alright, I'll go. Let me handle  it.
ROBERT	m	I'm sorry if --
ANN	f	He gives you shit -- fuck him.
LETOUR	f	Forget it.
ROBERT	m	We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I  mean we're on a roll --
ANN	f	Spring roll.
LETOUR	f	Sure, whatever. Surprise me.
EDDIE	m	You gotta get permission? Check with  Mama?
LETOUR	f	I'm calling your brother.
EDDIE	m	Huh?
LETOUR	f	Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm  gonna ask him to come over. You've told me so much about him.
EDDIE	m	No, don't. Please, I'll give you  money, anything. He doesn't  understand. Whose side are you on?
LETOUR	f	Is this Martin Jeer? Thank you.
EDDIE	m	I shoulda never called.
LETOUR	f	I recommend Hazelden. It has the  best all-around program. Martin Jeer? I'm here with your brother Ed. Yeah, in the city. I'm afraid there's  a medical emergency. You're going to  have to come.
LETOUR	f	He'll be here.
TIS	?	Tour, just in time. We were out.  Nineteen, right?
LETOUR	f	Thirty-eight hundred -- got any  hundreds?
TIS	?	Some, not the whole thing. You got hundreds?
THOMAS	m	No.
TIS	?	I like that about Ann. Always takes  the time to grind it. If you do it,  do it right.
TIS	?	Looks like you could use some help. Mari, this is Tour. You got any  hundreds?
TIS	?	Not the talkative type. Haven't seen  her in years. You know her, don't  you? Why they call me? What a nightmare. You want it or not?
LETOUR	f	Yeah.
TIS	?	See you later.
FEMALE COP	f	Get back!
MALE COP	m	Who saw it? What happened? EMS is on the way.
FEMALE COP	f	Too late --
CARLOS	m	Where to?
LETOUR	f	What?
CARLOS	m	Where to, sir? Where are we going?
LETOUR	f	Nowhere just now. Wait.
CARLOS	m	You want me to wait here?
LETOUR	f	Yes.
LETOUR	f	Downtown.
CARLOS	m	Yes.
NEWSCASTER	?	This story is just in. A woman has  fallen thirty stories to her death  from a posh Grace Towers apartment  on Lexington Avenue. Police are  withholding identification pending  the notification of the next of kin.  The incident happened about ten p.m.  According to the sources on the scene  there was no one else in the posh  Grace Towers apartment when the fall  occurred. We will bring you more  details as we get them. An end to the sanitation strike seems  imminent. Negotiations at the Helmsley  Palace are continuing to this hour...
TERESA	f	Who is it?
LETOUR	f	John. John LeTour. Can I see you?
TERESA	f	What time is it?
LETOUR	f	It's important, Teresa.
TERESA	f	Call. Make an appointment.
LETOUR	f	Open the door. You're awake anyway. Teresa.
LETOUR	f	Read me. What do you see?
TERESA	f	Do I know you?
LETOUR	f	We had a session last week. What do  you see?
TERESA	f	John?
LETOUR	f	Yes. Look at me.
TERESA	f	Step back. Again. Death.
LETOUR	f	Someone I knew died tonight.
TERESA	f	This was not an accident. This person  was murdered.
LETOUR	f	Am I in danger?
TERESA	f	There is danger around you. It's  very close. I'm sleepy.
LETOUR	f	What should I do?
TERESA	f	I can't see it.
LETOUR	f	Please. Am I lucky?
TERESA	f	Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home.
LETOUR	f	What do I owe you?
TERESA	f	Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep.
POLICE SWITCHBOARD	m	Ninth Precinct.
LETOUR	f	Bill Guidone, please. Homicide.
POLICE SWITCHBOARD	m	Hold on.
GUIDONE	m	Guidone.
LETOUR	f	This is John LeTour. Remember me?
GUIDONE	m	Laundromat. Your father's got  connections.
LETOUR	f	You said I should ask around, tell  you something you didn't know.
GUIDONE	m	I thought you'd call.
LETOUR	f	It ain't much, but it's something.
GUIDONE	m	Go on.
LETOUR	f	A girl died last night. Lexington  Ave.
GUIDONE	m	The jumper. Druggie.
LETOUR	f	The news said she was alone in the  apartment when she went out -- she  wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was  someone else.
GUIDONE	m	Who?
LETOUR	f	Who lives in the apartment?
GUIDONE	m	You there?
LETOUR	f	That's all I know. You asked me to  tell you something. I told you  something.
ROBERT	m	Who is it?
LETOUR	f	Jack. Let me in.
ROBERT	m	Where have you been? We were worried.
LETOUR	f	I need some sleep -- not much. I  don't want to go home just yet. A  little sleep first. Can I crash here?  Nice place.
ROBERT	m	It's hideous. I did it years ago.  I've got to throw everything out.  You haven't been here? Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you  about him. You should talk. He's the  lapidopterist -- gems.
TONY	m	Lapidarian.
ROBERT	m	Same thing.
LETOUR	f	Can I?
ROBERT	m	Sure.
LETOUR	f	What do you know about Tis? What's  his relationship to Ann?
ROBERT	m	They go way back -- before me. Did  you cross him?
LETOUR	f	No.
ROBERT	m	Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection.  She needs that score. What happened?
LETOUR	f	Nothing.
ROBERT	m	Don't mess with him.
LETOUR	f	Is he dangerous?
ROBERT	m	Everybody's dangerous. We heard what  you did to Eddie. Ann thought it was  great. She was afraid that was why  you didn't come back.
LETOUR	f	It was something else. Tell me if  you hear anything.
ROBERT	m	About what?
LETOUR	f	Tis.
ROBERT	m	Tis who? Ann says you want a chart  done. What's wrong?
LETOUR	f	Ah...
ROBERT	m	You down?
LETOUR	f	Yeah... You ever think about it?
ROBERT	m	What?
LETOUR	f	That it'd be like this -- like, your  life, you... that it would turn out  this way? --
ROBERT	m	Compared to what? My thinking this  or that is going to make any  difference? There's a plan unfolding.  "Will my plane crash?" "Does life  have meaning?" -- why ask me?  Thinking's a fear of living, negative  living; living's something else.  You're afraid. Let the plan unfold.  Stop. Stop, live one day -- one day --
LETOUR	f	-- Robert --
ROBERT	m	-- day at a time.
LETOUR	f	You've lost your fucking brain.
ROBERT	m	I'm a drug dealer.
LETOUR	f	Got a tub?
ROBERT	m	Yeah.
LETOUR	f	Great.
ROBERT	m	There's a plastic bottle of bath oil  in the cabinet. Yellow. Use it --  tell me what you think. It's a new  formula.
LETOUR	f	Manny. LeTour. Jealous. "Jell." SOB's.
MANUEL	m	Reggae night.
LETOUR	f	Burning Spear.
MANUEL	m	How'd you get in?
LETOUR	f	C-C.
MANUEL	m	You buying?
LETOUR	f	How's product?
MANUEL	m	How much?
LETOUR	f	I got a problem. I need a piece.
MANUEL	m	Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy?
LETOUR	f	A gun.
MANUEL	m	When?
LETOUR	f	Now. Anything. Am I speaking too fast?
MANUEL	m	How much you spend?
LETOUR	f	The rate. What you got?
MANUEL	m	He's got a 64 Smith-son. Detective  Special. Nobody wants 'em. Fresh  from a cop.
LETOUR	f	How much?
MANUEL	m	Four -- including me.
LETOUR	f	You're fucking me.
MANUEL	m	Street price.
LETOUR	f	Where is it?
MANUEL	m	Sigame.
MANUEL	m	The hundreds -- Franklins.
LETOUR	f	How do you use this?
MANUEL	m	Automatic.
LETOUR	f	I don't have much use for a gun.  Never used one like this.
LETOUR	f	What do you do?
MANUEL	m	Simple. You put the bullets in -- you point it at the bad guys, pull  the trigger and they fall down!
MANUEL	m	Vaya con Dios.
LETOUR	f	-- Dios.
LETOUR	f	Have you been to the police station?
RANDI	f	She was back on drugs. Really back.  They're gonna bring her here too. My  God. I thought she was playing for  attention.
LETOUR	f	I didn't know.
RANDI	f	You're not to blame. Don't blame  yourself. You weren't responsible.  She was always -- she loved you.
LETOUR	f	She loved you. You were what she  wanted to be.
RANDI	f	She scared me.
LETOUR	f	Look. Do you recognize anyone?
RANDI	f	Tis.
LETOUR	f	You know him?
RANDI	f	His father's a lawyer. Did some tax  things for Mom. He was at the  hospital. What's that smell?
LETOUR	f	It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for  that cheap airplane stuff. Did  Marianne mention him yesterday?
RANDI	f	It was his apartment. What are you  thinking?
LETOUR	f	I don't know.
RANDI	f	She jumped. You loved her, but she -- this sounds  terrible but it's true -- she was...  she ruined everything... bad luck.
LETOUR	f	When's the funeral -- your mother's?
RANDI	f	Tomorrow. Will you come?
LETOUR	f	Well, I got this thing to do. It's --  I don't know if I can get away.
RANDI	f	Try? For me.
LETOUR	f	I'll try.
ANN	f	The Prodigal Son.
LETOUR	f	Sorry about last night. Something  came up.
ANN	f	Where were you?
LETOUR	f	T.C.T.E.
ROBERT	m	"Too Complicated To Explain."
LETOUR	f	I'm $500 short from last night. I'll  get it, you can take it from my  salary.
ANN	f	This is family. Are you saying that  to hurt me? It's not money.
LETOUR	f	Sorry.
ROBERT	m	Look at this. We had a graphic artist make it up --  you know, Billy, Five Towns.
ANN	f	The label for the cosmetics line.
LETOUR	f	Classy. Sorta -- Katmandu...
ANN	f	Kathmandu.
LETOUR	f	I love it.
ROBERT	m	Tis called twice. He wants you to  come by.
LETOUR	f	Me?
ANN	f	Yeah. Says you were supposed to show  up again yesterday, but didn't.
LETOUR	f	A lie. I don't want to go. The suicide  and all. Let's stay away.
ANN	f	Can't. He's the Ecstasy connect. No  way I can fuck this.
LETOUR	f	C'mon...
ANN	f	This is business.
LETOUR	f	Let Robert go.
ANN	f	Tis won't deal with fags.
LETOUR	f	Since when?
ANN	f	Just is -- so he's a bigot? What's  new? So's everybody else.
LETOUR	f	I don't want to go. I got a bad vibe.
ROBERT	m	He said you.
ANN	f	Why?
LETOUR	f	Why don't you go? He's your contact.
ROBERT	m	He is --
ANN	f	You giving orders?
ROBERT	m	No, Missy.
LETOUR	f	Come with me -- the two of us.
ANN	f	Okay. You got it. Like old times --  Ann and Johnny.
LETOUR	f	Okay.
ROBERT	m	Stop it. You're breaking my heart.
ANN	f	It's going to be strange, not doing  this. I mean I've had it, but  sometimes...
LETOUR	f	You're gonna do it, aren't you? You're  gonna quit.
ANN	f	I think so. Seal this thing with  Tis, turn it -- go with the cosmetics.  You gotta take a chance in life. No  risk, no gain. I've already got retail  connections here, London. It was  great at the beginning, though.
LETOUR	f	When?
ANN	f	You know, when we first started out  of the place on Greene Street. Before  deliveries, when you were still using.  It was open house every night but  Sunday. We had everything: uppers,  downers, meth, six kinds of hash,  all in that trousseau, remember? You  could get in for a gram, stay all  night -- everybody, music people,  movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even  politics. I think like five marriages  came out of those parties, babies --  really. God. You stayed, you then Robert -- but  he... I'da never thought you'd, what  is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a  year max, eight months, in, out,  start using, unreliable -- nice kids.  Remember when you first came: long  hair, dirty fingers --
LETOUR	f	You made me --
ANN	f	-- never washed --
LETOUR	f	-- khaki pants.
ANN	f	I should write a book someday. Did  you know somebody wanted to do my  story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible,  of course -- my lawyer freaked I  even had the meeting. People envy  me. They think my life is so  glamorous, but they don't know. I  know. Glamorous. It was for a while. Then came crack  and fucked everything.
LETOUR	f	I gotta stop home a second.
ANN	f	Why? It's out of the way. They're  expecting you.
LETOUR	f	You know I got a bad vibe about Tis.
ANN	f	Chill. This is routine.
LETOUR	f	I want to get my lucky jacket.
ANN	f	Oh. Okay.
ANN	f	That took long enough. What did you  do, douche while you were at it?
LETOUR	f	Ann, you got some mouth on you.
ANN	f	You don't want to know where it's  been. Cologne?
LETOUR	f	For you.
ANN	f	Phew. It smells like that stuff they  give you on airplanes. It's no good  for your skin. All chemicals.
ANN	f	What's that?
LETOUR	f	Do me a favor.
ANN	f	What?
LETOUR	f	Don't ask why, just promise.
ANN	f	What is it?
LETOUR	f	If anything happens to me -- if I  should like, you know, fucking die --  write and tell her.
LETOUR	f	It's my sister. Her husband's in San  Quentin. She worries, you know.
ANN	f	Okay.
LETOUR	f	I thought we were going to Tis'?
ANN	f	We are. He's here. He can't very  well work out of his apartment after  what happened yesterday, can he?
ANN	f	Mathis Bruge, please. Tis? Ann. I'm here with Tour. Okay.
LETOUR	f	Tis there?
ANN	f	Twelve-oh-four.
LETOUR	f	Ann.
ANN	f	I told you greasy fucks I don't deal  with guns! I see guns, I walk! How  dare you?
ANN	f	And you, beaner, whoever the fuck  you are, kiss my fat ass!
THOMAS	m	Hold it! Stop right there.
TIS	?	No! Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I  was just trying to make a point -- I  apologize.
LETOUR	f	Go on.
TIS	?	Tour and I need to get our stories  straight. Somebody's talking to the  police. The guns were for emphasis,  to make a point, dumb --
ANN	f	We came together, we're leaving  together. Johnny, come with me.
TIS	?	Thomas.
TIS	?	Don't be stupid. Get out. Leave. I had nothing to do with Marianne --  she jumped: she was there, then she  was gone. Nothing will happen to Tour.
ANN	f	Fire! Fire! Fire!
TIS	?	I didn't --
LETOUR	f	Hello.
ANN	f	Hi.
LETOUR	f	Twenty minutes. You look terrific.
ANN	f	I look respectable. Any news?
LETOUR	f	Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed  to be. Because of the extenuating  circumstances -- our cooperation --  they say it won't be more than five  years -- maybe seven. With time  served, good behavior, parole, I  could be out in two years -- maybe.  I hope.
ANN	f	It feels like forever.
LETOUR	f	It's not so bad. It's a relief in a  way -- at least so far. I've been  writing, reading.
ANN	f	I love your letters.
LETOUR	f	How's business?
ANN	f	Robert quit. He went back to dealing.  I think he thought it would be less  work, more money. It's lucky in a  way I got mixed up in it -- now I  have to see this thing through. So  it's cosmetics after all.
LETOUR	f	I miss you.
ANN	f	Me too.
LETOUR	f	Did we ever fuck?
ANN	f	What do you mean?
LETOUR	f	You know, make love.
ANN	f	There was that party when everybody  was so stoned, but -- oh yeah, that  night you came over and crashed and  we slept together.
LETOUR	f	We were naked, but did we --?
ANN	f	You had a hard-on...
LETOUR	f	I didn't --
ANN	f	You tried...
LETOUR	f	I was thinking about it and I realized  we never really did. It's one of the  things I think about. It's one of  the things I look forward to. I've  been looking forward.
ANN	f	Me too.
LETOUR	f	Something can be right in front of  you and you can't see it.
ANN	f	Strange how things work.
