SAL	m	  Pino, get a broom and sweep out   front.
PINO	m	  Vito, get a broom and sweep out   front.
VITO	m	  See, Pop.  That's just what I was   talkin' about.  Every single time   you tell Pino to do something, he   gives it to me.
PINO	m	  He's nuts.
SAL	m	  The both of youse, shaddup.
VITO	m	  Tell Pino.
PINO	m	  Get the broom.
VITO	m	  I ain't getting shit.

SAL	m	  Can you do better?  C'mere.
SAL	m	  Can you do better?     (he pops Pino upside     the head)   I didn't think so.  This is a   respectable business.  Nuthin'   wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
PINO	m	  Tell Vito.
VITO	m	  Pop asked you.
SAL	m	  I'm gonna kill somebody today.

MOOKIE	m	  I hear ya, Mother Sister.  I hear   you.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Good.  I'll be watching ya, son.   Mother Sister always watches.
PINO	m	  Mookie, late again.  How many times   I gotta tell you?
MOOKIE	m	  Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
SAL	m	  How ya doin', Mookie?
VITO	m	  Whaddup?
MOOKIE	m	  Just coolin'.
PINO	m	  You're still late.
SAL	m	  Pino, relax, will ya.
PINO	m	  Here, take the broom.  The front   needs sweeping.
MOOKIE	m	  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I   just got here.  You sweep.  I   betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
VITO	m	  That's right.
PINO	m	  Shaddup, Vito.
MOOKIE	m	  Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas.   That's what I get paid for.
PINO	m	  You get paid to do what we say.
MOOKIE	m	  What we say.  I didn't hear Sal say   nuthin'.
PINO	m	  Who's working for who?
SAL	m	  Come on in, Mayor.
DA MAYOR	m	  Good morning, gentlemens.  It's   gonna be a scorcher today, that's   for sure.  Need any work done   around here?
DA MAYOR	m	  It will be the cleanest sidewalk in   Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of   Health.
PINO	m	  Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We   runnin' welfare or somethin'?   Every day you give dat bum--
MOOKIE	m	  Da Mayor ain't no bum.
PINO	m	  Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping   our sidewalk.  What do we pay   Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I   work harder than him and I'm your   own son.
MOOKIE	m	  Who don't work?  Let's see you   carry six large pies up six flights   of stairs.  No elevator either and   shit.
SAL	m	  Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a   place of business.
VITO	m	  Tell 'em, Pop.
PINO	m	  Me and you are gonna have a talk.
VITO	m	  Sez who?
PINO	m	  Sez me.
SAL	m	  Hey!  What did I say?
MOOKIE	m	  Who doesn't work?  Don't start no   shit, won't be no shit.
SAL	m	  Mookie, no cursing in the store.
MOOKIE	m	  Talk to your son.
ELLA	f	  What's keeping him?
PUNCHY	f	  You call him, then.
ELLA	f	  Yo, Ahmad!
PUNCHY	f	  I coulda done dat.
ELLA	f	  Yo, Ahmad!
ELLA	f	  Punchy, if ya want to do some more   screaming, be my guest.  I'm too   through.
AHMAD	m	  Who's yelling my name?
ELLA	f	  Punchy told me to.
AHMAD	m	  Don't listen to him, it will get ya   in trouble.
ELLA	f	  Heard that, Punchy.
AHMAD	m	  Ella, you have a brain, use it.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  Peace, y'all.
ELLA	f	  Peace, Radio Raheem.
CEE	?	  Peace.
PUNCHY	f	  You the man, Radio Raheem.
AHMAD	m	  It's your world.
CEE	?	  In a big way.
AHMAD	m	  My people.  My people.
DA MAYOR	m	  Where's the Bud?  Where's the Bud?
KOREAN CLERK	m	  No mo' Bud.  You look what we have   and buy.
DA MAYOR	m	  No more Bud.  What kind of joint is   this?  How come no mo' Bud?  Doctor,   this ain't Korea, China, or wherever   you come from.  Get some Budweiser   in this motherfucker.
KOREAN CLERK	m	  You buy 'nother beer. 
DA MAYOR	m	  Alright.  Alright.  Y'know you're   asking a lot to make a man change   his beer, that's asking a lot,   Doctor.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  You ole drunk.  What did I tell ya   about drinking in front of my stoop?   Move on, you're blocking my view.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  The evil eye doesn't work on me.
DA MAYOR	m	  Mother Sister, you've been talkin'   'bout me the last eighteen years.   What have I ever done to you?
MOTHER SISTER	f	  You're a drunk fool.
DA MAYOR	m	  Besides that.  Da Mayor don't   bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother   Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just   mind his business.  I love everybody.   I even love you.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Hold your tongue.  You don't have   that much love.
DA MAYOR	m	  One day you'll be nice to me.  We   might both be dead and buried, but   you'll be nice.  At least civil.
TINA	f	  Hector, I shouldn't be telling you   this but you would find out sooner   or later.  Ya father ain't no real   father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum   in a hundred-dollar world.  Your   father is to the curb.  You're   smart.  I see that look on ya face.   You're saying if he's such a bum   why am I with him?  Good question.   Like I said before, you're no dummy.   He talked his way into my panties,   I thought being a mother would make   me happy, make me whole.  He's a   mistake, but you are not.
ML	f	  The way I see it, if this hot   weather continues, it will surely   melt the polar caps and the whole   wide world--the parts that ain't   water already--will be flooded.
COCONUT SID	m	  You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker.   Where did you read that?
ML	f	  Don't worry about it.  But when it   happens and I'm in my boat and ya   black ass is drowning, don't ask me   to throw you a lifesaver either.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Fool, you're thirty cents away from   a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
ML	f	  Don't worry about it.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat   the holes out of donuts.
ML	f	  I'll be back on my feet.  Soon   enough.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  So when is all this ice suppose to   melt?
SAL	m	  You paying now or on layaway?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  How much?
SAL	m	  You come in here at least three   times a day.  You a retard?  A buck   fifty.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on   that motherfucker.
SAL	m	  Extra cheese is two dollars.   Y'know dat.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Two dollars!  Forget it!
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Mookie.
MOOKIE	m	  What?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  How come you ain't got no brothers   up?
MOOKIE	m	  Ask Sal.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Sal, how come you ain't got no   brothers up on the wall here?
SAL	m	  You want brothers up on the Wall of   Fame, you open up your own business,   then you can do what you wanna do.   My pizzeria, Italian Americans up   on the wall.
VITO	m	  Take it easy, Pop.
SAL	m	  Don't start on me today.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Sal, that might be fine, you own   this, but rarely do I see any   Italian Americans eating in here.   All I've ever seen is Black folks.   So since we spend much money here,   we do have some say.
SAL	m	  You a troublemaker?
PINO	m	  You making trouble.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Put some brothers up on this Wall   of Fame.  We want Malcolm X, Angela   Davis, Michael Jordan tomorrow.
SAL	m	  Don't come back, either.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
MOOKIE	m	  Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  I'm cool.  I'm cool.
MOOKIE	m	  Come back in a week, it will be   squashed.
SAL	m	  Mookie, if your friends can't   behave, they're not welcome.
MOOKIE	m	  I got no say over people.
PINO	m	  You talk to 'em.
MOOKIE	m	  People are free to do what they   wanna do.
SAL	m	  I know, this is America, but I   don't want no trouble.
DA MAYOR	m	  Mookie.
MOOKIE	m	  Gotta go.
DA MAYOR	m	  C'mere, Doctor.
DA MAYOR	m	  Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
MOOKIE	m	  OK.  OK.   OK.  OK.
DA MAYOR	m	  Doctor, always try to do the right   thing.
MOOKIE	m	  That's it?
DA MAYOR	m	  That's it.
MOOKIE	m	  I got it.
NILDA	f	  I hope it's not cold.
MOOKIE	m	  No, it's not cold.  Twelve dollars   for the pie.
MOOKIE	m	  Hold it.  Let me count this first.
MOOKIE	m	  You're short.
NILDA	f	  I counted the twelve dollars myself.
MOOKIE	m	  Twelve is right, but no tip.
NILDA	f	  No tip.
MOOKIE	m	  Look, lady.  I carried your pizza   up five flights of stairs and shit.   The cheese didn't slide over to one   side like it sometimes does with   delivery people who don't care.  I   do care.  May I get paid?
NILDA	f	  Wait here.
MOOKIE	m	  I'll wait.
MOOKIE	m	  Gracias mucho.
MOOKIE	m	  A dollar!  Cheap bastard!  Your   pizza is gonna be fucked next time.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Jade, you're late.
JADE	f	  I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here   now.  Where's the stuff?
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Seen your brother, just walked by.
JADE	f	  This might take some time.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  I got nowhere to go.  We haven't   had a good sit-down for a long while.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Tender-headed runs in my family.   You tender-headed?
JADE	f	  Yeah, me too.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  That's why I don't fool with it.   Only let you touch it...Ouch!
JADE	f	  Sorry, comb got caught.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is   an old woman.
JADE	f	  How are you holding up in this   weather?
MOTHER SISTER	f	  I'll do.
JADE	f	  I don't know why you still haven't   bought an air conditioner.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
DA MAYOR	m	  I didn't know you had such beautiful   hair.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Fool, there's a lot in this world   you don't know.
DA MAYOR	m	  I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
JADE	f	  You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it   isn't right.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides,   he reminds me of my least favorite   peoples.  My tenants and my ex-   husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Number One: I got some jive, late-   rent-paying trifling Negroes in   this house.  Every year I keep   threatening to sell it.
JADE	f	  And move to Long Island...
MOTHER SISTER	f	  And move to Long Island.  Number   Two: my ex-husband lost all my   property, all my money in his   scheme to build a Black business   empire.  Needless to say what   happened, this house is it, all I   got.  I'm too through with yar   people.
JADE	f	  Whew!
ELLA	f	  Ahmad!  Put me down!  Put me down!   I can't get wet!  I'm not playing!
AHMAD	m	  Yo!
ELLA	f	  No!
CHARLIE	m	  I'm not playing.  There's gonna be   trouble if you fuck around.
PUNCHY	f	  Go 'head.  You got it.  You got it.
CHARLIE	m	  This is an expensive car.
CEE	?	  You won't get wet.
CHARLIE	m	  I'm warning you.
PUNCHY	f	  C'mon.
CEE	?	  Hurry up.  We ain't got all day.
CHARLIE	m	  I'm fucking soaked.  If I ever   catch those fucks they'll be sorry.   Cocksucking sonabitches!
CHARLIE	m	  You people make me sick.
CHARLIE	m	  Officers, I want an arrest made.   Now.
OFFICER PONTE	m	  What happened?
CHARLIE	m	  Two Black kids soaked me and my car.   It's fucking ruined.
OFFICER LONG	m	  Where are they?
CHARLIE	m	  Where are they?  What kind of   fucking asshole question is that?   They ran the fuck away.
OFFICER PONTE	m	  Do you wish to file a complaint?
CHARLIE	m	  A complaint.  I want those fucks   locked under the jail.
OFFICER PONTE	m	  This hydrant better not come back   on or there's gonna be hell to pay.
CHARLIE	m	  What about my car?  I want justice.
OFFICER LONG	m	  You know anything about this?
CHARLIE	m	  He knows.  He's a witness.  They   all know.  He saw the whole thing.
OFFICER LONG	m	  Who were the punks?
DA MAYOR	m	  Those who'll tell don't know.   Those who know won't tell.
OFFICER PONTE	m	  A wise guy.
MOOKIE	m	  Let's go, Mayor.
OFFICER LONG	m	  Keep this hydrant off.  You want to   swim, go to Coney Island.
CHARLIE	m	  He's leaving?  What about me?
OFFICER PONTE	m	  I suggest you get in your car   quick, before these people start to   strip it clean.
OFFICER LONG	m	  Let's go, break it up.  Go back to   your jobs.
OFFICER PONTE	m	  What jobs?
SAL	m	  Mookie, what took you so long?  I   got a business to run.
MOOKIE	m	  Run it then.
SAL	m	  Here, this goes to the radio station.
VITO	m	  Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
SAL	m	  Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
PINO	m	  Yeah, hurry back, it's getting   crowded.
VITO	m	  Mister Se�or Love Daddy is cool.
MOOKIE	m	  Ya like him, huh?
VITO	m	  Yeah.
MOOKIE	m	  Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya   brother and shit, but the next time   he hits ya, the next time he   touches ya, you should "house him."   Kick his ass.
VITO	m	  I don't know.
MOOKIE	m	  If you don't make a stand, he's   gonna be beating ya like a egg for   the rest of your life.
VITO	m	  That's what you think?
MOOKIE	m	  That's what I think.
VITO	m	  I don't like to fight.
MOOKIE	m	  Do it this one time and he'll never   touch you again.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  Peoples, my stomach's been grumbling   but help has arrived.  My main man   Mookie has saved the day, straight   from Sal's Famous Pizzeria, down   the block.  Come up to the mike,   Mookie.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells   good.  This is ya Love Daddy   talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin.   Say something, Mookie.
MOOKIE	m	  Mister Se�or Love Daddy, I'd like   to dedicate the next record to my   heart, Tina.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  Alright.  Let me play this record   while I go to work on my chicken   Parmigiana hero with extra cheese   and extra sauce.
VO	m	  I just looove you so much Mister   Se�or Love Daddy.  WE LOVE RADIO,
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  Here ya are.     (he hands Mookie a     twenty-dollar bill)   Keep the change.
MOOKIE	m	  That's right on time.  This is my   friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  Tell ya father he makes the best   heros in Brooklyn.
VITO	m	  I'll do that.
MOOKIE	m	  We're outta here.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  Thanks for stopping by.  WE LOVE   Radio, 108 FM.
STEVIE	m	  You got it, bro.
MOOKIE	m	  You the man.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  You the man.
MOOKIE	m	  No, you the man.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  No.  I'm just a struggling Black   man trying to keep my dick hard in   a cruel and harsh world.
MOOKIE	m	  Vito is down.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Yo!
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Yo!
CLIFTON	m	  Yes?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  You almost knocked me down.  The   word is "excuse me."
CLIFTON	m	  Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Not only did you knock me down, you   stepped on my new white Air Jordans   that I just bought and that's all   you can say, "Excuse me?"
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  I'll fuck you up quick two times.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Who told you to step on my sneakers?   Who told you to walk on my side of   the block?  Who told you to be in   my neighborhood?
CLIFTON	m	  I own a brownstone on this block.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Who told you to buy a brownstone on   my block, in my neighborhood on my   side of the street?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  What do you want to live in a Black   neighborhood for?  Motherfuck   gentrification.
CLIFTON	m	  I'm under the assumption that this   is a free country and one can live   where he pleases.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  A free country?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  I should fuck you up just for that   stupid shit alone.
AHMAD	m	  Your Jordans are dogged.
CEE	?	  You might as well throw 'em out.
PUNCHY	f	  They looked good before he messed   them up.
ELLA	f	  You used to be so fine.
AHMAD	m	  How much did you pay for them?
CEE	?	  A hundred bucks.
AHMAD	m	  A hundred bucks!
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  You're lucky the Black man has a   loving heart.  Next time you see me   coming, cross the street quick.
AHMAD	m	  He's dissing you.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Damn, my brand-new Jordans.  You   should buy me another pair.
CLIFTON	m	  I'm gonna leave now.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  If I wasn't a righteous Black man   you'd be in serious trouble.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Move back to Connecticut.
SAL	m	  I should have Vito go with you all   the time.
PINO	m	  Yeah, no more ninety-minute   deliveries around the corner.
MOOKIE	m	  Pino, I work hard like everybody in   here.
VITO	m	  He's right.
PINO	m	  C'mere.     (Pino smacks his brother)   Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
SAL	m	  That's gonna be the last time you   hit Vito.
MOOKIE	m	  Smack him back.
PINO	m	  What?
MOOKIE	m	  Remember what I said.
PINO	m	  Are you gonna listen to this Mook?   Listen to him tell you to smack me?   Your only brother?
PINO	m	  I didn't think so.
OFFICER PONTE	m	  What a waste.
COCONUT SID	m	  As I was saying before we were so   rudely interrupted by the finest.
ML	f	  What was you saying?
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
ML	f	  Look at that.
COCONUT SID	m	  Look at what?
ML	f	  It's a fucking shame.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  What is?
ML	f	  Sweet Dick Willie.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  That's my name.
ML	f	  Do I have to spell it out?
COCONUT SID	m	  Make it plain.
ML	f	  OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break   it down.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Let it be broke.
ML	f	  Can ya dig it?
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  It's dug.
ML	f	  Look at those Korean motherfuckers   across the street.  I betcha they   haven't been a year off da   motherfucking boat before they   opened up their own place.
COCONUT SID	m	  It's been about a year.
ML	f	  A motherfucking year off the   motherfucking boat and got a good   business in our neighborhood   occupying a building that had been   boarded up for longer than I care   to remember and I've been here a   long time.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  It has been a long time.
COCONUT SID	m	  How long?
ML	f	  Too long!  Too long.  Now for the   life of me, I haven't been able to   figger this out.  Either dem   Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks   are dumb.
COCONUT SID	m	  It's gotta be cuz we're Black.  No   other explanation, nobody don't   want the Black man to be about shit.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Old excuse.
ML	f	  I'll be one happy fool to see us   have our own business right here.   Yes, sir.  I'd be the first in line   to spend the little money I got.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  It's Miller time.  Let me go give   these Koreans s'more business.
ML	f	  It's a motherfucking shame.
COCONUT SID	m	  Ain't that a bitch.
DA MAYOR	m	  Sonny!  Sonny!
DA MAYOR	m	  Doctor, what's your name?
EDDIE	m	  Eddie Lovell.
DA MAYOR	m	  How old are you?
EDDIE	m	  Ten.
DA MAYOR	m	  What makes Sammy run?
EDDIE	m	  My name is Eddie.
DA MAYOR	m	  What makes Sammy run?
EDDIE	m	  I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
DA MAYOR	m	  Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to   the corner store.  How much will it   cost me?
EDDIE	m	  How would I know how much it's   gonna cost if I don't know what I'm   buying?
DA MAYOR	m	  Eddie, you're too smart for your   own britches.  Listen to me.  How   much do you want to run to the   store for Da Mayor?
EDDIE	m	  Fifty cents.
DA MAYOR	m	  You got a deal.
DA MAYOR	m	  Git me a quart of beer, Budweiser,   say it's for your father, if they   bother you.
AHMAD	m	  Who told him he was Da Mayor of   this block?
CEE	?	  He's self-appointed.
ELLA	f	  Leave him alone.
PUNCHY	f	  Shut up.
DA MAYOR	m	  Go on now.  Leave me be.
AHMAD	m	  You walk up and down this block   like you own it.
CEE	?	  Da Mayor.
PUNCHY	f	  You're old.
AHMAD	m	  A old drunk bum.
AHMAD	m	  What do you have to say?
DA MAYOR	m	  What do you know 'bout me?  Y'all   can't even pee straight.  What do   you know?  Until you have stood in   the doorway and heard the hunger of   your five children, unable to do a   damn thing about it, you don't know   shit.  You don't know my pain, you   don't know me.  Don't call me a   bum, don't call me a drunk, you   don't know me, and it's   disrespectful.  I know your parents   raised you better.
ELLA	f	  He told you off.
MOOKIE	m	  I know I haven't seen you in four   days.  I'm a working man.
TINA	f	  I work too, but I still make time.
MOOKIE	m	  Tina, what do you want me to do?
TINA	f	  I want you to spend some time with   me.  I want you to try and make   this relationship work.  If not,   I'd rather not be bothered.
MOOKIE	m	  Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over   there sometime today.
TINA	f	  When?
MOOKIE	m	  Before I get off work.
TINA	f	  Bring some ice cream, I'm burning   up.  Do you love me?
MOOKIE	m	  Do I love you?
SAL	m	  Mookie, get offa da phone.
MOOKIE	m	  Be off in a second.  Tina, I   dedicated a record on Mister Se�or   Love Daddy's show to you.
TINA	f	  Big deal.
SAL	m	  Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call   in?
MOOKIE	m	  Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I   don't know what is.
PINO	m	  You deaf or what?
MOOKIE	m	  Gotta go.  See ya soon.     (he hangs up)   Everybody happy now?
PINO	m	  Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two   large pizzas, pepperoni and   anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop,   Mookie fucking talking on the phone   and people are trying to call in   orders.  He's making us lose   business.
SAL	m	  Mookie, you're fucking up.
PINO	m	  Twenty minutes.     (he hangs up the phone)   How come you niggers are so stupid?
MOOKIE	m	  If ya see a nigger here, kick his   ass.
PINO	m	  Fuck you and stay off the phone.
VITO	m	  Forget it, Mookie.
MOOKIE	m	  Who's your favorite basketball   player?
PINO	m	  Magic Johnson.
MOOKIE	m	  And not Larry Bird?  Who's your   favorite movie star?
PINO	m	  Eddie Murphy.
MOOKIE	m	  Last question: Who's your favorite   rock star?
MOOKIE	m	  Barry Manilow?
MOOKIE	m	  Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
VITO	m	  It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
PINO	m	  Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
MOOKIE	m	  Sounds funny to me.  As much as you   say nigger this and nigger that,   all your favorite people are   "niggers."
PINO	m	  It's different.  Magic, Eddie,   Prince are not niggers, I mean, are   not Black.  I mean, they're Black   but not really Black.  They're more   than Black.  It's different.
MOOKIE	m	  Pino, I think secretly that you   wish you were Black.  That's what I   think.  Vito, what do you say?
PINO	m	  Y'know, I've been listening and   reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't   know that, did you?
MOOKIE	m	  I didn't know you could read.
PINO	m	  Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister   Farrakhan always talks about the   so-called "day" when the Black man   will rise.  "We will one day rule   the earth as we did in our glorious   past."  You really believe that shit?
MOOKIE	m	  It's e-vit-able.
PINO	m	  Keep dreaming.
MOOKIE	m	  Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck   Frank Sinatra, too.
PINO	m	  Well, fuck you, too, and fuck   Michael Jordan.
MOOKIE	m	  Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea,   pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending,   Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano   Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging   motherfucker.
PINO	m	  You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing,   fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin',   monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh,   fast-running, three-hundred-sixty-   degree-basketball-dunking spade   Moulan Yan.
STEVIE	m	  You slant-eyed, me-no-speak-   American, own every fruit and   vegetable stand in New York,   Reverend Moon, Summer Olympics '88,   Korean kick-boxing bastard.
OFFICER LONG	m	  Goya bean-eating, fifteen in a car,   thirty in an apartment, pointed   shoes, red-wearing, Menudo, meda-   meda Puerto Rican cocksucker.
KOREAN CLERK	m	  It's cheap, I got a good price for   you, Mayor Koch, "How I'm doing,"   chocolate-egg-cream-drinking, bagel   and lox, B'nai B'rith asshole.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  Yo!  Hold up!  Time out!  Time out!   Y'all take a chill.  Ya need to   cool that shit out... and that's   the truth, Ruth.
MOOKIE	m	  Sal, can you do me a favor?
SAL	m	  Depends.
MOOKIE	m	  Can you pay me now?
SAL	m	  Can't do.
MOOKIE	m	  Sal, just this once, do me that   solid.
SAL	m	  You know you don't get paid till we   close tonight.  We're still open.
MOOKIE	m	  I would like to get paid now.
SAL	m	  Tonight, when we close.
MOOKIE	m	  Whaddup.  Money?
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  I was going to buy a slice.
MOOKIE	m	  I'll be back after I make this   delivery.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  On the rebound.
MOOKIE	m	  That's the dope.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  I just copped them.  Let me tell   you the story of Right-Hand--Left-   Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
MOOKIE	m	  I'm listening.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  HATE!
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  It was with this hand that Brother   Cain iced his brother.  LOVE!
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  See these fingers, they lead   straight to the soul of man.  The   right hand.  The hand of LOVE!
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  The story of Life is this...
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  STATIC!  One hand is always fighting   the other.  Left Hand Hate is   kicking much ass and it looks like   Right Hand Love is finished.  Hold   up.  Stop the presses!  Love is   coming back, yes, it's Love.  Love   has won.  Left Hand Hate KO'ed by   Love.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  Brother, Mookie, if I love you I   love you, but if I hate you...
MOOKIE	m	  I understand.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  I love you, my brother.
MOOKIE	m	  I love you, Black.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  Two slices.
SAL	m	  No service till you turn dat shit   off.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  Two slices.
PINO	m	  Turn it off.
SAL	m	  Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even   hear myself think.  You are   disturbing me and you are disturbing   my customers.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  Two slices, extra cheese.
SAL	m	  When you come in Sal's Famous   Pizzeria, no music.  No rap, no   music.  Capisce?  Understand?...   This is a place of business.  Extra   cheese is two dollars.
MOOKIE	m	  Thanks.
MOOKIE	m	  Jade.
JADE	f	  I'm in here.
JADE	f	  How come you're not at Sal's?
MOOKIE	m	  I'm working.
JADE	f	  Is this another one of your patented   two-hour lunches?
MOOKIE	m	  I just come home to take a quick   shower.
JADE	f	  Sal's gonna be mad.
MOOKIE	m	  Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I   think you're more concerned with   him than me.
JADE	f	  I think no such a thing.  Sal pays   you, you should work.
MOOKIE	m	  Slavery days are over.  My name   ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't   want to argue, stop pressing me.
JADE	f	  I just don't want you to lose the   one job you've been able to keep,   that's all.  I'm carrying you as it   is.
MOOKIE	m	  Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get   paid.
JADE	f	  Yeah, then ya should take better   care of your responsibilities.
MOOKIE	m	  What responsibilities?
JADE	f	  I didn't stutter.  Take care of   your responsibilities.  Y'know   exactly what I'm talking about.
SAL	m	  I'm beat.
PINO	m	  Pop, I think we should sell this   place, get outta here while we're   still ahead...and alive.
SAL	m	  Since when do you know what's best   for us?
PINO	m	  Couldn't we sell this and open up a   new one in our own neighborhood?
SAL	m	  Too many pizzerias already there.
PINO	m	  Then we could try something else.
SAL	m	  We don't know nuthin' else.
PINO	m	  I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad   neighborhood.  I don't like being   around them, they're animals.
VITO	m	  Some are OK.
PINO	m	  My friends laugh at me all the   time, laugh right in my face, tell   me go feed the Moulies.
SAL	m	  Do your friends put money in your   pocket?  Pay your rent?  Food on ya   plate?
SAL	m	  I didn't think so.
PINO	m	  Pop, what else can I say?  I don't   wanna be here, they don't want us   here.  We should stay in our own   neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
SAL	m	  So what if this is a Black   neighborhood, so what if we're a   minority.  I've never had no   trouble with dese people, don't   want none either, so don't start   none.  This is America.  Sal's   Famous Pizzeria is here for good.   You think you know it all?  Well,   you don't.  I'm your father, you   better remember that.
JADE	f	  Hurry up and get dressed.
MOOKIE	m	  I'm coming.
JADE	f	  I'm going with you.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Da Mayor, we need your leadership.
DA MAYOR	m	  Doctor, what are you talkin' bout?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's   Famous Pizzeria.
DA MAYOR	m	  Keep walkin', Doctor.  I don't want   to hear none of your foolishness.
ML	f	  No!
COCONUT SID	m	  No!
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Hell no!  Goddamnit.  Sal ain't   never done me no harm.  You either.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Would you like to sign a petition   to boycott Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  I'll do it without your help.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Sal, we're gonna boycott ya fat ass.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  It's so nice to see a family   hanging out together.
MOOKIE	m	  We're not hanging out.  I'm being   escorted back to work.
JADE	f	  That's not even true.  I just want   a slice.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Jade, you don't know this, but I'm   organizing a boycott of Sal's   Famous Pizzeria.
JADE	f	  What did he do this time?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Y'know all those pictures he has   hanging on the Wall of Fame?
JADE	f	  So?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Have you noticed something about   them?
JADE	f	  No.
MOOKIE	m	    (interjects)   Yo, I'm gone.
JADE	f	  I'll see ya there.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Peace.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Every single one of those pictures   is somebody Italian.
JADE	f	  And?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  And I--we--want some Black people up.
JADE	f	  Did you ask Sal?
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want   nobody in there, nobody spending   good money in Sal's.  He should get   no mo' money from the community   till he puts some Black faces up on   that motherfucking wall.
JADE	f	  Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be   disrespectful, but you can really   direct your energies in a more   useful way.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  So, in other words, you are not down.
JADE	f	  I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  Jade, I still love you.
JADE	f	  I still love you too.
SAL	m	  Mookie, you are pushing it.  You're   really pushing it.  I'm not paying   you good money to fucking jerk me   around.
SAL	m	  You're gonna be in the street with   the rest of your homeboys.
PINO	m	  'Bout time, Pop.
SAL	m	  Jade, we've been wondering when ya   would pay us a visit.
JADE	f	  Hi, Sal, Pino, Vito.
JADE	f	  What's happening, Jade?
JADE	f	  Nuthin' really.  How are you   treating my brother?
SAL	m	  The Mook?  Great.  Mookie's a good   kid.
PINO	m	  Pop, stop lying.
SAL	m	  Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
JADE	f	  What's good?
SAL	m	  Everything, but for you I'm gonna   make up something special.  Take a   seat.  There, that's a clean table.
JADE	f	  You still letting Pino push you   around?
VITO	m	  Who told you that?  He doesn't push   me, who told you, Mookie tell you   that?  I hold my own.
JADE	f	  Forget about it, Vito.  Forget I   even brought it up.
VITO	m	  Pino picks on me, but I don't let   him push me around.  Mookie tell   you that?
JADE	f	  Alright already.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  Twenty "D" Duracells.
KOREAN CLERK	m	  Twenty "C" Duracells.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  D, not C.
KOREAN CLERK	m	  C Duracell.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  D!  D!  D!  You dumb motherfucker.   Learn how to speak English first.  D.
KOREAN CLERK	m	  How many you say?
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
KOREAN CLERK	m	  Motherfucker you.
RADIO RAHEEM	m	  Motherfucker you.  You're alright.   You're alright.  Just gimme my   twenty Duracells, please.
DA MAYOR	m	  I'd thought you might like these...   I guess not.
DA MAYOR	m	  Ain't nuthin' like the smell of   fresh flowers.  Don't you agree,   Miss Mother Sister?
DA MAYOR	m	  Summertime, all ya can smell is the   garbage.  Stink overpowers   everything, especially soft sweet   smells like flowers.
DA MAYOR	m	  If you don't mind, I'm gonna set   right here, catch a breeze or two,   then be on my way.
DA MAYOR	m	  Thank the Lord, the sun is going   down, it's hot as blazes.  Yes Jesus.
ML	f	  What can you say?
COCONUT SID	m	  I don't know how he does it.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  ML?
ML	f	  What?
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  ML, hold this for me.
ML	f	  That's OK.  At least my moms didn't   name me Sweet Dick Willie.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
ML	f	  Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  I didn't say nobody, I said you.
ML	f	  Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like   that.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Yes you did.
COCONUT SID	m	  Squash it.
ML	f	  I just wanted to know who named ya   Sweet Dick Willie?
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  It's just a name.
COCONUT SID	m	  And what does ML stand for?
ML	f	  ML stands for ML.  That's it.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now   you know how I got that name.
ML	f	  Negroes kill me, always holdin'   onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
COCONUT SID	m	  I don't know 'bout you, but it's   too hot to fuck.
SWEET DICK WILLIE	f	  Never too hot, never too cold for   fucking.
EDDIE	m	  Ice cream.  Ice cream.
DA MAYOR	m	  Doctor, you know better to run out   in the street... Stop crying, son.
DA MAYOR	m	  Doctor, there's nothing to cry   about.  You're OK.
LOUISE	f	  What's wrong?
EDDIE	m	  Mayor knocked me down.
LOUISE	f	  You should be ashamed of yourself.
DA MAYOR	m	  Ma'am, the boy is just scared to   death.  What actually happened is   that I was minding my business when   I saw your son about to be run over.   I ran into the street to save him   and I had to knock him down to keep   the both of us from getting hit.
LOUISE	f	  Eddie, is that the truth?
LOUISE	f	  Eddie, you hear me talkin' to you?
LOUISE	f	  I'm talkin' to you, boy.
DA MAYOR	m	  Miss, the boy is fine.
LOUISE	f	  What I tell you 'bout lying?
LOUISE	f	  What did I tell you 'bout playing   in the street?
EDDIE	m	  Mommy!  Mommy!  I'm sorry.  I'm   sorry.
LOUISE	f	  Get upstairs now.
LOUISE	f	  And when your father comes home,   he's gonna wear ya little narrow   behind out too.
DA MAYOR	m	  You didn't have to hit your son;   he's scared to death as it was.
LOUISE	f	  I appreciate ya helping my Eddie.   I truly do, but I'll have nobody   question how I raise him, not even   his Daddy.
DA MAYOR	m	  You're right.
JADE	f	  Sal, that was delicious.
SAL	m	  Anytime.
JADE	f	  Thanks.
MOOKIE	m	  I'll see you out.
JADE	f	  See ya around.
SAL	m	  Don't wait too long to come back.
MOOKIE	m	  Jade, I don't want you coming in   here no mo'.
JADE	f	  Stop tripping.
MOOKIE	m	  No, you're tripping.  Don't come in   Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
JADE	f	  What are you so worked up about?
MOOKIE	m	  Over Sal, the way he talks and the   way he looks at you.
JADE	f	  He's just being nice.
MOOKIE	m	  Nice!
JADE	f	  He's completely innocent.
MOOKIE	m	  Innocent!
JADE	f	  I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
MOOKIE	m	  You should see the way he looks at   you.  All Sal wants to do is hide   the salami.
JADE	f	  You are too crude.
MOOKIE	m	  I might be, but you're not welcome   here.
JADE	f	  Stop trying to play big brother.   I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta   nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay   your rent and you're gonna tell me   what to do.  Come off it.
MOOKIE	m	  One has nuthin' to do with the other.
JADE	f	  Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your   little 250 dollars a week plus   tips...
MOOKIE	m	  I'm getting paid...
JADE	f	  ...peanuts.
MOOKIE	m	  Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
JADE	f	  I truly hope so.  I'm tired of   supporting a grown man.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  As the evening slowly falls upon us   living here in Brooklyn, New York,   this is ya Love Daddy rappin' to   you.  Right now we're gonna open up   the Love Lines.  Hello, you're on   Love Daddy's Love Line.  No names,   please.  Let's keep it anonymous.
FEMALE VOICE #1	f	  Hi, Mister Se�or Love Daddy.  I'd   kiss your feet every morning,   that's how much I love you.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  How nice of you.
FEMALE VOICE #2	f	  I think you have the sexiest voice   in the world.  All you have to do   is talk.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  Love Line, you're on.
FEMALE VOICE #3	f	  You give me fever.     (she moans)
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  She's feeling it.
FEMALE VOICE #4	f	  Love Daddy, I'd work in Mickey D's   24, 7, and 365 just to call you my   own.  Give you all my money, honey.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  That was the last call for tonight   on Mister Se�or Love Daddy's Love   Line.  I love you.  You I love.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Mister Mayor, I saw what you did.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  That was a foolish act, but it was   brave.  That chile owes you his life.
DA MAYOR	m	  I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I   saw what was about to happen and I   reacted, didn't even think.  If I   did, I might not have done it in   second thought.  Da Mayor is an old   man, haven't run that fast in years.
DA MAYOR	m	  I went from first to home on a bunt   single, scored the winning run, the   bottom of the ninth, two out,   August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.     (he is warming up now)   Maybe I should be heroic more often.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get   happy.  This changes nothing   between you and me.  You did a good   thing and Mother Sister wanted to   thank you for it.
DA MAYOR	m	  I thank you.
MOTHER SISTER	f	  You're welcome.
MOOKIE	m	  Sal, I don't care if you fire me   this exact minute, leave my sister   alone.
SAL	m	  Mookie, I don't know what you're   talking about, plus I don't want to   hear it.
MOOKIE	m	  Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade   alone.
SAL	m	  Here, you gotta delivery.
MOOKIE	m	  Is this the right name and address?
SAL	m	  Yeah, do you know 'em?
MOOKIE	m	  No, just checking.
MOOKIE	m	  Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
TINA	f	  What took you so long?  Is it hot?
MOOKIE	m	  Hot.  Hot.
TINA	f	  Come in then.
MOOKIE	m	  Tina, you are too slick.
TINA	f	  How else was I going to get you   here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
MOOKIE	m	  I've been working hard, getting paid.
TINA	f	  Where's the ice cream?  The H�agen-   Dazs butter pecan?
MOOKIE	m	  Shit!  I forgot.
TINA	f	  Your memory is really getting bad.
MOOKIE	m	  I just forgot.
TINA	f	  And I really wanted some ice cream   too.
MOOKIE	m	  I can run out and get it.
TINA	f	  No!  No!  You won't come back either.
MOOKIE	m	  I can't be staying long anyway.
TINA	f	  How long then?
MOOKIE	m	  Long enough for us to do the nasty.
TINA	f	  That's out.  No!  It's too hot!   You think I'm gonna let you get   some, put on your clothes, then run   outta here and never see you again   in who knows when?
MOOKIE	m	  A quickie is good every once in a   blue moon.
TINA	f	  You a blue-moon fool.
MOOKIE	m	  Then we'll do something else.
TINA	f	  What else?
MOOKIE	m	  Trust me.
TINA	f	  Trust you?  Because of trusting you   we have a son.  Remember your son?
MOOKIE	m	  Trust me.
MOOKIE	m	  I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
TINA	f	  Mookie, I told you already it's too   fucking hot to make love.
MOOKIE	m	  Why you gotta curse?
TINA	f	  I'm sorry, but no rawness is   jumping off tonight.
MOOKIE	m	  No rawness.
MOOKIE	m	  Tina, you're sweating.
TINA	f	  Of course I'm sweating.  I'm   burning up.  It's hot, moron, only   a hundred degrees in here.
MOOKIE	m	  Lie down, please.
MOOKIE	m	  Hello, Mrs. Rampolla.
TINA	f	  It's cold.
MOOKIE	m	  It's 'pose to be cold.
TINA	f	  Later for you.
MOOKIE	m	  Meda.  Meda.
TINA	f	  What?
MOOKIE	m	  Tina, you don't have a forehead,   you got a eight-head.
MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDY	m	  Yes, children, this is the Cool Out   Corner.  We're slowing it down for   all the lovers in the house.  I'll   be giving you all the help you   need, musically, that is.
MOOKIE	m	  Thank God for thighs.
MOOKIE	m	  Thank God for buttocks.
MOOKIE	m	  Thank God for the right nipple...   Thank God for the left nipple...
TINA	f	  Feels good.
MOOKIE	m	  Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better   than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice   cream?
MOOKIE	m	  I'll be back tonight.
SAL	m	  It's almost ready.
OFFICER LONG	m	  What time you closing tonight?
SAL	m	  Ten.
SAL	m	  Here you go.
OFFICER PONTE	m	  What do we owe you?
SAL	m	  Nine-fifty.
OFFICER PONTE	m	  Here.
SAL	m	  Thanks.  Enjoy.
OFFICER LONG	m	  Vito, Pino, see ya later.
MOOKIE	m	  Sal, if you want me to deliver any   faster, get me a jet rocket or   something, cuz I can't run with   pizzas, all the cheese ends up on   one side and shit.
SAL	m	  I didn't say nuthin'.  You must   have a guilty conscience.  What are   you guilty of?
MOOKIE	m	  I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
SAL	m	  You must be guilty of something or   you would have never come in saying   the things you said.
MOOKIE	m	  C'mon, Sal.
SAL	m	  Where we goin'?
PINO	m	  Vito, I want you to listen to me.   I'm your brother.  I may smack you   around once in awhile, boss you   around, but I'm still your brother.
VITO	m	  I know this.
PINO	m	  I love you.
VITO	m	  I'm listening.
PINO	m	  Good.  I want you to listen.
VITO	m	  Jesus Christ on the cross, I said   I'm listening.
PINO	m	  Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook   too much.  So does Pop.
VITO	m	  Mookie's OK.
PINO	m	  You listening to me?
VITO	m	  Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm   listening ten fucking times already.
PINO	m	  Mookie is not to be trusted.  No   Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The   first time you turn your back,   boom, a knife right here.     (Pino gestures)   In the back.
VITO	m	  How do you know this?
PINO	m	  I know.
VITO	m	  You really think so?
PINO	m	  I know so.  He, them, they're not   to be trusted.
VITO	m	  So what do you want me to do?
PINO	m	  Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned   already, so we have to look out for   him.
VITO	m	  I like Mookie a lot.
PINO	m	  And that's exactly what I'm talkin'   'bout.
SAL	m	  Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
PINO	m	  Be right there, Pop.  Listen to   what I said.
VITO	m	  You don't listen to me, never have.   Just run your big fucking mouth   always playing big brother.  You   don't listen, but Mookie does.
BUGGIN' OUT	m	  How you be?
