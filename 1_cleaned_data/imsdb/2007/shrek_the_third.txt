SHREK	m	Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
FIONA	f	And, uh... maybe even the pitter- patter of little feet on the floor...?
SHREK	m	That's right. The swamp rats will be spawning.
FIONA	f	Uh, no... you know, what I was thinking of is a little bit bigger than a swamp rat.
SHREK	m	Donkey?

SHREK	m	Yeah?
FIONA	f	They were little ogre feet? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 14.
SHREK	m	Oh.
SHREK	m	Honey? Let's try and be rational about this. Have you seen a baby lately? They just eat and poop and they cry and then they cry when they poop and they poop when they cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby. They extra cry and they extra poop.
FIONA	f	Shrek.
FIONA	f	Don't you ever think about having a family?

DONKEY	m	Put your hat back on, fool.
KING HAROLD	m	Shrek, please come hither.
SHREK	m	Yeah, Dad?
KING HAROLD	m	This Kingdom needs a new king. You and Fiona are next in line for the throne.
SHREK	m	Ooo. Next in line. Now you see Dad, that's why people love you. Even on your deathbed you're still making jokes.
SHREK	m	Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King? I don't think that's such a good idea. There's got to be somebody else. Anybody?
KING HAROLD	m	Aside from you there is only one remaining heir.

PRINCE CHARMING	m	Where's Doris, taking the night off? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 20.
MABEL	f	She's not welcome here and neither are you.
MABEL	f	What do you want, Charming?
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Oh not much, just a chance at redemption... And a Fuzzy Navel.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	We're not your friends.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Ahh!
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	You don't belong here.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	You're right; oh, I mean you're absolutely right, but I mean, do any of us?
CYCLOPS	m	Do a number on his face! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 21.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	No, no, wait, wait, wait! We are more alike than you think.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Wicked Witch. The Seven Dwarves saved Snow White and then what happened?
EVIL QUEEN	m	Oh, what's it to you?
PRINCE CHARMING	m	They left you the un-fairest of them all. And now here you are, hustling pool to get your next meal. How does that feel?
EVIL QUEEN	m	Pretty unfair.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	And you? Your star puppet abandons the show to go and find his father.
PUPPET MASTER	m	I hate that little wooden puppet.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	And Hook...
PRINCE CHARMING	m	And you! Frumpypigskin.

PRINCE CHARMING	m	Where's that first-born you were promised, hey? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 22.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Mabel, remember how you couldn't get your little fat foot into that tiny glass slipper?
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Cinderella is in Far Far Away right now, eating Bon Bons, cavorting with every little last Fairy-tale Creature that has ever done you wrong.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Once upon a time, someone decided that we were the losers. But there are two sides to every story. And our side has not been told.

DONKEY	m	I know, I know... I don't want to leave you either baby, but you know how Shrek is. The dude's lost without me.
DONKEY	m	But don't worry. I'll send you airmail kisses everyday!
DONKEY	m	Alright, be strong babies! Be strong. Now, Coco, Peanut, you listen to Mama, alright? And Bananas, no more roastin' marshmallows on your sister's head. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 24.
DONKEY	m	Ah, that's my special boy. Oh, come over here, all of you. Give your Daddy a big hug!
FIONA	f	Shrek, maybe you should just stay and be King.
SHREK	m	Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could ever run a kingdom. That's why your cousin Arthur's the perfect choice.
FIONA	f	It's not that. No. It's, you see...
SHREK	m	And if he gives me any trouble, I've always got persuasion and reason. (holds up his right fist) Here's persuasion, (holds up his left fist) and here's reason.

DONKEY	m	Shrek. Shrek, are you okay?
SHREK	m	Oh... I can't believe I'm going to be a father.
SHREK	m	How did this happen?
PUSS	f	Allow me to explain. You see, when a man has certain feelings for a woman, a powerful urge sweeps over him...
SHREK	m	I know how it happened. I just can't believe it.
DONKEY	m	How does it happen?
DONKEY	m	And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 31.
DONKEY	m	Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
DONKEY	m	"When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then, Dad-"
SHREK	m	Donkey, can you just cut to the part where you're supposed to make me feel better?
PUSS	f	You know I love Fiona, Boss. Right? But what I'm talking about here is you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice- cold pitcher of mojitos, and two weeks of nothing but fishing.
DONKEY	m	Man, don't you listen to him. Having a baby is not going to ruin your life.
SHREK	m	It's not my life I'm worried about ruining. It's the kid's.
SHREK	m	I mean...when have you ever heard the phrase "as sweet as an...ogre" or "as nurturing as...an ogre" Or how `bout..."you're gonna' love my dad...he's a real ogre." Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 32.
DONKEY	m	Okay, okay I get it! Nobody said it was going to be easy. But at least you got us to help you out.

FEMALE STUDENT #1	f	Ahhhhh!
VAN STUDENT	m	(cough, cough) For lo bro, don't burn all my frankincense and myrrh. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 34.
DONKEY	m	I'm already starting to feel nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies!
PUSS	f	But how did you receive the wedgies when you are clearly not the wearer of the underpants?
DONKEY	m	Let's just say some things are better left unsaid and leave it at that.
GUINEVERRE	?	So then I was all like "I'd rather get the black plague and lock myself in an iron maiden than go out with you."
TIFFANY	f	Eh, totally.
SHREK	m	Pardon me...
GUINEVERRE	?	Eh! Totally ew-th!
TIFFANY	f	Yeah, totally!

PUSS	f	That information is on a need to know basis.
DONKEY	m	It's top secret, hushity hush.
KNIGHT	m	Now gentlemen let's away... to the showers!
JOCKS	m	Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 37.
SHREK	m	Greetings your majesty. This is your lucky day.
KNIGHT	m	So what for like are you supposed to be? Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun or something?
SHREK	m	Oh, ho, ho, ho. Giant mutant leprechaun... You made a funny.
KNIGHT	m	Unhand me, monster!
SHREK	m	Stop squirming, Arthur.

LANCELOT	m	That dork over there is Arthur!
SHREK	m	Hey!
LANCELOT	m	Aaah. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 38.
GUINEVERRE	?	Ahem! This is like totally embarrassing, but my friend Tiffany thinkest thou vex her so soothly...
GUINEVERRE	?	And she thought perchance thou would wanna ask her to the Homecoming Dance or something...
SHREK	m	Uh, excuse me?
GUINEVERRE	?	It's like whatever. She's just totally into college guys and mythical creatures and stuff.
SHREK	m	Oh Arthur! Come out, come out wherever you are...
DONKEY	m	Yeah, you better run, you little punk no good-niks, `cause the days of "Little Donkey Dumpy Drawers" are over!
HALL MONITOR	m	Hold it... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 39.
COSTUME STUDENT 1	m	We're here for the Mascot Contest.
COSTUME STUDENT 2	m	Grrrrr!
SHREK	m	(pleased with himself) We're here for the Mascot Contest too.
HALL MONITOR	m	This is a costume?
SHREK	m	Aaaiyyyy... worked on it all night long!
HALL MONITOR	m	Looks pretty real to me.
PUSS	f	If it were real could I do this?
DONKEY	m	Or this?
SHREK	m	He's right! If it were real that would have been agonizingly painful!
DONKEY	m	Now watch this.... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 40.
GRITTED TEETH)	?	That's quite enough boys.
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY	m	Thank you to Professor Primbottom for his invigorating lecture on how to just say "nay".
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY	m	And now, without further ado, let's give a warm Worcestershire-hoozah to the winner of our "New Mascot" contest... the--
SHREK	m	That's right. I'm the new mascot. So let's really try and beat the other guys... at whatever it is they're doing.
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY	m	This is indeed all a bit unorthodox.
SHREK	m	Now, where can I find Arthur Pendragon? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 41.
LANCELOT	m	Classic.
DONKEY	m	You should be ashamed of yourself.
LANCELOT	m	I didn't do it. They did.
ARTIE	m	Please don't eat me.
STUDENTS	m	Eat him! Eat him!
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY	m	Eat him!
SHREK	m	I'm not here to eat him.
STUDENTS	m	AWWW.
SHREK	m	It's time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies. You're the new King of Far Far Away.
ARTIE	m	What? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 42.

SHREK	m	Absolutely. Now clean out your locker, kid. You've got a kingdom to run.
ARTIE	m	So wait, I'm really the only heir?
SHREK	m	The one and only.
ARTIE	m	Give me just a second.
ARTIE	m	My good people, I think there's a lesson here for all of us. Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think, hey, maybe this guy has feelings. Maybe I should cut him some slack. Because maybe, just maybe... this guy's gonna turn out to be, uh...I dunno...a King! And maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him -- that's right, I'm looking at you, jousting team. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 43.

SNOW WHITE	m	The feeding.
NANNY DWARF	f	The burping.
FIONA	f	So what are Shrek and I supposed to do?

FIONA	f	Gee thanks Rapunzel, and what's that supposed to mean?
RAPUNZEL	f	Oh, come on now, Fiona. You know what happens. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 47.
SLEEPING BEAUTY	f	Huh? You're tired all the time...

GINGERBREAD MAN	m	Stretch marks!
RAPUNZEL	f	Say goodbye to romance.
DRAGON	m	Yort.
FIONA	f	Um sorry... but how many of you have kids?
DORIS	f	She's right. A baby is only gonna strengthen the love that Shrek and Fiona have. How did Shrek react when you told him? Tell me!
FIONA	f	Well, when he first found out...Shrek said-
DRAGON	m	Roarrr! Onward my new friends. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 48.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Gaa! Gulp! Ahhhh!

PRINCE CHARMING	m	You! You can't lie. So tell me puppet... Where is Shrek?!
PINOCCHIO	m	Well, I don't know where he's not.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	You're telling me you don't know where Shrek is?
PINOCCHIO	m	It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume that I couldn't exactly not say that is or isn't almost partially incorrect.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	So you do know where he is!
PINOCCHIO	m	On the contrary, I'm possibly more or less, not definitely rejecting the idea, that in no way, with any amount of uncertainty that...
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Stop it.
PINOCCHIO	m	...I undeniably do or do not know where he shouldn't probably be. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 54.
PINOCCHIO	m	If that indeed wasn't where he isn't. Even if he wasn't not where I knew he was could mean that I wouldn't completely not know where he wasn't.
PIG #1	m	Oh, enough! Shrek went off to bring back the next heir! Oh!
PRINCE CHARMING	m	He's bringing back the next heir?
PINOCCHIO	m	No!
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Hook! Get rid of this new "King."
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	Right!
PRINCE CHARMING	m	But bring Shrek to me. I have something special in mind for him.
PINOCCHIO	m	He'll never fall for your tricks!
WOLF	m	Oh boy.
ARTIE	m	I can't believe it... me a King? I...I mean I knew I came from royalty and all, but I just figured everyone forgot about me.
SHREK	m	Oh no, in fact, the King asked for you personally.
ARTIE	m	Really? Wow! Look, I know it's not all gonna be fun and games.
SHREK	m	It really is all fun and games, actually. Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two. By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle.
ARTIE	m	Boat with the bottle? Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.
SHREK	m	Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks.
ARTIE	m	Whoa!! This is gonna be huge. Parties, princesses, castles... princesses.
DONKEY	m	It's gonna be great, Artie. You'll be living in the lap of luxury. They got the finest chefs around waiting for you to place your order.
PUSS	f	And fortunately you'll have the royal food tasters. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 56.
)	?	Oh yeah? What do they do?
PUSS	f	They taste the food before the King eats, to make sure it's not poisoned.
ARTIE	m	Poisoned?
SHREK	m	Or too salty!
DONKEY	m	Don't worry about it. You'll be safe and sound with the help of your body guards.
ARTIE	m	Body guards?
PUSS	f	All of them, willing at a moment's notice to lay down their own lives out of devotion to you.
ARTIE	m	Really?
PUSS	f	Si, and the whole kingdom will look to you for wisdom and guidance.
DONKEY	m	Just make sure they don't die of famine.
PUSS	f	Or plague.
DONKEY	m	Oh, plague is bad. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 57.
PUSS	f	The coughing, the groaning, the festering sores.
SHREK	m	Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are one funny kitty cat.
PUSS	f	What did I say?
SHREK	m	We don't want Artie here getting the wrong idea.
SHREK	m	Uh, Artie?
ALL	m	Whoa!
SHIP CAPTAIN	m	Whoa! Oh, there goes my hip.
SHREK	m	Artie!
SHREK	m	What are you doing?!
ARTIE	m	What does it look like?! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 58.
SHREK	m	This really isn't up to you!
ARTIE	m	But I don't know anything about being King!
SHREK	m	You'll learn on the job!
DONKEY	m	Whoaaa!
ARTIE	m	Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm going back!
SHREK	m	Back to what? Being a loser?!
SHREK	m	Now look what you did!
ARTIE	m	Look what I did? Who's holding the wheel chief?
SHOUTING)	?	Shrek! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 59.
PUSS	f	How humiliating...
SHREK	m	Oh, nice going, Your Highness.
ARTIE	m	Oh, so now it's "Your highness?" What happened to "loser?" Huh?
SHREK	m	Hey, if you think this is getting you out of anything, well it isn't. We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another, and you're gonna be a father!
ARTIE	m	What?
DONKEY	m	(clearing his throat) A-hem. You just said father...
SHREK	m	You're... I said king. You're gonna be King!
ARTIE	m	"You're gonna be King!" Yeah right. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 60.
SHREK	m	Where do you think you're going?
ARTIE	m	Far Far Away... from you!
SHREK	m	You get back here young man and I mean it!
PUSS	f	Uh boss, I don't think he's coming back and maybe it's for the best. He is not exactly king material.
DONKEY	m	When were you planning on telling him that you were really supposed to be King?
SHREK	m	Oh c'mon, now why would I do that? Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me.
DONKEY	m	Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then you're gonna have to change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with this kid.
SHREK	m	You're right, Donkey.
SHREK	m	What about this? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 61.
DONKEY	m	Shrek!
SHREK	m	Oh c'mon. It's just a joke. Still...
SHREK	m	Listen Artie...
SHREK	m	If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope, I feel you dude. I mean, I'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof or whatever, but what I am screaming is, yo, check out this kazing thazing bazaby.
SHREK	m	I mean, if it doesn't groove or what I'm saying ain't straight trippin', just say, oh no you didn't, you know, you're gettin' on my last nerve. And then I'll know it's... then I'll know it's whack-- Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 62.
ARTIE	m	SOMEBODY HELP! I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED
SHREK	m	Artie! Wait!
ARTIE	m	C'mon! C'mon! Help! Help! Hello?
DONKEY	m	AHHHH!
MERLIN	m	I knew I should of gotten that warranty! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 63.
MERLIN	m	AHH! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
ARTIE	m	Mr. Merlin?
SHREK	m	You know this guy?
ARTIE	m	Yeah. He was the school's magic teacher until he had his nervous breakdown.
MERLIN	m	Uh, technically I was merely a victim of a level three fatigue, and at the request of my therapist and the school authorities, I have retired to the tranquility of nature to discover my divine purpose.
MERLIN	m	Now, can I interest anyone in a snack or beverage?
SHREK	m	Uh, no.
MERLIN	m	Sure you don't wanna try my famous rock au-gratin?
MERLIN	m	It's organic!
SHREK	m	Oh, thanks, I just ate a boulder on the way in. What we need are directions back to Far Far Away.
ARTIE	m	What's with the "we"? Who said I was going with you?
SHREK	m	Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of people counting on you so don't try and weasel out of it.
ARTIE	m	If it's such a great job, why don't you do it?
SHREK	m	Understand this kid, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out!
ARTIE	m	Oh, so that was your "Mr. Nice Guy?"
SHREK	m	I know, and I'm gonna miss him.
ARTIE	m	You know what? Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone?
SHREK	m	Oh, is that some kind of crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away before I kick it there. Now which way am I kicking?
MERLIN	m	Oh, I could tell you. But since you're in the midst of self- destructive rage spiral it would be karmic-ly irresponsible.
SHREK	m	Self-destructive ra... Look, are you gonna help us or not? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 65.
MERLIN	m	Most definitely, but only after you take the journey to your soul.
SHREK	m	Yeah, I don't think so.
MERLIN	m	Look pal, it's either that or some primal scream therapy. Ahhhhhhhhhh!
SHREK	m	Alright, alright... journey to the soul...
MERLIN	m	Now all of you, look into the "Fire of Truth" and tell me what you see! Yah! Ha! (Wild war cry) Woo-looo-looo-looo!
DONKEY	m	Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls.
MERLIN	m	Okay. Monster, go for it.
SHREK	m	I see a rainbow pony. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 66.
MERLIN	m	Excellent work! Now! The boy!
ARTIE	m	This is lame.
ARTIE	m	Ow!
MERLIN	m	You're lame! Now just go for it.
ARTIE	m	Okay. There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest.
MERLIN	m	Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
ARTIE	m	Wait, the dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone?
ARTIE	m	It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!
MERLIN	m	Whew, proper head case you are, aren't you? Really messed up. Whoa. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 67.
ARTIE	m	Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what?
SHREK	m	Look Artie...um-
MERLIN	m	(loud, over the music) Just thought I might help set the mood! Y'know for your big heart to heart chat!
SHREK	m	I know what it's like to not feel ready for something.
SHREK	m	Even ogres get scared...you know, once in a while.
ARTIE	m	I know you want me to be king, but I can't. I'm not cut out for it and I never will be, alright?
ARTIE	m	Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble. He dumped me at that school the first chance he got and I never heard from him again. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 68.
SHREK	m	My dad wasn't really the fatherly type either.
ARTIE	m	Well, I doubt he was worse than mine.
SHREK	m	Oh yeah? My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me.
SHREK	m	Now, I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.
ARTIE	m	Okay... I guess that's... pretty bad.
SHREK	m	You know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that I was a monster. And for a long time, I believed them.
SHREK	m	But after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are.
ARTIE	m	You know, you're okay, Shrek.
ARTIE	m	You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 69.
SHREK	m	Thanks Artie.
ARTIE	m	The soap's because you stink. Really bad.
SHREK	m	Yeah. I got that.
CINDERELLA	f	Oh this place is filthy. I feel like a hobo.
SNOW WHITE	m	I'm sorry but this just isn't working for me.
SLEEPING BEAUTY	f	Everything's always about you, isn't it? It's not like your attitude is helping, Snow.
SNOW WHITE	m	Well maybe it just bothers you that I was voted fairest in the land.
RAPUNZEL	f	You mean in that rigged election?
SNOW WHITE	m	Oh, give me a break. (gesturing toward hair) Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 70. SNOW WHITE (cont'd) "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy golden extensions!"
QUEEN	f	Ladies, let go of your petty complaints and let's work together.
SNOW WHITE	m	So I guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly in this stink hole until we rot.
FIONA	f	No, we're gonna get inside and find out what Charming's up to.
DORIS	f	I know he's a jerk and everything, but I gotta admit, that Charming makes me hotter than July.
SLEEPING BEAUTY	f	Ew!
RAPUNZEL	f	Ugh.
FIONA	f	That's it!
RAPUNZEL	f	Come on, this way!
FIONA	f	Rapunzel. Wait!
FIONA	f	Charming, let go of her.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	But why would I want to do that?
RAPUNZEL	f	Grrrr!
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Woof!
FIONA	f	What?
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Say hello ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away.
CINDERELLA	f	Yaaaaaaaaay!
FIONA	f	Rapunzel, how could you?
RAPUNZEL	f	Jealous much? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 72.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Soon you'll be back where you started... scrubbing floors or locked away in towers; that is, if I let you last the week.
RAPUNZEL	f	But Pooky, you promised you wouldn't hurt them!
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Not here, "kitten whiskers." Daddy will discuss it later. Now forgive us, we have a show to put on.
FIONA	f	Shrek will be back soon Charming, and you'll be sorry.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Sorry? Don't you realize --once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away he's doomed?
ARTIE	m	Ow!
DONKEY	m	Ahhh!
DONKEY	m	Look out! They've got a piano!
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	Kill `em all. Except the fat one.
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	King Charming has something special in mind for you, ogre.
SHREK	m	"King Charming?"
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	Attack!
PIRATES	m	AAAARGH!
SHREK	m	Artie, Duck! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 74.
DONKEY	m	Ahhh!
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	Ha-ha! Argh!
PIRATES	m	Argh! Argh!
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	Ready the plank!
DONKEY	m	Shrek!
ARTIE	m	Help! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 75.
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	Ya cowards!
SHREK	m	What has Charming done with Fiona?
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	She's gonna get what's coming to her.
CAPTAIN HOOK	m	Ahhh. And there ain't nothing you can do to stop him!
PUSS	f	We've got to save her!
DONKEY	m	But she's so far far away!
SHREK	m	Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 76.
ARTIE	m	No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've got an idea.
MERLIN	m	I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz, buzz...
ARTIE	m	Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to get them...I mean, us, back to Far Far Away.
MERLIN	m	Forget it. I don't have that kind of magic in me anymore, kid. How about a hug instead? Hmm? That's the best kind of magic.
ARTIE	m	Mr. Merlin please. I know you can
MERLIN	m	I said, forget it!
MERLIN	m	Mumble, grumble, interrupt my healing. Mumble, mumble. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 77.
MERLIN	m	Oh. What, what's with you?
ARTIE	m	It's just so hard. You know? They really need to get back `cause their kingdom's in trouble `cause there's a really bad man and it's just so hard...
MERLIN	m	C'mon, take it easy.
ARTIE	m	No! I don't think you understand! There's a mean person doing mean things to good people-
SHREK	m	Oh, have a heart old man!
ARTIE	m	And they really need your help to get them back! So why won't you help them?
MERLIN	m	Oh.
MERLIN	m	Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my things.
ARTIE	m	Piece of cake. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 78.
SHREK	m	Well, well, well. You want some eggs with that ham?
MERLIN	m	Now, I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects.
DONKEY	m	Side effects!?
MERLIN	m	Don't worry, whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be, it'll wear off eventually... I think.
DONKEY	m	Ah!
MERLIN	m	Oops.
DONKEY	m	Are you sure this is a good idea?
SHREK	m	Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me. Even if his robe doesn't quite cover his-
MERLIN	m	Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy zoom zoom. Let's help our friends get back, um... soon!
MERLIN	m	Woah! It worked!
DONKEY	m	(moan and groan)
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Oh man, I haven't been on a trip like that since college.
SHREK	m	Donkey?
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) What? Is there something in my teeth?
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Huh? What the? Oh no!
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) I've been abracadabra'd into a fancy feasting second rate sidekick.
PUSS	f	(in Donkey's body) At least you don't look like some kind of bloated roadside pi�ata. You really should think about going on a diet! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 80.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Yeah, and you should think about getting yourself a pair of pants! I feel all exposed and nasty.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Oh, so you two think this is funny?
ARTIE	m	I'm really sorry guys.
SHREK	m	Don't be! You got us back kid.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. How in the Hans Christian Andersen am I supposed to parade around in these goofy boots?
PUSS	f	Be very careful with those - HEE
PUSS	f	They were made in Madrid by the finest- HEE HAW! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 81.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Oh, you'll learn to control that.
DONKEY	m	Seriously man, you need some comfort inserts or arch supports or something. (noticing Rodeo Drive) Woah!
EVIL WITCHES	m	Woohoo!!
EVIL DWARF #1	m	Hey... watch it I'm walking here... and I'm gonna keep going...
SHREK	m	Pinocchio? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 82.
PINOCCHIO	m	Shrek!
SHREK	m	Pinocchio!
PINOCCHIO	m	Help me!
SHREK	m	What's happened?
PINOCCHIO	m	Charming and the Villains have taken over everything! They attacked us but Fiona and the Princesses got away. And now she's-
SHREK	m	She's what?! She's what!?
SHREK	m	(turns to Puss in Donkey's
BODY)	?	Puss, loan me five bucks!
DONKEY	m	C'mon Puss, you heard the man, help a brother out.
PUSS	f	(in Donkey's body) Do you see any pockets on me?
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Hold on a second. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 83.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Aha!
PUSS	f	(in Donkey's body) I had no idea ...really ...I swear.

SHREK	m	Shrek's final performance.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us you were in a play.
SHREK	m	Well I guess I've been so busy I forgot to mention it! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 84.
PUSS	f	(in Donkey's body) Don't worry, Jefe. I got this.
GUARD #2	m	Ugh! Kill it!
ARTIE	m	Look, don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you?
SHREK	m	Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs.
ARTIE	m	He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so sorry about this Mr. Shrek.
SHREK	m	I'm gonna lose it!
ARTIE	m	I assume you have everything ready for tonight! You did get the list for the dressing room? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 85.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Yeah, the breakfast croissants stuffed with seared sashimi tuna. Oh, and please tell me you at least have the saffron corn with the jalapeno honey butter cause our client cannot get into his proper emotional state without his jalapeno honey butter.
SHREK	m	I just lost it!
GUARD #1	m	Uh...Maybe they should talk to Nancy in Human Resources.
PUSS	f	(in Donkey's body) Oh, we'll have much to say to Nancy, I promise!
PRINCE CHARMING	m	(reading his lines from a
SCRIPT)	?	With this sword, I do- No.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	With this sword, I do smote thee! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 86.
 )	?	Is that the right word? "Smote?" "Smooote." Is that even a word actually? Maybe I should just smite him.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Let's try this again. Now...
PRINCE CHARMING	m	(playing the scene out
QUIETLY)	?	Shrek attacks me, I pretend to be afraid. (he fake screams) Ooh!!!
PRINCE CHARMING	m	I say... (he riffles through pages) "Finally the Kingdom will get the happily ever after they deserve, die Ogre", blah, blah, blah...
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Oh! It just doesn't feel real enough yet!
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Who told you to stop dancing?!
CYCLOPS	m	Uh... Wink and turn, wink and turn. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 87.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	And what are you laying around for? Get up! Honestly.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Our happily ever after is nearly complete, mummy. And I assure you, the people of this kingdom will pay dearly for every second we've had to wait.
SHREK	m	Break a leg. Or, on second thought, let me break it for you.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Thank goodness you're here. I was beginning to think you might not make it back in... time. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 88.
SHREK	m	Where's Fiona?
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Don't worry. She and the others are safe. For now.
ARTIE	m	Ow.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	Let me guess... Arthur?
ARTIE	m	It's Artie, actually.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	This boy is supposed to be the new King of Far Far Away?
PRINCE CHARMING	m	How pathetic! Now, stand still so I won't make a mess.
SHREK	m	Charming, stop! I'm here now, you got what you wanted. This isn't about him. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 89.
ARTIE	m	Then who's it about? I'm supposed to be King, right?
SHREK	m	You weren't really next in line for the throne, okay? I was.
ARTIE	m	But you said the King asked for me personally.
SHREK	m	Not exactly.
ARTIE	m	What's that supposed to mean?
SHREK	m	Look, I said whatever I had to say, alright! I wasn't right for the job, I just needed some fool to replace me, and you fit the bill. So just go!
ARTIE	m	You were playing me the whole time.
SHREK	m	You catch on real fast kid... Maybe you're not as big of a loser as I thought.
ARTIE	m	You know, for a minute there, I actually thought you -
PRINCE CHARMING	m	What? That he cared about you? He's an ogre. What did you expect? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 90.
PRINCE CHARMING	m	You really do have a way with children, Shrek.
SNOW WHITE	m	Had we just stayed put like I suggested, we could be sipping tea out of little heart-shaped cups... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 91.
CINDERELLA	f	Yeah... yeah, heart shaped cups.
SNOW WHITE	m	Eating crumpets smothered with loganberries.
CINDERELLA	f	Yeah... loganberries.
SNOW WHITE	m	Shut up Cindy.
CINDERELLA	f	Yeah, shut up.
CINDERELLA	f	No! You shut up!
CINDERELLA	f	Just stay out of this!
SNOW WHITE	m	Who cares who's running the kingdom anyway?
FIONA	f	I care.

DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Yeah, and I have your badge number,
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Princess?!
FIONA	f	Puss?!
PUSS	f	(in Donkey's body) Lo siento, Princessa, but I am Puss, stuck here inside this hideous body.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) And I'm me!
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) I know, I know. Everything's a little fruity in the loops right now. But what happened is, we went to high school, the boat crashed, and we got "bippity-bopity-booped" by the "Magic Man."
DORIS	f	You poor sweet things.
CINDERELLA	f	I don't get it.
SNOW WHITE	m	The cat turned into a little horse that smells like feet. What's to get?
SLEEPING BEAUTY	f	Huh? Who dat?
FIONA	f	Where's Shrek? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 93.
DONKEY	m	Charming's got him, Princess. And he plans on killing Shrek tonight in front of the whole kingdom.
FIONA	f	Alright everyone, we need to find a way out, now.
SNOW WHITE	m	You're right. (to the other Princesses) Ladies, assume the position!
FIONA	f	What are you doing?
SLEEPING BEAUTY	f	Waiting to be rescued.
FIONA	f	You have got to be kidding me.
SNOW WHITE	m	Well, what do you expect us to do? We're just four... I mean, three, super hot princesses, two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre and an old lady.
QUEEN	f	Hmmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming through.
QUEEN	f	Hiiiyyyiiiaaaah! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 94.
FIONA	f	Mom!?
QUEEN	f	Well, you didn't actually think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you?
SNOW WHITE	m	Excuse me, I think there's still one more.

DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Artie, it's not like it seems.
ARTIE	m	It's not? I think it seems pretty clear. He was using me. That's all there is to it.
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Using you? Man, you really don't get it!
PUSS	f	(in Donkey's body) Shrek only said those things to protect you!
DONKEY	m	(in Puss' body) Charming was going to kill you Artie. Shrek saved your life.
