OLDER KID	m	You're doing it wrong.
YOUNGER KID	m	Shut up.
OLDER KID	m	You're doing it wrong.
STEPHEN	m	It doesn't go like that.
BRIAN	m	Who asked you?
STEPHEN	m	If you do it like that it'll open in  the fire. Then you'll get burned and
DENNIS	m	Who's going to die?
STEPHEN	m	Brian. He's not doing it right, dad.  He never does it right.
DENNIS	m	Well, let's have a look.
DENNIS	m	Your brother's right. If you don't  fasten these correctly they could  open and you'd get burned.
STEPHEN	m	And DIE!
BRIAN	m	You wouldn't let me die, would you,  Dad?
DENNIS	m	McCaffreys are smarter than fire,  Brian. How 'bout lunch, huh?
STEPHEN	m	Fireman shit?
DENNIS	m	Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd  you grow up, a barn?
STEPHEN	m	Firehouse.
DENNIS	m	Cute.
DENNIS	m	Never fails...
DENNIS	m	Big deal?
AXE	m	Medium deal.
DENNIS	m	Want to come along, Brian? Watch the  old man earn his keep?
STEPHEN	m	Dad!
DENNIS	m	You've come along a dozen times,  Stephen, give your brother a chance.  We'll be back in a few minutes. How 'bout it, sport?
BRIAN	m	Sure!
DENNIS	m	Hit the button, Brian.
DENNIS	m	Stay near the truck. And keep an eye out for us, huh?  We're short handed today.
ENGINEER	m	Don't stray too far, little man.
BRIAN	m	Dad...
AXE	m	Get us some backup! We need some  goddamn backup!
CHIEF FITZGERALD	m	Is this a joke?
BRIAN	m	If it was a joke, sir, you'd be  laughing.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	m	You walked out on this academy six  years ago. One week to graduation.  You think we forgot that? You think  I did?
BRIAN	m	I want another shot, Sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	m	Look, everybody remembers your old  man. Being his son, all you had to  do was breathe to graduate here.  Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew  us off. Why should I take you back?
BRIAN	m	If you remember, sir, my test scores  were in the top --
CHIEF FITZGERALD	m	-- I don't give a damn what your  test scores were, maybe you could  have been a good firemen, but you  had your shot.
BRIAN	m	I need another one, sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	m	Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try  again next year.
BRIAN	m	No, it isn't out of your hands or  you wouldn't even have met me. If I  push you have to let me back in.  Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	m	Even if you graduate this academy,  you've still got nine months of  probation. That's hard duty, son. If  you don't really love this job, it'll  kill you.
BRIAN	m	See you Monday. Sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	m	Though the world changes every day,  some things are truly forever:  Courage, devotion, and honor in what  we do. This class is a special one,  for we dedicate it to the three  firefighters that have fallen this  year: Donald Knowlton, Richard Walter  and Michael Petzold... Ladies and gentlemen, it is with  pleasure that I certify that Candidate  Class number 322, having successfully  completed all academy requirements,  are hereby graduated to the Chicago  Fire Department.
BRIAN	m	Completely out of control.
TIM	m	What the hell are we waiting for?
CANDIDATE	m	Hot off the presses, guys. Station  assignments.
BRIAN	m	A beer, Willy!
WILLY	m	Well, if it isn't the littlest  McCaffrey. Hey! You break anything with that  you buy it! Sorry, there must be something wrong  with my eyes. I keep thinking that's  a fire department uniform.
BRIAN	m	It's in my blood, Willy.
WILLY	m	Really. Well, let's have a look at  what else was "in your blood". I  always look forward to getting these,  they make such a nice collage for  the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales,  Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
BRIAN	m	Didn't offer the kinda growth and  challenge I need.
WILLY	m	Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile  Log Cabins". That was in your blood  about six months wasn't it?
BRIAN	m	Management were pin heads.
WILLY	m	"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
BRIAN	m	Coffee sucked.
WILLY	m	And just this year, "Brian's Sound  Spectrum". Your own company even.  Big step.
BRIAN	m	I was ahead of my time.
WILLY	m	You know, I've got a perfect little  spot here for "Brian McCaffrey,  Fireman"...
TIM	m	Aren't you even curious?
BRIAN	m	Engine 115, right?
TIM	m	How'd you know? These are supposed  to be sealed.
BRIAN	m	Lucky guess. And a case of scotch to a captain in  station assignments.
TIM	m	You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
BRIAN	m	Lots of fires. They promote faster  there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s  list, half the guys on it came from  that battalion. Gotta think about  your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
TIM	m	Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your  way into a station, why not 17 with  me and your brother?
TIM	m	Hey, that's my cousin's company!  C'mon! Let's go!
BRIAN	m	Mrs. Viatkus...
JENNIFER	f	Brian.
BRIAN	m	Jennifer.
JENNIFER	f	You're back.
BRIAN	m	You look great.
JENNIFER	f	Thanks for calling.
BRIAN	m	Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low  profile... the academy... I graduated  today.
JENNIFER	f	Huh.
BRIAN	m	So... I see you're still in the  neighborhood.
JENNIFER	f	Not quite. Just visiting. I live in  Lincoln Park now.
BRIAN	m	Yeah? What have you been up to?
JENNIFER	f	I work for city hall.
BRIAN	m	Really? No kidding.
JENNIFER	f	What, you think I just dried up and  blew away when you left? The world  does turn once in awhile Brian, even  without your permission.
TIM	m	Don't want you overheating, Brian!
TIM	m	Okay okay! Uncle!
JENNIFER	f	You've certainly matured.
BRIAN	m	Well, if nothing else, it's nice to  know we can still be friends.
JENNIFER	f	I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
TIM	m	Let's go, man!
TIM	m	That way.
DRIVER	m	Tim! You crazy motherfucker!
TIM	m	What'cha got?
DRIVER	m	Box alarm. Walton Ave.
TIM	m	We'll meet ya.
TIM	m	Man. Something sure put a crimp in  his evening.
BRIAN	m	Backdraft.
STEPHEN	m	Well, look what we have here. Nice  costume. Rent it?
BRIAN	m	I want to thank you for coming to my  graduation, Stephen. It was a great  inspiration to me.
STEPHEN	m	So you're going to fight fires now,  huh?
STEPHEN	m	Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother.
BRIAN	m	Not likely.
STEPHEN	m	Well, see you're wrong already. Had  a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we  decided in the interest of brotherly  love, that maybe you shouldn't be  way over on the other side of town.  So starting tomorrow, your assigned  to company 17. My company. One case of scotch, you're getting  cheap in your old age, Brian...
SHADOW	m	If you stare any longer Stevie, I'll  start charging you admission.
STEPHEN	m	Got a cause?
SHADOW	m	Are the glory boys actually showing  interest in Investigation's work? I  may have a stroke.
STEPHEN	m	The glory boys just want to finish  their report so they can go home.
SHADOW	m	They're gonna have to wait a few  days on this one.
BRIAN	m	Hey, you forgot... this.
CORONER DRIVER	m	We always leave something for the  dogs.
BRIAN	m	Hey, Sean. What's goin' on, man?
BRIAN	m	It's Uncle Brian. Y'know.
BRIAN	m	"Spinach? We don't need no stinking  spinach". Remember?
KID	m	Mom! Mom!
BRIAN	m	Hellooo...
HELEN	f	Brian?
BRIAN	m	Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
HELEN	f	You look like... Brian.
HELEN	f	'Bout written you off. How long have  you been in town?
BRIAN	m	Four months.
HELEN	f	Four months?
BRIAN	m	I know, I know, Should'a called.  I've been really busy. I joined the  fire department.
HELEN	f	Oh Brian... You guys... you really know how to  put each other through it, don't  you?
BRIAN	m	That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
HELEN	f	Yeah, you'd be surprised what three  years can do to a kid.
BRIAN	m	Sean, come on out, man. What, you  forget your favorite uncle?
HELEN	f	Stephen told him you were killed in  a hot tub accident.
SEAN	m	Dad was kidding, Mom.
BRIAN	m	Well that's two things to strangle  Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
HELEN	f	Stephen's not staying here now, Brian.  He moved out last April.
BRIAN	m	Oh, man, I'm sorry.
HELEN	f	You guys ought to try picking up a  phone once in awhile.
BRIAN	m	Hey.
BRIAN	m	I talked to Helen...
BRIAN	m	...Man, I thought dad's boat was  finally retired to the family  graveyard. Don't you worry about  falling out of this thing?
BRIAN	m	I like what you've done with the  place.
STEPHEN	m	It's comin' along... want a beer?
BRIAN	m	Been ripping off fire stations?
STEPHEN	m	It's old stuff Adcox gave me that  the department was going to throw  out anyway. Still good enough though  for this tub.
BRIAN	m	Bachman Turner Overdrive? ...Buffalo Springfield?... Stephen  Bishop? Oh man...
BRIAN	m	My God, an actual operating 8-track.
STEPHEN	m	What, you've never seen one before?
BRIAN	m	In the Field Museum once.
STEPHEN	m	It works.
BRIAN	m	It worked when you were in sixth  grade.
STEPHEN	m	People actually used to pay you for  this?
BRIAN	m	Millions, Stephen -- And sexual  favors.
STEPHEN	m	Sheep don't count.
BRIAN	m	Yeah? What about Laura --
STEPHEN	m	That was never proved.
STEPHEN	m	Why'd you come here, Brian?
BRIAN	m	I wanted to know why you messed with  my station assignment. I mean, is  this really gonna have to one of  those big brother -- little brother  "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still  pissed" games?
STEPHEN	m	What is it with you, man, huh? How  do you manage to keep coming up with  new and amazing ways to screw up?  That scotch bullshit? Am I really  supposed to believe you came crawling  back home because you suddenly felt  heart strings moan for the family  biz? You were bankrupt, man.
BRIAN	m	Hey! You don't know me --
STEPHEN	m	I know you cold, Brian. The scary  thing is, you probably could have  faked it for awhile. But you see, in  this job there's no place to hide.  Isn't like selling log cabins. You  have a bad day here -- someone dies.  And that's not fucking good enough.  Want another beer?
BRIAN	m	So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna  ride my ass till I cough blood?
STEPHEN	m	Big bad brother is going to treat  you like any other probie -- that I  don't think is going to make it.
BRIAN	m	There's only so much technology can  do. Thanks for the beer.
STEPHEN	m	Thanks for the speakers.
BRIAN	m	Y'know, I told myself a million times  I didn't want to be a fireman. I  said bullshit to that line about  tradition and family legacy. I know  I split, and I know how you felt...
STEPHEN	m	Yeah, you know. You know what it  felt like.
BRIAN	m	I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta  know.
STEPHEN	m	I think you're gonna find out, Brian.  Don't be late tomorrow.
STEPHEN	m	You're too late, probie.
BRIAN	m	Goddamn it, Stephen...
AXE	m	Why baby McCaffrey, how ya doin'?
SCHMIDT	?	You know this rug rat?
AXE	m	Know him? I practically raised him. And he never calls, he never writes...
BRIAN	m	I'm Brian.
GRINDLE	m	I'm sorry.
GRINDLE	m	Boys, I do believe we have a  barbecue...
GRINDLE	m	I hate it when we gotta fucking go  look for it.
STEPHEN	m	Call in another alarm. We're gonna  need some back-up.
AXE	m	Oh these moments do try me...
STEPHEN	m	Be gentle.
SCHMIDT	?	It's only rock 'n roll, kid.
STEPHEN	m	Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh?
STEPHEN	m	You're doing it wrong.
STEPHEN	m	Stay beside me.
AXE	m	Wash it to the windows?
STEPHEN	m	No, we'll hit the son of a bitch  head on.
AXE	m	It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta  get behind it.
STEPHEN	m	Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy.  It'll just steam on us. It won't  flash. Go high in the ceiling.
STEPHEN	m	I knew you were a pussy! C'mon! Steam  us! Let's go!
STEPHEN	m	Ya love it, probie?
BRIAN	m	I'm in heaven, Lt.
STEPHEN	m	Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
STEPHEN	m	Jesus, how 'bout man, huh? We're  gonna loose this!
STEPHEN	m	Hey Otis, is it...?
SCHMIDT	?	Yeah.
STEPHEN	m	Goddamn it, where's our backup?  Where's the second-in companies?
SCHMIDT'S VOICE	m	Sorry, man. John Wayne time.
STEPHEN	m	Dig in!
STEPHEN	m	Dig in, goddamn it!
STEPHEN	m	You're gonna love this.
SANTOS	m	Help... Oh God...
GRINDLE	m	You go, we go.
BRIAN	m	Hey!
NIGHTENGALE	?	Sorry man, I thought you were dead.
PENGELLY	?	Stephen! BC's on the radio. Says  they think a civilian got left behind  downstairs.
STEPHEN	m	Adcox! Take Tim and do a search.
STEPHEN	m	Don't you fold on me now, man.
STEPHEN	m	Clear the hose for me.
BRIAN	m	Hey, I think it's coming from a  different staircase.
BRIAN	m	I got one!
BRIAN	m	I got somebody! I got somebody!
BRIAN	m	Is she... Is she alive?
PARAMEDIC	m	I'm afraid you're a little too late  with this one.
GRINDLE	m	Sorry to hear about the mannequin. I  heard you two were close.
BRIAN	m	Shit...
STEPHEN	m	You all right?
BRIAN	m	Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right  now.
STEPHEN	m	Y'know, you got an awful short memory  for direct orders. I told you to  stay beside me.
BRIAN	m	-- C'mon, Stephen.
STEPHEN	m	-- You split the team, man. And what  was that crap with the standpipe?  You'd think you and a hose were never  introduced before.
BRIAN	m	Goddamn it Stephen!
STEPHEN	m	-- I told you to stay next to me!
BRIAN	m	-- I was doin' it! I was up there  fucking doin' it. You don't know,  man, you don't know what I did!
STEPHEN	m	What you did was drop the ball,  Probie. Get that right.
PENGELLY	?	Hey! Stevie! They're callin' for ya.
STEPHEN	m	Bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty  two days a month off sounded pretty  good twelve weeks ago, huh?
SWAYZAK	m	Roger, Paul... How's it going, guys?
REPORTER	m	Another fire in this district. Getting  to be Cinder Alley up here.
JENNIFER	f	You used that last week.
AXE	m	Hey! Probie! We're still workin'  here, man.
GRINDLE	m	Stephen man, what's going through  that guy's head? Takin' it on in the  first room... this shit's happening  too often. It could've flashed.  Should've flashed.
AXE	m	But it didn't. Guy knows.
GRINDLE	m	Guy's lucky.
AXE	m	Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the  clincher. You did okay.
BRIAN	m	My Lt. might have something to say  about that.
AXE	m	Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian.  You're working for the toughest Lt.  on the job. Saw him once pick up a  probie he thought was moving too  slow and throw him into a burning  building. It's just bad luck you're  family.
BRIAN	m	John, when you're in there... in the  fire... do you ever see...
STEPHEN	m	C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
BRIAN	m	-- Never mind.
SHADOW	m	Alderman Swayzak.
SWAYZAK	m	Investigator Rimgale.
SHADOW	m	I need to get in the trunk.
SHADOW	m	Awful expensive shoes to be wearing  at a fireground, Alderman. But then  I guess you haven't been to too many  fires.
JENNIFER	f	I wanted to talk to you about Alan  Seagrave's death. We still haven't  gotten a fire report from your office.
SHADOW	m	You'll have an answer as soon as I  do.
SWAYZAK	m	People are asking how a prominent  taxpayer got stuffed through the  windshield of his own car. They're  asking me.
JENNIFER	f	--The point is, Investigator, you  haven't even told us yet if the fire  was accidental. We're starting to  get the feeling your office is  dragging out this case to embarrass  the Alderman because of his fire  dept. reorganization program --
SHADOW	m	-- You mean his firehouse closing  program, -- Don't you?
JENNIFER	f	We'd just be very disappointed if it  turned out your office was playing  politics.
SWAYZAK	m	-- Because I'm not. I care about  this city, and I care about this  department --
SHADOW	m	Alderman, I have a remarkably  uncomplicated job. To decide if a  fire's arson, and if so catch the  pain in the ass doing it. But to be  honest, if my methodical investigative  methods just happen to muck up the  campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees,  well, I guess I can't say I sleep  any less peacefully.
SWAYZAK	m	I wish I could just fire the son of  a bitch.
STEPHEN	m	Hey! Swayzak!
STEPHEN	m	We almost lost a whole company up  there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back- up since you closed '33. And we really  appreciate it, the guys and me.  Honest. I know you've got my vote  for mayor.
SWAYZAK	m	Look Lt., I'm on your side. If there's  a problem, please, work with our  task force to fix it.
STEPHEN	m	Oh yeah, your famous task force...  three guys have already died this  year because of the cuts made by  your "task force"...
GRINDLE	m	Stevie, c'mon man...
SWAYZAK	m	You see that funny glow that's  starting to blink in the corner of  your eye, Lt? That's your career  dissipation light -- and it just  went into overtime.
STEPHEN	m	If anybody's light's gonna blink,  it's yours.
AXE	m	You're in firemanland now, Swayzak.  Do yourself a favor and just walk  away.
BRIAN	m	This is your city job?
AXE	m	That's Franny. She likes firemen.
STEPHEN	m	Tim, fill out the alarm card. Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the  ladders and hang some hose.
GRINDLE	m	That's The Thing. You can't stay  unless he likes you.
BRIAN	m	Have you guys got something against  dalmatians?
BRIAN	m	Do you have to do that?
TIM	m	Could you believe that fire? Man!  First day! There I was, Adcox and  me, pullin' that lady right out of  the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it  here -- No surround and drown for  this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn  Stephen's amazing. You see how he  took that fire by the balls? I'm  gonna be that good some day, you  watch.
TIM	m	Y'know what Stephen said to me, right  when all the shit was coming hard?  "You never know till the moment the  fire stares you down if you're just  gonna do this job or be great at  it".
BRIAN	m	Ah man, is he usin' that line now on  you? What, you think he made that  little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used  to have to listen to my old man use  that every morning.
GRINDLE	m	-- C'mon! C'mon! Go! Go!
GRINDLE	m	No! C'mon! This way!
BRIAN	m	What's going on?
PENGELLY	?	Dinner, Probies. Get started.
STEPHEN	m	Better be good.
SANTOS	m	Or we feed you to The Thing.
AXE	m	Gentlemen, please... As 17's official  toastmaster --
SANTOS	m	And bullshitter.
AXE	m	Thank you, Santos. Did I happen to  mention that you were cut out of my  will? I think it appropriate that we  recognize the two asswipes -- I mean  probationary firemen -- among us who  today were baptized officially into  the world of Old Man Fire. First to  Tim, who despite being handicapped  at birth with a rather dull expression  and a really hideous pair of ears,  not only took on the beast but pulled  from its clutches -- assisted by a  more famous and brilliant firefighter --  me -- a kicking and screaming civilian  that will probably end up suing us  for breaking her fingernail. And to Brian, who's own contribution  was both more beautiful and less  likely to sue.
AXE	m	Y'know, when I heard that both  McCaffrey brothers were going to be  assigned together here, well, my  heart was filled with... a sudden  desire to transfer. So raise a glass, lads. To funny- looking Tim, and the McCaffrey  brothers, who despite years of getting  on each other's nerves have managed  with great effort... to still be  pissed off at each other. Gentlemen!
COMPANY	m	Fuck you!
STEPHEN	m	Bye, boys.
SCHMIDT	?	We'll keep it warm for you.
STEPHEN	m	Clean the toilets.
STEPHEN	m	Okay, company dismissed. -- See ya  guys tonight at Fitzgerald's  retirement party.
STEPHEN	m	You want a ride?
BRIAN	m	Thanks.
STEPHEN	m	Brian -- -- See ya tonight.
STEPHEN	m	Hey.
BRIAN	m	Hey.
STEPHEN	m	I gotta change the view...
GRINDLE	m	Heard you didn't make the list for  captain, man. I'm sorry...
BRIAN	m	With grenadine, right?
JENNIFER	f	When I was twenty.
BRIAN	m	Oooh, very sophisticated. Having  fun?
JENNIFER	f	Look, I'm not the same girl who had  nothing better to do than wrap her  legs around you on a Saturday night.  This isn't about fun. I'm working  here.
BRIAN	m	Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
JENNIFER	f	Let me tell you something. Martin  Swayzak is going to be this town's  next mayor.
BRIAN	m	Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope.  How can you work for that guy?
JENNIFER	f	Why do you think Marty came here  tonight? Because he cares about your  department. You don't know how hard  he works. You don't know about his  programs helping West Side --
BRIAN	m	-- All I know is that his programs  are getting firemen hurt.
JENNIFER	f	Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about  efficiency. I've got two cousins on  the job, you think I'd work for him  if I didn't believe in it?
JENNIFER	f	-- Tom, how nice to see you. I know  Marty'll be very happy you came.  Thanks so much for the donation. Marie... how's little Kevin? Really?  Seen the polls? This is the year...
JENNIFER	f	-- The thing that really makes me  angry is the way your union has --
BRIAN	m	What was that? Oh man, you have picked  up a few moves since John Paul II  Boulevard.
JENNIFER	f	Yeah, well I like to think I'm just  a little past hanging out on JP II  watching the Irish pick fights and  Litwalks barf in the planters.
BRIAN	m	I seem to remember some pretty good  nights on JP II.
SALLY	f	Yuck, what a scumbag.
AXE	m	Fuckin' city transferred Sally three  months ago out of parking violations  into Swayzak's office. Now I gotta  pay my own goddamn tickets and she's  stuck with an asshole.
SANTOS	m	Pay more?
SALLY	f	No, but there's more exercise --  being chased around a desk.
GRINDLE	m	Aw, I don't believe this shit.
SCHMIDT	?	Somebody get a shovel! You seen this,  Stephen?
BRIAN	m	What?
TIM	m	"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey,  on his very first fire, showed the  kind of bravery and courage of a  veteran firefighter when he risked  life and limb to double-check a  burning floor alone, emerging  victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a  seamstress for the North Shore  Clothing Company... McCaffrey first  gained prominence as the subject of  a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning  photograph taken at the scene of his  father's death..."
GRINDLE	m	Whadda we gonna do about this?
STEPHEN	m	Y'know, I think it's a union bylaw  that if a guy gets in the paper --  especially if it's bullshit -- he  owes the company a drink. In fact... ...I'll have a double. On the hero.
BRIAN	m	What's going on?
SWAYZAK	m	Brian McCaffrey, right?
JENNIFER	f	Brian, this is my boss, Alderman  Swayzak. Brian's a big fan of yours.
BRIAN	m	Yeah. Big fan.
SWAYZAK	m	And I'm a huge fan of what you did  to save that woman, Brian.
BRIAN	m	Uh, I think there's been a mistake.  I didn't save that woman.
SWAYZAK	m	No need to be modest, Brian.
BRIAN	m	No, you don't understand, I saved a  mannequin.
SWAYZAK	m	-- That really was incredibly work  you did. You and your brother,  fighting fires together, helluva  image, isn't it? You must feel lucky  to be assigned under his command.
BRIAN	m	Every little boy's fantasy.
SWAYZAK	m	Brian, let me come to the point. I'd  like to offer you a job.
BRIAN	m	I have a job.
SWAYZAK	m	This one's still with the fire  department. One of our best  investigators, Don Rimgale, is working  on a very difficult, visible case  right now. We think he could use  another pair of hands and you're  exactly the kind of guy I want  representing us: An authentic hero  from a traditional firefighting clan.
BRIAN	m	Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
SWAYZAK	m	Not every job in the fire department  comes with a tombstone, Brian. This  could be a great opportunity to  move... beyond a fire engine.
BRIAN	m	Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire  engines sorta run in my family.  Politics don't.
JENNIFER	f	Boy, took you all of thirty seconds  to blow that.
BRIAN	m	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another  North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
JENNIFER	f	Brian, do you always have to be so  stupid? Think about your future for  once.
BRIAN	m	So now you suddenly care about my  future?
JENNIFER	f	Look, I didn't mean to take a piece  out of you back there, I just thought  you'd call when you came back. You  didn't and... Don't blow it just because of this  garbage between us.
BRIAN	m	Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in  front of your boss. But I'm not gonna  be a poster boy for him, I'm trying  to do something here. There's five  hundred smoke eaters in this room  that do that stuff for real every  day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of  them.
PENGELLY	?	Aw man, how can she dance with that  guy?
SCHMIDT	?	I hate that guy. He's a dispatcher.  I hate his voice.
STEPHEN	m	Whatever...
PENGELLY	?	I mean, I know women have gotta bang  somebody, but why that son of a bitch?
SCHMIDT	?	Hey Stevie, he's an asshole...
STEPHEN	m	Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a  second about Sean...
HELEN	f	Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we  talk about this later?
DATE	m	How ya doin', Stephen?
STEPHEN	m	Jackson.
STEPHEN	m	What's wrong with right now? He's  your son for christ's sake. He's --
JACKSON	m	Hey, Stephen, what about that dumb  ass brother of yours, huh?
STEPHEN	m	...Yeah?
JACKSON	m	Savin' a mannequin... How fuckin'  stupid can a guy get?
STEPHEN	m	You can't talk about my brother like  that...
HELEN	f	Here we go...
JACKSON	m	You're crazy, man!
STEPHEN	m	Leave me alone!
AXE	m	Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off! You stupid dumbshit, you never know  when to fucking quit, do you? You  ever wonder why your career's in the  fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be  stuck a Lt. for life?
STEPHEN	m	No. I need a drink.
BRIAN	m	You don't need a drink, man. You  need to get outta here...
JENNIFER	f	Ah those McCaffreys... just hate  leaving a party with anyone left  standing...
STEPHEN	m	I'm okay... leave me alone...
BRIAN	m	So you got a 'roid going with Jackson  or what?
STEPHEN	m	Nah, he's nothin'. It's just  sometimes... sometimes you just gotta  punch somebody out, y'know?
STEPHEN	m	I don't think I can get up.
STEPHEN	m	Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I  can get on the cover of LIFE magazine,  too.
BRIAN	m	C'mon, let's crawl home.
STEPHEN	m	...Adcox, those guys...they don't  get it... it isn't the goddamn  promotion... or dad... I'm not my  old man, y'know? No fire's gonna get  me... I don't give a shit about being  a captain... it's just... it's just  they don't trust me anymore... ...they don't trust me anymore...
STEPHEN	m	If you'd get out of my fuckin' way.  I could take my own goddamn shoes  off...
STEPHEN	m	You're such a pain in the ass...  You've always been a pain in the  ass...
STEPHEN	m	Jesus, it's too damn bright in here...  Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin'  blind...
BRIAN	m	This?
STEPHEN	m	Yeah... too bright...
STEPHEN	m	They don't know... they don't know  what I hear in there...
STEPHEN	m	...This boat could be okay, huh?...  Take it out weekends... Sean 'n me...
STEPHEN	m	Hey! Knock it off!
AXE	m	Maybe you should have gotten more  sleep last night.
TIM	m	This everything you wanted?
WOMAN	f	Can I help you guys at all?
STEPHEN	m	Nah, we just about got it.
WOMAN	f	Sally must be finally ironing your  shirts.
AXE	m	It's just new. Couple'a shifts and  it'll be as thrashed as the rest.
WOMAN	f	I'm sorry...
AXE	m	It's okay...
WOMAN	f	I miss him... I just miss him,  y'know?...
AXE	m	This job... This fuckin' job  sometimes... To buy it trying to go  the extra yard, man, that's one thing,  but to buy it just because there  wasn't any back-up... it's bullshit...
STEPHEN	m	Yeah, it's bullshit. So what? Fuck  Swayzak. Fuck 'em all. We don't go  into fires for them. You know that.  Christ, you taught me that.
STEPHEN	m	You know Knowlton pretty well?
AXE	m	Yeah...
STEPHEN	m	Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
AXE	m	Biggest in two battalions.
STEPHEN	m	We're gonna be okay, man...
SCHMIDT	?	Is she going to get the divorce?
SANTOS	m	Hell if I know, man.
WASHINGTON	m	Hey, Pengelly, you made the captain's  list!
STEPHEN	m	Alright... Go!
STEPHEN	m	Go!
STEPHEN	m	That isn't a football, probie. Get  it on your shoulder.
BRIAN	m	Having fun, fireman?
STEPHEN	m	You're not breaking any records,  Brian.
STEPHEN	m	Your shoulder. Like this!
STEPHEN	m	Come on! Pick it up!
STEPHEN	m	Run, damn you!
STEPHEN	m	Roll the hose.
BRIAN	m	What, are you kidding? By myself?
STEPHEN	m	You heard me.
BRIAN	m	What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll  let you win next time.
STEPHEN	m	You got a problem with drilling,  probie?
BRIAN	m	No, Lt., I don't have a problem with  drilling. But let's just have one  drill. Not one for the company and  one for me.
STEPHEN	m	Roll the hose.
BRIAN	m	Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna  quit. You hear me!
STEPHEN	m	Well, thank God for fires...
MOTHER	f	My baby! My baby's still up there!
BATTALION CHIEF	m	Hang on a sec, Stevie, we got a  hoseline coming.
STEPHEN	m	Don't take that kind of shit from  it! Don't let it know you're scared!  Come on!
STEPHEN	m	Ready?
BRIAN	m	Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the  hose team...
STEPHEN	m	Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I  say... It won't get us.
STEPHEN	m	Now!
SANTOS	m	They think she's gonna live...
STEPHEN	m	You okay?
BRIAN	m	I waited... I would have fucking  waited...
STEPHEN	m	That's not what it's about, Brian.  The point is there was a kid in there.  And what if there'd been two? I went  in because that's what I do. It's my  way. It's dad's way. It isn't  everybody's way.
BRIAN	m	Dad's way? Where did he tell you  that? In a fucking seance?
STEPHEN	m	You said you wanted to know something,  Brian. What did you learn today? What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to  move on?
BRIAN	m	You're right, Stephen... You win...  You're the best, man...
SECRETARY'S VOICE	m	Brian McCaffrey on line two for  Jennifer.
JENNIFER	f	I'll take it in my office.
SWAYZAK	m	Go get him.
JENNIFER	f	Brian?
BRIAN	m	I've been thinking about what you  said the other night... If the offer's  still on the table, I'd like to talk  about it.
JENNIFER	f	...Okay. I'll arrange things with  your assignment captain. Marty's a good man, Brian.
BRIAN	m	Yeah...
SHADOW	m	...So stop me if I get this wrong...  The fire's almost out... You're  upstairs on the unburned floor  checking for heat. You've been told  by your Battalion Chief, your Captain,  by me, not to do anything up there  until ordered. But now the itch  starts, and all of a sudden comes  the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, I'm a hero.  Heroes don't just stand around. So  on your own you decided to punch out  a window for ventilation. Was that  before or after you noticed you were  standing in a lake of gasoline?
SHADOW	m	You could've crispered half your  company with that little stunt, but  more importantly you wrecked the  physical evidence I use to prove  it's arson. You've made my day longer,  Probie. Go home and think about that.
BRIAN	m	Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new  assistant.
SHADOW	m	Your Dennis' kid. I work alone.
SHADOW	m	Are you still here?
BRIAN	m	Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not  going anywhere.
SHADOW	m	Then go find a corner. I don't want  you in my way.
BRIAN	m	I think we should get something  straight here. I was assigned to  this office by the city.
SHADOW	m	Look, I knew your father, he had a  helluva reputation on this job. But  that don't mean you get any slack.  Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I  gotta eat you, that's the rules and  I got nothing to say about that. But  Swayzak or no, you live with me.  Step out of line, and I don't care  who knows you, I'll swing the hammer. You think you're the first?
BRIAN	m	Where are you going?
SHADOW	m	Pest control.
RONALD	m	Shadow.
SHADOW	m	How ya doin', Ronald. Staying  comfortable?
RONALD	m	Didn't think you'd make it.
SHADOW	m	Wouldn't miss this for the world,  pal.
RONALD	m	Who's this?
SHADOW	m	He works for me.
RONALD	m	Is he a fireman? I like firemen.
SHADOW	m	You like everybody, Ronald.
RONALD	m	Brian McCaffrey... Oh this is really a treat. Brian  McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal,  huh?
BRIAN	m	Hey, do I know you?
SHADOW	m	You don't know him.
RONALD	m	I know you.
BRIAN	m	What the hell are you talking about  my --
SHADOW	m	Knock it off. Now.
RONALD	m	Tell him about me, Shadow?
SHADOW	m	Ronald here likes telephones. Used  to tape wooden matches to the bell  striker and wrap it in cotton. Came  up with a whole little thing there,  didn't you Ronald? When you got bored,  what did you do? You just started  making calls... mostly day care  centers and retirement homes, wasn't  it?
RONALD	m	Did he tell you how we finally met?
SHADOW	m	Nobody cares, Ronald.
RONALD	m	Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow.  You're depriving our famous young  friend here...
VOICE IN CORRIDOR	m	Okay... Ronald Bowland...
RONALD	m	It was on State Street, right?...  Just your basic warehouse torch for  the owner. Cakewalk. But the animal...  turned on me... 'Ol Shadow here, he  shows up -- whole place is going  like hell -- my hair, my hands...  could've just let the animal take me --  but Shadow, he's a good camper, so  he tries to pull 'ol Ronald out.  Guess he didn't notice the tub of  phosphorous next to me... Notice you're still a little shy  about rolling your sleeves up, Shadow.  Show him your stomach yet?
MAN	m	...All right, the parole board has  received Mr. Bowland's fitness report,  his ID-44, endorsement from his  section warden... Dr. Norris?
WOMAN PSYCHIATRIST	f	As supervising psychiatrist I would  describe Mr. Bowland's progress as  remarkable. Taking into account his  disability and the six years already  served, I recommend parole.
MAN	m	Mr. Bowland, do you regret your  crimes?
RONALD	m	Yes. I understand now the pain I  caused.
MAN	m	If released, will you commit these  crimes again?
RONALD	m	I won't.
MAN	m	Do you consider yourself ready for  society?
RONALD	m	Yes.
SHADOW	m	Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
RONALD	m	Absolutely.
MAN	m	Excuse me, Mr. Rimgale.
SHADOW	m	Excuse me. What do you do with little girls?
SHADOW	m	What do you do with them, Ronald?  Huh?
RONALD	m	-- Burn them.
SHADOW	m	And old ladies?
RONALD	m	-- Burn them.
SHADOW	m	And the world -- the whole world.
RONALD	m	-- Burn it all.
SHADOW	m	See ya next year, Ronald. Gotta go.
SHADOW	m	Hey kid, c'mere -- At least make  yourself useful.
ENGINE LT	m	We were lucky with this one. Could've  taken out the whole complex, but the  explosion blew out most of the flame.  Good for us. -- Not so good for him.
SHADOW	m	Turn this over.
BRIAN	m	What do you want me to do with --
SHADOW	m	-- Shhh.
BRIAN	m	What are you listening to?
SHADOW	m	You sneaky little son of a bitch...  Hide and seek... Come on, tell me  what I want to know...
SHADOW	m	Heavy smoke stains observed in entry  room. Demarkation line high. Fire  never got hot enough here to cook  soot off. It started somewhere else... Less soot here. More heat. And very little soot here. Get that couch out of the way.
SHADOW	m	So you were happy here. Warm and  cozy and in no hurry... Soot high, clean unburned wall low,  indicates slow burn in thermal  balance. Find me some glass.
BRIAN	m	Glass?
SHADOW	m	Do we have a language barrier here?  Glass.
SHADOW	m	Glass found in ignition room is in  small, thin pieces, indicating  explosion. Lack of discoloration  indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion  must of come after a slow burn. You little tease... What were you up  to you little bastard, huh? What  made you that mad? Or scared. It started in this room. Took its  time, hung out... but the air ran  out. It couldn't breathe. So it was  snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still  all that trapped heat, lying low,  waiting for some sucker to open the  door and give it that one gulp of  air...
BRIAN	m	-- Another backdraft.
SHADOW	m	Finish coat burned away... Severe  spawling of rough coat...
SHADOW	m	That's our ignition point. Dig it  out. Carefully.
SHADOW	m	Temperature in this room was about  2000 degrees, but copper wire in  outlet is melted, which requires  5000 degrees. An accidental short in  the plug could of created a spark of  7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the  wire and start a fire.
BRIAN	m	No it couldn't.
BRIAN	m	I mean you'd be right -- with normal  wire. But that's gauge ten in that  plug -- industrial stuff. Who knows  why they put it in here -- but it  won't melt at less than 12,000  degrees. And no natural spark short  of lightning gets that hot. In another life I was in high-end  electronics.
SHADOW	m	Have outlet analyzed for any traces  of flammable accelerants.
BRIAN	m	Don't mention it.
BRIAN	m	Hey, Tim.
TIM	m	Brian.
SHADOW	m	Check the wall for burn patterns.
BRIAN	m	So, you surviving without me?
TIM	m	There's no replacement 'cause of  your boss' cuts, if that's what you  mean. If someone else goes out on an  injury we're really screwed.
BRIAN	m	Swayzak's not my boss.
GRINDLE	m	Ooooh, like the tie. Love the tie.
BRIAN	m	Grindle, scrape down that wall for  me, huh? I would myself, but the tie  'n all, y'know...
SANTOS	m	Uh, Brian, if you're lookin' for  smoke patterns, there's some good  ones over here.
BRIAN	m	Yeah? Where?
GRINDLE	m	Little to the right... further...  further... Right behind there. Hey,  could you hand me that pike pole?
GRINDLE	m	Sorry, maybe that wasn't it after  all.
STEPHEN	m	That's just about enough, guys, okay?
SCHMIDT	?	See ya around, Brian.
AXE	m	What the hell's the matter with you,  huh? You're steppin' in the shit  again. You could've done it. You  don't want this. Wake up, kid.
STEPHEN	m	Here. Dry yourself off.
STEPHEN	m	Look, you are sorta making yourself  fair game.
BRIAN	m	Thanks for the insight.
STEPHEN	m	Brian, look --
BRIAN	m	Just leave me alone, okay?
STEPHEN	m	Hey, Bri... Rimgale's okay. I don't  get half the shit he's talking about,  but then everybody says the same  thing about me. Who the hell knows?
HELEN	f	Stephen, what are you doing here?
STEPHEN	m	Fixing my roof.
HELEN	f	It's not your roof anymore.
STEPHEN	m	Where's Sean?
HELEN	f	He's got piano lessons.
STEPHEN	m	Oh yeah? How's he doing?
HELEN	f	He's going to be a fireman.
STEPHEN	m	Give up, babe. You can't fight it.  Believe me, my mom tried...
HELEN	f	Stephen, you gotta stop just showing  up on the roof like this.
STEPHEN	m	I just wanted to, I don't know, not  exactly apologize for the other night --  especially since I don't remember  much of it --
HELEN	f	-- You remember.
STEPHEN	m	Yeah... I just thought I should say,  I don't know, something.
HELEN	f	The great communicator.
STEPHEN	m	Sorry I hit Jackson.
HELEN	f	He deserved it. He was born deserving  it.
STEPHEN	m	He treats you okay?
HELEN	f	Okay.
STEPHEN	m	I treated you better.
HELEN	f	You treated me like shit.
HELEN	f	You want some coffee?
STEPHEN	m	Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
HELEN	f	What's wrong, Stephen? C'mon, you only beat up the roof  when something's on your mind. How's Brian doing?
STEPHEN	m	He's out.
HELEN	f	I know he's out, but how's he doing?
STEPHEN	m	Y'know, I treated him better than  any other probie I ever had. He  probably hates my guts, but I did  the best thing for him. I made him  finally look in the mirror.
HELEN	f	Ah Stephen, that's what this is really  about, isn't it? You always have to  be right.
STEPHEN	m	Hey, I'm the first one to admit when  I'm wrong.
HELEN	f	Yeah? When was the last time?
STEPHEN	m	In a fire? Never. Look, I'm his brother. I care about  him, y'know? He was going to get  himself killed. Maybe not today,  maybe not in a year, but it would've  happened. And I couldn't -- I just  couldn't...
HELEN	f	You can't keep being his father...
STEPHEN	m	You know what I realized today? I  can't remember my dad's face anymore.  There's pictures of him staring at  me everywhere I go, but the guy behind  them... he's gone...
STEPHEN	m	I'll see ya around, Helen.
RICCO	m	Okay, Alan Seagrave and Donald  Cosgrove...
RICCO	m	...Both deaths due to close encounters  with stationary objects; office door  for Mr. Cosgrove, '89 Porsche for  Mr. Seagrave. No non-relevant traumas.  No significant blood toxicology.  Attitude of both trajectories  consistent with explosions.
RICCO	m	They ran the residue you scraped  from both crispers' front doors.  It's a combination of plumber's putty  and rayophene gum. Burns almost  completely away when you light it.
SHADOW	m	Putty? On both doors?
RICCO	m	There's something else kinda  interesting...
RICCO	m	See this?
RICCO	m	Guess he didn't leave home without  it.
RICCO	m	Anyway, down here, take a look...
SHADOW	m	McCaffrey, hold this for us.
BRIAN	m	Uh, I don't think that's in my  contract...
SHADOW	m	I just re-wrote your contract.  C'mere...
RICCO	m	Jesus Christ, he isn't gonna try to  sell you insurance, lift him.
RICCO	m	See that patch of shirt? We wondered  about the discoloration so he ran a  spectro. On a lucky shot we picked  up some traces of Trychticholorate.  Nobody around here had ever heard of  it.
SHADOW	m	Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an  absorption catalyst in toxic waste  accidents. It's pretty rare, they  stopped making it a couple'a years  ago.
RICCO	m	Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes  in a gas state from the fire.
SHADOW	m	What the hell was it doing in the  fire?
RICCO	m	That's your job.
SHADOW	m	I asked you to hold him, not feel  him up...
SHADOW	m	Read.
BRIAN	m	"Trychtichlorate is a binary  structured --"
SHADOW	m	-- Go to the bottom. Under heat  properties.
BRIAN	m	"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin  or higher, Trych breaks down and  dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
SHADOW	m	Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot  it takes water molecules and BAMM!
SHADOW	m	Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just  to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take  much at all to melt ten gauge wire.  Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a  powder trace -- unless you could  find something that would eat its  residue.
BRIAN	m	Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can  announce Seagrave was a murder.
SHADOW	m	Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone  may have put the chemical in the  outlet, but we found it as a vapor  in Cosgrove's clothes.
BRIAN	m	And the putty around the door?
SHADOW	m	Even if it was used to seal the air  off, that doesn't explain why someone  would go to the trouble of a  backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot  easier
BRIAN	m	But the right guess on this is arson.
SHADOW	m	I don't guess.
BRIAN	m	Some people say you don't do much of  anything when it comes to this case.
SHADOW	m	I don't work for them, either.
BRIAN	m	Arson.
JENNIFER	f	Straightest answer your department's  given me all week.
BRIAN	m	Hey.
JENNIFER	f	How's it going?
BRIAN	m	Boss and I are up to about three  words an hour.
JENNIFER	f	Green committed to a thousand. There's another fund-raising party  tonight. Marty'd really like you to  come.
BRIAN	m	I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
JENNIFER	f	I could use a date.
BRIAN	m	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
RIMGALE'S VOICE	m	McCaffrey! Come here!
BRIAN	m	Call ya back.
SHADOW	m	Take the top off. Go ahead. Take it  off.
BRIAN	m	Jesus!
SHADOW	m	That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch,  he's different, goddamn it! You see  what this tells us, huh? Our killer  doesn't love fire!
BRIAN	m	What?
SHADOW	m	I got it after we talked to Ronald.  Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn  world. But the fires that killed  those guys never really burned up  much. -- The burns were all lit in  outlets surrounded by double  firebreaks in the walls. And he made  his burns backdrafts.
BRIAN	m	But he killed these guys.
SHADOW	m	But he could have killed everybody  there. The firebreaks kept it from  spreading in the wall. The backdraft  blew out the flame. That's it. That's  the reason.
BRIAN	m	What reason?
SHADOW	m	Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave  and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot  of trouble to make sure they died by  fire, but also made sure the fire  blew itself out.
BRIAN	m	That's why the sealant on the doors...  So what have we got, a torch with a  conscience?
SHADOW	m	No, we have a stone killer trying to  make a point.
BRIAN	m	Are you going public with this?
SHADOW	m	No. Do that and I guarantee you'll  scare him off. I don't want him  running away.
JENNIFER	f	Hi.
BRIAN	m	Hey... So are you dating your boss or what?
JENNIFER	f	If you weren't at least the 300th  person to ask me that, I'd probably  be pissed. Boy, you sure know it's a man's world  sometimes...
BRIAN	m	Sorry. Are you dating anyone?
JENNIFER	f	You think that's really any of your  business?
BRIAN	m	Well, you did invite me here.
JENNIFER	f	Marty did. But I wanted you to come to.
SWAYZAK	m	Mr. McCaffrey...
BRIAN	m	Nice boat.
SWAYZAK	m	It isn't mine. Let's get a picture.
SWAYZAK	m	Larry! What does he do again?
JENNIFER	f	How's the job going?
BRIAN	m	Okay.
JENNIFER	f	Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail,  isn't he?
BRIAN	m	No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's  not a dummy, though. He's juggling  alot of balls on this one.
JENNIFER	f	Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert  Einstein just to figure out if these  guys were killed by accidents or  not.
BRIAN	m	Jesus, give him a break. There isn't  enough proof yet to go public. Sure,  we found some chemical shit we think  somebody dumped in the plugs to torch  'em, and we've maybe figured out why  backdrafts, but you can't rush this  stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
JENNIFER	f	But Rimgale's probably going to come  around to arson.
BRIAN	m	In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
JENNIFER	f	Save me.
BRIAN	m	Thanks for the invite.
JENNIFER	f	Got anything to drink in there?
BRIAN	m	Oh, there might be something stashed  away for emergencies.
BRIAN	m	This is one of the oldest fire  stations in the city. Lotta tradition  locked up in here. What do you think?
JENNIFER	f	Homey.
BRIAN	m	See that trap door up there? That  used to lead to the hay loft when  they had horse-drawn engines. It was  pretty different then... but kinda  the same, y'know?
JENNIFER	f	Do you miss it? You seem like you do.
BRIAN	m	When I came back, I knew more than  anything else that I wanted to be a  fireman.
JENNIFER	f	Then why did you quit?
BRIAN	m	I wanted to be a good one.
BRIAN	m	Old firehouse trick.
JENNIFER	f	So show me your fire truck.
BRIAN	m	Well, our specimen here is your basic  standard issue piece of primary  suppression equipment. This area is  the pumping panel, which controls  the rate of liquid insertion into  the hose.
JENNIFER	f	Uh huh.
BRIAN	m	This is a six inch playpipe, cast  bronze to keep it firm during hard  flows. This is our pipe extender, used in  forward lays... This is our hard suction line... Our  adjustable insertion nozzle... ...And this is the hose bed.
GRINDLE	m	Jesus Tim, if you're going to kill  yourself at least wait till the fire,  it's better P.R.
JENNIFER	f	Tell me about the playpipe again...
STEPHEN	m	Where is it?
SECURITY GUARD	m	Don't know. There's alarms going off  on three different floors.
STEPHEN	m	Wonderful.
TIM	m	How do we know if the floor's going  to be on fire?
STEPHEN	m	If the doors open and it's hot, don't  get out.
STEPHEN	m	It's here.
GRINDLE	m	These high-rise gigs give me the  creeps.
AXE	m	Let's wait for a back-up, Stephen.  We're early on this one, it hasn't  even broke out yet. We're one short  as it is with Brian gone.
STEPHEN	m	Want to learn something?
TIM	m	Yes sir!
STEPHEN	m	Adcox, go with Pengelly and check  the other side.
AXE	m	It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin'  us up. Not with this one.
STEPHEN	m	-- What the hell's the matter with  you? You always check the other side.  I haven't got time for bullshit right  now, okay? We got a job here.
AXE	m	Let me take the lead, Stephen...
STEPHEN	m	Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking  job!
STEPHEN	m	Oh, you're so very sly, but so am
JENNIFER	f	What's going on?
JENNIFER	f	What are they doing?
BRIAN	m	Excuse us.
STEPHEN	m	Lotta smoke, but it isn't rolling...  that means it's hiding... staying  sleepy... one of these doors...
STEPHEN	m	Easy... no hurry... you're not going  anywhere...
STEPHEN	m	Did you check the door for heat,  Tim?
STEPHEN	m	Tim?
STEPHEN	m	Tim!
AXE	m	Oh God! Oh God no!
STEPHEN	m	Hey, Stevie.
BRIAN	m	Is he...
AXE	m	He's alive.
BRIAN	m	Do they think he'll pull through?
GRINDLE	m	They're not saying.
BRIAN	m	I should have been there.
NIGHTENGALE	?	None of us should have been there,  Brian.
BRIAN	m	You had to do it, didn't you?
STEPHEN	m	...Not now, Brian.
BRIAN	m	Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth  man in there instead of looking out  for your probie. Is that what  happened? Is it, Stephen?
STEPHEN	m	I had that fire. He didn't listen!
BRIAN	m	He didn't listen? He was a fucking  candidate! He was your responsibility.  He shouldn't have been there in the  first place, Stephen. You burned him.
STEPHEN	m	Fuck you.
SHADOW	m	Goes on about how the break was made  through the discovery of "chemical  traces" and a "behavioral link". Oh,  and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief  investigator is closing in on the  torch and expects an arrest "any  time".
SHADOW	m	Get your stuff and get out.
JENNIFER	f	Brian. What's wrong?
BRIAN	m	You told Swayzak about our arson  lead. It's all over the fucking news.
JENNIFER	f	I didn't know it was a secret. There  aren't supposed to be secrets between  the city and its investigators --
BRIAN	m	-- Bullshit! You knew what I told  you wasn't ready for the papers --
JENNIFER	f	Will you please keep your voice down,  there's people --
BRIAN	m	-- You could have scared the son of  a bitch off. We may never bust him  now. All for a couple's political  points.
JENNIFER	f	I was doing my job.
BRIAN	m	Yeah? And just how much of all this  has been "doing your job"?
JENNIFER	f	Let me ask you something, do you  really think Marty had you assigned  to arson because of your firefighting  skills? Who the hell are you kidding?  I was there, remember? I saw you and  your brother --
BRIAN	m	Leave Stephen out of this --
JENNIFER	f	Oh yeah, he's the real fireman. Who are you? Just another probie  working for Swayzak --
BRIAN	m	-- I work for the city.
JENNIFER	f	You knew what we were asking you to  do. Don't suddenly pull out a  conscience now. The fit isn't right.
SWAYZAK	m	Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
BRIAN	m	Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a  letter to the Times explaining how  yesterday's arson announcement was a  fabrication by your office. They  loved it. And you know what? You  were right, my family background in  firefighting gave it weight.
JENNIFER	f	Oh Brian...
STEPHEN	m	He's gonna live. Maybe not much else,  but he's gonna live...
SWAYZAK	m	Inspector.
SHADOW	m	Alderman.
SHADOW	m	I usually have breakfast first.
SWAYZAK	m	When are you going to catch the prick  that's doing this, Don?
SHADOW	m	"Don?"
SWAYZAK	m	Don't you have any leads at all?
SHADOW	m	No Marty, I don't.
SHADOW	m	We still haven't found a connection  between the victims.
SWAYZAK	m	Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave,  Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried  in a goddamn high-rise!
SHADOW	m	Holcomb? I didn't know the name of  that victim had even been released  yet.
SHADOW	m	Is there a connection between them,  Alderman?
SWAYZAK	m	Just catch the son of a bitch.
SHADOW	m	What the hell are you doing here?
BRIAN	m	I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do  whatever you want me to do. I just  want to help catch the guy that burned  Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
SHADOW	m	I thought 'ol Marty was acting a  little strange... And he's right.
BRIAN	m	Backdraft?
SHADOW	m	The backdraft was set somewhere in  there. It fried Holcomb when he opened  the inner door. But the outer door  held... and waited for Tim...
SHADOW	m	So find me the fire.
SHADOW	m	You're thinking too much of the  building and not enough of the ghost.
SHADOW	m	In a word, Brian, what is this job  all about?
BRIAN	m	Fire.
SHADOW	m	It's a living thing, Brian. It  breathes, it eats, and it hates.
SHADOW	m	The only way to beat it is to think  like it. To know that this flame  will spread this way across the floor  not because of the physics of  flammable liquids or heat convection,  but because it wants to.
SHADOW	m	Some guys on this job, fire owns  them. It makes them fight on its  level. But the only way to truly  kill it is to love it a little, just  like Ronald.
VOICE	m	What the hell are you guys doin'?
SHADOW	m	We're the fire department, lady.
WOMAN	f	Well color me stupid, I always thought  the fire dept. put out fires.
SHADOW	m	You work here?
WOMAN	f	Till yesterday. What do you think  the odds are that a non-refundable  ticket to Paris survived this?
BRIAN	m	Somewhere between zero and no way.
WOMAN	f	Shit. What a mess.
SHADOW	m	You seem real broken up about Mr.  Holcomb.
WOMAN	f	Jeff Holcomb? The Darth Vader of tax  accountants? He was a sleezeball.  Hopefully a sleezeball that carried  some insurance.
BRIAN	m	Go talk to the building owner.
WOMAN	f	He was the building owner.
BRIAN	m	Our book lists the owner as Dekom  Trust.
WOMAN	f	Don't investigators come in adult  size?
GRINDLE	m	Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
STEPHEN	m	I'm busy.
GRINDLE	m	He just wants to --
STEPHEN	m	-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
STEPHEN	m	What, they don't knock on your planet?
SHADOW	m	I still haven't gotten your fire  report, Stevie. On Tim.
STEPHEN	m	I'm working on it.
SHADOW	m	I deal with this stuff every day.  But a fireman... you never get used  to it. What happened up there? He was a  candidate. Did he pay attention? Was  he listening?
STEPHEN	m	...He wasn't listening to the right  thing...
SHADOW	m	What do you listen to, Stephen?
STEPHEN	m	You don't know... nobody knows...
SHADOW	m	I might.
STEPHEN	m	It knows us. This one knows us.
SHADOW	m	I need that report, Lt.
STEPHEN	m	Tim-went-to-the-fire-and-now-he- doesn't-have-a-face.
BRIAN	m	Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by  Pan Illinois... which is majority  controlled by Lakeside Dynamics...  which is a division of Windy City  Ventures... who's partners are... Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and  Jeffrey Holcomb.
SHADOW	m	Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
BRIAN	m	So Seagrave and Holcomb were  accountants...
SHADOW	m	And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he  laundered money for the mob before  getting into real estate. They weren't  very high on Seagrave, either.
BRIAN	m	Nice bunch of guys.
SHADOW	m	Who all ended up wearing candles for  faces... Swayzak's up to his ass in this  somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink  in his hand, he's so scared.
SHADOW	m	We need to get a look at his files.
JENNIFER	f	Hi.
BRIAN	m	Hi.
JENNIFER	f	We still talking? Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
BRIAN	m	Swayzak knows something about the  guys that were murdered. I want to  know why he keeps that hidden.
JENNIFER	f	I don't know anything about it.
BRIAN	m	You could check. It'd be in his files.
JENNIFER	f	Do you know what you're asking me to  do?
BRIAN	m	Yes.
JENNIFER	f	Y'know, four years ago I was working  in a bakery. Two years ago I was  bringing Marty coffee and he didn't  even know my name. I run that office  now. Marty believed in me and I  believe in him. You want me to just  throw that away?
BRIAN	m	Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
HELEN	f	Stephen?
STEPHEN	m	I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
HELEN	f	What's wrong?
STEPHEN	m	I...
STEPHEN	m	Cook and I are almost finished here.  Have a seat.
HELEN	f	Stephen... I... can I talk to you a  second...
STEPHEN	m	Look, I'm sorry I --
HELEN	f	-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
STEPHEN	m	-- He's gettin' good on those eggs.  And y'know, he told me he actually  likes the piano.
HELEN	f	I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
HELEN	f	It's... It's just things have  changed... you're the same, Stephen,  but things are different now... you've  got a son... you're the best at what  you do Stephen, you always were, but  you scare me now...
STEPHEN	m	Hey... Sean-man, your dad blew it. I  forgot I had to work this morning...
SEAN	m	Aw dad, c'mon...
STEPHEN	m	Next time, huh? We'll do it up big.  Promise.
SEAN	m	Okay. Mom's crying, dad.
JENNIFER	f	Latest polls came in, Marty. Marty?
JENNIFER	f	Jesus Christ, Marty, what's going  on?
SWAYZAK	m	Leave me alone.
JENNIFER	f	We've come a long way together, Marty.  I've staked my whole career on you.  And now you're sneaking around this  office, leaking things to the papers  behind my back... Is there something you're not telling  me about these deaths?
SWAYZAK	m	No.
BRIAN	m	Jennifer?
BRIAN	m	What is --
JENNIFER	f	Just take it.
BRIAN	m	I'm sorry.
JENNIFER	f	That's a dumb thing to say.
BRIAN	m	You're right.
JENNIFER	f	Goodbye, Brian.
REPAIRMAN	m	What the hell do you do with this  thing?
SHADOW	m	This is the copy of Swayzak's manning  report that was released. Everybody  on this job knows it's bullshit but  we could never argue with the numbers.  They're all airtight.
BRIAN	m	Yeah? Airtight?
BRIAN	m	I've got three different drafts of  the same report -- with different  numbers that're all over the place.  Looks like they were just making it  up as they went along.
SHADOW	m	Did a little check on the consulting  firm that wrote the report. They did  exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower  study. It's not even really a company.  No employees, no directors, just a  PO Box.
BRIAN	m	Then who wrote the report?
SHADOW	m	It had to be someone who knows  numbers. Some kind of fancy  accountant. But what's the connection?
SHADOW	m	I think it's time Mr. Swayzak and us  had a little heart to heart talk.
SHADOW	m	Hello? Swayzak?
SHADOW	m	Uh... I sorta got a problem here...
SHADOW	m	Well Brian, I guess you can say it's  arson now...
BRIAN	m	How ya feeling?
BRIAN	m	Did you pull me out?
SHADOW	m	Yeah.
BRIAN	m	Did I say thanks?
SHADOW	m	No.
BRIAN	m	Just wondering.
SHADOW	m	I hate hospitals. You're so... so  goddamn useless...
BRIAN	m	So what do you want me to do?
SHADOW	m	I've been lying here hours... just  thinking... We're close... We're not looking in the right place,  Brian. This one knows us and we're  not looking in the right place...
RONALD	m	Well, Mr. Life magazine. Come all  this way just to say hi?
BRIAN	m	I'm close... but I can't get who it  is...
RONALD	m	So you came to me... Well, this is going to be an  interesting afternoon after all...
RONALD	m	Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you  a story, you tell me one. Fair?
BRIAN	m	Who's doing this?
RONALD	m	Your first question should be who  isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not  enough damage. And an insurance pro?  Where's the profit margin?
BRIAN	m	Then who --
RONALD	m	-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
BRIAN	m	I don't have a story.
RONALD	m	Sure you do.
RONALD	m	Famous story even. Straight burn.  Just an engine and truck first on  scene. What did you feel, Brian,  when you first got there?
BRIAN	m	What?
RONALD	m	You gotta tell a story too, Brian.  It's fair. C'mon, don't think too  hard --
BRIAN	m	I... I thought it was great. I loved  it. It was nothing to these guys...  medium deal.
RONALD	m	Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a  civilians hollering -- medium deal.  So young fireman Adcox and Captain  McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get  out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey  does the ballsy jump across... what  were you feeling, Brian? C'mon, you promised. Be honest. Okay... Guard!
BRIAN	m	-- I wanted to be him. Right then I  wanted to be him more than anything...
RONALD	m	Very good, Brian. -- About your report  here. The way to a torch's heart is  through his tools. That's how you  know him. It's the way he talks to  the fire. And to you if you listen.
BRIAN	m	The outlets.
RONALD	m	That's a probie answer. You're smarter  than that, Brian.
BRIAN	m	Trychticholorate.
RONALD	m	Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox  and McCaffrey, they go back inside.  Only there's another fire in there  nobody sees. And it took your dad,  didn't it Brian? Did you see him  burn?
BRIAN	m	Who the fuck is doing this?
RONALD	m	After it took your dad... the fire...  did it look at you Brian? Did it  talk to you?...
RONALD	m	You see, our world's aren't so  different...
BRIAN	m	Who's doing this?
RONALD	m	Think, Brian. Who doesn't love fire,  but knows it better than anyone else?  Who's around trychticholorate 24  hours a day?
BRIAN	m	Oh Jesus Christ...
RONALD	m	Not such a far walk after all, is  it, Brian?
BRIAN	m	Oh goddamn it Stephen...
STEPHEN	m	Hey, what are you doing here?
BRIAN	m	Just... Just wanted to say hello...
STEPHEN	m	So hello.
STEPHEN	m	Well, long as you're here you can  help clean up a little. I've got a  guy coming to look at this in a few  minutes.
BRIAN	m	You're selling dad's boat?
STEPHEN	m	Yeah, it's just another memory in my  life right now. And I got way too  many of them...
BRIAN	m	I really should get back. There's...  there's something I'm supposed to  do.
STEPHEN	m	Yeah? What have you got to do? Look at you. Look at your face. All  the things you must be thinking.  Man, you must really hate my guts.  Well, you know what? It's okay.
BRIAN	m	Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk  about this some other --
STEPHEN	m	-- Okay, so you don't like me. You  don't like everything I've done.  What, because I wasn't such a genius  the way I raised you? Jesus Christ,  dad was gone, what was I supposed to  do? You tell me, what the fuck was I  supposed to do?!
BRIAN	m	It's okay, Stephen, I --
STEPHEN	m	-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I  don't have all the answers, but  goddamn it, I've got some. Look, you're gonna do what you have  to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten  in the way. I'm your brother, not  your father. Go on. You gotta go  somewhere? Go...
BRIAN	m	I saw it.
STEPHEN	m	Saw what?
BRIAN	m	When dad died, I saw another fire...
STEPHEN	m	Everybody did.
BRIAN	m	I saw it before it got them. I tried  to yell, but... He asked me to look  out for him. And I didn't do it. I  let him die.
STEPHEN	m	...Jesus, you been carrying that  around for twenty years? For christ's  sake, you were seven years old! You  think he could have heard you in  there?
BRIAN	m	I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen.  You don't know how hard it was for  me to put that uniform on...
STEPHEN	m	Maybe I do. ...What a fuckin' mess, huh? People can change Brian.
BRIAN	m	Sometimes right when you're looking  at them.
BRIAN	m	Oh God, Stephen, what's going on  with you?
STEPHEN	m	I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
BRIAN	m	-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta  talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
STEPHEN	m	-- What are you doing here?
BRIAN	m	I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn!  I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen,  he's been killing people!
STEPHEN	m	I know.
BRIAN	m	How do you know?
STEPHEN	m	I knew when you came looking for the  chemicals. Looking for me.
BRIAN	m	-- What were they doing there?
STEPHEN	m	They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
GRINDLE	m	We gotta roll, Stevie...
STEPHEN	m	I'll be there.
GRINDLE	m	They're waitin' man.
STEPHEN	m	I'll be there, goddamn it!
STEPHEN	m	Anything else?
BRIAN	m	What are we going to do about this?
STEPHEN	m	I'll handle it.
BRIAN	m	We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
STEPHEN	m	I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility.  I'll handle it. Me.
BRIAN	m	Oh, Christ. Stephen...
BRIAN	m	Where are they? Where's 17?
CAPTAIN	m	On the roof.
BRIAN	m	Stephen --
STEPHEN	m	Brian?
AXE	m	Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
STEPHEN	m	-- What the fuck were you thinking,  huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
AXE	m	They were killing firemen, man. When  Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's  files... They were my friends, I had  to do it. I had to do it for the  department.
BRIAN	m	Did you do it for Tim?
AXE	m	That was an accident! Jesus Christ,  why did you have to go in there so  fucking early? Why didn't you listen  to me!
AXE	m	You gotta let me finish --
BRIAN	m	Just come down, John. Just --
AXE	m	-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking  puke if he saw how you've shit on  his department!
STEPHEN	m	-- Knock it off!
AXE	m	-- You can't let him turn you against  your friends, man --
BRIAN	m	-- He killed people --
AXE	m	-- You know what Swayzak would do to  the department if this got out? --
BRIAN	m	-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
AXE	m	-- What he would do to your dad's  department? You gotta let me finish  it --
BRIAN	m	You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it? Are you  Stephen?
STEPHEN	m	Shut up!
AXE	m	...What do you want me to do, Stephen?  Talk to me. What am I supposed to  do?
STEPHEN	m	There's a fire. We've got a job here.  Let's get on with it.
GRINDLE	m	Shit... It's going! Clear the roof!  Now!
STEPHEN	m	Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn  it!
STEPHEN	m	You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't  you stay behind a desk where you  belong?
BRIAN	m	"You never know till the fire stares  you down if you're gonna be --"
STEPHEN	m	Oh shut up, huh? I think I broke my goddamn arm...
STEPHEN	m	You stupid son of a bitch! What the  fuck are you doing!
AXE	m	Stevie... I...
STEPHEN	m	Let it go! Goddamn it let it go!
AXE	m	I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
BRIAN	m	Stephen!
STEPHEN	m	You go, we go.
BRIAN	m	NO!
BRIAN	m	You're gonna be all right, man.
BRIAN	m	Hey! Over here!
STEPHEN	m	Wait for another hose team...
STEPHEN	m	Wait for the goddamn hose team!
BRIAN	m	No... No more.
STEPHEN	m	That's my brother! That's my brother  goddamn it!
BRIAN	m	Another time, friend.
STEPHEN	m	You are such a pain in the ass...
STEPHEN	m	Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't  let 'em...
BRIAN	m	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought...  I won't.
PARAMEDIC	m	Oh shit, give him some lidocaine,  now. Now.
STEPHEN	m	Who's your brother?
PARAMEDIC	m	His pressure's fading -- push some  adrenalin.
BRIAN	m	Oh man, don't you die... Don't you  die...
PARAMEDIC #2	m	He's going south... He's gonna box  damn it...
BRIAN	m	Goddamn it don't you die now... Not  now!
PARAMEDIC	m	V-fib!
SHADOW	m	In the Chicago Fire Department the  alarm code 3-3-5 signifies that the  company has returned home to quarters.  We will now ring out that code to  welcome home John Adcox and Stephen  McCaffrey...
SHADOW	m	Your brother was a good man.
BRIAN	m	Yeah.
SHADOW	m	Another couple of good men get burned  up for their city? Is that how it's  going to read? You're the only one that knows.
BRIAN	m	Like it never happened...
SHADOW	m	Want to help me with something?
SHADOW	m	Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
SWAYZAK	m	Investigator...
SWAYZAK	m	I'm a little busy right now --
SHADOW	m	This'll only take a minute. There's  two cops outside that want to ask  you about this --
SHADOW	m	This is just a guess of course, but  I think they're gonna want to know  why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove,  Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to  create a phony manpower study. You guys'll wait, right?
BRIAN	m	See that glow flashing in the corner  of your eye? That's your career  dissipation light. And it just went  into high gear.
SHADOW	m	-- Brian.
SHADOW	m	Don't keep looking over your shoulder  for the ghost. It's gone now.
BRIAN	m	I think your boss is going to need  some spin control.
JENNIFER	f	I quit two days ago, Brian.
BRIAN	m	What'll you do?
JENNIFER	f	I don't have the slightest idea...
BRIAN	m	I'll see ya around, huh?
JENNIFER	f	It's a small town.
BRIAN	m	You're doing it wrong.
