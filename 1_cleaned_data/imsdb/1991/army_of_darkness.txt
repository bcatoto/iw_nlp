ASH	m	Why would you say that I am insane?  I wouldn't say that I've lost my mind simply because I've heard the voices and seen the godless things moving in the woods. If anything, I think more clearly now than ever before. I know now that there is such a thing as a living Evil. A dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we know, but between them. In the Dark. In the night. And it wants the exact same thing as you and I: a chance at warm life on this Earth. It doesn't care that is already had that chance ...once. Now listen closely because there isn't much time. Listen and believe, because it's all true.
ASH	m	I first saw the damn thing at that blasted cabin. The Necronomicon. An ancient Sumarrian text, bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. It contained bizarre burial rites, prophesies...and instruction for demon resurrection. It was never meant for the world of the living.
ASH	m	The book awoke something dark in the woods.
ASH	m	It got into my hand and it went bad.
ASH	m	So I lopped it off at the wrist.
ASH	m	In order to rid myself of the foul thing, I read from a passage in the book that was supposed to open a hole.  A hole in Time that would send the Evil back. And it worked.
ASH	m	...I just didn't plan on coming along.
WARRIOR #1	m	Hail to him who has come from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the Deadites!  Hail!
ASH	m	Take is easy now chief. I don't know how I got here and I'm not lookin' for any trouble.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	My Lord Arthur, I believe he is the promised one, written of in the Necronomicon.
ARTHUR	m	He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The one written of in the Book would not bleed.
ARTHUR	m	Likely, he is one of Henry's men. I say to the pit with him!  If he is truly the promised one... he will emerge.
WARRIOR #2 AND #3	m	Aye!  The pit's a fair test!
GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR	m	To the pit with the blackard!
ASH	m	Where the hell they put the stirrups on this thing!!??
ARTHUR	m	LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.
ASH	m	GIDDYPU!
ARTHUR	m	Bring the prisoner!
ASH	m	No!
ARTHUR	m	To the castle!
GOLD TOOTH	m	Move along now!
SHEILA	f	M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother? Did he not ride with you?
ARTHUR	m	Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But last night fell in battle to Duke Henry's men.
SHEILA	f	Foul thing!  A pox on your throat! Thou art a Murderer!  A black Murderer!
VILLAGE WOMAN #1	f	May you be consoled by their suffering in the pit.
DUKE HENRY	m	You sir, are not one of my vassals.  Who are you?
ASH	m	Who wants to know?
DUKE HENRY	m	I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale. Lord of the Northlands and leader of its people.
ASH	m	You ain't leadin' but two things now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack left town.
ARTHUR	m	There is an Evil that has awakened in this land.  And whilst my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Duke Henry the Red, wage war on us. Your people are no better than the foul corruption that lies in the bowels of that pit!  May God have mercy on your souls.
OLD WOMAN	f	Aye. Into the pit with the bloodthirsty sons of whores!
HENRY'S WARRIOR #1	m	I beg of you... by all that's holy!  Lower a rope!  Lower... Oh, for the love of god!  no!  NO!!! AIIIIIiiieee!
TOWER GUARD	m	There!  He's escaping!
ASH	m	Hey, I never even saw these assholes before.. You gotta tell 'em you don't know me. We never met. Tell him.
HENRY	m	I do not believe that he shall listen.
ASH	m	Come on, you blasted piece of--
ASH	m	All right now. Who wants to be next?  Who wants some.
ASH	m	You want some more?  Huh?!
ASH	m	Now climb on those horses and get out of here.
ARTHUR	m	Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
ASH	m	GIDDYUP NOW!!  HYAAAH!
ARTHUR	m	For that, I shall see you dead.
ASH	m	This is my boomstick. It's a twelve gauge, double barreled Remington pump. Next one of you primitives touch me...
ASH	m	Bring me your hoo do man.
SHEILA	f	I pray thee to forgive me.  I believed thee one of Henry's men.
ASH	m	First you wanta kill me, now ya wanna kiss me.
ASH	m	Lady, just leave me alone.
SHEILA	f	I'm sorry m'lord. Please understand... T'is a cruel time for us. The Wisemen say you are the promised one. Our only hope against the darkness that has descended on this land.
ASH	m	They're mistaken.
SHEILA	f	I think not.  I feel that there is reason for your being here. It is no accident.
ASH	m	Well what is it?  Can you send me back or not?
WISEMAN JOHN	m	Only the Necronomicon has the power.  A power which we both require. It contains passages that can dispel the Evil from this place and return you to your time.
ASH	m	The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's the thing that got me here.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	It is in a place far from here. It can only be retrieved by the Promised one. Other Warriors have tried.  Their widows grieve still. We have waited long years for you. Out only hope is the Necronomicon. Thou must undertake to quest for it.  Alone must thou travel to a distant cemetery. There thou shalt find it.
ASH	m	Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm goin' is home.
POSSESSED WOMAN	f	YOU SHALL DIE!
POSSESSED WOMAN	f	YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE
ASH	m	It's a trick.  Get an axe.
POSSESSED WOMAN	f	The Evil lives.  Slay me and ten will rise to take my place.  All will die.  ALL WILL -
POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD	f	---DIE!
WISEMAN JOHN	m	Now.  Will thou quest for the Necronomicon?
ASH	m	What's going on?
WISEMAN JOHN	m	This is the edge of the land ruled by the Dark Spirit. This path will lead you to an unholy place. A cemetery. There, the Necronomicon awaits.
WARRIOR #1	m	Lord Arthur, he is supplied.  Now I beg of you, let us leave this foul place.
ARTHUR	m	A moment.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	As thou removest the Book from it's cradle, you must recite these words.  Clatoo, verata, Nicto.
ASH	m	Clatto Verata Nicto.  Okay.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	Repeat them.
ASH	m	Clatto Verata Nicto.
WISEMAN #1	m	Again.
ASH	m	I got it.  I got it.  I know your damn words. All right?  Now you get this straight: I get the book, you send me back. That's the deal. After that I'm history.
ASH	m	HAAAAAA!
ASH	m	Come on!  Come on!
ASH	m	Blasted piece of junk!
ASH	m	Anybody here?!
ASH	m	This place'll do for the night. Get the book in the morning.
ASH	m	Damn this cold.
ASH	m	'least I won't freeze to death.
ASH	m	Easy, boy.
ASH	m	Ooops.
ASH	m	Nasty little thing's inside me. Well let's see how you like a little hot water!
ASH	m	Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
ASH	m	Soon as I get out of this thing
ASH	m	No!  Not the teeth!
ASH	m	Where the hell are ya!?
ASH	m	I can't see ya!!
ASH	m	No, no--not the poke--
ASH	m	Okay then.
ASH	m	Dear God, it's growing bigger!
GOOD ASH	m	What... are you?  Are you me?
BAD ASH	m	WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You sound like a jerk!
GOOD ASH	m	Why are you doing this?!
BAD ASH	m	Wanna know?  'cause the answers easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash, and yer...
EVIL ASH	m	...Little goody two-
GOOD ASH	m	Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the gun.
ASH	m	I know better than to bury you whole.
ASH	m	Now you see what's what.  Man's body is his own personal property. Don't anybody try to take that away from him.
EVIL ASH HEAD	m	You'll never get that Book. I will come back for you.
ASH	m	Hey, what's that you got on your face?
EVIL ASH HEAD	m	Huh?
ASH	m	Rest in pieces.
ASH	m	This must be it. The cemetery.
ASH	m	Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said anything about that. Ha!  That Wiseman was so busy fillin' me fulla his secret words and phrases and, and, his... bullshit, he forgot to mention anything about that.  Like do I take all of 'em of one or 'em, or what?  Well...
  ASH	m	Woah.  Wrong book.
ASH	m	Huh.
ASH	m	Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!
ASH	m	Okay.The words.  Say the words. KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh... Necta... uh... Nectar... Necktie... uh...
ASH	m	KLATOO... VERATA...
ASH	m	Okay then.
ASH	m	Hey, wait a minute. Everything's cool!  I said the words!  I did!
WISEMAN JOHN	m	Something is amiss.
ASH	m	No.. no more...
ASH	m	Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU!
ASH	m	Keep you damn filthy bones outta my mouth.
ASH	m	I'm through bein' their garbage boy.  I did my part of the bargain. Now they owe me.  Like in the deal.  I want back.
GOLD TOOTH	m	Open the gates. The Promised one has returned!
VILLAGERS	?	The stranger has returned!  He's brought the book!
WISEMAN JOHN	m	The Necronomicon.  Quickly.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	Did you bring the Necronomicon!
ASH	m	Yes. It's just that...
WISEMAN JOHN	m	Just what?!
ASH	m	Nothing. Here Now send be back. Like in the deal.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	No...I sensed something had gone awry. The book's power. It's gone.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	When you removed the Necronomicon from it's cradle, did you speak the words?
ASH	m	Yeah.  basically.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	Did you speak the exact words?!
ASH	m	Well, maybe not every single syllable, no.  But basically I said them.  Yes.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	Dung eating fool!  Thou hast doomed us. When thou misspoke the words the Army of the Dead was awoke.
ASH	m	Hey. We had a deal. You told me, you could clean this thing up, once I got you the book. You said there was a passage in there that could get rid of this thing and send me back.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	The passage is useless to us as long as these evil dead walk. They have a terrible desire for this book. And they shall come here to get it. Once in their possession, the Evil shall rule the Earth for one thousand years...Because of you...we are doomed.
ASH	m	You wanted the damn book. You got yer book. I did my part of the deal.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	We did strike a bargain. I will return you to your own time as promised.
ASH	m	Yeah. Well good. That was the deal.  So uh...when do you think we can...
ASH	m	I mean...when can you send me...
ARTHUR	m	The Wisemen were fools to believe that you were the Promised one. That one such as you could have saved us!.
SHEILA	f	I still believe that thou wilt help us.
ASH	m	No.. They're right.  I screwed up. I didn't come through for you, and...  I'm sorry for it.
SHEILA	f	I still have faith in thee. In my heart I know thou wilt still succeed.
ASH	m	Sheila... It's over for me. I don't belong here and I'm going home. I didn't have what it took. It's over.
ASH	m	No!
SHEILA	f	M'Lord Ash!  Help me!
ASH	m	Damn you!
SCOUT	m	An army of the dead!  They have gathered in the wilderness and come this way.
ARTHUR	m	How far from here?
SCOUT	m	But two days ride.
ARTHUR	m	Then these winged ones are only the first of them.
WISEMAN	m	Perhaps we should go from this place while we can.
GOLD TOOTH	m	We could be safe in the mountains.
WARRIORS	m	Yes!  To the mountains!  We must flee! They'll take our souls!
ASH	m	Go ahead and run.  Run home and cry to mama.  I'm through runnin'. I stay we stay and fight.
ARTHUR	m	How will we stop an army of the dead at out castle walls?  How will you fight that?!  With more words? Most of out people have already fled.  We are but forty men.
ASH	m	We'll get Henry the Red and his men to fight with us.
ARTHUR	m	We shall not stand in battle, alongside the likes of him. Our honor will not allow it.
ASH	m	Then you'll die.  Honor and all. Now who's with me?
BLACKSMITH	m	I'll stand by you.
WARRIOR #7	m	You may count on my steel.
WARRIOR #8	m	And mine!
EVIL ASH	m	Dig!  Dig faster!  I want every black hearted, worm infested, son of a bitch that ever died in battle! We'll storm their castle and take the book!  Then my lads, eternal life shall by ours!
EVIL ASH	m	Why ain't you a sweet little thing?
SHEILA	f	Don't touch me!  You foul thing!
EVIL ASH	m	Your gonna learn to live me missy.
SHEILA	f	The Promised one will come for you.
EVIL ASH	m	Darlin' I'm gonna save him the trouble.
HENRY WARRIOR #1	m	He wears the insignia of Arthur!
HENRY WARRIOR #2	m	Slay him!
HENRY	m	Stay your arms!
HENRY	m	T'is the stranger who spared me from the pit. What brings you?
ASH	m	The Army of the Dead.
HENRY	m	What of them?
ASH	m	They're headed towards Arthur's castle. We need your help. Fight with us.
HENRY	m	So you are a vassal of Arthur now? You have taken up sides with him against me.
ASH	m	The only side I'm takin' is the one that's gonna stop those things.
HENRY	m	Why should I endanger my people to save my enemy?
ASH	m	Because after they finish with Arthur they'll come after you. Together, we've got a chance. Besides, you owe me.
EVIL ASH	m	Who rules?!
ASH	m	You eyeballin' me boy?
WARRIOR #9	m	No, M'Lord.
ASH	m	I can't hear you!
WARRIOR #9	m	NO, M'LORD!!
ASH	m	You squeekin' like a mouse!  Are you a mouse boy?!
WARRIOR #9	m	NO, M'LORD!
ASH	m	Where you from, mouse?!
WARRIOR #9	m	I hail from the village of Perth.
ASH	m	Only two things come from Perth: steers and queers. Which are you?
WARRIOR	m	They're coming!  The Deadites approach!
SKELETON CAPTAIN	m	M'Lord!  We are positioned on both fronts!
EVIL ASH	m	Where are they keeping my book?
SKELETON CAPTAIN #1	m	Most likely...there, in the castle's keep. It would be the safest place.  It is behind two walls that must be taken first.
EVIL ASH	m	Excellent. Proceed.
SKELETON CAPTAIN #1	m	Forward!
ASH	m	Arrows!
ARTHUR	m	Load!
ASH	m	Fire!
ARTHUR	m	Fire!
SCOUT	m	M'Lord!  A second division approaching from the South.
ASH	m	CATAPULTS...SOUTH!
ARTHUR	m	Powder!
SKELETON CAPTAIN #1	m	Permission to regroup, m'Lord.
EVIL ASH	m	You needn't bother.
EVIL ASH	m	You are now my captain. I will now allow anything to stop me from possessing the Necronomicon. Get me into that castle.
NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN	m	RAM THE GATES!
EVIL ASH	m	Arrows!
ARTHUR	m	Where is Henry?!
ASH	m	He'll be here.
ARTHUR	m	I think he will not. But know this.  No matter how this battle fares, I was wrong to think you a coward.
ARTHUR	m	They're coming in. What now?!
ARTHUR	m	Fall back!  Man the Parapet!  Protect the book or God save us all!
EVIL ASH	m	The book shall be mine!
WARRIOR #2	m	We can't hold this wall much longer!
EVIL SHEILA	m	Thou didst find me beautiful once.
ASH	m	Honey...You got real ugly.
SKELETON ASH	m	You're finished.
SKELETON ASH	m	I possess the Necronomicon. I've crushed your pathetic army. Now I'll have my vengeance!
GUARD	m	Duke Henry's men!  They've come!
ASH	m	We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure we had our problems.  But in the end, he was all right.
ASH	m	Peace was made between the two peoples.  And a new nation was formed.  They offered my a chance to stay among them and teach them. A chance to lead them.  To be King.  But Sheila was gone. Besides, I had places to go.
WISEMAN JOHN	m	The Book tells us that each drop allows a man to sleep a century. Swallow six drops, and thou shalt awaken in thine own time.
ASH	m	Yeah.  Right... ...but what other choice did I have?
ASH	m	I had to find a place to crash. For a very long time.
ASH	m	YAHH!!
ASH	m	I locked the door.
ASH	m	I closed my eyes.
ASH	m	I took a drink.
ASH	m	I didn't know if it was day or night. I started... to get drowsy... And I slept...
ASH	m	...And dreamed.
ASH	m	Dreams last lasted centuries.
ASH	m	And when I awoke...
ASH	m	....I found that I had slept too long.
