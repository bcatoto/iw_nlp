GIRL	f	I can see you...
DARLA	f	-- and we know from yesterday that the base of a triangle times half the height equals the area.
DARLA	f	Yes, Mia?
GIRL	f	Lucy's asleep again.
DARLA	f	Let her sleep.
GANG MEMBER	m	He would just go off, you know, start tearin' the place down. You didn't even know why he was doin' it half the time, you just got out of his way...
EMILY	f	And what you learned from your father now Diego's learning from you...?
EMILY	f	That really upsets you, doesn't it?
GANG MEMBER	m	Yeah. Cuz I mean I don't want him to be like me.
EMILY	f	A whole week without skipping school? Is that true?
EMILY	f	That's the last time I make a bet with you. (to his parents) See you guys next week.
EMILY	f	You cut your hair. It looks great.
EMILY	f	No one is trying to steal your child, they found bruises and cigarette burns -- Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report -- well, if you feel you need legal representation that's perfectly within your rights...
WAYNE	m	How many active cases you have?
EMILY	f	Thirty-eight.
EMILY	f	No, absolutely not, look at this, Wayne, look, I'm buried --
WAYNE	m	Sorry, Em, we all are.
EMILY	f	Don't fight. Hey, that's his.
DOUG'S VOICE	m	Exhausted, her career path questionable, her faith in mankind shaken, she resisted her tendency toward introspection and went to have a drink with her friend Doug.
DOUG	m	I am so in your head.
EMILY	f	Be honest. The whole psychology thing, it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?
DOUG	m	Regrettably, yes.
EMILY	f	You know what freaks me out?
DOUG	m	That you have a four-year degree and make seventeen grand a year after taxes?
EMILY	f	I sit there talking to these families, you know, like I'm some expert. My family's a train wreck. I mean, I had this moment today where I realized I might be totally full of it.
DOUG	m	Everybody's full of it. In the end you're a number to call for people who don't have anyone else. There's no way that's bad.
EMILY	f	Hey Becca...
FRIEND	m	Hey. So one of us is a major screwup, I can't remember if I was supposed to call you or the other way around...?
EMILY	f	No, it's me, it's just been a crazy couple weeks. You remember Doug.
FRIEND	m	Hi. (then to Emily) Listen, my ride's leaving, let's catch up soon, okay?
DOUG	m	So anyway, I've done some soul searching and I just want to say that if a full-on relationship feels like too much right now, I'd be willing to consider a purely physical one.
DOUG	m	Hey, you might actually enjoy yourself.
EMILY	f	I'm sure I would, I just...
DOUG	m	I know, I know, the job, you get home you don't have anything left.
EMILY	f	If it were anyone, it'd be you.
EMILY	f	What are they doing to you?
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	What?
EMILY	f	Emily Jennings. Child Services? We spoke on the phone...?
MARGARET	f	You said the seventeenth.
EMILY	f	Today is the seventeenth.
MARGARET	f	Is not.
EMILY	f	I'm sorry, but it is.
MARGARET	f	Friday was the thirteenth.
EMILY	f	Friday was the fourteenth, that makes today the seventeenth. Monday the seventeenth. The date of our appointment.
EMILY	f	Come down, I'd like to meet you.
EMILY	f	My name's Emily. What's yours?
LUCY	f	Lucy.
EMILY	f	Pretty name. Pretty girl.
EMILY	f	Is there somewhere we can talk?
EMILY	f	When do you expect your husband back?
EMILY	f	Because we've found it's more beneficial if the whole family participates.
MARGARET	f	Well he's not home so...
EMILY	f	Do you have any way of contacting him?
MARGARET	f	Not if I don't know where he is.
EMILY	f	Is that...?
EMILY	f	Would you ask him to join us?
MARGARET	f	He doesn't have anything to say.
EMILY	f	Would you ask him?
EMILY	f	It'll be okay.
EMILY	f	Hi, I'm Emily --
EMILY	f	I'm here today because Lucy's school is concerned about changes they're seeing in her academic performance. The kinds of changes they're seeing are often associated with family problems.
MARGARET	f	Eddie says we don't have family problems.
EMILY	f	That's just it, many times a family won't even know they're having problems until it's too late. That's where we come in. We help families communicate and learn healthier ways of resolving conflict.
MARGARET	f	Eddie says we don't need your help.
EMILY	f	Mr Sheridan, is there some reason you won't speak to me directly?
EMILY	f	Is there some reason why your husband won't speak to me directly?
MARGARET	f	Eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger.
WAYNE	m	No laws against being weird, Em. Send it over to CMC, we'll do a follow-up in a month.
EMILY	f	I didn't say weird, I said scary. The guy sat there the entire time staring at me, the mother is like his emotional slave.
WAYNE	m	Wait, did you just fly to New York and meet my parents?
EMILY	f	Wayne, this girl's in trouble. I can feel it.
WAYNE	m	Wanna know what I can feel? The lawsuit we're gonna get hit with if we violate her parents' rights without any evidence they've done something wrong.
EMILY	f	Every time I talk to you you sound more like a lawyer, you know that?
WAYNE	m	Yeah, well, maybe because every time I make an emotional decision I get called by one. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to let this one go.
EMILY	f	You put these files in front of me and you ask me to tell you what's going on. Well, I'm telling you, there's something going on and it's not something good. I've done my job, I've told you, what you do with it is yours.
EDWARD	m	They really are God's miracles. Day she was born was the happiest day of our lives. We're not perfect parents, we know that, but we figure if you let `em know how much you love `em a lot of the other stuff takes care of itself.
EMILY	f	Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've suddenly acquired the power of speech, doesn't it concern you a little that Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's in three months?
EDWARD	m	Course it does, she's our daughter.
EMILY	f	So you have no idea why she's falling asleep at school every day? Why she's not able to sleep at home?
EDWARD	m	Bad dreams?
EMILY	f	He's gonna be having bad dreams when he gets hit with child endangerment. (off Wayne's reluctance) Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's little girl routine?
WAYNE	m	So they're overcompensating a little.
EMILY	f	A little? Let me talk to her. Alone. She wants to talk.
EMILY	f	Five minutes. Talk to them about how much they love kids.
EMILY	f	I knew someone at school named Lucy, she was a writer. Do you ever write? I do sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm feeling.
EMILY	f	Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water up my nose. So much for establishing trust.
EMILY	f	What's happening to you? I can help. Let me help.
EMILY	f	What is it, sweetheart?
LUCY	f	They hate me.
EMILY	f	I'm sure they don't hate you.
LUCY	f	They do. I hear them. They go in the cellar and talk.
EMILY	f	What do they talk about?
LUCY	f	Sending me to hell.
EMILY	f	You've heard them say that?
EMILY	f	It's okay. You can tell him. He's on our side.
WAYNE	m	Did you hear your parents say they were going to hurt you?
EMILY	f	She doesn't trust anybody. You think I made it up?
WAYNE	m	I think you'd do just about anything you had to do to help a child you thought was at risk. Here are the facts, Emily. They haven't laid a finger on her that we can tell. And we have no proof they intend to. Meanwhile on your desk right now are thirty-plus cases of actionable abuse. What about those?
EMILY	f	I'm not giving up on her, Wayne.
WAYNE	m	Yes, you are, you're leaving this alone.
EMILY	f	I hope you can live with a dead child on your conscience.
WAYNE	m	That's a little unfair, don't you think? I care about these kids as much as you do, but we can't go around yanking them out of their homes on a hunch. Parents, even bad ones, have rights, that's how the laws of this great land are written.
EMILY	f	So that's it? We let kids get killed until they rewrite the goddamn laws?
BARRON	m	Was just thinking about you, got a nice letter from Sandy Hutchinson...
BARRON	m	Well, it's sitting in front of me which means our good friend Wayne thinks it fails to meet the criteria for child endangerment and has told you in no uncertain terms to leave it alone...?
EMILY	f	Surprise, surprise.
BARRON	m	I can't, Emily. I'm sorry.
EMILY	f	Mike, I'm desperate here.
BARRON	m	You know how dear to my heart the work you do is, but the department doesn't pay me to stakeout potential child abusers. Last time almost cost me my job.
EMILY	f	This girl heard her parents say they're going to send her to hell.
BARRON	m	Sickening as that is, you're a part of the system that handles those situations, I'm not.
EMILY	f	The system is broken.
BARRON	m	Maybe you just need to let it work.
EMILY	f	What? Jesus, I feel like I'm talking to Wayne. You don't want to get involved, fine, but don't bullshit me, I'm running out of people I respect.
BARRON	m	Okay. No bullshit. Give me evidence of a crime, I'll be all over it. Till then there's nothing I can do.
EMILY	f	I just wanted you to know I haven't forgotten about you. I'm doing everything I can.
LUCY	f	If I disappear will you come look for me?
EMILY	f	You're not going to disappear.
LUCY	f	If I do?
LUCY	f	I have to go. They get mad when I miss the bus.
EMILY	f	Lucy, wait...
EMILY	f	If anything happens, call me, okay? Just press this. Don't let your parents know you have it.
EMILY	f	I'm gonna get you out of there, I promise.
ANSWERING MACHINE	m	Hey, this is Doug, here it comes -
EMILY	f	It's me, thought you might be up, um, anyway, call if you get this.
EMILY	f	Too late, I met someone else...
EMILY	f	(concerned but calm) Lucy? Are you okay?
EMILY	f	Why? Why are you scared, honey?
EMILY	f	Why are you sorry?
EMILY	f	Okay, listen, I want you to go over and open the window. Can you do that? Lucy...?
EMILY	f	Lucy, no, wake up!
EMILY	f	Lucy...?!
EMILY	f	Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I told you about, I think she's in trouble - - yeah, I know what you said, but -- Mike, you're not listening -- HELP ME!
BARRON	m	What are we doing here?
EMILY	f	Saving her life!
BARRON	m	They're asleep.
EMILY	f	They're not asleep.
EMILY	f	Did you hear that?
BARRON	m	I didn't hear anything.
EMILY	f	Leave her alone!
EMILY	f	Did you hear that?!
BARRON	m	Police, open up!
EMILY	f	Break it down!
EMILY	f	BREAK IT DOWN!
EMILY	f	LUCY?!
EMILY	f	Oh my God...
BARRON	m	The hell's the matter with you people?!
EMILY	f	I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha...
STATE PROSECUTOR	m	Prosecution asks that you disallow an insanity defense. This was an act committed with premeditation, malice
PUBLIC DEFENDER	m	Your honor, the egregiousness of the crime makes the competency question all the more relevant.
JUDGE	m	Yes. I hereby order the defendants undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental fitness for trial.
EMILY	f	Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing your kid, Freudian dream analysis.
BARRON	m	Well, you're gonna hate me for saying this, but my money's on crazy.
EMILY	f	Did they or did they not know what they were doing? That's the legal standard. They knew, they knew damn well!
BARRON	m	It's not that simple sometimes.
EMILY	f	(stops on a dime) Meaning what exactly?
BARRON	m	When we brought them in that night they told Captain Lister... They think she's evil, some kind of demon spirit, minion of the devil or something.
EMILY	f	Oh, that's great - what is this, late- night cable?
BARRON	m	No, but that might be the world they're living in.
DOUG	m	-- and what's the most important thing we talked about that you have to remember?
LUCY	f	It's not my fault what happened.
DOUG	m	That's right and you know what? It's not.
DOUG	m	That is some seriously proactive social work happenin' there. You all right?
EMILY	f	Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing?
DOUG	m	Typical reaction, blames herself. We'll get there. I'm gonna put her in a group setting, see if I can get her to open up.
EMILY	f	Group therapy for kids, what's that say about the world?
EMILY	f	Good news. You get to leave here tomorrow.
LUCY	f	Doug said I might have to go to a state home.
EMILY	f	Only for a few days, till we find a better place.
LUCY	f	Why can't I live with you?
EMILY	f	Oh, sweetheart. That would never be allowed.
LUCY	f	Why?
EMILY	f	It's complicated, there's a whole process, I'm not even a foster parent...
EMILY	f	I'm sorry.
COORDINATOR	m	They were supposed to call you. We don't have any rooms.
EMILY	f	Nothing?
COORDINATOR	m	There was a mixup with the dates. Sorry.
EMILY	f	Hey, are you hungry? Let's get some lunch. What kind of food do you like?
LUCY	f	There's nowhere for me to go is there?
EMILY	f	I can't, Lucy, it wouldn't work, I live in this tiny house, I... I'm sorry, I'm not mom material...
LUCY	f	You don't have to be my mom. Just my friend.
EMILY	f	I know what it feels like to be that age and be unwanted. It's terrifying. She needs to be with someone she trusts; she trusts me. So much of our time is spent negotiating red tape, I think if we just look at the situation - this one situation, this one child - it's clear what's best for her.
NANCY	f	This is highly irregular and I'll tell you right now it makes me very uncomfortable. But since, Wayne, you've spoken so persuasively on Miss Jennings's behalf...
EMILY	f	I like to think of it as a glass-half- full situation. Kitchen. Bathroom. Fish. And here, is your room...
EMILY	f	Be okay?
LUCY	f	Where's your family?
EMILY	f	My family... well, I've met my dad twice and my mom's not a part of my life anymore.
LUCY	f	Why?
EMILY	f	(choosing her words) Sometimes people have kids and then decide they don't want to be parents.
EMILY	f	I'm glad you're here.
LUCY	f	What's this?
EMILY	f	Chamomile, when I get stressed out it helps me sleep.
EMILY	f	None of this ever should have happened, if I could make it go away I would.
LUCY	f	You did.
EMILY	f	I'm right down the hall if you need me.
EMILY	f	I have to grab some of her things, might take me a minute.
COURT CLERK	m	I trust ya, Em, make sure you lock it on the way out.
DOUG	m	Sometimes when our parents aren't getting along it's better if they don't see each other for a while, that's what a `restraining order' does...
DOUG	m	She's starting to come out of her shell. It's good, I just wish I thought it was me making the difference.
EMILY	f	I went by the house. I think her mom and dad were barricading themselves in their room at night. How sick is that?
DOUG	m	Hatred and fear are part of the same pathology - oh, but I forgot, you don't think they're crazy.
EMILY	f	I'm coming around.
EMILY	f	Okay?
EMILY	f	This is your new beginning.
LUCY	f	I love you, Emily.
EMILY	f	I love you, too.
COWORKER	?	Wayne's looking for you.
COWORKER #2	?	Wayne wants to --
EMILY	f	Got it.
EMILY	f	What's up with Diego?
WAYNE	m	Why don't we talk in my office.
EMILY	f	Tell me what's going on.
WAYNE	m	We don't know why yet, but... he killed his mother and father last night.
EMILY	f	What happened?
BARRON	m	Sure you want to see this?
BARRON	m	Gets a tire iron from the garage, comes back inside, locks all the doors and windows, kills them in their sleep...
BARRON	m	Had to use dental records to identify the bodies.
EMILY	f	An eight-year-old did this? There's no way.
BARRON	m	I was there when they brought him in. Took three guys my size to subdue him. Kid was climbing the walls.
BARRON	m	Just your average American family.
EMILY	f	Where is he now?
BARRON	m	Juvie lockup. And, no, I'm not taking you to see him.
EMILY	f	You want to know what happened?
BARRON	m	I know what happened.
EMILY	f	I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike, please, I care about this kid.
EMILY	f	Diego...
EMILY	f	Let me in. He won't hurt me.
DIEGO	m	Are they dead?
EMILY	f	What happened? Tell me what happened.
DIEGO	m	I killed my mum and dad...
DOUG	m	Every family you sit down with every day of every week is a family in crisis. Those are your odds. That's the job you do. Trying to beat them.
DOUG	m	You're one person, Em. You can't save the world. I know somebody you did save.
LUCY	f	You okay?
EMILY	f	It's just work. Don't worry.
LUCY	f	Why do you do it if it makes you sad?
EMILY	f	My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess maybe I want to believe families can work, so I can have my own someday, I don't know - does that make sense?
EMILY	f	(calls to other room) Breakfast.
EMILY	f	Honey, breakfa--
EMILY	f	Come on, let me see...
EMILY	f	You went through my things?
LUCY	f	I'm sorry... I wanted to know what happened to you.
LUCY	f	Is that your mom?
EMILY	f	She used to just leave, she'd just... ...and I never knew when she was coming back, or if she was... I used to think it was my fault and I would try so hard when she got home to be good, do everything I could think of, so she'd think I was `special' and stay next time or take me with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd always go away again, that's how it was.
LUCY	f	Where was your dad?
EMILY	f	Gone, he left before I was born. First time I met him I was like thirteen.
LUCY	f	What'd you say to him?
EMILY	f	Oh, I had all these things I was gonna say. Angry things I'd thought of and kind of memorized. And um.... And then I met him and I wasn't angry, I was just sad and I told him... (pauses, raw emotion) I said, I love you, even if you don't love me.
LUCY	f	Are you mad at me?
EMILY	f	No... No, I'm not mad at you. (puts her arm around her) But I need you not to do that again, okay? Go through my private things without asking?
EMILY	f	Omelet's getting cold. Better hurry.
WAYNE	m	I need another set of eyes to go over them, make sure we haven't missed anything else.
EMILY	f	You mean, to make sure I haven't missed anything else?
WAYNE	m	It's just a legal thing. You'll have them back tomorrow.
BARRON	m	You watch, six months, their lawyer will hire some expert to say they're rehabbed and they'll sue for custody when they get out.
EMILY	f	She's not going back there, I'll take her out of state before I let them near her again.
BARRON	m	I didn't hear you say that.
EMILY	f	You wanted to talk about something?
BARRON	m	We pulled the Martinezes' phone records. They got a call that night before the murders.
EMILY	f	From who?
BARRON	m	Emily, the call came from your house.
EMILY	f	What...?
BARRON	m	Look, I'm not accusing you of anything, I just need to know what was said.
EMILY	f	That's impossible. I might have called the week before...?
BARRON	m	I'm talking to you as a friend here, you know that, right?
EMILY	f	Did you not hear me? I'm telling you, Mike, as a friend, I did not call that family.
BARRON	m	Then who did? Go find the guy who broke in and just happened to dial the number of a kid whose case you handle.
LUCY	f	He's in my group... (puts down photo) ...why, did something happen?
BARRON	m	We're trying to figure out why. He got a call Thursday night from this number. I'm just wondering if he might have said anything...
LUCY	f	It wasn't me.
BARRON	m	You didn't call him?
BARRON	m	Lucy, it's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but I know you will because you're a good little girl.
LUCY	f	I am telling the truth.
EMILY	f	My backup files are in your room. Diego's is in there. Maybe you got curious and went through some, dialed a number?
LUCY	f	It wasn't me, I swear.
BARRON	m	The call was at 2 am, are you ever up that late?
LUCY	f	I didn't call him.
BARRON	m	Are you ever up that late?
EMILY	f	Mike, she said no. Maybe someone made a mistake.
BARRON	m	Yeah, maybe so. Night, Lucy.
BARRON	m	She's lying.
LUCY	f	Do you believe me?
EMILY	f	I believe you.
EMILY	f	Give me back my cases or fire me. Right now.
EMILY	f	I don't care if it's a hairline fracture, he broke her arm, I don't want him back in that house. He what? He found Christ? When? That recently? Uh huh. Well he should have found Him sooner.
EMILY	f	What's up?
DOUG	m	Copy of the Sheridans' psych evals for the file. And the cognitive profile Lucy did for me the other day.
EMILY	f	(re: Lucy's profile) How's it look?
DOUG WINTERS	m	Normal.
EMILY	f	Do I have to beg or are you gonna tell me what's going on?
DOUG	m	You have to beg. Coming from an environment like that, testing this normal is a bit abnormal, if that makes any sense.
EMILY	f	She's `abnormally normal'?
DOUG	m	I think she faked it, gave the answers she thought she should.
EMILY	f	Why would she do that?
DOUG	m	She's ashamed of who she is. Ashamed of how she feels. Afraid nobody would want her if they saw the real her. (off Emily's reaction) It's no big deal, it just means I might have to push her a little.
EMILY	f	No, I know, I just... The Martinezes' got a call Thursday night. From my house.
DOUG	m	Did you ask her about it?
EMILY	f	She said she didn't. Mike thinks she's lying.
DOUG	m	What do you think?
EMILY	f	I don't know what to think.
DOUG	m	Hmm. Bring her in after work, I'll do a one-on-one. I wanted to talk to her about this anyway.
EMILY	f	Got you an extra in case it gets cold.
EMILY	f	I need to ask you something... about the night it happened... did you get a call, really late?
EMILY	f	You didn't?
EMILY	f	Diego, I know you did, they called from my house.
EMILY	f	What's the matter? What's scaring you?
EMILY	f	Oh God...
EMILY	f	It's okay... slow breaths... you'll be okay... (yelling down hall) Can somebody help us down here?!
NURSE	f	He asked to see you before you left.
EMILY	f	Who called you? Was it Lucy?
EMILY	f	Did she say something to you? Something that scared you?
DIEGO	m	El dijo...
EMILY	f	`El' dijo? What do you mean, `He said'?
DIEGO	m	Era un hombre.
EMILY	f	It was a man?
LUCY	f	Do... you... like... working... here?
EMILY	f	Well, photocopying isn't much fun.
EMILY	f	What...?
DOUG	m	Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys. Ready, kiddo?
DOUG	m	Go ahead down, I'll be right there.
DOUG	m	You all right?
EMILY	f	This is weird. Diego said it was Lucy that called, but he called her a he, he said it was a man.
DOUG	m	So how's school?
LUCY	f	Fine.
DOUG	m	Any of your classmates giving you a hard time?
LUCY	f	No, they've been nice.
DOUG	m	Sleeping okay?
LUCY	f	That's not really what you want to talk about, is it, Doug?
DOUG	m	You got me.
DOUG	m	Question 16a, are you afraid of the dark? You answered `no'. Question 16b, are you afraid of being alone? `No'. 16c, are afraid of your parents? `No'. You answered `no' to everything in that section. I think some of those should have been yesses. Everybody is afraid of something. Working through our fears, conquering them, is how we get better. So I want you to tell me... What scares you?
LUCY	f	I'll tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you.
DOUG	m	Fair enough. When I was twelve I was climbing a tree and I accidentally put my hand through a giant hornets' nest. They didn't like it. I got stung over a hundred times. They had to rush me to the hospital. I've been afraid of hornets ever since. Don't climb many trees either. Everybody has fears. Now, what scares you?
LUCY	f	Me.
DOUG	m	You scare yourself?
LUCY	f	Sometimes.
DOUG	m	Why, what about yourself scares you?
LUCY	f	I have bad thoughts.
DOUG	m	About what?
LUCY	f	People.
DOUG	m	People in general or certain people?
LUCY	f	Certain people.
DOUG	m	Like who?
LUCY	f	You.
DOUG	m	You have bad thoughts about me? Why?
LUCY	f	I just do.
DOUG	m	Was there something I said or did that upset you?
LUCY	f	(shakes her head) It's just the way you are...
DOUG	m	How am I?
LUCY	f	Facile.
DOUG	m	Facile? (she nods yes) Do you even know what that means?
LUCY	f	Easily comprehended. Often lacking sincerity or depth. You're smug, too. Want me to tell you what that means?
DOUG	m	Well, if, um, if I seemed `smug' or `facile' I want to -
LUCY	f	Don't apologize.
DOUG	m	Why?
LUCY	f	You're a grown up, it's embarrassing.
	?	50.
LUCY	f	Should we talk about school now? My grades are getting a lot better.
DOUG	m	Talked to a lot of ten-year-olds, I don't think I've ever felt like that before...
EMILY	f	Like what?
DOUG	m	Threatened. I know a specialist, I'll call him in the morning.
EMILY	f	What do I do with her in the meantime?
DOUG	m	Don't let her get in your head.
LUCY	f	Are you mad at me?
EMILY	f	No. Just tired.
LUCY	f	Want me to brush your hair?
EMILY	f	That's okay.
LUCY	f	Are you sure?
EMILY	f	Some other time.
LUCY	f	It will make you feel better. I'll get the brush.
EMILY	f	I said no, thank you.
LUCY	f	Doug said something, didn't he?
EMILY	f	No. Doug? He says you're doing great.
LUCY	f	What did he tell you?
EMILY	f	Nothing.
LUCY	f	You're funny.
EMILY	f	Get some rest.
LUCY	f	You forgot to kiss me goodnight.
EMILY	f	Goodnight.
LUCY	f	I love you.
EMILY	f	I love you, too.
DOUG	m	Hello?
DOUG	m	Hello...?
DOUG	m	Try again, sorry.
DOUG	m	FUCK!
EMILY	f	See you next week.
DENISE	f	Seen Doug? He had an appointment with one of my kids this morning, never showed up.
EMILY	f	Did you try calling him?
DENISE	f	All I get is voicemail.
ANSWERING MACHINE	m	Hey, this is Doug, here it comes -
EMILY	f	Cover my desk.
EMILY	f	Doug, it's me, it's Emily...
EMILY	f	Doug?
EMILY	f	Doug, you here?
EMILY	f	NOOOOO!!!!!
EMILY	f	Dr Johannsen?
EMILY	f	You did the autopsy on Doug Winters?
CORONER	m	(trying to remember) Winters -- oh, right, Douglas.
EMILY	f	How did he die?
CORONER	m	Family?
EMILY	f	Friend. (preempting his reply) I know the rules -- please, he meant a lot to me.
CORONER	m	Compression fracture of the third and forth vertebrae. Severed his spinal cord. Actual cause of death was... suffocation.
EMILY	f	You're saying he did that to himself?
CORONER	m	It appears all his injuries were self- inflicted, yes.
EMILY	f	Oh come on. He looked like he'd been beaten to death! Don't tell me he was some - some suicidal... ...I knew him! He was my best friend!
CORONER	m	Miss, I would never presume to know your friend better than you. But the injuries suggest he was trying to hurt himself. Unfortunately, he succeeded. I am sorry.
EMILY	f	Have you ever seen this before, somebody dying like this?
CORONER	m	Truly, I am shocked every day by the violence people do to themselves.
LUCY	f	You think it's my fault, don't you?
EMILY	f	It was an accident. It was nobody's fault.
EMILY	f	He was scared. He came out of that room with her, Mike, and he was scared. He said she threatened him.
BARRON	m	Listen. You're still in shock. Let's
EMILY	f	Diego said it was a man on the phone. You know who made that call. There was no one else in the house. (off his look) You think I don't know how crazy this sounds?!
BARRON	m	Look, I don't know, all I'm saying is a kid in his state of mind maybe isn't the most reliable witness.
EMILY	f	Why is he in that state of mind? Why was Doug? Pull my phone records. See if she called him.
BARRON	m	Emily. I already did. There were no calls from your house.
EMILY	f	Her mother and father, their bedroom door has these deadbolts on it, big ones, two of `em... Something came through that door and they didn't want it ever coming through there again.
INTERVIEWER	m	And by forcing your daughter into the oven, can you tell me, what did you think the outcome would be?
MARGARET	f	You mean what were we doing it for?
INTERVIEWER	m	Yes.
MARGARET	f	To kill her.
INTERVIEWER	m	Why?
MARGARET	f	God's will.
INTERVIEWER	m	And why was it God's will that you should kill your daughter?
INTERVIEWER	m	Why is that funny, Margaret?
MARGARET	f	`Cause she's not my daughter.
INTERVIEWER	m	You're her mother...?
MARGARET	f	I bore her, but she's not mine.
INTERVIEWER	m	Help me understand. If you and Edward are Lucy's biological parents, how can she not be yours?
MARGARET	f	`Cause she's not Of us.
INTERVIEWER	m	Not Of you?
INTERVIEWER	m	Who is she Of?
MARGARET	f	Not who, what.
INTERVIEWER	m	What is she Of?
MARGARET	f	Stop acting like you don't know what I'm talking about.
INTERVIEWER	m	You think your daughter is the devil?
MARGARET	f	Not him himself, Of him, working in his name, in his honor.
INTERVIEWER	m	Evil incarnate?
MARGARET	f	I don't care what you call it.
INTERVIEWER	m	And why do you think that?
MARGARET	f	Not what I think it's what I know.
INTERVIEWER	m	How do you know this? Could you give me an example?
MARGARET	f	She can make you see things. Visions.
INTERVIEWER	m	Visions of what?
MARGARET	f	Hell. Damnation. Whatever you're afraid of.
INTERVIEWER	m	I see. Any other `special abilities'?
MARGARET	f	People die around her, is that a special ability?
INTERVIEWER	m	She kills people?
MARGARET	f	Not by her hand, they just die. I had two brothers, Brent and Travis...
MARGARET	f	...and I mean they was healthy boys, healthy as can be. Eddie, three sisters. Soon as she was born they started dying.
INTERVIEWER	m	You blame Lucy for their deaths?
INTERVIEWER	m	Why do you imagine you were spared?
MARGARET	f	I guess she couldn't get rid of us till she found somebody else. Now that she has, I don't imagine we're long for this world.
EDWARD	m	THE HELL DID I JUST SAY?!
INTERVIEWER	m	Edward, please calm --
EDWARD	m	YOU AND YOUR GODDAMN QUESTIONS! YOU
EDWARD	m	IT'S NOT CHILD KILLING IF SHE'S NOT A
CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST	m	...Woke up screaming, absolutely convinced she was on fire. She wasn't, of course, they managed to sedate her. But it's curious, she displays all the symptoms of a burn patient. Except the burns themselves...
CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST	m	In no condition for visitors as you can see. If you'd like, I could let you see Mr Sheridan?
EMILY	f	Okay.
EMILY	f	I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now, but you're...
EMILY	f	You're the only one I can talk to. Lucy's been staying with me -
EDWARD	m	Who died?
EMILY	f	A friend.
EMILY	f	I, ummm...
EDWARD	m	You're scared.
EDWARD	m	You oughta be.
EDWARD	m	You judged us before you ever walked in that house. Sat there in our living room tellin' us about our problems, how to be better parents - certain of everything and dead wrong about all of it. Ask what you came to ask.
EMILY	f	What is she?
EDWARD	m	Can tell you what she's not. She not a daughter of mine. She's not a ten-year- old having trouble in school. She's not some innocent victim whose door you busted down and life you saved. And she's not going no place, lady, till she's good and done with you.
EMILY	f	Done with me how?
EDWARD	m	However she wants. You think it's an accident her ending up with you? She saw you coming a mile away.
EMILY	f	Why me? I don't have anything.
EDWARD	m	You have that you're good. Kindness. Decency. That's what she feeds on. Bleeds ya dry, moves onto the next. We were a big family, she went through us like a wrecking ball. And you know, every time something happened, every time, we had an excuse for why it wasn't her fault. Cuz it's easier to lie to yourself than think bad things about your baby girl. But finally we got to a point where me and Maggy looked at each other - (remembers so clearly) - where we looked at each other and we was out of lies, both of us. Most terrifying moment of our lives. And that's where you are now.
EDWARD	m	I'll tell you this. She sees everything. And what she doesn't see she just sort of senses it, like when you call a friend and they pick up before it rings? 66.
EDWARD	m	Only time you got the upper hand is when she's sleepin' but she almost never does. We checked on her every night for three months. Every twenty minutes, up and down those stairs. First time she slept was the night you kicked in my front door.
EMILY	f	What does she want?
EDWARD	m	To know... what your idea of hell is... and make you live there.
EDWARD	m	I'm not a hateful man. I look at you and I wish I could tell you you're through the worst of it. That it's gonna work out for you in the end. I wish I could.
EMILY	f	What should I do?
EDWARD	m	How strong's your faith?
EMILY	f	Nancy...?
NANCY	f	Emily, I heard about Doug. I'm so sorry.
EMILY	f	Do you have a minute?
NANCY	f	How's it working out with the Sheridan girl?
EMILY	f	Actually, that's why I'm here. I appreciate what you did for me, Nancy, I really do, but I think it'd be best if she was placed in foster care.
NANCY	f	She is. You're it.
EMILY	f	I know, but it's not working out.
NANCY	f	Playing mommy isn't the laugh-a-minute you were hoping, huh?
EMILY	f	I suppose not.
NANCY	f	Sorry, you petitioned for custody, you got it. She's your responsibility.
EMILY	f	Until when?
NANCY	f	Till we find a suitable foster home.
EMILY	f	How long is that going to take?
NANCY	f	You're asking me questions you know the answer to. Three to six weeks. Surely you can manage that long.
EMILY	f	I don't want her anymore. I'm done. That's it.
NANCY	f	Now you look. I put my reputation, quite possibly my career, on the line for you. Don't embarrass me. You make this work.
EMILY	f	How do I make it work if it's not working?
NANCY	f	However! Find a way!
HARDWARE CLERK	m	That what you're looking for?
EMILY	f	Thanks.
LUCY	f	Hi.
EMILY	f	Hi.
LUCY	f	You weren't there so I took the bus.
EMILY	f	Sorry, work - lost track of time.
LUCY	f	It's okay, I know how busy you are.
LUCY	f	Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops right at the end of the street. So I can always get home, whether you're there or not.
EMILY	f	Lucky.
LUCY	f	Where's the phone?
EMILY	f	Oh, it wasn't working...
LUCY	f	Wow. That one, too.
LUCY	f	Can I have a shower? We had gym today...
LUCY	f	Are they being nice to her?
EMILY	f	Who?
LUCY	f	My mother.
EMILY	f	How - how would I know that?
LUCY	f	I thought you said you were going to see her.
EMILY	f	I never said that.
LUCY	f	Hm. I must have dreamt it.
EMILY	f	I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find somewhere that will take her. Tonight. I don't want this girl in my house.
LUCY	f	Good night.
BARRON	m	Emily...?
EMILY	f	Mike.
EMILY	f	`No such thing as a bad kid, only bad parents.' I always believed that. It's a lie. Her parents aren't crazy.
BARRON	m	You wanna end up where they did keep talking like this. (off her look) I'm not judging you. You're grieving for Doug and you're still confused about what Diego did.
EMILY	f	Aren't you?
BARRON	m	Diego grew up in a bad home, he saw violence and he repeated it, that's the cycle, you know that better than anyone.
EMILY	f	Why did she lie about calling him?
BARRON	m	`Cause she's a liar, that doesn't mean she made him do it. Look, let me tell you what Lucy is. Lucy is a damaged child, a deceitful child, a manipulative child. But a damaged, deceitful, manipulative child is not a demon. Ask my brother-in-law, he's got a couple of `em.
EMILY	f	Mike, you know I'm not crazy. Don't run away from something just because it scares you.
BARRON	m	I stopped you on the steps. I think maybe you oughta go all the way in.
NANCY	f	Who do you think you are barging in there like that?!
EMILY	f	I don't want her in group anymore, I don't want her around the other kids.
NANCY	f	Well that's not your decision, is it?!
LUCY	f	It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a lot of stress lately, but she's really nice to me and I hope I can stay with her a really long time.
NANCY	f	We'll talk about this later.
LUCY	f	See you next week, Nancy.
EMILY	f	You're never going back there.
LUCY	f	Why, Emily?
LUCY	f	Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
LUCY	f	Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
EMILY	f	W-w-what's happening - ?!
LUCY	f	Can I go back to group next week?
EMILY	f	You're never going back there!
LUCY	f	Are you sure?
EMILY	f	No...
LUCY	f	I can see you.
LUCY	f	Don't be sad. This is your new beginning.
EMILY	f	Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let - that's not what I said - no, I did not - you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will you let me respond? - will you let me - Mrs Lynch - will you let -
EMILY	f	SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE
WAYNE	m	Um, so, I notice you haven't taken any personal days. Come on, you look like crap, go home.
EMILY	f	I don't want to go home.
BECCA	f	Emily...
EMILY	f	I know I haven't been a great friend lately, but... do you think maybe I could crash here for a couple of nights?
BECCA	f	Sure, when?
EMILY	f	Tonight and tomorrow.
BECCA	f	Em, any other weekend you know I'd say yes, but I just met this guy and he's coming over tonight like for the night and it might be, you know, kinda weird.
EMILY	f	LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
EMILY	f	Help me! Please!
EMILY	f	Let me on!
EMILY	f	She's coming! Please!
EMILY	f	Drive!
BUS DRIVER	m	There's nobody out there.
EMILY	f	DRIVE!
BUS DRIVER	m	There - is - nobody - out - there!
BOYFRIEND	m	(re: the office space) No, I like it. It's like those things they put baby cows in to make veal -
WAYNE	m	What?
WAYNE	m	Em...?
WAYNE	m	Emily...?
WAYNE	m	Jesus - are you okay?
EMILY	f	I... I had some things to catch up on...
WAYNE	m	You look like shit, you need to see a doctor.
EMILY	f	I saw a doctor.
WAYNE	m	What did they say?
EMILY	f	They said mind your own fucking business!
EMILY	f	Wayne...?
EMILY	f	Hello...?
EMILY	f	Robin...
ROBIN	m	What are you doing here so late? I tried calling you. I found someone to take Lucy.
EMILY	f	You did?
ROBIN	m	Anaheim couple. They've helped us out before.
EMILY	f	(under her breath) Oh God...
ROBIN	m	What's the matter?
EMILY	f	I can't. I'm keeping her.
EMILY	f	If I get rid of her, if I put her into the system...
EDWARD	m	She starts all over again somewhere else. Can't let her stay, can't let her go. That leaves you with one option.
EMILY	f	I can't, Edward, I --
EDWARD	m	You have to. You have to find the strength. Don't you understand? That's why she's doing this. To test you. Test your faith.
EMILY	f	I don't have any faith.
EDWARD	m	How `bout anger. Got some of that?
EMILY	f	How... how do I...?
EDWARD	m	Kill her? In her sleep, assuming you can... Tell you what I'd do different. Count myself dead at the outset. Accept that going in and use it to my advantage. That's the one thing I don't think she'd see coming, someone giving up their own life to take hers.
EMILY	f	(calls through door) Mike...?
EDWARD	m	Where is she now? Some family somewhere?
INTERVIEWER	m	Why does that concern you, Edward?
EDWARD	m	`Cause you have to warn them.
LUCY	f	I like it here. I like you. You want me to like you, don't you?
LUCY	f	You have to do what I say. If I say I want to go to group, you have to do it. If I say I want a new dress, you have to do it. If I say I want ice cream every day after school, you have to do it. Okay?
LUCY	f	They did what I said for a while and then they stopped and started with the secrets. But they weren't really secrets I guess... (looks at Emily) ...because I always knew what they were thinking.
MARGARET	f	Don't leave me.
YOUNG NURSE	m	It's okay, Maggie. I'll check on you later.
LUCY'S VOICE	f	I'm happy you're getting the help you need, daddy.
BARRON	m	I know...
BARRON	m	There's something I want you to hear. Came in at two o'clock last night. You might wanna sit. Twenty years in the trenches, can't make Lieutenant? Hurts, doesn't it? Shakes your faith sometimes. You know why they keep passing you over? Do you, Michael? `Cause you're soft. Soft, soft, soft...
BARRON	m	You're right. She called Doug. Took me an extra couple of days to get your cell phone records. That's what she's been using.
EMILY	f	She's taking me apart, Mike.
BARRON	m	I'm gonna help you get to the bottom of this.
EMILY	f	(re: Edward's photo) He told me I have to kill her.
BARRON	m	I'll help you.
BARRON	m	Whatever it takes.
BARRON	m	I'm gonna put Beth and Tim in a hotel. Keep her at the house.
DOCTOR	m	Physically you're fine. How's the stress?
EMILY	f	I'm not sleeping, I was hoping you could give me something.
DOCTOR	m	Take one of these, you'll sleep.
BARRON'S WIFE	f	Why won't you tell me what's going on?
BARRON	m	Because I can't.
BARRON	m	Take care of your mom.
EMILY	f	Lucy...?
EMILY	f	Oh my God...
EMILY	f	Who is this...?
EMILY	f	No... he's...
EMILY	f	I have to go.
EMILY	f	What did you do to him?
EMILY	f	WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!
LUCY	f	He did it to himself.
LUCY	f	Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The moons of Jupiter. We got back our astronomy tests today.
EMILY	f	Get out of my house.
EMILY	f	GET OUT!
LUCY	f	Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to yell at me.
EMILY	f	Stay away from me!
EMILY	f	STAY AWAY FROM ME!!
LUCY	f	What are you doing, you silly pumpkinhead?
LUCY	f	You don't want me to come under there and get you, do you?
LUCY	f	I'm going to count to three. One...
EMILY	f	No...
LUCY	f	Two... Two and a half...
EMILY	f	Please...
LUCY	f	Two and three quarters... Three...
LUCY	f	Here I come.
EMILY	f	WHAT DO YOU WANT?!!
LUCY	f	What you wanted from your mother. I want you to love me.
EMILY	f	Okay... okay, I will, I will, I promise.
LUCY	f	Come tuck me in.
EMILY	f	Okay... I'll be right there.
LUCY	f	You better come.
LUCY	f	Chamomile.
LUCY	f	Maybe you should have it, you look stressed.
EMILY	f	I'll have one later.
EMILY	f	Tomorrow's our new beginning.
LUCY	f	I'll be good.
EMILY	f	I know.
EMILY	f	Get some rest.
LUCY	f	Say it.
EMILY	f	I love you.
LUCY	f	Forever and ever?
EMILY	f	Forever and ever.
LUCY	f	Where are you if I need you?
EMILY	f	Right down the hall.
EMILY	f	Sweetheart...?
FIRE MARSHALL	m	Everybody get out okay?!
FIRE MARSHALL	m	This your house?! (she nods yes) Anybody else inside?! (off her hesitation) Ma'am...?!
FIRE MARSHALL	m	Anyone else inside?! Yes or no?!
LUCY	f	That was mean.
LUCY	f	Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming pool.
LUCY	f	It's sad, isn't it? How it gets passed on. How people do to their own kids what their parents did to them. That's why you got the job...
LUCY	f	...To prove to yourself you're not like her, that you're not like your mother. Because that scares you. Scares you more than anything.
LUCY	f	I love you... even if you don't love me.
LUCY	f	What are you doing? Slow down.
LUCY	f	Did you hear me?
LUCY	f	I said slow down!
LUCY	f	Please, stop, Emily, I'll be good.
LUCY	f	Look out!
LUCY	f	What are you doing?!
EMILY	f	It's not real.
LUCY	f	Yes, it is!
EMILY	f	Are you scared?!
LUCY	f	STOP!
EMILY	f	ARE YOU SCARED?!
EMILY	f	I'M NOT!!
PASSERBY	m	Right through the guardrail, never touched the brakes...
PARAMEDIC	m	Don't look at her, okay? Just don't even look.
NEWS REPORTER	m	A remarkable story of survival this morning as a young girl is pulled from the Los Angeles reservoir in an accident police are calling suspicious...
EMILY	f	Where is she? Where'd they put her? Foster care? Is she with a family? You have to let me talk to them...
EMILY	f	Do you hear me?!
BAILIFF	?	Set.
LUCY	f	Why can't I live with you?
RETIRED WOMAN	f	Oh, darling, we're not foster parents, we just help out when the system's full.
RETIRED MAN	m	They'll contact us, Lucy, when your placement comes through.
RETIRED WOMAN	f	Some nice family that always wanted a little girl.
CASEWORKER	?	Going to the thing Saturday?
SUPERVISOR	m	I don't know.
CASEWORKER	?	Oh, you should. It'll be fun.
SUPERVISOR	m	Maybe I will, I don't know. We'll see.
CASEWORKER	?	Bye, Janey.
SUPERVISOR	m	See you tomorrow.
