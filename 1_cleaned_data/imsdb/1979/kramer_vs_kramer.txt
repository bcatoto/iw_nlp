TED	m	They're not gonna call... I tell you  they're not gonna call. I blew it. I  don't know what I did wrong, but I �
O'CONNOR	m	Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's  not about to drop an account that  represents more than two million in  gross billing receipts in a small  agency like this, without making us  sweat. Now just relax, okay?  Everything's gonna be fine.
TED	m	I don't think so, Jim. Maybe I  shouldn't have �
JOANNA	f	I love you, Billy...
BILLY	m	I love you too, mommy... Good-night...
JOANNA	f	Sleep tight...
BILLY	m	Don't let the bedbugs bite...
O'CONNOR	m	Here's to Ted Kramer.
O'CONNOR	m	I wanna tell you something about  this little runt. He went out there  and sold the shit out of Revlon and  that's why we got the account. It  was his idea, it was his concept,  right down the line...
TED	m	All I can say... All I can say is  this is maybe one of the five best  days of my whole life...
TED	m	So anyway Jim and I are making the  pitch, right? And all of a sudden  this old guy starts to cough and I  keep on going and he keeps on coughing  and I keep on going and he keeps on  coughing and �
MURRAY	m	Congratulations, Ted. That was a  hell of a job.
TED	m	Where you goin' Murray, it's early?
MURRAY	m	Got to get home.
TED	m	Oh, Christ, I'm late... I gotta get  out of here. So anyway, I look over and this old  geezer is starting to turn blue and  I swear to God the only thing I can  think about is that this poor  sonofabitch is gonna die on me and  screw up the pitch.
O'CONNOR	m	Hey, what's the rush? C'mon, walk me  a couple of blocks.
TED	m	Jim, I've got to go. I'm already  late �
O'CONNOR	m	Listen, Ted... I just want to tell  you, when old man Schmidt retires  next year, I've got a pretty good  feeling they'll kick me upstairs...
O'CONNOR	m	...and when they do, I just want you  to know I'm takin' you along with  me.
O'CONNOR	m	Y'know, Ted, I mean what I said back  there. You did a hell of a job on  this and I want you to know I'm  turning the whole show over to you.
TED	m	Wow!
O'CONNOR	m	I mean it Ted, you're running this  one.
TED	m	I thought you might just like to  know that at five-fifteen this  afternoon we were officially handed  the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
JOANNA	f	Ted, I'm leaving you.
TED	m	That represents a gross billing in  excess of two million � What?!
JOANNA	f	Here are my keys. I won't be needing  them any more.
TED	m	I'm sorry I'm late, all right? I'm  sorry I didn't call � I was busy  making a living.
JOANNA	f	My American Express... My  Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My  check book �
TED	m	Okay, okay... What is it this time?  What did I do now?...
JOANNA	f	I took two thousand out of the savings  account. That was what I had in the  bank when we got married.
TED	m	Joanna, whatever it is, believe me,  I'm sorry.
JOANNA	f	Here are the slips for the laundry  and the cleaning. They'll be ready  on Saturday.
TED	m	Now listen, before you do something  you'll really regret you'd better  stop and think -
JOANNA	f	I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and  the phone bill, so you don't have to  worry about them.
JOANNA	f	There, that's everything.
TED	m	For God's sake, Joanna, would you at  least tell me what I did that's so  terrible! Would you do me that little  favor?
JOANNA	f	Look, it's not your fault, okay?  It's me. It's my fault � you just  married the wrong person.
TED	m	So we've got problems. Everybody's  got problems � that's normal �
JOANNA	f	Ted, you're not listening to me.  It's over, finished.
TED	m	I'm listening, Joanna � believe me,  I'm listening. My wife is walking  out on me after eight years of �
JOANNA	f	You just don't get it, do you? I � am � really � and � truly �  leaving � you.
TED	m	I heard you, Joanna. I promise I  heard you.
JOANNA	f	No you didn't. You didn't even ask about Billy.
TED	m	What about Billy?
JOANNA	f	I'm not taking him with me.
TED	m	What?
JOANNA	f	Ted, I can't... I tried... I really  tried but... I just can't hack it  anymore...
TED	m	C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother �
JOANNA	f	I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm  an awful mother. I yell at him all  the time. I have no patience. No...  No. He's better off without me. Ted, I've got to go... I've got to  go.
TED	m	Okay, I understand and I promise I  won't try and stop you, but you can't  just go... Look, come inside and  talk... Just for a few minutes.
JOANNA	f	NO!... Please... Please don't make  me stay... I swear... If you do,  sooner or later... maybe tomorrow,  maybe next week... maybe a year from  now... I'll go right out the window.
TED	m	Where are you going?
JOANNA	f	I don't know...
TED	m	Do you want me to help you get a  cab?
TED	m	Joanna!?... Joanna?!
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	Huh... Hello?
TED	m	All right, Thelma... That's it. I've  had it. You can call your good friend  Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is  enough, okay? I mean, I don't know  what I did, but you can tell her  she's made her point.
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	Ted, what are you talking about?!
TED	m	Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going  on.
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	Ted, I don't understand a word you're  saying. Where's Joanna?
TED	m	Ha! You tell me.
THELMA	f	All right. What's going on?
TED	m	All right, Thelma, you want to know  what's going on? I'll tell you what's  going on. I'll tell you exactly what's  going on.
THELMA	f	Look, Ted, all I �
TED	m	I came home tonight. We just got the  Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?! Do you  understand what that means? It means  that it was maybe one of the five  best days in my whole life.
THELMA	f	Ted, all I wanted to know was where
TED	m	I walk in the house and before I can  say "How are you?", "Did you have a  nice day?" before I can say anything.  Pow she's out the door.
THELMA	f	OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything?  She must've said something.
TED	m	Yeah, she said it wasn't any use  talking anymore.
THELMA	f	Ted, don't be so hostile.
TED	m	Hostile? Me? Thelma, I'm not hostile. I am anything but hostile. But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am  is, I am hurt. I am very hurt. And I  just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing... Why? That's all I  want to know... Why?
THELMA	f	Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot  and... well, she told me a lot of...  ah, things about the two of you.
TED	m	Things? What kind of things?
THELMA	f	I mean... things. Ted, Joanna's very  unhappy and �
TED	m	Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn  good life. She's got a husband that  loves her. She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home �
THELMA	f	What d'you know about how Joanna  felt? You went off to an office every  morning and you'd come dragging home  at seven or eight every night and as  long as dinner was on the table you  thought everything was swell.
TED	m	Did it ever occur to you guys that  Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person  in the world to live with?! Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty  minutes late. You can set your watch  by it �
THELMA	f	So she's late. What's the big deal.  That's just a way of saying, "Pay  attention to me."
TED	m	Two. She is getting to be a real  hermit or recluse or whatever it is  you call it. Thelma, do you know  where I could be in this business if  I had a wife that entertained or  went out socially �
THELMA	f	Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the  most selfish human being I have ever  met. No wonder she said you came  first, then Billy, then, if there  was anything left over, she got the  scraps.
TED	m	Joanna said that?
TED	m	Then how come she never said anything  like that to me?
THELMA	f	Maybe she didn't feel like she should  have to. Maybe she felt like if you'd  been paying any real attention to  her to start with, maybe you would've  noticed.
TED	m	Boy, you guys are really something,  y'know? I'd like to know one thing,  okay � just one little thing. Did  you tell Joanna she should leave me?
THELMA	f	No.
TED	m	Y'know something Thelma � you are  the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean  it. Joanna and I never had any trouble  until you and Charley split up.
THELMA	f	Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I  know, I went through it. You've got  to believe I did everything I could  to get Joanna to stay. But I'll tell you something. You may  not want to hear it, but it took a  lot of courage for Joanna to do what  she just did.
TED	m	I'd like to know what the hell kind  of courage it takes to walk out on  your husband and your child?
THELMA	f	Joanna left Billy? She didn't take  him with her?
THELMA	f	Oh Shit.
BILLY	m	Where's mommy?
TED	m	Huh?... Oh God... What time is it?
BILLY	m	The little hand is on the six and  the big hand is on the nine. Where  is mommy?
TED	m	Oh, Christ... Ah, yeah... you want  to know why mom's not here, right?
TED	m	Okay, I'm going to tell you... It's  like this. Mommy and daddy had a  little argument and mommy decided  she wanted to go off by herself for  a little while. You know how sometimes  you get mad and want to go off and  be by yourself? Well, it's like that,  okay? Okay. Now how about some breakfast?
BILLY	m	When is mommy coming back?
TED	m	Soon. Very soon.
TED	m	I'll tell you what, kiddo � why don't  I fix us some French toast?
BILLY	m	Wow! French toast, really?
TED	m	Sure. Didn't I ever tell you French  toast was my specialty? I'll bet I  never told you that. Now then, the  first thing we need is... ...eggs! Right?
TED	m	This is terrific... isn't this  terrific?
TED	m	I'm having a good time... Are you  having a good time?
BILLY	m	You forgot the milk.
TED	m	That's right. You're absolutely  right... It's been a long time since  I made French toast.
TED	m	Look at this, isn't this something?!
BILLY	m	What about my orange juice?
TED	m	Right. One O.J. coming up.
BILLY	m	Daddy!!!
TED	m	Don't worry... Everything's fine...
TED	m	Goddam! Son of a bitch!
TED	m	It's okay. It's gonna be okay...
BILLY	m	When is mommy coming back?
TED	m	Soon. I told you before, very soon.
BILLY	m	Will she pick me up after school?
TED	m	No. If I'm not here, you go home  with Thelma and Kim.
BILLY	m	What if she forgets?
TED	m	I'll call Thelma and remind her,  okay? Don't worry.
BILLY	m	But what happens if she's on her way  to school and she gets runned over  by a truck and killed? What happens  them?
RECEPTIONIST	m	Congratulations, Mr. Kramer.
YOUNG MAN	m	Terrific news, Ted.
O'CONNOR	m	Hey... Look who was out celebrating  last night.
TED	m	Uh, Jim... Can I talk to you?
O'CONNOR	m	Jesus Christ. That's a real  blockbuster. I always figured you guys had it  made.
TED	m	You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first  time in my life � the first time � I  feel like a loser.
O'CONNOR	m	Listen, don't let it get you down. You're going to be fine.
TED	m	Me? I've never been better. I mean  having my wife walk out on me after  seven years of marriage agrees with  me just fine.
O'CONNOR	m	Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on  the beat, okay? Three marriages, two  divorces... You're gonna be okay.
TED	m	I'm going to be okay. The way I see  it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a  matter of time.
O'CONNOR	m	She'll be back...
O'CONNOR	m	But... just in case... I mean, just  on the off chance she doesn't. What  are you going to do about the kid?
TED	m	I don't know, Jim. This whole thing  has happened so... Pow � like that.
O'CONNOR	m	Look, it's none of my business, so  you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll  send Billy away to stay with relatives  for a while. Just until you get  yourself straightened out.
TED	m	I don't know, Jim...
O'CONNOR	m	Ted, this may sound a little rough,  but we've just landed the biggest  account in the history of this agency,  right? And now it's up to us � that's  you and me � to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I  can't depend on you a hundred and  ten percent, twenty-four hours a  day, because you're worried about a  kid with a runny nose �
TED	m	Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's  coming back.
O'CONNOR	m	I hope you're right, Ted... I really  hope you're right.
TED	m	Billy!
BILLY	m	Uh, huh...
TED	m	You got a letter from mom.
BILLY	m	When is she coming home?!
TED	m	"My dear, sweet Billy: Mommy has  gone away. Sometimes in the world  daddies go away and mommies bring up  their little boys. But sometimes a  mommy can go away too, and you have  your daddy to bring you up."
TED	m	"I have gone away because I must  find some interesting things to do  for myself in the world. Everybody  has to, and so do I. Being your mommy  was one thing, but there are other  things and this is what I have to  do. I did not get a chance to tell  you this, and that is why I am writing  you now."
TED	m	"I will always be your mommy and I  will always love you. I just won't  be your mommy in the house. But I  will be your mommy of the heart. And
TED	m	It's okay... It's okay. We'll talk  about it some other time.
THELMA	f	Oh, God... OhmyGod...
THELMA	f	What are you going to do?
TED	m	I don't know, Thel... This whole  thing has happened so... Pow, like  that.
THELMA	f	I mean, what are you going to do  about Billy?
TED	m	I'm gonna keep him, why?
THELMA	f	Look, this is nothing personal, but  I don't think you can do it.
TED	m	Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not  losing my child.
THELMA	f	All right... Okay... But let's get  something straight, right now. I  mean, I'm sorry about what happened  between you and Joanna, but it's not  my problem, understand?
THELMA	f	I'm not going to have you calling  every fifteen minutes just because  you can't find a hot water bottle,  understand?
THELMA	f	I've got enough trouble raising my  own kid. I don't need another one.  Got it?
TED	m	Got it.
THELMA	f	You're on your own, understand?
TED	m	I understand.
THELMA	f	You're sure?
TED	m	I'm sure.
THELMA	f	All right. Who's Billy's pediatrician?
THELMA	f	Ed Davies. 230 East 76th Street. 472- 8227. Fifty bucks a house call, thirty  for an office visit. Write this down:  I'm not telling you twice. What's  the nearest hospital?
TED	m	Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
THELMA	f	Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park  and Lex. The emergency number is 327-
TED	m	Slow down... Slow down...
THELMA	f	Colors in one pile, white things in  another and shirts in a third.
THELMA	f	Brush the teeth. Hang up the towel  and flush the toilet.
TED	m	'Night, Jim.
O'CONNOR	m	Hey, Ted. C'mon in. I wanna' talk to  you.
O'CONNOR	m	What's the big rush. C'mon in, put  your feet up, have a drink.
TED	m	Can't do it tonight. Gotta pick up  Billy. I'm late.
O'CONNOR	m	Listen, I heard a terrific joke today.  There's this Polish skydiver �
TED	m	Sorry, Jim I've got to go. I'll talk  to you tomorrow.
O'CONNOR	m	Murray? Jim O'Connor, why don't you  drop by and have a drink...
TED	m	Mrs. Kline, I'm sorry I'm late, but
MRS. KLINE	f	That's all right, but I'm afraid  Billy was a little nervous...
BILLY	m	You're late.
TED	m	I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting  and �
BILLY	m	Goodbye.
MRS. KLINE	f	Goodbye, Bill. Thank you for coming. Mark. Say goodbye to Bill.
MARK	m	Bye.
BILLY	m	Bye.
BILLY	m	I was waiting a long time.
TED	m	It wasn't so long, I'm only... ...twenty minutes late.
BILLY	m	All the other mothers got here a  long time ago...
TED	m	How was school today?
BILLY	m	Okay... Same as usual...
TED	m	Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
BILLY	m	Sorry.
TED	m	Well, I see the Yankees finally won  a game.
BILLY	m	Mom, I mean dad?
TED	m	Yeah?
BILLY	m	Can I be excused? I'm not hungry. I  think I'll go to bed.
TED	m	Sure. Too much birthday cake, right?
BILLY	m	I guess...
TED	m	Goodnight.
BILLY	m	'Night.
TED	m	Listen, pal, I'm sorry, okay?
TED	m	I know how you feel.
TED	m	Look, I remember one time when. I  was a couple of years younger than  you are now and... I was staying  with this cousin of mine and my  parents were supposed to come and  pick me up by three, but it got later  and later and they didn't and they  didn't show up and I remember I got  really scared that something had  happened to them and I remember when  they finally came instead of being  happy to see them I was very angry  and... Billy, I promise I'll never  do that to you again, okay?...
TED	m	Billy? Okay?
WOMAN	f	It's very big... They didn't tell me  it was this big.
TED	m	No... No, actually it's only two  bedrooms.
SECOND WOMAN	f	Phew... This place is a real pig  sty.
TED	m	Look, my wife just walked out on me.  Okay? It's been a tough week.
THIRD WOMAN	f	Don't tell me your troubles, mister.  I got enough of my own.
FOURTH WOMAN	f	The first thing is, I don't do floors.
O'CONNOR	m	Ted.
FOURTH WOMAN	f	Or windows. I come in at ten and I  get Wednesdays off.
O'CONNOR	m	Ted.
TED	m	I'll be with you in a minute, Jim. You couldn't make that Saturday,  could you?
MRS. WILLEWSKA	f	What kind of boy is your son?
TED	m	Well, he's... ah, he's a good kid.  He's shy and... I think he's probably  very creative and...
MRS. WILLEWSKA	f	Could I see him?
TED	m	Sure. He's right in here.
MRS. WILLEWSKA	f	Oh... He's very beautiful.
MRS. WILLEWSKA	f	Mr. Kramer, you are a very lucky  man.
TED	m	Mrs. Willewska, could you start on  Monday?
BILLY	m	Mom, I mean dad...
TED	m	Uh huh...
BILLY	m	That's not the right soap. We use  the kind in the green and yellow  box.
TED	m	C'mon, there's not much difference �
BILLY	m	We use the green and yellow.
BILLY	m	The pink stuff.
TED	m	Okay, what color cereal do we get?
MAN'S VOICE	m	Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain  and buy him an ice.
TED	m	What?
SATURDAY FATHER	m	Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain,  buy him an ice. It'll kill twenty  minutes.
TED	m	I've got a lot more than twenty  minutes to kill.
SATURDAY FATHER	m	Tough... ...I get off duty at five-thirty. How long you been divorced?
TED	m	Three months. How can you tell?
SATURDAY FATHER	m	You've got that look. My lady and I  split two years ago in August and  I'm an old pro at this shit. First  thing, stay away from the Children's  Zoo. It's pure hell � if I never see  another chicken, I'll be happy. I'm here, darling. Don't worry...
TED	m	Billy?
TED	m	Billy?
TED	m	Billy?!
TED	m	Billy!
BILLY	m	Mommy! Mommy!
BILLY	m	Oh. I thought you were my mommy.
TEACHER	m	Ladies and gentlemen...
BILLY	m	Ladies and gentlemen...
TEACHER	m	Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
BILLY	m	Welcome to the...
TEACHER	m	Greatest.
BILLY	m	Greatest...
TEACHER	m	Show.
BILLY	m	Show...
TEACHER	m	On earth.
BILLY	m	On earth.
TEACHER	m	Mr. Kramer, I just wanted to tell  you what a wonderful boy your son  is.
TED	m	I don't know... I've been worried... I mean, with what he's been through  and everything. I �
TEACHER	m	No... No... Billy is doing just fine.
TED	m	Well, you know it's not easy raising  a kid on your own and I thought if  we could get together and, uh, discuss
WOMAN	f	Barbara! Congratulations! When is  the baby due?
TEACHER	m	Oh, God. Not 'til August.
TEACHER	m	Excuse me. You said you wanted to  talk, Mr. Kramer.
TED	m	Yes, but... ah, not now... I've got an appointment... I forgot  all about it...
SECRETARY	f	Mr. O'Connor called. There's a meeting  with the Revlon people in the board  room and you're fifteen minutes late.
TED	m	I know... I know.
SECRETARY	f	Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures  on the television buy until Monday.
TED	m	No. Uh, uh. Tell him I asked for it  Friday. I want it Friday. Period.
SECRETARY	f	Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to  meet on Friday.
TED	m	Fine.
SECRETARY	f	And Mrs. Kelsey called to ask if  Billy can come to Stephanie's birthday  party on Tuesday.
TED	m	Yes. Remind me to pick up a "Crying  Chrissie" doll at lunch on Tuesday.
O'CONNOR	m	If it's all right with you, Mother  Kramer, can we get down to work now?
PHYLLIS	f	Hello, Kramer.
TED	m	Hiya, Phyllis. These are the Revlon  contracts. I thought you ought to  check them out.
PHYLLIS	f	Sure.
PHYLLIS	f	Yes.
TED	m	Yes, what?
PHYLLIS	f	Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
PHYLLIS	f	Kramer, I've got to go. I've got an  eight o'clock closing tomorrow down  on Centre Street.
TED	m	Mmmmnph... I'll get you a cab...
PHYLLIS	f	That's okay. It's just that I've got  these clients that are �
PHYLLIS	f	Oh, God.
BILLY	m	Do you like fried chicken?
PHYLLIS	f	Ah... Yes.
BILLY	m	So do I...
PHYLLIS	f	I just met your son.
TED	m	Like that?!
TED	m	And?
PHYLLIS	f	He wanted to know if I liked fried  chicken.
TED	m	Do you?
TED	m	So what's your problem?
TED	m	You ever think about getting married  again?
THELMA	f	No, not really... I guess it's different if you don't  have children, but... I dunno, even  if Charley and I don't live together,  even if we're sleeping with other  people, even if Charley was to marry  again... He'd still be my husband.  That stuff about "Till death do you  part?" That's really true.
TED	m	How many onions does it say to use?
THELMA	f	Three. And add some basil.
TED	m	D'you think you and Charley'll ever  get back together again?
THELMA	f	No. I don't think so.
TED	m	C'mon, Thel. So Charley had a little  fling. So what? All in all he was a  pretty good husband.
THELMA	f	Look, I know this isn't gonna make  any sense, okay? I mean forget the  logic part... But I keep thinking if  Charley really loved me, he wouldn't  have let me divorce him.
TED	m	Now look, you hold it like this... ...and you swing like this...
PHYLLIS	f	No, no, no, Kramer. That's not how  you do it. Look...
PHYLLIS	f	...you hold it like this... Farther down the bat. And you swing  like this... Throw me one.
TED	m	Okay, Jim. Here's the report on...
TED	m	What the hell is this?
O'CONNOR	m	Murray had some ideas about the Fire  and Ice campaign and he had the art  department make up a few roughs... I think they're kind of interesting.
TED	m	I don't. Jim, this isn't anything  like what we talked about. It's not  even close.
MURRAY	m	Ted, basically it's still your  concept.
O'CONNOR	m	Murray just added a few things, that's  all.
TED	m	Now hold it right there, I'm the one  that went in and sold Revlon on this  idea to start with, remember? You  said I was going to be �
O'CONNOR	m	Yeah?
O'CONNOR	m	It's for you.
TED	m	Yes?
TED	m	Look, Billy, I told you before, one  hour of T.V. a day, that's the rule...  No... I don't care what the other mothers  do... Listen, I can't talk now, I'm  in a meeting... Billy, I'll talk to you later, good- bye.
MURRAY	m	Ted, I appreciate what you're saying,  but I really think you're just too  close to it right now.
O'CONNOR	m	Murray's right. Look it's just some ideas, okay? I  mean nothing's locked in cement. I  promise you this is your show...
O'CONNOR	m	Trust me on this one, Ted...
BILLY	m	Mom, I mean dad...
TED	m	In a minute...
BILLY	m	What do you do when an elephant sits  on your fence?
BILLY	m	You get a new fence.
TED	m	C'mon, Billy. I'm trying to work for  God's sake...
TED	m	Goddamnit, can't you watch what you're  doing!
BILLY	m	I'm sorry.
TED	m	Je-sus Christ! I catch all kind of  shit at the office because I'm not  pulling my weight because I'm busting  my butt trying to be a decent goddamn  father and �
BILLY	m	I'm sorry.
TED	m	That's terrific. That's really  terrific, but I notice I'm the one  that's cleaning up this � Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one  over.
BILLY	m	I'm sorry.
TED	m	Look, it's after your bedtime, okay?  Just do me a favor and go to bed,  okay?
TED	m	Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
BILLY	m	That's okay.
TED	m	It's just... I've been catching a  lot of flack at the office...
BILLY	m	That's okay...
PHYLLIS	f	How about lunch, Kramer. I'm buying.
WAITER	m	Perrier and lime... ...and scotch with soda.
TED	m	Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
PHYLLIS	f	Kramer...
PHYLLIS	f	O'Connor's out to get you. He's going  to take the Fire and Ice account  away from you.
TED	m	What?!?
TED	m	I don't believe it! That's crazy!  Why would Jim do something like that?
PHYLLIS	f	You want to know why? I'll tell you  why... Another scotch and soda for the  gentleman. I'll tell you exactly why. Because  you're not his buddy anymore. Because  he can't count on you to sit around  the office every night until eight  or nine and shoot the shit with him.
TED	m	I can't. I've got Billy to take care  of.
PHYLLIS	f	You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a  damn about Billy. All he wants is  somebody that'll hang around with  him every night so he won't have to  go home.
TED	m	I don't believe you.
PHYLLIS	f	All right. Okay. But tell me  something, Kramer. Who do you think  is palling around with O'Connor these  days?
TED	m	How should I know?
PHYLLIS	f	Murray.
TED	m	So... what's so terrible about that?
PHYLLIS	f	Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have  got to be the world's most naive  human being. Murray has gone in and changed every  single ad you've done on the entire  Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...  Every idea... Every single thing,  right down the line.
TED	m	No. No, I don't believe it. Jim  O'Connor would never let anything  like that happen. He gave me my shot  in this business. If it wasn't for  Jim O'Connor I'd be � I don't know  where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
PHYLLIS	f	Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying  to do was �
TED	m	I don't want to hear another word  against him. Not another word. He's  a wonderful man... a wonderful man...
SECRETARY	f	I'm sorry, Mr. O'Connor is in  conference.
TED	m	All right, Jim. You said I was running  this show, right? You said no  decisions without my approval, right? Well what the hell is this? What's  going on, Jim?
O'CONNOR	m	Well, ah... I thought it over and I  decided we're doing it Murray's way.
TED	m	Jim, this is garbage. This isn't  anything like what we talked to Revlon  about. None of it. You can't �
O'CONNOR	m	That's my decision, Ted and that's  final.
BILLY	m	What is it?
TED	m	Salisbury steak.
BILLY	m	I hate it.
TED	m	You don't hate it. We had Salisbury  steak last week and you liked it  fine.
BILLY	m	No I didn't. I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
TED	m	All it is is onions and gravy.
BILLY	m	I'm allergic to onions.
TED	m	You are not allergic of onions. You've  had them lots of times.
BILLY	m	I want a pizza.
TED	m	No. This is fine. Just take a bite,  you'll like it fine.
BILLY	m	I think I'm going to throw up.
TED	m	Oh, for God's sake... Here.
TED	m	There, okay? Now that's just plain  old hamburger.
BILLY	m	Some of the brown stuff is still  there.
TED	m	Then eat around it.
BILLY	m	No.
TED	m	Now listen to me, young man. Do you  know what I had to go through to put  this goddamn food on the goddamn  table?
BILLY	m	I don't care. I hate it. I want pizza.
TED	m	Not on your life. That's it. I've  had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza! Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real  food like a normal human being!
BILLY	m	No!
TED	m	You want to know something?! You are  a spoiled selfish little brat! Now  eat �
TED	m	Goddamnit! Go to your room!
BILLY	m	Owwww... You're hurting me... You're  hurting me... I hate you... I hate  you...
TED	m	You're no bargain either, pal.
BILLY	m	I want my mommy... I want my mommy..
BILLY	m	I want my... mm... ommy... I want  mmmy... mommy...
TED	m	Tough shit. You're stuck with me.
BILLY	m	I want my... mmmo... mmmy. I want  mmmy mmo... mmy...
BILLY	m	Daddy?
TED	m	Yeah?
BILLY	m	I'm sorry...
TED	m	That's okay, pal. Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
BILLY	m	Daddy?
TED	m	Uh huh?
BILLY	m	Are you... gonna go... away?
TED	m	Of course I'm not going away. I love  you very much. I'll be right here.
BILLY	m	That's why mommy left... isn't it?  'Cause I was bad...
TED	m	Oh, Christ... Oh, Christ... No, pal. Your mom loves you very  much. The reason she left didn't  have anything to do with you. Look, I don't know if this will make  any sense to you, okay? But I'll try  and explain. You see the reason your  mom left was because... Well, I guess  it was because I kept trying to make  her into a certain kind of person...  Make her be the way I thought a wife  was supposed to be. Only she wasn't  like that. She was... Well, she wasn't like that. And now,  when I think about it, I can see she  tried very hard to be like I wanted  � very hard. And when she couldn't,  then she tried to tell me about it.  Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I  thought that if I was happy, that  meant she was happy too. Only she  wasn't. The truth is, the only reason  she didn't leave a lot sooner was  because she loves you so much. Joanna  stayed until she couldn't stand me  any longer and then she left... But  it wasn't you, pal. It wasn't you.
BILLY	m	Is mom ever coming back?
TED	m	You mean for good?
TED	m	I don't think so.
BILLY	m	Oh...
TED	m	Now go to sleep. It's very late.
BILLY	m	Good night.
TED	m	Sleep tight.
BILLY	m	Don't let the bedbugs bite.
TED	m	See you in the morning light.
BILLY	m	Dad?
TED	m	Yes?
BILLY	m	I love you...
TED	m	Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
THELMA	f	Not for a couple of months. The last  time I heard from her she was living  in San Francisco.
TED	m	California?
THELMA	f	Uh, huh... She said she had a good  job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
TED	m	She ever ask about me?
THELMA	f	Uh, huh... Yeah...
TED	m	What d'you tell her?
THELMA	f	I told her you're doing a pretty  good job.
BILLY	m	Daddy! Daddy!
BILLY	m	Daddy, look! Presenting Billy Kramer's  Fantastic Superjet!
BILLY	m	Daddy!
SURGEON	m	That's good, Billy... That's a brave  boy... Now then, how's that? Now  we've cleaned it out...
SURGEON	m	There. That wasn't so bad, was it?
SURGEON	m	Now then, you just wait here, Billy.  I want to talk to your dad for a  minute.
SURGEON	m	Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught  the eye.
SURGEON	m	But I'm going to have to take some  stitches.
TED	m	How many?
SURGEON	m	Ten.
SURGEON	m	Because of the position of the wound  and your son's age, I don't think  there will be much of a scar.  Otherwise I'd call in a plastic  surgeon.
SURGEON	m	Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas �
TED	m	No.
SURGEON	m	Mr. Kramer, there's �
TED	m	Fuck you. He's my son. I'm staying  with him.
BILLY	m	Ohhh... Ohhhh... Ohhhhh...
TED	m	It's okay, son... I'm here... Just a  little more to go... Don't worry,  son... I'm here...
THELMA	f	How is he?
TED	m	He's okay... Thel, can I ask you a  favor?
THELMA	f	Sure.
TED	m	I don't mean a little favor. I mean  a big F favor.
TED	m	Thelma, if I die �
THELMA	f	What?
TED	m	I didn't say I'm going to die, but  if I should �
THELMA	f	Don't say that! I don't want to hear  you say that!
TED	m	Thel, listen to me. If, on the million  to one shot that I should � That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
THELMA	f	Me?! You want me to take care of  Billy?!
TED	m	I thought about it a lot and you're  the only person I know that I trust  with him. I mean, if anything happened  to me, he'd be okay with you. You're  a good mother.
TED	m	I know it's not an easy thing to  answer.
TED	m	Look, if it's too much responsibility
TED	m	You're sure?
TED	m	Thank you, Thel. Thank you very much.
TED'S VOICE	m	Hello?
JOANNA'S VOICE	m	Ted?
TED'S VOICE	m	Joanna?
MAITRE D'HOTEL	m	Good evening, Mr. Kramer. We haven't  seen you for a long time. Mrs. Kramer,  she waits for you in the back.
TED	m	Thank you, John.
JOANNA	f	Hello, Ted. You look well.
TED	m	So do you.
WAITER	m	The usual, Mr. Kramer.
TED	m	Thanks, Gino.
JOANNA	f	How's the new job?
TED	m	Fine.
TED	m	Look at us, Joanna. Just like any  old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
JOANNA	f	Yes... How's Billy?
TED	m	He's great... except... ...Except he had... he fell and he  cut his face. He... He has a scar,  Joanna, from about here to here.
TED	m	I can't help but feel somehow...  it's my fault. I keep thinking I  could've done something � stopped  it...
JOANNA	f	You can't tell it from a distance,  Ted.
TED	m	What?
JOANNA	f	I've seen him.
TED	m	You have?
JOANNA	f	A few times. Sometimes I sit in that  coffee shop across the street and  watch when you take him to school.
JOANNA	f	He looks like a terrific kid.
TED	m	He is... You sat in that coffee shop across  from school �
JOANNA	f	Watching my son... Ted, I've been  living in New York for the past two  months.
TED	m	You've been living here, in the city?
JOANNA	f	Ted... The reason I wanted to see  you... I want Billy back.
TED	m	You want what?!
JOANNA	f	I want my son. I'm through sitting  in coffee shops looking at him from  across the street. I want my son.
TED	m	Are you out of your mind?! You're  the one that walked out on him,  remember?
JOANNA	f	Ted, listen to me... You and I, we  had a really crappy marriage � Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as  it was yours... Anyway when I left I  was really screwed up �
TED	m	Joanna, I don't give a �
JOANNA	f	Ted, all my life I'd either been  somebody's daughter or somebody's  wife, or somebody else's mother.  Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty- two-year-old, highly neurotic woman  who had just walked out on her husband  and child. I went to California  because that was about as far away  as I could get. Only... I guess it  wasn't far enough. So I started going  to a shrink. Ted, I've had time to think. I've  been through some changes. I've  learned a lot about myself.
TED	m	Such as?
TED	m	Come on, Joanna, what did you learn?  I'd really like to know.
TED	m	One thing, okay? Just tell me one  goddam thing you've learned.
JOANNA	f	I've learned that I want my son.
TED	m	Joanna, go be a mother. Get married,  have kids. Don't get married, have  kids. Do whatever you want. I don't  give a damn. Just leave me out of it  � and leave my baby out of it.
JOANNA	f	Ted, if you can't discuss this  rationally -
TED	m	Joanna, go fuck yourself!
TED	m	Look, she walked out on her own child,  right? That's desertion, right? Mr.  Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an  open and shut case.
SHAUNESSY	?	First, there's no such thing as an  open and shut case. Especially where  custody is involved. Got it?
SHAUNESSY	?	Second, the burden is on us to prove  your ex-wife is an unfit mother.  That means I'm going to have to play  rough and, if I play rough, you can  bet they will too. Can you take that,  Mr. Kramer?
SHAUNESSY	?	Third, it'll cost you five thousand  dollars.
SHAUNESSY	?	That's if we win. If we lose, you  could end up having to pay your wife's  court costs as well.
TED	m	Fine.
SHAUNESSY	?	Good. You've hired yourself a hell  of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer. How old is the child?
TED	m	Six.
SHAUNESSY	?	That's tough. In most cases involving  a child that young, the court tends  to side with the mother.
TED	m	But she signed over custody. Here...
SHAUNESSY	?	I'm not saying we don't have a shot,  but it won't be easy... Mr. Kramer, do me a favor. There is  something I find very helpful in  matters like this. I sit down and  make a list of all the pros and cons  on an issue. I actually write them  down and look at them. I want you to  do that, okay? Then, after that, if  you're really sure you want to retain  custody of your child � then we'll  go in there and whip their asses.
TED	m	I love you Billy Kramer.
BILLY	m	I love you too daddy.
TED	m	Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs  bite...
BILLY	m	See you in the morning light...
O'CONNOR	m	Look, ah... Ted. I just got word  from the guys at Revlon and... ah  they did some marketing tests on our  campaign and the results were...
O'CONNOR	m	Disappointing. It only pulled a  fourteen share and they were hoping  for a twenty five minimum, and...  ah... they're not very happy and...  Well, the guys have decided they  want to... ah, re-think the entire  concept and... Look, I don't like  having to do this, okay?... But... I  mean, what I mean is... ah, I'm going  to have to... ah, let you go �
TED	m	Are you firing me, Jim?
O'CONNOR	m	C'mon, Ted, don't get emotional.  Okay? Look, this isn't exactly an easy  thing for me to do, y'know? I swear  Murray and I did everything we could,  but those sons of bitches were out  for blood. I mean it was all I could  do to keep the account inside the  shop... Look, I promise, if I hear  of anything I'll let you know first  thing.
O'CONNOR	m	Ted?...
O'CONNOR'S VOICE	m	Ted?...
INTERVIEWER	m	Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm... Well, this looks very good.. Of course ...you understand this is the worst  time of the year to look for a job.
TED	m	What?! What do you mean, I don't  understand.
INTERVIEWER	m	Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about  leaving their job until after they  get their Christmas bonus.
TED	m	Look, you don't understand. I need a  job. I've got a kid and �
INTERVIEWER	m	I understand and I'm absolutely sure  something wonderful will turn up... ...after the first of the year.
TED	m	Uh, huh?
SECRETARY'S VOICE	m	Mr. Kramer? Please hold for Mr.  Shaunessy...
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	Ted? They've set the court date. I  just heard today... It's... January sixth.
TED	m	Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some-  thing I ought to tell you. My... ah,  situation has... changed. I lost my  job.
TED	m	John?
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't  have a hope in hell of winning a  custody hearing if you're out of  work.
TED	m	Good Christ, Joanna, just get the  hell out of my life.
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	Ted? Are you there?
TED	m	Yeah.
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	Any prospects?
TED	m	Don't worry. I plan to have something  within twenty-four hours, John.
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	How the hell are you going to do  that?
TED	m	I don't know.
INTERVIEWER	m	Mis-ter Kramer, as I mentioned  yesterday, this is a very bad time  of year to look for work. Now I'm  sure we'll have something for you by  mid-February, March at the latest.
TED	m	I need a job, now.
INTERVIEWER	m	No... No... No...
INTERVIEWER	m	There might be something at J. Walter  Thompson. But... ...I don't think they're really  serious. The position's been open  for two months and... They may just be on a fishing  expedition. I'm sure you'll be much happier if  you wait until after the first �
TED	m	Call up the people at J. Walter  Thompson. Set up an appointment at  four.
INTERVIEWER	m	Mis-ter Kramer, it's... ...almost four now. It's the Friday  before Christmas. Nobody is going to  want to �
TED	m	Either you call and set up the  appointment, or I'll call. And if I  call, you lose the commission.
INTERVIEWER	m	My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
TED	m	You bet your ass.
TED	m	So, Mr. Ackerman, as you can see  from my resume, my experience in  setting up the leisure package concept  means that I've spent a lot of time  working along the same lines as your  multiple buys and your regional  advertising ideas. I know the  pitfalls, but � and this is more  important � I know the potential  revenue for the company inherent in  these programs.
ACKERMAN	m	Well, Mr. Kramer, I must say this  has been very impressive. I'd like  to think about it and get back to  you.
TED	m	Mr. Ackerman, is there anyone else  that I should see before you come to  a decision.
ACKERMAN	m	Mr. Spencer, our Advertising Director.
TED	m	Could I see him right away?
ACKERMAN	m	I'm sorry, but he's leaving this  evening for a two-week vacation.  I'll set up something the moment he  gets back.
TED	m	I'd like to see him now � before he  leaves.
ACKERMAN	m	Mr. Kramer, I don't think �
TED	m	I want this position very much.
ACKERMAN	m	Wait here.
ACKERMAN	m	Mr. Spencer, Mr. Kramer.
SPENCER	m	So you're the go-getter. All right,  you've got ten minutes.
SPENCER	m	That's very interesting, Mr. Kramer.  I must say, it's very interesting.  Let me think about it. I'll let  Jack... ...know and he'll get in touch with  you.
TED	m	Excuse me, I believe you said I had  ten minutes.
SPENCER	m	Well?
TED	m	That means I've got two minutes left.  I understand you're paying twenty- five.
TED	m	All right, I'll tell you what I'm  gonna do � I'll take the job at twenty- two-five. Now, that's twenty-five  hundred less than you're offering.  The only thing is, you have to say  yes right now. Not tomorrow. Not  next week. Not after the holidays.  It's worth it to me for a yes right  now and I'll take twenty-five hundred  less.
TED	m	Today only. One day only. Twenty-two  five.
SPENCER	m	Mr. Kramer, can we talk privately  for a moment?
TED	m	Certainly.
ACKERMAN	m	Mr. Kramer?
SPENCER	m	Welcome aboard, Mr. Kramer.
TED	m	Well, gentlemen, I'm pleased to be  with you.
TED	m	Merry Christmas.
TED	m	You're a terrific kid, Billy Kramer.
TED'S VOICE	m	Hello?
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	Ted? John Shaunessy here. I just got  a call from your wife's lawyer. She  wants to see the kid.
TED	m	What?! She wants what?!
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	She's the mother. That means she's  within her legal rights.
TED	m	John, what if she kidnaps him. I've  heard all these �
SHAUNESSY	?	Look, Ted, I don't honestly think  she would go to the trouble of suing  you for custody of the child if she  was planning on kidnapping him.
TED	m	I don't know, John... I mean, to be  brutally honest, I'm not so sure  what kind of mental shape Joanna's  in right now. Y'know she admitted  she was seeing a shrink.
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	You ever see her talk to the walls?
TED	m	No, but �
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE	m	Then you don't have a choice. Have  Billy at the Seventy-Fifth Street  entrance to Central Park, Saturday  at ten.
BILLY	m	Mommy!
JOANNA	f	Oh, Billy... Oh my Billy... Oh my  son...
JOANNA	f	I'll have him back at six.
TED	m	So, naturally, you assume that since  Joanna left, that would be a  compelling point against her, right?
PHYLLIS	f	Right.
TED	m	But it doesn't work that way. A major  decision was handed down by the  Appellate Court in 1969 � in the  case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
PHYLLIS	f	Kramer �
TED	m	Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court  ruled in favor of the mother, thus  establishing a precedent for awarding  the child to the mother even though  she previously abandoned the baby.
PHYLLIS	f	Kramer... There's something I ought  to tell you.
TED	m	Yeah?
PHYLLIS	f	I've been offered a job in Washington  with H.E.W.
TED	m	And?
PHYLLIS	f	I'm going to take it.
PHYLLIS	f	It's a very good job � too good to  pass up. I'll be handling funding  for the whole... Look, I... ..."like" you a lot. And you... ..."like" me, okay? Maybe if it was  a year from now, maybe things would  be different...
TED	m	But it's not a year from now, is it?
PHYLLIS	f	I'll miss you, Kramer...
ALVAREZ	m	Mr. Kramer?
TED	m	Yes?
ALVAREZ	m	I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked  me to look in on your son and prepare  an evaluation sheet.
TED	m	Oh, yes. Won't you come in.
ALVAREZ	m	Where is the child?
TED	m	He's in his room, playing.
ALVAREZ	m	Good. I'll see him in there.
ALVAREZ	m	Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in  here with anyone?
TED	m	Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social  life discreetly. At the moment I am  seeing no one.
ALVAREZ	m	Does that distress you?
TED	m	Not particularly.
ALVAREZ	m	What does?
TED	m	The prospect of losing my child.
ALVAREZ	m	Very well, I'd like to see him if I  may.
TED	m	Billy. This is Dr. Alvarez. She would  like to talk to you.
BILLY	m	Sure.
DR. ALVAREZ	m	I'd like to talk to Billy privately.
TED	m	Oh, yeah...
ALVAREZ	m	What do you have here, Billy?
BILLY	m	Detroit.
ALVAREZ	m	Have you ever been to Detroit?
BILLY	m	No. But I've been to Brooklyn.
ALVAREZ	m	I see you have people there. What  are their names?
BILLY	m	That's Kim... and this one's Thelma  and that's Mrs. Willewska and this  is daddy and that's Batman and over  there is Robin.
ALVAREZ	m	What about your mommy?
BILLY	m	Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.
ALVAREZ	m	Do you like to be with your mommy?
TED	m	Objection. You're leading the witness.
BILLY	m	Sure.
ALVAREZ	m	What do you like best about her?
BILLY	m	Lunch in a restaurant.
ALVAREZ	m	What do you like best about your  daddy?
BILLY	m	Playing.
ALVAREZ	m	Tell me, does your daddy ever hit  you?
TED	m	Objection.
BILLY	m	Sure. Lots of times.
ALVAREZ	m	When does he hit you?
BILLY	m	He hits me on the planet Kriptarium,  when I steal the buried treasure  from the famous peanut butter factory.
ALVAREZ	m	In real life when does he hit you?
BILLY	m	My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why  would my daddy hit me?
TED	m	See. That's my name.
BILLY	m	It's my name too.
TED	m	Right.
BILLY	m	Wow!
TED	m	You like it?
BILLY	m	Wow! Is this really where you work?
BILLY	m	Is this really your desk?
TED	m	Yep.
BILLY	m	Is that really your chair?
TED	m	Uh huh...
BILLY	m	Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it?
TED	m	Sure.
BILLY	m	Did mommy ever see this?
TED	m	No, she never did.
BILLY	m	Are you going to get remarried?
TED	m	I don't know. I hadn't thought much  about it.
BILLY	m	Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
TED	m	No.
BILLY	m	Will you and mommy get remarried?
TED	m	No, son. Daddy and mommy will never  get remarried.
BILLY	m	Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw  this she'd remarried you.
CLERK	m	Oyez, oyez... The third Circuit Court  of the State of New York, Judge Atkins  presiding is now in session. All  rise...
GRESSEN	?	Your honor. As our first witness I  would like to call Joanna Kramer.
SHAUNESSY	?	Real direct. Motherhood... They're  going right for the throat.
GRESSEN	?	Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you  tell the court how long you were  married?
JOANNA	f	Six years.
GRESSEN	?	And would you describe those years  as happy?
JOANNA	f	The first couple, yes, but after  that it became increasingly difficult.
GRESSEN	?	Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a  job while you were married to your  ex-husband?
JOANNA	f	No, I did not.
GRESSEN	?	Did you wish to?
JOANNA	f	Yes. I tried to talk to Ted � my ex- husband � about it, but he wouldn't  listen. He refuses to discuss it in  any serious way. I remember one time  he said I probably couldn't get a  job that would pay enough to hire a  baby-sitter for Billy.
GRESSEN	?	Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed  at the present time?
JOANNA	f	Yes, I work for Jantzen as a  sportswear designer.
GRESSEN	?	And what is your present salary?
JOANNA	f	I make thirty-one thousand dollars a  year.
GRESSEN	?	Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
JOANNA	f	Yes. Very much.
GRESSEN	?	And yet you chose to leave him?
JOANNA	f	Yes... Look, during the last five  years we were married, I had... I  was getting more and more... unhappy,  more and more frustrated. I needed  to talk to somebody. I needed to  find out if it was me, if I was going  crazy or what. But every time I turned  to Ted � my ex-husband, he couldn't  handle it. He became very... I don't  know, very threatened. I mean,  whenever I would bring up anything  he would act like it was some kind  of personal attack. Anyway, we became  more and more separate... more and  more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I  had to leave. And because of my ex- husband's attitude � his unwillingness  to deal with my feelings, I had come  to have almost no self-esteem... At the time I left, I sincerely  believed that there was something  wrong with me � that my son would be  better off without me. It was only  when I got to California and started  into therapy I began to realize I  wasn't a terrible person. And that  just because I needed some creative  and emotional outlet other than my  child, that didn't make me unfit to  be a mother.
GRESSEN	?	Your honor, I would like to place in  evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's  therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore  Freedman of La Jolla, California.
GRESSEN	?	Mr. Kramer, why did you set up  residence in New York?
JOANNA	f	Because my son is here. And his father  is here. As a mother, I don't want  my child to be separated from his  father.
GRESSEN	?	Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court  why you are asking for custody?
JOANNA	f	Because he's my child... Because I  love him. I know I left my son, I  know that's a terrible thing to do.  Believe me, I have to live with that  every day of my life. But just because  I'm a woman, don't I have a right to  the same hopes and dreams as a man?  Don't I have a right to a life of my  own? Is that so awful? Is my pain  any less just because I'm a woman?  Are my feelings any cheaper? I left  my child � I know there is no excuse  for that. But since then, I have  gotten help. I have worked hard to  become a whole human being. I don't  think I should be punished for that.  I don't think my son should be  punished for that. Billy's only six.  He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't  need his father, but he needs me  more. I'm his mother.
GRESSEN	?	Thank you, Mrs. Kramer. I have no  further questions.
SHAUNESSY	?	Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you  were married seven years. Is that  correct?
JOANNA	f	Yes.
SHAUNESSY	?	In all that time did your husband  ever strike you or abuse you  physically in any way.
JOANNA	f	No.
SHAUNESSY	?	Did your husband strike or physically  abuse his child in any way?
JOANNA	f	No.
SHAUNESSY	?	Would you describe your husband as  an alcoholic?
JOANNA	f	No.
SHAUNESSY	?	A heavy drinker?
JOANNA	f	No.
SHAUNESSY	?	Was he unfaithful?
JOANNA	f	No.
SHAUNESSY	?	Did he ever fail to provide for you?
JOANNA	f	No.
SHAUNESSY	?	Well, I can certainly understand why  you left him.
GRESSEN	?	Objection.
SHAUNESSY	?	How long do you plan to live in New  York, Mrs. Kramer?
JOANNA	f	Permanently.
SHAUNESSY	?	Permanently? Mrs. Kramer, how many boy friends  have you had � permanently?
JOANNA	f	I don't recall.
SHAUNESSY	?	How many lovers have you had �  permanently?
JOANNA	f	I don't recall.
SHAUNESSY	?	More than three, less than thirty- three � permanently?
GRESSEN	?	Objection!
JUDGE	m	Overruled. The witness will answer,  please.
JOANNA	f	Somewhere in between.
SHAUNESSY	?	Do you have a lover now?
GRESSEN	?	Objection!
SHAUNESSY	?	Your honor, I would request a direct  answer to a direct question. Does  she have a lover?
JUDGE	m	I'll allow that. The witness will  answer please.
JOANNA	f	Yes.
SHAUNESSY	?	Is that... permanent?
JOANNA	f	I... I don't know...
SHAUNESSY	?	Then, we don't really know, do we,  when you say "permanently" if you're  planning to remain in New York, or  even to keep the child for that  matter, since you've never really  done anything in your life that was  continuing, stable, that could be  regarded as permanent.
GRESSEN	?	Objection! I must ask that the counsel  be prevented from harassing the  witness.
JUDGE	m	Sustained.
SHAUNESSY	?	Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider  yourself a fit mother when you have  been a failure at virtually every  relationship you have undertaken as  an adult?
GRESSEN	?	Objection!
JUDGE	m	Sustained.
SHAUNESSY	?	I'll ask it another way. What was  the longest personal relationship  you have had in your life � other  than parents and girlfriends?
JOANNA	f	Ah... I guess I'd have to say...  with my child.
SHAUNESSY	?	Whom you've seen twice in a year?  Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't  he the longest personal relationship  in your life?
JOANNA	f	I suppose...
SHAUNESSY	?	Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I  couldn't hear you.
JOANNA	f	Yes.
SHAUNESSY	?	How long was that?
JOANNA	f	We were married two years before the  baby. And then four very difficult  years.
SHAUNESSY	?	So, you were a failure at the longest,  most important relationship in your  life.
GRESSEN	?	Objection!
JUDGE	m	Overruled.
JOANNA	f	I was not a failure.
SHAUNESSY	?	Oh? What do you call it then � a  success? The marriage ended in  divorce.
JOANNA	f	I consider it less my failure than  his.
SHAUNESSY	?	Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You  have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
GRESSEN	?	Objection!
SHAUNESSY	?	Your honor, I'd like to ask what  this model of stability and  respectability has ever succeeded  at? Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at  the longest, most important personal  relationship in your life?
JUDGE	m	Please answer the question, Mrs.  Kramer.
JOANNA	f	It did not succeed.
SHAUNESSY	?	Not it... Not it, Mrs. Kramer � you.  Were you a failure at the most  important personal relationship of  your life?
SHAUNESSY	?	Were you?
JOANNA	f	Yes.
SHAUNESSY	?	No further questions.
TED	m	Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so  rough on her?
SHAUNESSY	?	Do you want the kid or don't you?
GRESSEN	?	Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did  Ted Kramer work for you?
O'CONNOR	m	Eight, almost nine years.
GRESSEN	?	And did you have a close personal  relationship?
O'CONNOR	m	Yes...
GRESSEN	?	And how did you find his work?
O'CONNOR	m	It was good. He was a hard worker, a  lot of drive, a real hustler.
GRESSEN	?	And yet you fired him.
O'CONNOR	m	Ted was a good worker. But, ah...  after his wife left him and he was  taking care of the kid on his own,  things started to change. Look, I  know he had problems, I understand  that. I've got problems, everybody's  got problems. But I've got a shop to  run, I can't let that kind of thing  get in the way... I guess I felt that Ted was letting  his duties at home interfere with  his responsibilities in the office.
GRESSEN	?	Thank you. I have no further  questions.
SHAUNESSY	?	Mr. O'Connor, does the agency still  have the Fire and Ice account?
O'CONNOR	m	No.
SHAUNESSY	?	Mr. O'Connor, can you tell me where  you are employed at the moment?
O'CONNOR	m	At the moment I am unemployed.
JUDGE	m	If the petitioner has no further  witnesses, we will hear the respondent  tomorrow morning at 9:30.
BILLY	m	Mom � I mean, dad?
TED	m	Uh, huh?
BILLY	m	What did you do when you were little?
TED	m	I guess about the same kind of things  you do.
BILLY	m	Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
TED	m	Uh, uh... We didn't have television  then.
BILLY	m	You didn't have T.V.?
TED	m	Nope. It hadn't been invented yet.
BILLY	m	Was there apple juice when you were  little?
TED	m	Yeah, there was apple juice.
BILLY	m	Was there Burger King?
TED	m	Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as  Burger King.
BILLY	m	What else wasn't there?
TED	m	Well, let's see... There wasn't  McDonald's. And there wasn't  astronauts... And there wasn't frozen  yogurt. And there wasn't...
SHAUNESSY	?	Mrs. Phillips, how long have you  known Ted Kramer?
THELMA	f	Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna  moved into the building.
SHAUNESSY	?	How often do you see Mr. Kramer and  his son?
THELMA	f	Charley, my husband, and I are...  divorced and Kim, that's our daughter  is about Billy's age and the children  play together a lot. So, I guess we  see each three or four times a week.
SHAUNESSY	?	Can you describe the relationship  between Mr. Kramer and his son?
THELMA	f	It's beautiful. It's just beautiful.  They have a beautiful relationship.
GRESSEN	?	Objection, your honor. The answer  is, to be generous, very vague.
SHAUNESSY	?	Can you recall any particular incident  that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of  his child?
THELMA	f	Ted � Mr. Kramer, spends a great  deal of time with his child. I don't  just mean hours, I mean good time,  involved time. He reads to Billy.  They play together. They talk all  the time... He is a very... kind man... a very...  devoted father, and... and... And Joanna if you ever saw them  together... there wouldn't be a trial  at all... Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
SHAUNESSY	?	No further questions. Thank you Mrs.  Phillips.
GRESSEN	?	No questions.
SHAUNESSY	?	Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court  exactly why you want to retain custody  of your child.
TED	m	When Joanna � � my ex-wife � when she was talking  before about how unhappy she was  during our marriage... Well, I guess  most of what she said was probably  true. There were a lot of things I  didn't understand � a lot of things  I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of  things Joanna wishes she could  change... But we can't. Some things,  once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe  she does. So do I. But the way it  was explained to me, that's not the  issue. The only thing that's supposed  to matter here is what's best for  Billy... When Joanna said why  shouldn't a woman have the same  ambitions as a man, I suppose she's  right. But by the same token what  law is it that says a woman is a  better parent simply by virtue of  her sex? I guess I've had to think a  lot about whatever it is that makes  somebody a good parent: constancy,  patience, understanding... love.  Where is it written that a man has  any less of those qualities than a  woman? Billy has a home with me,  I've tried to make it the best I  could. It's not perfect. I'm not a  perfect parent. I don't have enough patience.  Sometimes I forget he's just a little  kid... But I love him... More than  anything in this world I love him.
SHAUNESSY	?	Thank you, Mr. Kramer. No further  questions.
GRESSEN	?	Mr. Kramer, by any chance have you  ever had a woman in your bed while  your child was asleep in the next  room?
TED	m	I suppose.
GRESSEN	?	So do I.
SHAUNESSY	?	Objection!
JUDGE	m	Sustained.
GRESSEN	?	Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you  were fired from your last job not  more than six weeks ago?
TED	m	Technically, the agency lost a big  account and seventy four people were  let go. I was one of them.
GRESSEN	?	You were fired, correct?
TED	m	Yes, but I'm with J. Walter Thompson  now. I don't think that will happen  again.
GRESSEN	?	Give them time...
SHAUNESSY	?	Objection, your honor! Counsel is  harassing the witness.
GRESSEN	?	Your honor, I'm only examining the  man's employment record. He pretends  to fitness when he cannot hold a  job.
JUDGE	m	Sustained.
GRESSEN	?	Mr. Kramer, did your child nearly  lose an eye when he was in your care?
GRESSEN	?	Mr. Kramer, did you, or did you not  tell the child's mother that you  were responsible for the injury that  permanently disfigured your child?
SHAUNESSY	?	Objection! Your honor, counsel is  raising a question that is not germane  to these proceedings.
GRESSEN	?	While the child was in the care of  the witness, he cut his face badly  and is now scarred.
JUDGE	m	Are you introducing the question of  negligence here, counselor?
GRESSEN	?	Yes, your honor.
JUDGE	m	I see. Well, you'll have to do better  than that. Do you have any affidavits  to support negligence?
GRESSEN	?	I do not, your honor, however �
JUDGE	m	This is an isolated incident,  counselor, unless you can prove  otherwise.
GRESSEN	?	Does the witness deny the injury  took place?
JUDGE	m	No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
GRESSEN	?	Then I have concluded my questions.
JOANNA	f	Ted.
JOANNA	f	I'm sorry... I just mentioned it in  passing. I never thought he'd use  it.
TED	m	Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
JOANNA	f	Please, Ted. I never would have  brought it up if I thought �
TED	m	I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
THELMA	f	You heard anything yet?
TED	m	Any day.
THELMA	f	Ted.
TED	m	Uh, huh...
THELMA	f	Ah, Charley and I are... Well, we're  thinking about... I mean, actually  we're sort of talking about maybe  getting back together.
TED	m	You and Charley?
TED	m	Really?
TED	m	Hey, that's terrific.
THELMA	f	Maybe. I said maybe. What I mean is, ah... I don't think  it'll really work out, but Charley  seems to want it, so...
THELMA	f	Oh, God... Ted, I am really scared.
TED	m	C'mon. Billy, Kim. Let's go.
TED	m	Well?
TED	m	Oh, Christ!
SHAUNESSY	?	The judge went for motherhood straight  down the line.
TED	m	I lost him? I lost him?
SHAUNESSY	?	I can't tell you how sorry I am.
TED	m	Oh, no..
SHAUNESSY	?	Ordered, adjudged and decreed that  the petitioner be awarded custody of  the minor child, effective Monday  the 23rd of January. That the  respondent pay for the maintenance  and support of said child, four  hundred dollars each month. That the  father shall have the following rights  of visitation: every other weekend,  one night each week to be mutually  agreed upon and one half of the  child's vacation period. That's it.
TED	m	What if I fight it?
SHAUNESSY	?	We can appeal, but I can't guarantee  anything.
TED	m	I'll take my chances.
SHAUNESSY	?	It's going to cost.
TED	m	Don't worry. I'll get the money.
SHAUNESSY	?	I've got to tell you something, Ted.  This time it'll be Billy that pays.  This time I'll have to put him on  the stand.
TED	m	Oh, Christ no... I can't do that. I  just... can't... Excuse me... I'm sorry... I just...
THELMA	f	Ted!... It's me... Ted?...
TED	m	Please go away, Thel... I... I just  have to be by myself for a little  while...
THELMA	f	Ted, I just heard...
TED	m	Please, Thel...
THELMA	f	I'm so... sorry... Oh, Ted, I'm so  sorry...
BILLY	m	Daddy! You're home early. Did you  get fired again?
TED	m	No, son, I didn't get fired. I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King  and then we watch a little T.V. and  then we get packed to go to the  country tomorrow. Just you and me...  How 'bout that?
TED	m	Joanna... This is by way of  introducing William Kramer. He is a  sweet child, as you will see. He is  allergic to grape juice, but will  more than make up for the loss in  apple juice. He is also allergic to  peanut butter from the health food  store, but not from the supermarket.  Don't ask me why.
TED	m	At times, in the night he will have  nightmares, one particular monster  is called The Face. The Face, as  best as I can determine, looks like  a circus clown without a body, and  from what the pediatrician says, and  what I have read, may be sexual fear  of losing his penis, or a fear of  his own anger, or just a circus clown  he saw once.
TED	m	His doctor, by the way, is still Ed  Davies. The Sundafed is for colds,  one tablespoon every four hours. I  will pack it in the blue suitcase.
TED	m	His best stories have been Babar and  Winnie the Pooh up to now, with Batman  moving up. His housekeeper has been  Etta Willewska and she is the main  reason for the note. She is a loving  woman, conscientious, very concerned  about Billy and more important, Billy  cares about her.
TED	m	I urge you to retain her. Her number  is 722-8099, and I think she will  take the job if it is offered. I'm  sure other things will come up. Ask  me what you need to and I guess  eventually we'll talk...
TED	m	That's all I can think of, except to  repeat what I said before, he's a  terrific kid. I'm grateful for the  time we've had together and I feel I  am a better man because of my son...  Ted.
TED	m	Billy, sometimes when a mother and a  father are divorced, there's a  discussion about who the child should  live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge. And a judge has  a lot of experience with divorces  and he decides who it would be best  for the child to live with.
BILLY	m	Why does he decide?
TED	m	Because... Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
BILLY	m	Like a principal?
TED	m	Bigger than a principal. The judge  sits in robes in a big chair... The  judge has thought a lot about us,  about you and me and your mom, and  he has decided... ...he has decided that it would be  best for you to live with your mom  Joanna in her apartment. And I'm very lucky. Because even  though you'll live with your mom  Joanna I'll get to see you once a  week for dinner and a couple of  weekends a month.
BILLY	m	I don't understand, daddy.
TED	m	What don't you understand, pal?
BILLY	m	Where will my bed be, where will I  sleep?
TED	m	At your mom's. She'll have a bed for  you in your own room.
BILLY	m	Where will my toys be?
TED	m	I'll send your toys there and I'm  sure you'll get some new ones.
BILLY	m	Who will read me my stories?
TED	m	Your mom.
BILLY	m	Daddy, what if The Face comes when  I'm at mommy's?
TED	m	Your mom knows all about The Face,  okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The  Face to beat it.
BILLY	m	Will you come and say good-night to  me every night?
TED	m	Look, it's getting cold. Why don't  you go inside where it's warm. I'll  be along in a minute.
TED	m	Go on, scoot.
TED	m	Hey? What's doin' with that bread?  Let's see a little hustle around  here.
TED	m	This is it, pal.
TED	m	Yes?
JOANNA'S VOICE	m	Ted, it's Joanna. Can you meet me in  the lobby?... Alone?
TED	m	I'll be back in a minute.
TED	m	Okay, I'm here. Now why did you �
JOANNA	f	Ted, do you love him?
TED	m	Goddamnit, Joanna. What the �
JOANNA	f	Ted, do you love him?
JOANNA	f	I love him too... I don't think I  ever knew how much until now.
JOANNA	f	Ted, when we got married it was  because I was twenty-seven years old  and I thought I should get married  and... when I had Billy it was because  I thought I should have a baby...  and I guess all I did was mess up my  life and your life and �
TED	m	Joanna, what the hell is �
JOANNA	f	Please... Please don't stop me. This  is the hardest thing I've ever had  to do..
JOANNA	f	After I left... when I was in  California, I began to think, what  kind of mother was I that I could  walk out on my own child. It got to  where I couldn't tell anybody about  Billy � I couldn't stand that look  in their faces when I said he wasn't  living with me. Finally it seemed  like the most important thing in the  world to come back here and prove to  Billy and to me and to the world how  much I loved him... And I did... And  I won. Only... it was just another  "should." ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing  everything you did, everything you  went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I  love him, or how much you love him.  I guess it's like you said, the only  thing that counts is what's best for  Billy. I don't know, maybe that's  all love is anyway... Ted, I think  Billy should stay with you...
TED	m	What?
JOANNA	f	He's already got one mother, he  doesn't need two... He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more.  He's yours...
TED	m	Oh, God... Oh, my God...
JOANNA	f	Only can I still see him?
TED	m	No more waiting in Coffee Shops... I  promise.
JOANNA	f	Okay... I think I'll go talk to my  son now. How do I look?
TED	m	Beautiful.
