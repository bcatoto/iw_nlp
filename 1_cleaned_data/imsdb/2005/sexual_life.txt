LORNA	f	Hmm.  Simon and Garfunkel hit.  Eight letters.  Any thoughts?
LORNA	f	Excuse me, whatever happened to that sign, the one that used  to hang next to the pies?
WAITRESS	?	What sign?
LORNA	f	The one that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your  life."
WAITRESS	?	That thing?  We got rid of it.
LORNA	f	Oh.
WAITRESS	?	Have you decided? Before Lorna can speak, we hear--
WOMAN	f	She'll have the steak and egg special. Lorna turns as TERRI, her roommate, joins her at the counter.
TERRI	f	Look at her, she needs protein.  Lots of protein.
LORNA	f	(to the Waitress) White toast.  Dry. The Waitress leaves.
LORNA	f	Working early today, huh?
TERRI	f	No, I had something important to do... Terri opens her bag and pulls out a small, gift-wrapped box.
TERRI	f	...Miss nineteen.
LORNA	f	I knew you'd remember. Terri gives Lorna a kiss on the lips.
TERRI	f	Of course I remembered.  Go on, open it.
LORNA	f	No, no.  I wasn't born until ten minutes before midnight.  And  that's when I'll open it.
TERRI	f	You better like it.  I don't want to tell what I had to do to  pay for it.
LORNA	f	Ooh.  It must be good.
TERRI	f	So what's the plan, Stan?  Something special today?  Other than  splurging on toast.
LORNA	f	Yes.  There is something.
TERRI	f	Good.  Count me in.
LORNA	f	No.  Something big.  Something I've been thinking about for a  long time.
LORNA	f	I can't do this forever, Terri.  Look... Lorna points to the corner of her eye.
LORNA	f	Crow's feet!  I'm nineteen!  Crow's feet!  I know I keep talking  about it, but this time I'm going to do it.  In fact, I did it.
TERRI	f	Okay...
LORNA	f	I called them.  I told them I was out.
TERRI	f	You did not.
LORNA	f	Uh-huh.  I have one more appointment.  Then, I'm...free.
TERRI	f	Give me your cell phone.  I'm calling them back right now. Lorna smiles and pours the shattered remnants of her phone on  the counter.
LORNA	f	A bus ran over it.  Isn't that perfect?  It's a perfect sign.
WAITRESS	?	(to Terri) Can't do that here, Miss.
TERRI	f	I know, I know.  I'm not going to light the damn thing. (beat) Fuck me.
LORNA	f	Look, I'm good for next month's rent. This takes Terri by surprise.
TERRI	f	What, you're leaving too?
LORNA	f	Maybe.  Get out of town for a while.  I really feel good about  this.
TERRI	f	I wish you'd talked to me first.
LORNA	f	I didn't because...I knew you'd try to talk me out of it.
TERRI	f	That's because I'm looking out for you.  It's because there is  so much opportunity here.
LORNA	f	I know. (beat) Listen, I'm late. Lorna leaves some change on the counter, picks up her gift and  gives Terri a hug.
LORNA	f	Thanks.
TERRI	f	Well...Happy Birthday. As Lorna goes, the Waitress reappears.
WAITRESS	?	Your friend comin' back?
TERRI	f	Hard to say.
TODD	m	Seventy-five, right?  For the half-hour.
LORNA	f	Not including tip. She smiles.  Todd paces uneasily.
TODD	m	And, typically, the size of the tip is...
LORNA	f	Depends on how generous you feel.
TODD	m	Of course.
LORNA	f	Is...this your first appointment?
TODD	m	No.  I've done this before. Lorna thinks otherwise.  She pats the seat next to her.
LORNA	f	Come over here, you're making me nervous. He plops down next to her.
LORNA	f	So, how much extra do you feel like spending?
TODD	m	I don't know.  Another fifty dollars?
LORNA	f	Uh-huh. She thumbs through the wedding photos.
LORNA	f	So, this is what you do.  Weddings.
TODD	m	It pays the rent.
LORNA	f	These are good.  You're really a good photographer.
TODD	m	Well, somebody thinks so.  I get a lot of work.
LORNA	f	And you can only spend another fifty on me? Todd walked right into that one. LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) Maybe you'll feel more generous once you get to know me. Lorna smiles.  Her face has an open, unguarded beauty.
TODD	m	You have a great smile, do you know that?
LORNA	f	Yeah, I've heard.
TODD	m	And I like your name.  Lorna.  Like the cookie.
LORNA	f	Gee, I've never hear that one before. She laughs at him.  But it's not unkind. LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) I have a friend who makes photos.  She's had some stuff in magazines.
TODD	m	Hey, I'm not afraid of sick images.  In fact, it's what I aspire  to do, create pictures that are edgy, that really assault you,  that reach out and slap you in the face.
LORNA	f	Why?
TODD	m	Well...I don't know.  Shake people out of their...complacency.
LORNA	f	She photographs people pissing on each other.
TODD	m	Uh-huh.
LORNA	f	Yeah...disgusting.
TODD	m	Maybe that's the point.
LORNA	f	But who would want to look at that?  I mean, bathrooms have doors  for a reason.
TODD	m	What do you like?
LORNA	f	I like things that make me happy.  Like this. Lorna holds up a photo of a beautiful, smiling bride.
LORNA	f	I bet she's going to have a very happy life. She lingers over the photo.
LORNA	f	I don't think I'm the marrying kind, though.
TODD	m	Me, neither.  Marriage, it's so...medieval.  Sometimes when I'm  doing a wedding I look at the bride and groom and think, "What  a couple of lemmings."
LORNA	f	I'm not sure people can be true, that's all.
TODD	m	Right.  That, too. Lorna puts down the photos.
LORNA	f	Well...Now that we've gotten to know each better, maybe we should  get started.
LORNA	f	Oh, you really have a big cock...My, you really have a big cock...God,  what a big cock you have.
LORNA	f	As she goes about her work, Lorna wears a vaguely puzzled expressions.
LORNA	f	Forty-two across...Simon & Garfunkel hit...eight letters...begins  with 'I'...I...I'm A Loser...Did they sing that?...Susie used  to play Mom's Simon & Garfunkel records all the time...I scratched  one once and she pulled my hair...I haven't spoken to her for  almost a year...Her little kid must be walking by now...Maybe  I should give Susie a call...Nah, fuck that!  She's perfectly  capable of calling me...I mean, I'm listed...I'm...I am a rock...that's  it!...I Am A Rock, that's the answer...I am a--
LORNA	f	(flatly) God, you really have a big cock. Like Pavlov's proverbial dog, Todd MOANS and the whole thing  is quickly over.
LORNA	f	Wow.  That was something.
TODD	m	Yeah...was it?
LORNA	f	Let me tell you...that was something.
TODD	m	Really.
LORNA	f	Cut the modesty.  You really know what you're doing.
LORNA	f	(into phone) Hey, it's Lorna...I'm clocking out for the last time...No, I'm  not done for the day, I'm done...Wait, I don't think you heard  me...Well, just give it to one of the other girls.  Give it to  Terri...I don't care if he's an important client, I told you  I'm...Well, you'll just have to cancel it, won't you?...I don't  care what it pays, it's not my fuckin'--
LORNA	f	(into phone) Hold on... (to Todd) What?
TODD	m	Nothing.  Are you alright?
LORNA	f	I'm fine.  The cab fare will be another twenty.
TODD	m	You never said anything about cab fare.
LORNA	f	Of course I did.  Are you calling me a liar?
TODD	m	No.  I swear, you didn't say a word about it. Lorna slowly brings the phone to her ear.
LORNA	f	(into phone) Alright.  Where is it?
TODD	m	You haven't told me where we're going yet.
LORNA	f	Make a right at the light. He does.
TODD	m	Can I ask you a question? (without a beat) No, forget it...it's stupid.
LORNA	f	Go on, ask.
TODD	m	Well, after we...after we did it, you didn't really mean what  you said, did you?  About me being so good.
TODD	m	(back-peddling) I'm only asking because I'm fascinated by this whole scene you're  in.  So, don't worry about sparing my feelings or anything.   I'm just curious.
LORNA	f	Pull over.
TODD	m	What?
LORNA	f	Pull over here. He does.  Up the block is a high-rise, luxury hotel.  Limos and  cabs line the driveway.  Uniformed doormen guard the entrance.
LORNA	f	You see that hotel?  In one of those rooms, there's a man waiting...he's  waiting for me.  I don't know what his name is or what he looks  like.  He may have bad skin.  He may be really ugly.  But no  matter how he looks, or how bad he smells, or whether he makes  weird wheezing sounds when he comes, I tell him the same thing...the  same thing I told you.
TODD	m	Right...Well, that's what I thought.  I mean, a guy would have  to be pretty lame to think that...
LORNA	f	To think what?
TODD	m	Nothing. Quite out of the blue, she leans over and kisses him on the cheek.
LORNA	f	It's Todd, right.
TODD	m	Yeah.
LORNA	f	Well, Todd, you're alright. (beat) And that I don't say that to everyone. She opens the door, starts out--
TODD	m	If I wanted to see you again--
LORNA	f	No. You can't.  You can't see me again. (beat) But thanks for asking.
TODD	m	Lorna!  Lorna! But Lorna is gone.
PHIL	m	(to the couple) Beautiful, just beautiful. (to Todd) You used a rubber, I hope.
TODD	m	Of course.
PHIL	m	And how much did this afternoon delight set you back?
TODD	m	Oh.  About a buck and a quarter. (to the couple) We just need to reload. As they do--
PHIL	m	Since when do you have a hundred and twenty-five dollars to throw  away?
TODD	m	I'm sure you spend just as much on porn rentals.
PHIL	m	There's no comparison.  Here, I'll do the math for you. Phil pulls a calculator out of his camera bag. PHIL (CONT'D) (cont'd) (punching in numbers) A video rents for $2.65.  That's a two-day rental.  That means  you can get off at least a couple times before it's due.  $125  divided by $2.65 equals approximately 47.  47 X 2 = 94.  I can  get off ninety-four times for the same amount you paid to get  off once.  Now tell me who gets the better deal.
TODD	m	You're right.  I can't argue with that.
PHIL	m	Anyway, I stopped watching porno.
TODD	m	You did?  Why?
PHIL	m	They kinda depress me. (beat) When I want to get off now, you know what I use?
TODD	m	What? Phil taps his forehead.
PHIL	m	My imagination. (to the couple) Okay, folks.  It's magic time.
LATER.	?	The couple is gone.  Phil and Todd wrap some equipment. Phil (cont'd) What I don't understand is, aren't you getting enough action  from that Sarah?
TODD	m	What's Sarah got to do with it?
PHIL	m	You're seeing her, aren't you?
TODD	m	Sarah...that's a whole different situation.
PHIL	m	But you're doing it with her, right?
TODD	m	I like Sarah a lot.  And I don't want to blow it by pushing too  hard.
PHIL	m	You mean, you haven't...
TODD	m	Technically?  No.
PHIL	m	She won't put out?
TODD	m	No, no, no.  You don't get it.  You can't equate the two.  What  I did with Lorna--
PHIL	m	Lorna?
TODD	m	That's her name.  Lorna.  I mean, that's the name she gave me.  person is like?  What that world is like?  I was just...doing  research.  The lower depths...
PHIL	m	I didn't say anything.
SARAH	f	Shit!  Sold out! Sarah, at twenty-five, is cute, brainy, articulate, and hopelessly  insecure.
SARAH	f	I am so sorry.
TODD	m	That's alright.  I hear it's really overrated.  And long.
SARAH	f	I could just kill him!  This is not the first time he's done  this, either.
TODD	m	Done what?
SARAH	f	Cooked up some phony emergency, right as I'm getting on the elevator.
TODD	m	He's your boss.  Being an asshole is part of the job description.
SARAH	f	We're talking about the most self-centered man I have ever met.
TODD	m	Do what?
SARAH	f	Ruin my evening.  Our evening. (without a beat) You know, he also thinks he's God's gift to women.  I'm surprised  he hasn't been sued by now...Okay, okay.  Stop me.
TODD	m	Sarah.  Take a breath.
SARAH	f	Okay.  I'm taking a breath. And she does.
TODD	m	Now, take another one.
SARAH	f	I like you.  Have I told you that?
TODD	m	Not today.
SARAH	f	You know what I want to do?  I want to go shopping.
TODD	m	Shopping?  For what?
SARAH	f	For a house.
TODD	m	(completely thrown) Just what I was thinking.
SARAH	f	Look at the detail on that one.  Wow.  Every one of these is  a gem.  Makes the stuff I work on look pretty shabby by comparison.
SARAH	f	What's this? She lifts up Lorna's birthday gift -- still unwrapped.Todd reacts  -- he forgot to get rid of it -- and Sarah reacts to Todd.
SARAH	f	Obviously, not for me.
TODD	m	Something...somebody left in front the studio.  I just picked  it up.
TODD	m	What are you doing?
SARAH	f	Maybe we can find out whose it is. Inside is a silver bracelet, and a hand-written note.
SARAH	f	(reading) "Lorna.  Remember, I'm in your corner.  Love, Terri."  Pretty  cool bracelet.  You just found this.
TODD	m	Stupid of me...I should've left it.
SARAH	f	Lorna.  That's a name you don't hear very much.  Lorna.  Like  the cookie.
TODD	m	No.
SARAH	f	Terri and Lorna.  Sisters, maybe?  Lovers, more like it.  Or...witches.
TODD	m	You have a perverse mind. (beat) ...which I like, by the way.
SARAH	f	Or...perhaps Terri killed Lorna, and this "gift" provides her  with an alibi.
TODD	m	Maybe you should put it back.
SARAH	f	What, aren't you a little curious? Todd pulls over and stops.
TODD	m	Sarah...I don't know how to put this.  This is our fourth night  out, and I feel a lot of pressure...for this to work.
SARAH	f	I want it to work, too. (off his look) Oh.  Is this about sex?
TODD	m	Don't you think we're being a little...methodical about the whole  thing?  Maybe we should just...
SARAH	f	What?  Get it over with?
TODD	m	Not exactly.
SARAH	f	Don't you think it's better to be sure of each other first?   To have a little bit of trust?
TODD	m	You can trust me.
SARAH	f	I know, I know. (beat) But you're not sleeping with anyone else, right?
TODD	m	Of course not.
SARAH	f	It's not such a strange thing to ask.  Sometimes relationships...overlap.
TODD	m	I told you.  I'm not. Beat.
SARAH	f	You haven't asked me if I'm seeing anyone.
TODD	m	Is that bad?
SARAH	f	It's silly, I know, but it makes me feel like you couldn't imagine  anyone being interested in me.
TODD	m	What?  You should be flattered I don't ask.  I respect you enough  to assume you'd tell me if you're involved with someone.
SARAH	f	Hmm.  Ask me, anyway.
TODD	m	Are you serious? (off her look) Alright.  Are you seeing anyone?
SARAH	f	Absolutely not. Todd takes the bracelet, puts it on the dash, then leans to kiss  Sarah.
SARAH	f	I do want to make love tonight.
TODD	m	I'm just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity--
SARAH	f	I think spontaneity is overrated.
SARAH	f	Todd, the light. He switches it off.  They sit side by side and undress down to  their underwear.   They look at each other.
SARAH	f	Wait.  Don't say anything.
TODD	m	Okay. Beat.
SARAH	f	What were you going to say?
TODD	m	I wasn't going to say anything.
SARAH	f	Oh.
TODD	m	You look beautiful--
SARAH	f	No, don't say that.  Let's get under the covers. They climb into bed and move into each other's arms.
SARAH	f	Let's go slowly. They kiss, caress, shedding their inhibitions. Then--
SARAH	f	Oh.  Oww!
TODD	m	What happened?
SARAH	f	Dammit...my foot.  I've got one of those...what's the word?
TODD	m	A bunion
SARAH	f	Not a bunion.  A spasm.
TODD	m	Oh, a foot spasm.  Here let me-- He throws back the covers and massages her foot.
SARAH	f	Oww!  No, stop!  It hurts!  I hate this!
TODD	m	What can we do?
SARAH	f	Nothing, it's fine, it's fine.  Lemme just walk it off. She gets out of bed and hobbles into--
TODD	m	She has a better-looking body than I imagined...Breasts are definitely  bigger than I thought.  You can just never tell with breasts,  can you?...I don't know what to make of this foot problem...Maybe  she gets a spasm every time she has sex...I've heard of people  with problems like that...People who can't have sex without laughing,  or burping...Oh, God, what if she's one of them...
SARAH	f	I am so embarrassed.  Trust me, this doesn't happen all the time.
TODD	m	The thought never crossed my mind.
TODD	m	She won't look at me.  Why won't she look at me?..I'll bet she's  preoccupied with her foot.  She's praying she won't get another  spasm, another foot freak-out...She's being awfully quiet, too...Why  is she so quiet?...Maybe she needs to concentrate...Some women  need to concentrate...I read that in a magazine at the grocery  store...That blonde check-out girl who works there is really  cute...I love the way she says, "Paper or plastic?"...
SARAH	f	Todd!  Shhh... Todd stops.  Everything stops.
TODD	m	What's the matter?
SARAH	f	These walls, they're paper-thin.  This building is so poorly  built.  Everyone can hear you.
TODD	m	Is that why you're so quiet?
SARAH	f	Yes, the walls are...What are you saying?
TODD	m	It's hard for me to tell if you're enjoying this.
SARAH	f	Of course, I am.  I'm sorry if I'm not vocal enough for you.
TODD	m	That's not what I...Sarah, I just want to make sure I'm doing  something right here.
SARAH	f	There's no right or wrong way to do this.
TODD	m	I know.  I just want to make sure I'm...you know, in the ballpark.
SARAH	f	Todd, I don't expect you to do everything right the first time...Sorry,  that didn't come out the way I meant it...
TODD	m	You didn't like it.
SARAH	f	No, I didn't say that.  I was just...Let's be still for a while.
SARAH	f	Everyone expects fireworks the first time you do it.  But that's  just a myth.
TODD	m	A myth.  You're right.
SARAH	f	Let's not be too hard on ourselves.
TODD	m	I agree.
SARAH	f	Our expectations were a little high, that's all. Todd nods his agreement.
TODD	m	And at the end of the day, sex is only one part of the picture.
SARAH	f	True.  What do you mean?
TODD	m	I know this couple. They had nothing in common but good sex.  it lasted?  A month.  They were hot for each other...but there  was nothing else.
SARAH	f	Right. (beat) There's got to be something else. And they stare at the ceiling.
SARAH	f	Morning, Pappy.  How's she doing today?
GRANDFATHER	m	Don't pay her any mind, Sarah.  The things she says, they get  stranger by the day.
GRANDMOTHER	f	They keep telling me I'm doing fine, that I'm even improving.  protect me from?
SARAH	f	Maybe they know something you don't.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Like hell. She pulls out a pack of American Spirit cigarettes and lights  one.  Sarah reacts.
SARAH	f	Nan.
GRANDMOTHER	f	What?  One in the morning with coffee.  One at night with cocktails.
SARAH	f	Oh, please.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Your story, that's the one I want to hear.
SARAH	f	I wish I had a story to tell.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Hmm.  The last time there was talk of an admirer.
SARAH	f	All you want is dirt, Nan.  Admit it.
GRANDMOTHER	f	The world is made of dirt, Sarah.  So, please, dish.  No detail  is too small.
SARAH	f	I...I'm sleeping with two different men.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Hmm.  Continue.
SARAH	f	One of them is a good man.  He's good for me.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Like vitamins.
SARAH	f	Sort of.  The other one, he can be a complete ass.  A total jerk.
GRANDMOTHER	f	In other words...he excites you.
SARAH	f	He does.  And I hate it.  I hate him.  And, on top of that, I  can't have him.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Can you see your Pappy? Sarah looks back over her shoulder.  She catches a glimpse of  her Grandfather.  He's still on the front porch.
SARAH	f	He hasn't moved.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Good.  Keep an eye on him.
SARAH	f	Why?
GRANDMOTHER	f	Because I'm going to tell you something he shouldn't hear.  Something  no one knows.  Once, I had two lovers.  One was your grandfather.  and people would look at us and say, "Now, there goes a couple."  And I liked that.
SARAH	f	Don't worry.  He's not moving.
GRANDMOTHER	f	The other man -- he was a boy, really -- he had no prospects.  certainly had no respect for my virginity.  And I liked that,  too.
GRANDMOTHER	f	But I had to make a choice.  I chose your grandfather.  The day  before the wedding, I went to let the other boy down.  Met him  by a river where we used to swim.  Well, one thing led to another,  and when I returned home that night, I'd left my virginity back  in the tall grass by that river.
GRANDMOTHER	f	But I did bring something back.  A bite mark.  That sonuvabitch  left on my neck, the size of a peach pit.
SARAH	f	Did Pappy see it?
GRANDMOTHER	f	He did and he didn't.  On the wedding night -- in this house  -- I managed to squeak by.  It was dark.  We were shy.  He took  me in his arms and said, "I'm glad you waited for me."  In other  words, I lost my virginity twice in the same week.
SARAH	f	No small feat.
GRANDMOTHER	f	It's an accomplishment.  But the next morning, your Pappy saw  it.  He demanded an explanation.  And, Sarah, do you know how  I got out of that pickle?
SARAH	f	You lied.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Damn right.  I said, "What, you don't remember giving me this?"  He said, "No."  And I said, "Well, you were so fired up last  night, it's a wonder you can remember anything."
SARAH	f	And you've never been tempted to...
GRANDMOTHER	f	What?  Come clean with your Pappy?  Why should I tell him?  He  had nothing to do with it.
SARAH	f	Right.
GRANDMOTHER	f	It's mine.  Not his.
SARAH	f	I wonder what became of that boy.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Never saw him again.  I don't regret a thing, if that's what  you're wondering.
SARAH	f	I was, in fact.
GRANDMOTHER	f	Look what I have.  I have you. (beat) And you know what else?  I have the tall grass by that river.  really beautiful that day.
SARAH	f	I don't believe it.  You're actually asking my opinion.  You  really want to know what I think?
JOSH	m	To tell you the truth, no.  I just wanted to hear your voice.
SARAH	f	(shrugs) Boo.
JOSH	m	Alright, what do you think of it?
SARAH	f	You'd have to pay me to live in that neighborhood. (off his look) Hey, what do I know?  I'm just the assistant.
JOSH	m	What are they going to think?  That's all that matters.
SARAH	f	To paraphrase you, this is going to give them a major hard-on.
JOSH	m	You haven't met these women. Sarah laughs, catches herself and stops.
JOSH	m	The champagne order?
SARAH	f	Done.  Dom Perignon.  Fifteen cases.
JOSH	m	Invitations?
SARAH	f	A messenger is meeting us at the site with the proofs.
JOSH	m	Good. He reaches behind her and pats her butt.
SARAH	f	Stop it.
JOSH	m	I can't.
SARAH	f	Have you never heard of the phrase "impulse control"? They reach the elevators.
JOSH	m	I love it when you're full of contempt. She just glares.
SARAH	f	People are starting to notice, Josh.  I work very hard to act  completely indifferent toward you.  The least you could do is  to keep your hands to yourself.
JOSH	m	I've got a better idea.
SARAH	f	What?
JOSH	m	Why don't I distribute a memo, informing everyone that you and  I are not sleeping together?
SARAH	f	Josh, just for the sake of variety, could you take me seriously  for a moment?
JOSH	m	Alright, alright.  I have another idea.
SARAH	f	Please, don't...
JOSH	m	Let's just end it. Beat.
SARAH	f	Yes.  I think we should. Josh didn't expect this.  The elevator arrives.  He steps aboard  and holds the door for her.
JOSH	m	Coming?
SARAH	f	I'm going to take the stairs. Josh shrugs and lets the doors close. A beat.  Sarah considers the stairs, then hits the down button  again.
SARAH	f	I can't put my finger on it...I just don't feel it's happening  with us.
TODD	m	You don't want it work out, that's what you're saying.
SARAH	f	I do.  I mean, I did.  It's no one's fault.  It's chemistry.
TODD	m	You want your pickle?
SARAH	f	Do you want your pickle?!
TODD	m	You know what the problem is?  The first night we went out, we  should've just fucked.  Right away.  Without thinking.  Two dumb  bunnies.  Without any history,  any baggage.  A pair of blank  slates.  Fucking.  It could've been perfectly meaningless.  You  want chemistry?  The less you think, the better the chemistry.
SARAH	f	I'm sorry.  It's just not happening for me.
TODD	m	The least you can do is give me your goddam pickle. They look away from each other.  Todd eats in silence.  The pickle  sits between them.
SARAH	f	(into phone) I don't care if it costs the same, if it's not Dom Perignon tell  them we don't want it, alright?...Good.  Anybody else call?   Nobody, huh...Okay.
SARAH	f	Guess I'll be heading back...
JOSH	m	Wait. (beat) About the other day...Are you having any second thoughts?
SARAH	f	(shrugs) No.  None.
JOSH	m	You're angry I called it quits, aren't you?  You can admit it.
SARAH	f	No.  In fact, I want to thank you.
JOSH	m	For what?
SARAH	f	For sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship I've ever  had in my life.  For that, I thank you.
JOSH	m	Touch�.
SARAH	f	Are you having seconds thoughts?
JOSH	m	No.  I say, let's make a clean break.  Let's just walk away from  it.
JOSH	m	What are you doing?
SARAH	f	Let's seal the deal.  Shake. It's a little awkward, but they do.
JOSH	m	Alright.  Now that we've put that behind us, there's one problem  left.
SARAH	f	What?
JOSH	m	Where do we put the bed? Josh gestures to the empty room.  Sarah smiles -- it's a familiar  game.
SARAH	f	Oh, the bed.  Let's put it against this wall.  Away from the  morning sun.
JOSH	m	Wrong.  It's got to go here.  So you can see the hallway. They head out. As Josh and Sarah leave the house, they "decorate" several rooms.
SARAH	f	Not enough height for bunk beds.
JOSH	m	Why do you assume there will be two children?
SARAH	f	There has to be.  They need to keep each other company.
SARAH	f	Definitely not enough space for two people to cook.
JOSH	m	I prefer to eat out.
SARAH	f	Oh, no.  I wouldn't put the ottoman there.
JOSH	m	Where would you put it?
SARAH	f	It needs to go over... She waves her hand, accidentally brushing against Josh's chest.
SARAH	f	Hmmm.
JOSH	m	What? ...and linger.  They both know what's happening.
SARAH	f	We have another problem.
JOSH	m	And that would be...?
SARAH	f	What do we do with the elephant in the room?
JOSH	m	You're very clever. She rubs his chest.
SARAH	f	We shouldn't be rude to an elephant. She lets her hand drop to his crotch.
SARAH	f	They can get very annoyed...if you ignore them. She pulls Josh to her and kisses him.  Josh fairly attacks her,  his hands all over her body.
SARAH	f	Josh.  The door. It's an absurd request -- the room is completely exposed, but  Josh carries her to the front door and kicks it closed.
ON JOSH AND SARAH	m	With Sarah's back against the door, Josh enters her.
CLOSE ON SARAH	m	She looks up.  With no roof above them, she has a brilliant view  of...the clouds.  They float past as she thinks--
JOSH	m	I have to tell you, that was the best "break-up" sex I've ever  had.
SARAH	f	It was, wasn't it? (beat) Closure is important. jOSH Now you can move on.  You can meet someone who... sarah What?  Someone who's not a prick like you. Josh reacts -- slightly offended. joSH No.  Someone who's...free. sarah Oh.  Right. (beat) As if that would have made any difference in this...what is this  thing called again?  A relationship?
TODD	m	(into phone) No, no, no.  You don't understand.  I don't want an appointment,  I just need to get in touch with her...She left a package here  by mistake, a gift...No, I'd rather give it to her myself...Lorna,  but I assume none of you use your real names...What?  But she  was working last week?...And you don't have a forwarding number?  so--
TODD	m	Dammit. He dials again.  Then, a knock at the door.  Todd reacts -- he's  not expecting anyone.
SARAH	f	Still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier.  She holds a small  paper bag.
TODD	m	Sarah...
SARAH	f	I brought you something. She hands him the bag.  He looks inside.
TODD	m	Pickles.  Huh. (beat) What's in your hair? She touches her hair.
SARAH	f	Oh.  Sawdust.  Lots of sawdust at the job site. (beat) Can I come in? Todd puts the bag of pickles on the kitchen counter.  He sees  Lorna's bracelet...and slides it into a trash can.
GIRL	f	Need some help?
JOSH	m	Yes, I have a problem.  I need some...something to cover up a...Hell,  just take a look.
GIRL	f	Yeah.  You're fucked.
JOSH	m	I can do without the attitude, thank-you.
GIRL	f	Try concealer.  Aisle three.
JOSH	m	(impatient) But what do I do with it?
GIRL	f	Just put it on.  And call your lawyer. She smiles.
GWEN	f	Unbelievable.
JOSH	m	What?
GWEN	f	I'm reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine.
JOSH	m	If it's stupid, why read it?
GWEN	f	(ignores this) The whole issue is devoted to famous couples who are breaking  up.  Listen to this...Remember the blonde doctor on that show  you hate?
JOSH	m	Yeah.  She's a bore.
GWEN	f	She's breaking up with her husband of twenty years.  Said a friend,  "Her show's in syndication, she's thin, she's rich and she wants  to play." Josh dries his hands.
JOSH	m	Some poor tree gave its life so we could know that.
GWEN	f	It's comforting, reading about these broken marriages. Josh opens the door into the--
JOSH	m	Why?
GWEN	f	It's not enough for our marriage to succeed.  Everyone else's  must fail.
JOSH	m	Is this going to be one of those nights?
GWEN	f	What?
JOSH	m	One of those nights we talk.
GWEN	f	No.  There's no need to talk, because there's no problem. He gets into bed next to her.
JOSH	m	I've been under a lot of stress.
GWEN	f	You don't have to apologize.  There's nothing wrong with the  slump we're going through.  In fact, it's a good thing.
JOSH	m	How's that? He turns off the side light.  We can't see them -- the room is  completely dark.
GWEN	f	Too much passion can ruin a marriage.  Look at Eric and Sylvia.  at the genitals.  And, then...total burn-out.  A marriage cannot  sustain that kind of intensity.  It's good for people to grow  bored with each other.  That way, they can meet and fall in love  again.
GWEN	f	In case you hadn't noticed...I'm trying to seduce you.
JOSH	m	I can feel that.
GWEN	f	You're welcome to reciprocate. Josh turns on the light and sits up.
JOSH	m	I can't.
GWEN	f	It's alright.
JOSH	m	To seduce...to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise.  surprise?
GWEN	f	Rub my feet. He does.
GWEN	f	I think we should have an affair.
JOSH	m	What?
GWEN	f	With each other.
JOSH	m	That makes no sense.
GWEN	f	You pick me up at a bar...
JOSH	m	And, what?  Pretend I don't know you?
GWEN	f	(ignores him) Or we could meet at a hotel.  I'll register under my maiden name.
JOSH	m	THE GRADUATE is about a married woman having an affair with a  college boy.
GWEN	f	When I met you, you were a college boy.
JOSH	m	Gwen, THE GRADUATE is a story about a very unhappy woman who  has an affair out of wedlock.  As I recall, it turns out rather  badly for her.
GWEN	f	Alright.  Bad example. (rethe foot rub) You can stop.
JOSH	m	Actors pretend.  That's what they do.  I'm not an actor.  And  I love you the way you are.
GWEN	f	I love you, too. And he turns out the light again.
JOSH	m	Pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem.
GWEN	f	Who said there was a problem?
JOSH'S POV	m	Through the crowd he spots Sarah, entering with her date -- Todd.
GWEN	f	Your lovely assistant is here. (reTodd) You didn't tell me she had a new boyfriend.
JOSH	m	I don't ask her about her personal life. Sarah and Todd arrive.
SARAH	f	Hey, you two.  Todd, this is my boss Josh, and his wife Gwen.
TODD	m	Sarah's told me a lot about you. Josh is not sure how to take that.
GWEN	f	Sarah, you look great.  You've been keeping my boy on his best  behavior?
SARAH	f	It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
GWEN	f	I know he asks to go above and beyond the call of duty.
SARAH	f	He can be tough.
JOSH	m	But fair.
GWEN	f	Josh, I'm trying to thank Sarah for all the extra attention she  gives you.
SARAH	f	You're welcome.
GWEN	f	We should really have you over for dinner, Sarah.  It's been  too long.  You can bring...
TODD	m	Todd.
GWEN	f	Sorry.  I'm hopeless when it comes to names.
JOSH	m	Especially after two glasses of champagne.
GWEN	f	Hey, I'm still working on the first, thank you. (to Todd) So, are you two living together?
TODD	m	Living together?  No. Sarah and Todd both laugh.
SARAH	f	We've only known each other a few weeks. Josh reacts -- he knew nothing of this.
GWEN	f	You two seem to fit.  It only took me a few days to know with  Josh.  In fact, I knew after the first date.
SARAH	f	You knew what?
GWEN	f	That he was the one for me.
JOSH	m	(to Sarah) She loves to embarrass me.
SARAH	f	(to Gwen) Don't stop.  I want to hear about this first date.
GWEN	f	Well, it was the cheapest date I've ever been on.
JOSH	m	I was broke.
GWEN	f	Do you know the Chinese place on Third?  That little hole-in-the-wall?
TODD	m	I know it.  Used to be a cool dive.  Now it's ultra-hip and overpriced.
GWEN	f	Really?  I think our first dinner cost a grand total of ten dollars.
JOSH	m	Gwen loves to dissect our first date.
GWEN	f	It was a momentous night.  Babe, we should really go back there.
JOSH	m	Gwen, why don't you continue your stroll down memory lane while  I drink?  Todd, you up for it?
TODD	m	Sure. They move away toward--
JOSH	m	(to bartender) Gin.  Straight up.  Olives. (Todd) What are you having?
TODD	m	I'm fine, thanks.
JOSH	m	So...Sarah's an attractive girl.
TODD	m	Very.
JOSH	m	You two serious?
TODD	m	(shrugs) Hard to say.
JOSH	m	She wants to play the field, right?
TODD	m	No, that's not it.
JOSH	m	I see.  You want to fuck around. Todd reacts.
JOSH	m	C'mon, we're guys.  I know the drill. Todd considers his audience, then decides to open up--
TODD	m	We dated a few times, and to be honest, I was on the fence about  Sarah.  I liked her, but I didn't think we were in a good groove.
JOSH	m	I didn't know. (beat) She didn't say a thing about it.
TODD	m	It wasn't unexpected, but Sarah took it really hard.  So where  did that leave me?  I was ambivalent about things, right?  But  then my ambivalence had to take a back seat.  I had to be there  for her.  Completely.  And, ready or not, our relationship became...a  real relationship.
TODD	m	You know, I wasn't ready to be that involved with anybody.  I  don't know...Death has a funny way of making you get outside  yourself.
JOSH'S POV	m	Gwen is still chatting with Sarah.  Gwen makes eye contact with  Josh and sends him a warm smile.
GWEN	f	You missed the on-ramp.
JOSH	m	I know.
GWEN	f	Why?
JOSH	m	Somewhere we need to go first.
GWEN	f	We don't have to do this tonight.
JOSH	m	Yes, we do. She peers in the window.
GWEN	f	We can't go in here.  Everything's different. He opens the door for her.
JOSH	m	That's okay.  We're different, too.
GWEN	f	Sarah's a very interesting girl.  Did you know she's training  for the marathon?
JOSH	m	I don't want to talk about Sarah.
GWEN	f	What do you want to talk about, then?
JOSH	m	I want to talk about me... A beat.
JOSH	m	...and what a fool I've been. Gwen is not prepared for this.
JOSH	m	I thought if we came here tonight we could...start again.
GWEN	f	(flustered) But I thought you were over this place.  And, look...There's  nothing left.  Not one remnant of our first date...anywhere.
JOSH	m	(brightens) The fortune cookies haven't changed. He brings over the plate.
GWEN	f	You're supposed to wait--
JOSH	m	I can't wait.  I have to know. He opens the first.
JOSH	m	(reading) "You are on the verge of success"...in bed. Gwen laughs, opens one herself.
GWEN	f	(reading) "You will have a change of plans"...in bed. Josh reacts, opens a third.
JOSH	m	(reading) "You are very creative"...in bed.
GWEN	f	Hmm.  That's what I've heard.
JOSH	m	The last cookie.  Go ahead.
GWEN	f	No.  You open it. He slowly cracks in open.
JOSH	m	It's blank. (checks both sides) I got a blank.
GWEN	f	Blank...in bed.  That's disappointing.
JOSH	m	No, it's perfect.  Blank...no problems, no history, nothing...in  bed.
JOSH	m	By the way, I didn't get your name.
GWEN	f	What? (off his smile) Oh, my name. She glances across the street.  A shop window sign reads, "Bail  Bonds."
GWEN	f	My name is Gail.  Gail Bonds.
JOSH	m	Well, Gail, I'm not usually this forward on a first date, may  I take you to my car and ravish you?
GWEN	f	Hmm.  On one condition.
JOSH	m	What's that?
GWEN	f	That you tell me your name.
JOSH	m	Oh, I thought everyone knew my name.  I'm Bill Gates.  Billionaire.
GWEN	f	Is it true what they say, Bill, about billionaires?  That all  the wealth is just a way to compensate...for size?
JOSH	m	People are jealous.
GWEN	f	I can imagine.  It must be so lonely at the top. He reaches between her knees.
GWEN	f	What are you doing?
JOSH	m	What do you think I'm doing? (beat) The fortune cookie said you're on the verge of success...in bed.
GWEN	f	We're not in a bed.
JOSH	m	You shouldn't read fortune cookies too literally. Josh swings Gwen onto his lap.  They go at each other like...a  couple of college kids.
CLOSE ON JOSH	m	As he makes love to his wife, he thinks--
JOSH	m	...Can anyone see us?...Is anyone looking?...Why should it bother  you?  You're alone...with your wife...That's the way it's supposed  to be...You know every inch of her...every smell...every sigh...every  freckle...the shape of her ass...the mole under her nipple...the  whole history of her body...And, you know that if you really  concentrate, you can succeed...in imagining...she's someone you  don't know...
GWEN	f	Color.  That's the problem with this room, it needs color.  Think  of...the vibrant colors of Haiti.
JOANNE	f	Personally, Haiti does nothing for me.  When your father and  I were there -- this was before you were born, I almost died  from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind  me of that trip.
GWEN	f	Alright.  I didn't say anything.
JOANNE	f	Because you're not sure?
GWEN	f	No, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's sleeping with her. (beat) And I may have to kill him.
JOANNE	f	Hmm.
GWEN	f	What?  You think I should just forget about it?
JOANNE	f	Yes, I do.
GWEN	f	Mother, don't you think honesty is essential in a marriage?
JOANNE	f	It depends.  It can be quite detrimental. Gwen begins to pace in exasperation.
JOANNE	f	Alright.  Confront him.  You know where it will get you.  Your  whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing.  All the  things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St. Lucia  -- they'll disappear.  You'll be a divorced woman in her late  30s.  Lonely.
GWEN	f	Why did I invite you over?  You make me feel like shit.
JOANNE	f	That's my job. The phone rings.
GWEN	f	The machine can get it.
JOANNE	f	I don't monitor calls.  It makes me feel like I'm hiding in my  own home.
VOICE	m	Gwen, this is David Warren.  Hopefully, a welcome voice from  your past.  My show's on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.
JOANNE	f	Pick up the phone. Gwen just stares at the machine.
VOICE	m	I have no idea what you're up to...I hope life is treating you  well.  I heard through a friend of a friend of a friend that  you're still married.  Congratulations.  If you want, give me  a call.  I'm crashing at my sister's.  The number is -- hold  on-- the number is 235-4511.  Hope to hear from you.
GWEN	f	Wow.
JOANNE	f	How long has it been?
GWEN	f	College.
JOANNE	f	Have you ever seen his show?  It's absolutely dreadful.  I never  miss it.
GWEN	f	If Josh isn't home, I'll watch it.
JOANNE	f	Hmm.  It's Kismet, then.
GWEN	f	What?
JOANNE	f	A brief liaison with an old flame.  The perfect way to deal with  your anger.
GWEN	f	You're insane.  You're an insane mother.
JOANNE	f	It'll be good for your self-esteem.
GWEN	f	Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee?
DAVID'S VOICE	m	...on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.  Are you free for  coffee...or something?
JOANNE	f	"Coffee...or something."  He's flirting, admit it.  Coffee...or  something.
GWEN	f	He's stammering.  He's nervous.  He's calling out of the blue!
JOANNE	f	You're wrong.  I'm right, and I'm going.  But take a tip from  someone who's been there.  Opportunity is knocking, Gwen.  You  have a chance to level the playing field.
JOSH	m	You're right.  We could use some more color in the living room.
GWEN	f	Yes?
JOSH	m	I said you're right.
GWEN	f	About what?
JOSH	m	About more color in the living room.
GWEN	f	Oh.  I'm glad you think so. She leans closer to inspect a new wrinkle.
DESK CLERK	m	And how many nights will you be staying with us?
GWEN	f	One.
DESK CLERK	m	We do have a two-night minimum.
GWEN	f	Then...two. She hands him the card.
GWEN	f	I'd like to pay in cash.
DESK CLERK	m	That won't be a problem.  We just need a credit card imprint  for your incidentals...
DESK CLERK	m	...which we tear up when you check out. Gwen smiles.
DESK CLERK	m	Will you be needing more than one key?
GWEN	f	Two, please.
DAVID WARREN	m	I'm still reeling.  It was the most humbling experience of my  life.  Getting raked over the coals by a bunch of sixteen-year  old drama students!  At my own alma mater!
GWEN	f	I'm surprised they weren't all over you.
DAVID WARREN	m	They were, with knives drawn.
GWEN	f	What did they say?
DAVID WARREN	m	Basically, why am I working on a piece of shit like MALIBU NIGHTS  when I should be doing Shakespeare or Chekhov?
WAITER	m	Compliments from the table in the corner. The Waiter gestures.  David and Gwen turn.  In the corner three  middle-aged women are smiling.
GWEN	f	See?  Those women are happy you're not doing Shakespeare. Beat.
DAVID WARREN	m	Gwen.  You look great.  You haven't changed a bit.
GWEN	f	I don't think I'm MALIBU NIGHTS material.
DAVID WARREN	m	Those women!  Walking boob jobs.  They're appalling.
GWEN	f	You look like you enjoy kissing them.
DAVID WARREN	m	It's very simple.  I close my eyes and imagine I'm kissing someone  else.
GWEN	f	Hmm.  Someone else in particular?
DAVID WARREN	m	Yes.
GWEN	f	If she's as tan as you, I don't want to hear about it. David reaches for his wallet.
DAVID WARREN	m	Here, take a look... He hands her a photo.  In it, we see David standing with a distinguished  man in his mid-40s.  With them is a smiling boy, about eleven.
DAVID WARREN	m	What's wrong with this picture, huh? She smiles.
GWEN	f	Well...Let's start with the man, upper left.
DAVID WARREN	m	Andy.  My partner.  And the best thing that's ever happened to  me.
GWEN	f	Okay.  And the boy?
DAVID WARREN	m	Eric.  He's Andy's son from a marriage that -- needless to say  -- didn't work.  Andy came out when Eric was just five.  Great  kid.
GWEN	f	And when did you...?
DAVID WARREN	m	Come out?  About fifteen years ago. (off Gwen's look) Is this too much information?
GWEN	f	No.  But fifteen years ago...That was right after--
DAVID WARREN	m	You and me.
GWEN	f	Was I the last woman? David nods.
GWEN	f	Was I that bad? David laughs.
DAVID WARREN	m	No, you were fantastic.  I was completely confused. Gwen quickly gulps down some champagne.
DAVID WARREN	m	What's the matter?
GWEN	f	Nothing.  I'm very happy for you.  And, I have to confess, I'm  relieved.
DAVID WARREN	m	Why? Beat.
GWEN	f	Oh -- what the hell -- we're friends, right?
DAVID WARREN	m	I'm listening.
GWEN	f	I had this ridiculous idea that you wanted to get together to  have a...
DAVID WARREN	m	Oh.
GWEN	f	You know...for old time's sake.
DAVID WARREN	m	Uh-huh.
GWEN	f	And, frankly, I wasn't looking forward to turning you down.   Which I would have, of course.  Had you...asked.  Which you're  not, because you're...you're...
DAVID WARREN	m	Married.
GWEN	f	Right.
DAVID WARREN	m	Happily.
GWEN	f	Right. She slides her empty glass toward him.
GWEN	f	Would you pour me a little more, David?
DESK CLERK	m	Can I help you, ma'am? Gwen looks lost.
DESK CLERK	m	Are you okay?
GWEN	f	I'd like to check out.
DESK CLERK	m	Was there a problem?
GWEN	f	Yes.  I was stood up...by the past. Beat.
DESK CLERK	m	I'm sorry.  We won't charge you for the room.
GWEN	f	No, you don't understand.
DESK CLERK	m	Yes.  I do. (beat) More than you might think. Gwen stares at him.
DESK CLERK	m	Shall I close out the account?
GWEN	f	No.  I need the room after all. (beat) Will you show me the way there? The Desk Clerk looks at her with no apparent interest.
DESK CLERK	m	You're in luck.  I was just about to take my break.
DESK CLERK	m	Something from the mini-bar?
GWEN	f	No.
DESK CLERK	m	How's the air conditioning?
GWEN	f	Fine.
DESK CLERK	m	Shall I pull down the covers?
GWEN	f	I suppose.
DESK CLERK	m	Do you want to know my name?
GWEN	f	No. He takes her in his arms.
DESK CLERK	m	You're shaking.
GWEN	f	I'll be fine. (beat) This could get you in trouble.  You could lose your job, right?
DESK CLERK	m	I don't care.
GWEN	f	You don't even know me.
DESK CLERK	m	You're right.
GWEN	f	We have nothing in common. Beat.
DESK CLERK	m	That's where you're wrong. He begins to unbutton her blouse.  Without touching.  Without  affection.  After a beat, she begins to unbutton his shirt.
DESK CLERK	m	(to the Maid) Buenas tardes, se�ora.
GWEN	f	Thank you for taking care of the room.
DESK CLERK	m	Your welcome. And they ride in silence. In Gwen's mind--
GWEN	f	...And now the score is tied...Oh my God, what will I tell my  mother?  I did it with a desk clerk.  Hardly the affair to remember...Of  course, she will disapprove.  "Is English even his first language?  field?  You don't even know the boy's name--"
GWEN	f	What's your name?
DESK CLERK	m	David.
GWEN	f	What?  You're kidding me. Gwen laughs -- she can't help it.
DAVID	m	No.  What's so funny?
GWEN	f	Nothing, it's just-- She laughs even harder.  The elevator door opens.  David gets  out and looks at her oddly.
GWEN	f	Sorry, I just...I didn't think you'd be named David.
DESK CLERK #2	m	There's a woman waiting to see you.  She's been here for half  an hour.
DAVID	m	Why are you here?
ROSALIE	f	You weren't going to return my calls.
DAVID	m	Don't you have more important things to do?  Picking flowers,  honeymoon reservations...
ROSALIE	f	Is there somewhere we can talk? The desk phone rings.  David picks it up.
DAVID	m	(into phone) Front desk, David speaking...No, sir.  Tap water is very drinkable  in this city...Of course, sir.  We'll send up some bottled water  right away.
ROSALIE	f	Is there somewhere we can talk?
DAVID	m	What's wrong with here?
ROSALIE	f	Privately.
DAVID	m	But here, I won't be tempted to raise my voice or do something  rash.  That's the first lesson of hotel management.  Never lose  your cool, no matter how annoying the guest is.  Not that I plan  to go into hotel management.  I don't have ambitions in that  direction.  Or any direction, if I recall you correctly.
DAVID	m	(into phone) Front desk, David speaking...Yes, ma'am, the restaurant has a  smoking section...Well, I didn't make the policy...If it's any  consolation, the smokers are seated in a little corner of the  patio, and they feel very bad about themselves.
DAVID	m	Rosie, you'd better leave.  Before I get myself fired. She starts to protest.  Thinks better of it, and exits.
HOTEL MANAGER	m	Yo, fiddler on the roof. David reacts -- this is the last person he wants to deal with.
HOTEL MANAGER	m	(regards the violin) Wish I could play an instrument.  Chicks really dig that stuff.
DAVID	m	Discipline.  Always a struggle.
HOTEL MANAGER	m	I hear you.  For instance, it takes a certain discipline to know  that when you're working at the hotel, when you're on the clock...
DAVID	m	It won't happen again.
HOTEL MANAGER	m	Good. David marches away.
ROSALIE.	?	She's been waiting.
DAVID	m	Jesus! She simply picks up where they left off--
ROSALIE	f	I want you to be there on Sunday.
DAVID	m	No.
ROSALIE	f	You told me we'd always be friends.
DAVID	m	I lied.
ROSALIE	f	You're an important part of my life, David.  There's so much  history between us.  I don't want to trash it simply because--
DAVID	m	Because what?  Because you're getting married? Beat.
DAVID	m	Rosie, I want you to be happy.  I do.  And someday, we'll be  friends.  Someday, we'll all go out to dinner.  The four of us.
ROSALIE	f	The four of us?
DAVID	m	Sure.  Me, you, Jerry, and whatever pale imitation of you I can  dig up to be my date.
ROSALIE	f	Stop it. But he's on a roll--
DAVID	m	And the check will come and Jerry will pick up the tab and I'll  protest, but not too much.  Then, you'll give me a kiss on the  cheek, and some dim memory will stir in me, but not for too long.  to see you...
WEDDING PLANNER	m	We've  got a few more things to cover.  The photos.  There's  a courtyard behind the church.  It's a popular backdrop.  Our  photographer says the light is gorgeous.  We need twenty minutes  before the ceremony for singles.
JERRY	m	I know.  It is an election year.
WEDDING PLANNER	m	Exactly what he said.
ROSALIE	f	It's okay.
WEDDING PLANNER	m	Right.  The guest list.  We have a few more no-show's. She consults a list.
WEDDING PLANNER	m	Mr. and Mrs. Bennett send their regrets.  Also, Ms. Rothman will  no be attending.
ROSALIE	f	Oh.  David Freeman.  He's not coming. Jerry reacts.
JERRY	m	He's not?
ROSALIE	f	No.  He's not.
JERRY	m	After all that shit you put me through, now he's not even coming.
WEDDING PLANNER	m	So, if there are any last-minute--
JERRY	m	(ignores her) I guess that means you've been talking with him.
ROSALIE	f	Yes, I talked to him.  And I... (to Wedding Planner) Would you excuse us for a minute?
WEDDING PLANNER	m	Take your time. Rosalie gets up and leads Jerry into--
ROSALIE	f	I talked to David.  And...I uninvited him.
JERRY	m	What?
ROSALIE	f	I told him it wasn't right.  I told him he shouldn't be at our  wedding.
JERRY	m	When did you decide this?
ROSALIE	f	I don't know...I just realized I don't want our wedding to be  about where I've been.  I want it to be about where you and I  are going.
JERRY	m	What did he say?
ROSALIE	f	Jerry...
JERRY	m	I want to know.
ROSALIE	f	He was disappointed--
JERRY	m	Of course he was.  He's still in love with you.
ROSALIE	f	But he understands.  I drew the line, honey.
JERRY	m	Thank-you.
ROSALIE	f	I did it for us. Rosalie gives him a kiss.
DAVID	m	(into phone) What do you want, Rose?
ROSALIE	f	Were you sleeping?
DAVID	m	Yes.  I was.
ROSALIE	f	Liar.  You're practicing.  I can hear you. He moves to the window.
DAVID'S POV	m	Rosalie -- on her cell -- waves to him from the sidewalk, three  stories below.
ROSALIE	f	It's so sad.  Why do you always play sad songs?
DAVID	m	I don't write 'em, Rose. (beat) Is our conversation over now?
ROSALIE	f	Please let me in.
DAVID	m	No. She laughs mischievously.
ROSALIE	f	You don't trust me?
DAVID	m	No. (beat) Stay there.  I'll be right...Wait a minute.  This is insane.
ROSALIE	f	I'm going to wait here for one minute.  Sixty seconds.
DAVID	m	You do that.
ROSALIE	f	Then, I'm gone.  You won't see me again. She hangs up.  He hangs up.
DAVID'S POV	m	Rosalie sits on the front steps.  Stubborn.
DAVID	m	(to himself) Be my guest.  Sit there all night. David turns from the window.  He accidentally knocks his metronome  to the floor, setting it off.  Click...click...click...
DAVID	m	If I go down those stairs...it will only lead to one place...right  back here...the two of us...a short, brilliant moment...one more  to add to the gallery...then, empty-handed again, with nothing  to show for it but an emotional hangover...I'm not going to open  this door... Discipline... Like the man said, don't fuck the  guests...
DAVID	m	I've got nothing to say to you.
ROSALIE	f	Fine.  I'll talk... A beat.
ROSALIE	f	The reason I won't just leave you alone is not because I'm "confused."  that I can love Jerry and love you.  And that one love has nothing  to do with the other.  But it's true.
DAVID	m	Rose...
ROSALIE	f	What?
DAVID	m	This is bullshit.  I can't spell it out any more plainly.  It's  impossible!
ROSALIE	f	Why?
DAVID	m	Because I can't be this close to you...and not want to touch  you.
ROSALIE	f	That's it?
DAVID	m	That's...it. And he does touch her.  He puts his hand on her leg.
DAVID	m	And if I can't do that, I don't want to be your friend.  Not  now.  Not ever.
ROSALIE	f	Don't be so mean. David flashes an angry look.  Then, he pulls Rosalie close to  him.
DAVID	m	The bottom line is...If I'm with you, I have to touch you, to  kiss you.  That doesn't work for friends, does it?
DAVID	m	When I'm not with you -- this is more than you need to know...If  I touch myself, I can only think about one person. You.  No one  else.  Just you.
ROSALIE	f	What do we do?
DAVID	m	What do you mean "we"?  This is your problem. (beat) My only problem is how to get you out of my mind.  How to erase  you...Delete every bit of you...
ROSALIE	f	Stop... She kisses him.  He engulfs her in his arms.
DAVID	m	You have to say good-bye.
ROSALIE	f	I don't know how...
DAVID	m	Should we stop? Rosalie is too choked up to answer -- she shakes her head "no."
ROSALIE	f	David, will you hand me my shampoo?  It's in my purse. David opens Rosalie's purse and finds a travel-size bottle of  shampoo.
ROSALIE	f	Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the  fruit of thy womb Jesus...Holy  Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour  of our death, Amen...Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the  fruit of...
ON ROSALIE	m	She nudges him.  He doesn't stir.  Rosalie sits at the foot of  the bed.  She grabs the remote and "un-mutes" the sound.
EXPERT	m	...And the change is not just physical.  You'll be amazed how  quickly your whole outlook will--
JERRY	m	Hey...
ROSALIE	f	Hey...
JERRY	m	What time is it?
ROSALIE	f	Late. He looks at the time.
JERRY	m	It is late.  What happened?
ROSALIE	f	Oh.  The girls.  Wedding talk.  We could've gone on all night.
ROSALIE	f	Jerry...
JERRY	m	What?
ROSALIE	f	We need to make love now.
JERRY	m	Okay...why now?
ROSALIE	f	I can't explain it.  We just need to make love now. He nods.  He kisses her neck, her breasts. Suddenly she stops him, taking his face in her hands.
JERRY	m	What's the matter?
ROSALIE	f	I just need to fix this moment in my mind. A long beat.  She studies his face.
ROSALIE	f	I love you.  Totally.  Completely.  I don't want to spend another  minute of my life without you.
JERRY	m	You're forgetting something.
ROSALIE	f	No, I'm not. He laughs uncomfortably.
JERRY	m	Don't you think...
ROSALIE	f	No, I don't.  Let's not use it tonight. (beat) I'm ready. A beat.
JERRY	m	If you're ready, so am I. She straddles him, rocking back and forth.  With grim determination.
ROSALIE	f	Jerry?
JERRY	m	What?
ROSALIE	f	Talk to me...
FLASH!	?	rOSALIE I know. (beat) But I also know you would've enjoyed it more if I hadn't...
FLASH...FLASH!	?	rOSALIE I won't.  I promise. cUT TO:
PRIEST	m	A lot of young couples prefer "husband and wife" to the traditional  "man and wife."  Personally, I don't feel the phrase "man and  wife" gives the woman a diminutive status.  But I leave the choice  in your hands.  Do you have a--
ROSALIE	f	Husband and wife.  Definitely. Jerry simply nods.
PRIEST	m	Good. (to Jerry) After the blessing, I'll instruct you to kiss the bride.  Keep  it simple.  No slobbering.
ROSALIE	f	That could be tough.  For him. The Priest feigns amusement.
PRIEST	m	Remember, this is God's house.  And there will be prominent people  here as well.  Not to mention the press.  So, let's keep things  on the up-and-up.
FATHER	m	Here we are.  Bahia Gold.  Two hundred a box.
JERRY	m	You don't have to do this, Dad.
FATHER	m	If I can't come to the bachelor party, I want to be there in  spirit.
JERRY	m	Thank-you.
FATHER	m	I remember my bachelor night.  Frankly, I wish I didn't.  Not  a night I'm particularly proud of...I'll leave it at that.
JERRY	m	Why are you sharing this?
FATHER	m	Reminiscing.  That's all.
JERRY	m	Or warning me.
FATHER	m	Nonsense.  I know you.  You won't make an ass out of yourself.
JERRY	m	What's this?
FATHER	m	It's a key. (smiles) There's a new housing development, just west of here.  I've been  giving the developer a lot of breaks, and...now he's giving me  one in return.  I'm almost embarrassed to say how little this  cost me.
JERRY	m	I can't accept this.
FATHER	m	Yes, you can. (beat) C'mon.  Make your old man happy. Jerry says nothing.
FATHER	m	Uh-huh.  I get it.  This is Rosalie's domain.  She should have  a say in where you two settle down.  But don't worry, you won't  be forcing her hand.  Know why?  Because she's going to love  it.
FATHER	m	Let's ring these babies up.
BEST FRIEND	m	Alright, my man.  You ready?
JERRY	m	Do I have a choice?
BEST FRIEND	m	No.
JERRY	m	Then, I'm ready.
BEST FRIEND	m	The guys pitched in for this... He pats Jerry on the back.
BEST FRIEND	m	So go up there and get our money's worth. Jerry starts up--
JERRY	m	Why am I stopping?...There's a hot girl waiting on the other  side of the door...Why worry?  Everyone cuts you slack for this  kind of thing...This is supposed to happen...It's a tradition,  a time-honored ritual...Losing your tooth, losing your virginity,  losing the championship...If I walk through this door, what am  I losing?  Nothing...My father was here, and his father was here,  and his father's father was here, hand on the door...What am  I waiting for...
LORNA	f	Sitting on the bed in a tank-top and a short skirt.  As fetching  as ever.
LORNA	f	You must be the groom. Jerry laughs.
LORNA	f	The guys were right.  You're a looker.
JERRY	m	Did they also tell you I don't usually do this kind of thing.
LORNA	f	All the better.  I like challenges. She crosses to face him.
LORNA	f	Getting married tomorrow, huh?
JERRY	m	Yes, I am.
LORNA	f	Love, honor, and obey.  That's the drill, isn't it?
JERRY	m	Yes.  Tomorrow, I take the vows. Without much ceremony, she starts massaging his crotch.
LORNA	f	Tomorrow...So, technically, this doesn't count.
JERRY	m	How's that?
LORNA	f	You can't break a vow you haven't taken, can you?
JERRY	m	You sound like my lawyer. Lorna kneels down before him.  She unzips his pants.
LORNA	f	I've done my share of lawyers.  They spend most of the hour negotiating  the tip.
JERRY	m	I got it. She pulls down his pants, looks up at him.
LORNA	f	Something bothering you?
JERRY	m	I don't know if I should be doing this. She starts to stroke him.
LORNA	f	Want my philosophy?  If we don't make mistakes now and then,  how are we ever going to learn from them?
JERRY	m	Now you sound like my priest.
LORNA	f	I've done a few of them, too.
JERRY	m	Priests?
LORNA	f	Lousy tippers.  They spend most of the hour feeling bad about  what they're doing.  But they do it anyway.  Then, they shortchange  you on the tip.  One of them absolved me once, before he left.
JERRY	m	Who are the best tippers?
LORNA	f	The guys who can least afford it.  Guys with families.
JERRY	m	And the worst?
LORNA	f	Hands-down.  Politicians. Jerry reacts.
JERRY	m	Politicians?
LORNA	f	Sure.  Both parties.  I don't discriminate.  Besides, a penis  doesn't know from politics.  A penis is the most politically  incorrect part of the body.  It has a simple agenda.
JERRY	m	Stop it.  I can't do it.
LORNA	f	Don't worry about it.
JERRY	m	I can't...I'm sorry. Lorna instinctively puts a little distance between herself and  Jerry.
LORNA	f	Hey, it's no sweat.  I get paid either way.
JERRY	m	No, you don't understand.  I can't fucking go through with it!
JERRY	m	Jesus! Adrenaline pumping, he doesn't even notice the blood on his hand.
ON LORNA	m	She shakes her head --  she's completely nonplussed.
LORNA	f	That was smart.   Now, you're bleeding.  Here... She takes him by the arm into--
LORNA	f	Better?
JERRY	m	Yeah...
LORNA	f	Do you love her?
JERRY	m	I don't know.
LORNA	f	C'mon.  Let's sit down. They return to--
JERRY	m	She wants to have a baby.  That's the way it's supposed to be,  right?
LORNA	f	I wouldn't know.
JERRY	m	My parents approve of her.  Her parents approve of me.  Everybody  approves...
LORNA	f	What's wrong with a little approval? Jerry gives her a hard look.
JERRY	m	That's my whole life.  My whole goddam carrot-and-stick-life.  or that person's approval.  Playing one role, then another.   Then another!  The good student.  The good son.  The industrious  boy.  Good grades.  High ambitions.  Pats on the back.  Handshakes  from people who matter!  The good boyfriend, getting on his knees  and proposing to the good girlfriend.  The dutiful bachelor,  receiving the traditional blow-job from a...
LORNA	f	(lets him off the hook) Professional.
JERRY	m	I've lost count of all the roles, there's so many of them. (beat) I have no idea who I'm playing now.
LORNA	f	Huh. A beat.
LORNA	f	I don't see what the big deal is.  I play roles all the time.
JERRY	m	And you want to do that your entire life?  You can't...you...
LORNA	f	Lorna.  And I'll do whatever the hell I want.
JERRY	m	Well, I can't live somebody else's version of my life anymore.
LORNA	f	Sure.  I do. She gets up and crosses to the window.  Lifts it up.
LORNA	f	Here's your chance.
JERRY	m	What?
LORNA	f	It's not too far a drop to the lawn.  You have gas in your car?
HIS POV	m	The suburbs at night.  Cozy, warm-lit.
JERRY	m	I'm going to do it. He smiles at Lorna.  Then, he climbs out the window.
LORNA'S POV	?	She watches him hit the ground, hobble across the lawn, and get  into his car.  And he's gone.
LORNA	f	See?  Easy. She sits on the bed, takes in the room.  It seems ordinary and  strange, all at once.
LORNA'S POV	?	Behind the counter lies a crumpled newspaper.
LORNA	f	(to Waitress) Mind if I have that?
WAITRESS	?	It's yesterday's.  Morning paper should be here any minute.
LORNA	f	I just want the crossword puzzle. The Waitress puts the paper in front of her.  It falls open to  the Metro section, where Lorna sees a photo of Jerry and Rosalie  -- the one Todd shot.
LORNA	f	Oh my... The Waitress cranes her neck to see.
WAITRESS	?	There's a catch, alright.
TERRI	f	Hello...It's the oldest condition known to man.  Cold feet.
LORNA	f	You're wrong.  I'm telling you he's two states away by now.
TERRI	f	If you're wrong, you're paying for drinks tonight.
TERRI	f	Well, what do you know... Lorna can't believe it -- she almost feels betrayed.
TERRI	f	Told you we should've dressed up.
LORNA	f	C'mon...we're going inside.
TERRI	f	What for?  Wait... But Lorna is bounding toward the cathedral.
TERRI	f	Lorna, we shouldn't be here. Hearing her name Todd looks up.  Then, he gathers his gear and  starts inside.
LORNA	f	Excuse me, could you tell me who's getting married in... (beat) Hey, I know you.  The wedding guy.
TODD	m	I'm sorry. Have we met?
LORNA	f	Yeah.  You don't remember me?
TODD	m	You must be thinking of somebody else. Lorna reacts.  Stops herself.
LORNA	f	Right.  I must be thinking of someone else.  Sorry.
TODD	m	Excuse me... And he disappears into the church.
TERRI	f	What was that all about?
LORNA	f	Nothing.
TERRI	f	Nothing, my ass.
LORNA	f	Alright, alright.  I slipped.
TERRI	f	Slipped?  You broke the cardinal rule of the trade. (pedantic) Never acknowledge a client in public.
LORNA	f	What is this?  Hooking For Dummies?  C'mon... Lorna grabs Terri by the wrist and slips into--
LORNA'S POV	?	The front pews are packed, all eyes focussed on the wedding party  at the altar.  Jerry and Rosalie face the priest, who blesses  the ring.
PRIEST	m	The wedding ring is a powerful symbol.  It is a circle, with  no beginning and no end.  It is also the circle that encloses  your love for each other--
TERRI	f	I'll bet that dress is Vera Wang.
LORNA	f	Shhh... Jerry and Rosalie turn to face each other.
PRIEST	m	Do you, Rosalie, take this man, to have and to hold, in sickness  and in health, till death do you part?
ROSALIE	f	I do.
PRIEST	m	And do you, Jerry, take this woman, to have and to hold, in sickness  and in health, till death do you part?
JERRY	m	I do.
PRIEST	m	Then, by the power invested in me by Christ, Our Lord, I now  pronounce you husband and wife.
TERRI	f	You're crying, I can't believe it.
LORNA	f	No, I'm not. (beat) Weddings make me cry. The congregation applauds.  Jerry shakes hands with the best  man -- his Father.  He gives his son an approving pat on the  back.
SECURITY GUARD	m	Ladies, this event is strictly for invited guests.
TERRI	f	We're with the groom's party.
SECURITY GUARD	m	Ma'am...Let's not do this.  You're not with the groom. Terri points to Lorna.
TERRI	f	She had his cock in her mouth last night.  Doesn't that count?
LORNA	f	I don't know why he came back. (beat) It wasn't love.
TERRI	f	Guess you'll never know for sure. They start down the sidewalk--
TERRI	f	Remember the guy I told you about -- the writer?
LORNA	f	Yeah.  He said he wanted to immortalize you.  What a line.
TERRI	f	He's been steady work.  Every Tuesday for the past month.  Well,  get this.  Yesterday, he called and asked me out.
LORNA	f	On a date?
TERRI	f	Yeah.  A date.
LORNA	f	A non-paying date.
TERRI	f	No money will be exchanged.  You want to hear the weird part?
LORNA	f	You're right.  That is weird.
TERRI	f	You gotta keep an open mind, Lorna. (beat) You never know with people. They wait at the crosswalk.  Lorna idly glances at the window  of a brownstone apartment.
WHAT LORNA SEES	m	A Man finishing a cigarette.  He catches Lorna looking his way.  The Man gives Lorna a last look before pulling the curtains closed.
TERRI	f	C'mon, what are you waiting for?
ON LORNA	m	She lingers at the curb for a moment, pondering her next move.
