NARRATOR	m	No one would have believed in the early  years of the21st century, that our world  was being watched by intelligences greater  than our own. That as men busied themselves  about their various concerns, they observed  and studied. Like the way a man with  a microscope might scrutinize the creatures  that swarm and multiply in a drop of  water. With infinite complacency men  went to and fro about the globe, confident  of our empire over this world. Yet,  across the gulf of space, intellects,  vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded  our plant with envious eyes. And slowly  and surely, drew their plans against  us.
SAL	m	Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!
SAL	m	I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00  I got half of Korea coming in.
RAY	m	No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour  blow! Call Tadesko.
SAL	m	Tadesko can't move 40 containers in  an hour. I need somebody who can do  double picks.
RAY	m	I wish I could help you Sal. God damn  union regulations.
SAL	m	(getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position  here!
RAY	m	Come on, you remember the union regulations,  Sal.
SAL	m	(angrily) You know what your problem  is?
RAY	m	(joking) I can think of a couple of  women who'd be happy to tell you.
RAY	m	Is it 8:30? We say that?
MARY ANN	f	We said 8:00.
RAY	m	(changing subject) Hey, this is one  safe looking vehicle you got yourself  here Tim. Congratulations.
TIM	m	Thank You.
RAY	m	8 o'clock huh?
MARY ANN	f	Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,  depending on the traffic.
RAY	m	There he is! You got a hug?
RAY	m	(continues) Confusing handshake? (joking)  Kick in the teeth? The door's locked.  (to Mary Ann): Still working on those  manners?
RACHEL	f	Hello dad.
RAY	m	Hello, Rachel!
ROBBIE	m	(during bickering, at the front door)  The door's locked.
MARY ANN	f	(suit case in hand) I'll just get it  in the door.
RACHEL	f	It's got rollers, just roll it.
MARY ANN	f	Well we can't roll it up the stairs  now can we?
RAY	m	Really, I got it from here, okay?
RAY	m	(to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be  out of here next week.
RAY	m	(trying to get her to leave) You better  get going if you want to beat the traffic,  don't you think?
MARY ANN	f	You're out of milk. (smells it) And  everything else.
RAY	m	(mad) Would you close the door please?  Now that that's my refrigerator.
TIM	m	I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel)  I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see  you in a few days.
RACHEL	f	Bye Tim.
MARY ANN	f	I'd better get this upstairs.
RACHEL	f	(trying to get her bag form Mary Ann)  Mom, Mom!
RAY	m	Mary Ann, let me get this.
MARY ANN	f	I can get it.
RAY	m	(rushes to close his bedroom door, as  if hiding something) Excuse me.
MARY ANN	f	A little old to still be sharing aren't  they?
RAY	m	I don't hear any complaints.
MARY ANN	f	No, I do.
MARY ANN	f	Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie  to make sure he's listening) ...on the  French occupation of Algeria due Monday  which he's yet to begin. It would be  nice if he were done by the time we  got back so we don't have to keep him  up all night on Sunday.
ROBBIE	m	I just got to type it up. (makes typing  motion)
MARY ANN	f	No, you just got to start writing it  first.
ROBBIE	m	(interrupts her) I love you mom!
MARY ANN	f	I love you. (begins walking over to  Rachel) Listen to your father.
MARY ANN	f	Oh, no shoes on the bed.
MARY ANN	f	We'll be at my parent's house in Boston  but don't call the house line, because  you know. Well the point is I've got  my cell phone. So if anything comes  up, or if you have any questions just  call.
RAY	m	Believe it or not, I can handle it.
MARY ANN	f	I'll leave the phone on.
RAY	m	Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for  you.
MARY ANN	f	You think?
RAY	m	Yeah.
MARY ANN	f	Take care of our kids.
RAY	m	Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about.  Listen, you tell your mother that Ray  sends his love and kisses.
MARY ANN	f	(laughs) She'll love that.
ROBBIE	m	Baseball season's over.
RAY	m	Five minutes. It's not going to kill  you.
RAY	m	There he is. (Robbie puts on his new  cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how  it is? (no response from Robbie) That's  how it's gonna be?
RAY	m	Careful with that throw.
ROBBIE	m	Whatever Ray!
RAY	m	Your mom says you've got a report due  on Monday, so you are going to work  on that when you're done here.
ROBBIE	m	Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got  to type it up.
RAY	m	Yeah, bullshit!
ROBBIE	m	Yeah, and what do you know Ray?
RAY	m	Everything. Haven't you heard? Between  me and my brother, we know everything.
RACHEL	f	What's the capital of Australia?
RAY	m	That's one my brother knows.
ROBBIE	m	Is it okay with you if I just laugh  the first 500 times you tell that one.
RAY	m	Just do your report. We don't send you  to school so you can flunk out.
ROBBIE	m	You don't pay for it, Tim does.
RAY	m	That's half of what I've got.
ROBBIE	m	You're an asshole. I hate coming here.
RAY	m	That why you act like such a dick?
RAY	m	What?
RACHEL	f	That's not how you're going to get through  to him. You want him to listen to you...
RAY	m	(interrupts her) What are you? Your  mother or mine?
RACHEL	f	Where are you going?
RAY	m	To sleep. I work for a living.
RACHEL	f	What are we supposed to eat?
RAY	m	You know, order.
RAY	m	What's the matter?
RACHEL	f	I got a splinter.
RAY	m	Where'd you get it. Come here.
RACHEL	f	On your porch railing.
RAY	m	What, you want me to... (beat) You want  me to take that out for you?
RACHEL	f	Absolutely not!
RAY	m	Well, come here let me see it.
RAY	m	It's gonna get infected.
RACHEL	f	No it wont.
RAY	m	Yes, it's gonna get infected.
RACHEL	f	No, it won't. When it's ready, my body  will just push it out.
RAY	m	Push it out?
RACHEL	f	I read that. (as she sits back down)  You should get TiVo. Tim got it for  my room. It's awesome. I can watch all  my shows after homework.
RAY	m	Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum  card. Robbie? (no response) Robbie?
RAY	m	(with the disgusting food in his mouth)  What is that?
RACHEL	f	Hummus.
RAY	m	Hummus?
RACHEL	f	From the health food place. I kept one  of their menus last time we were here.
RACHEL	f	Uh, you said order!
RAY	m	(laughs) I meant order food! Where is  Robbie?
RACHEL	f	He went out.
RAY	m	Out where?
RACHEL	f	I don't know. He just took your car  and left.
FRIEND 1	m	You ever see something like that?
RAY	m	(scratching his chin) In the springtime  maybe. Not this time of year. Come on,  we can see better from the back yard.
RAY	m	That is so weird.
FRIEND 2	m	What?
RAY	m	The wind is blowing toward the storm.
FRIEND 2	m	That is weird.
RAY	m	Rachel, wanna see something cool?
RAY	m	It's okay.
RACHEL	f	I want to go inside.
RAY	m	It's okay.
RACHEL	f	I want to go inside.
RAY	m	Okay, you go ahead.
FRIEND 2	m	That's enough weather for me. (begins  walking inside)
RACHEL	f	I don't want to go by myself.
RAY	m	Kind of fun, ain't it?
RACHEL	f	No.
RAY	m	Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of  July.
RACHEL	f	No it's not.
RAY	m	It's okay. You're fine.
RACHEL	f	It hit right behind our house.
RAY	m	Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there  again because lighting doesn't strike  twice in the same place.
RAY	m	Oh, SHIT!
RACHEL	f	Where's Robbie?
RAY	m	I don't know.
RACHEL	f	Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you  okay?
RAY	m	Where's the thunder?
RACHEL	f	Why won't it stop?
RACHEL	f	(with hesitation) Is it over?
RACHEL	f	Where are you going?
RAY	m	Just checking things out. Just wait,  wait there.
RACHEL	f	Are we going to be okay?
RAY	m	I don't know.
RACHEL	f	You don't know.
RAY	m	No. I meant... Rachel, please, just  stop asking so many questions. Just  wait here.
FRIEND 2	m	You believe this Ray? Every single car.
RAY	m	(worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
ROBBIE	m	The car just stopped and...
RAY	m	(interrupts him) You're okay? Are you  okay?
ROBBIE	m	... and the lighting started hitting  about a block away over and over again.  And me and this other guy we...
RAY	m	(getting angry) Where the hell'd you  go?
ROBBIE	m	Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ...  by the church.
RAY	m	Did you see it? Did you... Were you  near it?
ROBBIE	m	Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and  over the lighting started hitting. It  opened up this hole or something...
RAY	m	26 times?
ROBBIE	m	Yeah.
RAY	m	Okay, well, you're okay?
ROBBIE	m	Yeah.
RAY	m	Good, because your sister is in the  house, I want you to go in that house  and I want you to stay with her. Okay?  (break, as he starts running down the  street) And the next time you take my  car with no driver's license and no  permission, I call the cops. You better  be there when I get back.
RAY	m	Robbie. (snaps his hands together)
RAY	m	Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it,  dead?
MANNY	m	All of them, everything, look at this...  (taps the starter motor) starter's fried.
RAY	m	Lightning hit it?
MANNY	m	Not even close. I thought if I changed  it... you got any idea what's going  on?
RAY	m	I'm on my way to find out. Try umm...  try changing the solenoids.
MANNY	m	Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right  see, I told you that, the solenoids.
COP 1	m	Let us through. Let us through here.
FRIEND 3	m	Hey, what up, Ray?
RAY	m	(joking) I should of known you two were  behind this.
FRIEND 3	m	Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor  hood
RAY	m	Can you blame him?
FRIEND 4	m	You see it?
RAY	m	Yep, you got power where you are?
FRIEND 3	m	Nope, nothing.
RAY	m	It's the cars though. That's the thing.
FRIEND 4	m	Solar Flare, that's what this guy told  me.
RAY	m	A solar flare?
FRIEND 4	m	Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma,  they turn into solar flare flashes.  It's the only thing that can kill all  of the electronic stuff.
FRIEND 3	m	Can I say something?
FRIEND 4	m	What bro?
FRIEND 3	m	The sun does not cause lightning, okay?
FRIEND 4	m	Bro, I'm just telling you what that  guy said he heard.
FRIEND 3	m	I know but it just sounds dumb saying  that...
COP 1	m	I never seen anything like this before.  That many strikes of lighting in one  spot.
RAY	m	Is this the only place?
FRIEND 4	m	Is it hot?
RAY	m	No. It's freezing.
COP 2	m	What is that?
RAY	m	You feel that?
FRIEND 3	m	Yeah, I feel that.
FRIEND 4	m	What is it the subway?
COP 1	m	There's no subway here.
FRIEND 4	m	PATH Train maybe?
COP 1	m	That can't be the water main.
COP 2	m	There's nothing else down there.
COP 1	m	The water main doesn't run through here.
COP 2	m	Well, there's something down there and  it's moving.
FRIEND 4	m	Oh my god.
FRIEND 4	m	Ray, no, stay man.
ROBBIE	m	What happened?
RACHEL	f	What's going on?
RACHEL	f	Dad, what's the matter?
ROBBIE	m	What's all that stuff all over you?
RACHEL	f	What's all the stuff?
ROBBIE	m	Hello? Ray?
RAY	m	We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.
ROBBIE	m	(questioning) What? Wait. I have no  idea what's going on...
RAY	m	(while Robbie asks) ... all the food  from the refrigerator and the cupboard,  put it in here.
ROBBIE	m	I think we are having a bit of a shock  here...what's going on, just tell me...
RAY	m	Just do it.
RAY	m	Rachel, sweetheart...
RACHEL	f	Dad, you're really scaring me.
RAY	m	I need you to get your suitcase...
RACHEL	f	Dad. (break) Dad!
RAY	m	The one that you brought, bring it to  me, okay?
RAY	m	Can you do that for me, darling?
ROBBIE	m	What's happening?
RAY	m	Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We...  We've only got about another minute.
RAY	m	Please, Please, Please.
RAY	m	Just keep it down.
ROBBIE	m	Ray, I'm standing right beside you.  Can you please answer me?
RAY	m	Just get in the front seat Robbie.
RACHEL	f	Who's car is this?
RAY	m	Just get in.
RACHEL	f	Who's car is this?
MANNY	m	Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right.  I had to change the sole... Ray?
MANNY	m	Hey Ray? Ray? What?
MANNY	m	Ray. Open up.
MANNY	m	Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR
MANNY	m	What are you...
RAY	m	(interrupts him) Get in.
MANNY	m	That's funny, you gotta get out of the  car. You can't take it.
MANNY	m	It's not my car. It's not your car.  Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy  kids. Guy's gonna come back...
RAY	m	(interrupts him) I don't have time to  expl....
MANNY	m	(interrupts him) You're busting my chops.  I got a shop to run. You know how many  people...
RAY	m	(interrupts him) Get in!
MANNY	m	No, RAY GET OUT OF THE...
RACHEL	f	What do you mean?
MANNY	m	All right, get out of the truck! I'm  not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR
MANNY	m	I'm not fooling around, I got a busy  day ahead of me...
RAY	m	(to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!
RACHEL	f	Is this the terrorists?!?!
ROBBIE	m	Where are we going?!?!?!
RAY	m	We gotta go! We got to be the only working  car around here. I'm not stopping until  we are clear.
RAY	m	We gotta go.
RAY	m	Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep  it down Rachel!
RAY	m	Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!
ROBBIE	m	(with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING
ROBBIE	m	Okay, (slapping his arms together on  top of each other, demonstrating) Put  em' up Rache.
ROBBIE	m	Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows  so she holds the position. He begins  to calm her down) This space right here,  this is yours.
ROBBIE	m	... This belongs to you, right?
RACHEL	f	(panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes...
ROBBIE	m	(reassuring her) You're safe in your  space.
RACHEL	f	(keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my  space.
ROBBIE	m	(reassuring her) You're safe in your  space. Nothing is going to happen to  you in your space.
RACHEL	f	I'm really scared.
ROBBIE	m	I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk  to dad...
RACHEL	f	No....
ROBBIE	m	(reassuring her) I will be two feet  away. Okay.
ROBBIE	m	Will you hold my hand?
RACHEL	f	Yes.
ROBBIE	m	Are you gonna be okay?
RACHEL	f	(relatively calm) Yes.
ROBBIE	m	(taking a breath to calm himself) I  want to know everything you know.
RAY	m	This thing, this machine, it crawled  out of the ground and started torching  everything, just killing everybody.
ROBBIE	m	What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?
RAY	m	No, this came from some place else.
ROBBIE	m	You mean like Europe?
RAY	m	That machine, it was already buried.
RAY	m	Maybe it came down in the lightning  storm.
ROBBIE	m	Wait a minute... you just said it was  buried.
RAY	m	No, the machine I'm talking about was  buried. But, what came down in the lighting  storm, what operates it. That's the...  that's the.... You know. The....
RACHEL	f	The what?
ROBBIE	m	Why aren't there any helicopters or  airplanes?
RAY	m	Hey Rache. How you doing there girl?  (to Robbie) How she doing?
ROBBIE	m	How you doing?
RACHEL	f	I'm fine.
ROBBIE	m	(to Ray) She's good.
RAY	m	Good.  Hey, what was that thing you  did with her?
ROBBIE	m	Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic.
RAY	m	Hey Rachel
RACHEL	f	I want mom.
RAY	m	I know. You feel better?
RACHEL	f	I want mom.
RAY	m	Yeah, tell me about it, you know?
RACHEL	f	Take me to Mom's!
RAY	m	Listen, I just need you to hold it together  for me, okay?
RAY	m	When you start screaming like that,  you know, I can't really...
RAY	m	I know...
RAY	m	That's where we're going right now.
RACHEL	f	Come on, hurry up Dad...
RACHEL	f	Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks  on it)
RACHEL	f	(begins, and continues once in the house)
ROBBIE	m	(begins, and continues once in the house)
ROBBIE	m	They're gone.
RACHEL	f	Is she dead??
RAY	m	She's not dead. All right? She's just  no here. Okay? They're never here.
ROBBIE	m	How do you know?
RAY	m	Because they are on their way to Boston....
RAY	m	... and so they just kept on going,  they're probably up to your grandma's  house by now.
ROBBIE	m	(dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.
RACHEL	f	How come the lights are on here and  not at your place?
RAY	m	Umm.... Because nothing bad happened  here. Okay?
RAY	m	So, were safe here. All Right?
RAY	m	Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay,  you are safe in your area...
RACHEL	f	Dad. That's not how it goes.
RAY	m	Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get  you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get  something to eat.  (digs into the box)  What do we have here??
ROBBIE	m	.. Busy signals, one of the fast ones....  You think all the circuits are down?
RAY	m	(continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco,  Barbeque Sauce. This is really good  Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food.  What... What the hell is this?
ROBBIE	m	That's all that was in your kitchen.
RAY	m	Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right.
RAY	m	Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the  bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm....  We'll just get some sandwiches.
RAY	m	You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal?  Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie,  two for me, (he has one extra in his  hand) ...one for the house. (laughs)
RAY	m	Maybe after we get done eating, I will  take you down, teach you how to play  some poker. A little five card stud...  a little blackjack...
RACHEL	f	I'm allergic to peanut butter.
RAY	m	(laughs) Since when?
RACHEL	f	(with a snotty look) Birth!
RAY	m	Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two  pieces of bread) You can eat the bread.  Okay?
RACHEL	f	I'm not hungry.
RAY	m	Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to  be eating peanut butter sandwiches.  (to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?
ROBBIE	m	I'm not hungry either.
RAY	m	You're not hungry either? Well, that's  fine.
RAY	m	Everybody just relax, okay? Because  we are here now and we're safe, and  we're gonna stay.  And in the morning  your mom and Tim are going to be here  and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?  (no responses) Okay.
RACHEL	f	If everything's fine, why do we have  to sleep in the basement. We've got  perfectly good beds.
RAY	m	It's like a slumber party.
ROBBIE	m	What are you afraid is gonna happen  to us?
RAY	m	(walks over to the weight room corner  of the basement) Nice basement.
RACHEL	f	I want to sleep in my bed. I've got  back problems.
RAY	m	Okay. You know on the Weather Channel  when there's a tornado, and they tell  you to go to the basement for safety?  It's like that.
RACHEL	f	There's gonna be tornadoes?
RAY	m	Rachel, no more talking.
RACHEL	f	Could you be a little nicer to me. God!
ROBBIE	m	Wanna stay here?
RACHEL	f	Yeah. Good night, love you.
ROBBIE	m	Love you, Rache.
RACHEL	f	Is the lighting back?
RAY	m	No, this is something else...
ROBBIE	m	(screams) AHHHH... WHAT'S THAT SOUND?
RACHEL	f	Are we still alive?
RAY	m	Down here!
RAY	m	Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?
MAX	m	Hey, how you doing? Wanna help me open  this?
RAY	m	Are you a passenger?
NEWS REPORTER	m	He's deaf. The shell went off right  beside him. The camera on his shoulder  saved his life. (to Max) You hear that  Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid  life.
RAY	m	Where were you?
NEWS REPORTER	m	Out there in the pine barrens. We were  attached to a National Guard unit, the  83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of  those things around midnight. They've  got some kind of shield around them.  We can't see it, but everything we fire  at them detonates too early before we  can get close enough to cause any damage.  When they flash that thing, everything  lights up like Hiroshima.
RAY	m	There's more than one?
REPORTER	m	You gotta be kidding me right?
REPORTER	m	We were feeding New York but New York  went dark. So we patched over to D.C.,  they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink  to London. Even called the affiliates  to try and get them to catch the feed,  but nobody answered.
REPORTER	m	It's the same everywhere. Once the tripods  start to move, no more news comes out  of that area.
RAY	m	Oh, my god!
REPORTER	m	You ain't seen nothing yet.
RAY	m	I saw that storm. I was right in the  middle of one of those.
REPORTER	m	No, you didn't see it like this. Those  machines come up from under the ground,  right? That means they must have been  buried there a long time ago. So who's  driving the god damn things? (pointing  to the monitor) Watch the lightning.  Watch it..... Watch the lighting.....
RAY	m	What is that?
REPORTER	m	That is them. They come down in capsules,  riding the lighting into the ground  into the machines right?
DRIVER	m	You hear that? We're getting the hell  out of here.
DRIVER	m	Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!
REPORTER	m	Hey. Were you on that plane?
REPORTER	m	Oh, that's too bad, it would have been  a really great story.
RAY	m	Look at me. Look at me.
RAY	m	You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?
RAY	m	Don't look down, don't look around me.  I'm taking you to the car and you're  gonna want to look around. But you are  not going to, are you?
RAY	m	You're doing good. You're doing good.  Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right  to Boston, and we're gonna see your  mom.
RACHEL	f	I'm not gonna look, dad.
RAY	m	That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay,  listen, I want you to close your eyes.  Got them closed?
RACHEL	f	Um-Huh.
RAY	m	There you go. Keep em' closed for me.
RAY	m	Robbie, get in.
RACHEL	f	Why are you yelling?
RAY	m	(to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get  in!
ROBBIE	m	Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
RAY	m	Because I don't want everybody to see  we've got a working car. (going over  the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson  until we find an open bridge or ferry,  then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then  take the back roads across Connecticut  all the way to Boston.
RACHEL	f	Where is everybody?
RAY	m	I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding  in their basements.
ROBBIE	m	If we had any balls, we'd go back there  and find one of those things and kill  it.
RAY	m	Yeah, well, why don't you just let me  make the big decisions, okay?
ROBBIE	m	Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's  about your speed.
RACHEL	f	Okay, enough Robbie!
RAY	m	(angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray  shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want  Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird  to me but you decide.
RACHEL	f	Dad?!?!
RAY	m	Yes, Rachel.
RACHEL	f	I have to go to the bathroom.
RAY	m	Really?
ROBBIE	m	Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which  Ray has a hold of) I gotta go!
RAY	m	Not so fast, not so fast, all right?  Now, there are two things we have to  watch out for, and the second is people  who might want our car.
ROBBIE	m	There's nobody around!
RACHEL	f	I gotta go.
RAY	m	(displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's  good right there. (points to a spot  20' away)
RAY	m	All right, then just go where I can  see you!
RAY	m	I'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!
RAY	m	Listen. Every time you don't listen  to me, I'm telling your mother, okay?  I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm  making a list!
RAY	m	I told you to stay where I could see  you!
RACHEL	f	I'm sorry!
SOLDIER	m	Watch it, kid! YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSLELF
RAY	m	If I close my eyes, why don't you drive  for a bit.
ROBBIE	m	I don't have a license.
RAY	m	Since when has that stopped you?
ROBBIE	m	Ray. (no response) Ray. (no response)  Dad!
ROBBIE	m	You think you could.... You think you  could...
RAY	m	Don't stop... don't take your foot off...  Okay. I got it... I got it....
RACHEL	f	Where's everybody going?
RAY	m	I don't know Rach.
RACHEL	f	But we do right?
RAY	m	Yeah, we do.
RACHEL	f	Why'd he do that?
RACHEL	f	Why is he doing that?
RAY	m	He wants a ride. Everybody just wants  a ride.
RACHEL	f	Can we give him one?

ROBBIE	m	Hi Sheryl.
SHERYL	f	He's just like dad.
SHERYL	f	How you doing? You look like shit.
RACHEL	f	(to herself) The trees are funny.
HARBOR MASTER	m	We're gonna move some cars out of the  way to make more space. Give us a few  minutes.

HARLAND	m	Over here! OVER HERE!!!
HARLAND	m	Hurry!!
HARLAND	m	(to Rachel) You all right?
HARLAND	m	(to Ray) And what about you?
RAY	m	(while Harland moves the wheel barrel)  (to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable?  I need you to close your eyes now, okay?  You need some sleep.
RACHEL	f	Dad?
RAY	m	He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna  meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.
RACHEL	f	(about ready to cry) What do you think  mom's doing right this minute?
RAY	m	Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I  know she's not sleeping 'cause she is  so worried about you. (trying to comfort  her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen,  and she's making that awful tea that  she makes. And they're all just... ...  ...there all just counting the minutes  until they see you again.
RAY	m	(picking up the ribbon) What is this?  What... What is this?
RACHEL	f	I won.
RAY	m	You won?
RACHEL	f	The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.
RACHEL	f	Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"?
RAY	m	(shakes his head in displeasure because  he can't think of it) I don't remember  that one.
RACHEL	f	Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?
RAY	m	I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one  either.
RAY	m	(begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby.  So don't put me down. Because I've got  the fastest set of wheels in the town.  Something comes up to me that don't  even try....
RAY	m	(continues singing) ... If I had a set  of wings, man, I know she could fly.  She's my little deuce coupe. You don't  know what I've got... just my little  deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't  know what I've got....
HARLAND	m	Peach schnapps.
HARLAND	m	Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole  case of this shit.
RAY	m	Thank you.
HARLAND	m	I'm sorry about your son.
RAY	m	We got separated... he's gonna meet  us in umm... in Boston.
RAY	m	Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did  you loose anybody?
HARLAND	m	All of them.
HARLAND	m	(introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy.
RAY	m	(introduces himself) Ray Ferrier.
HARLAND	m	I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks.  You're welcome to stay, both of yous.
RAY	m	I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep.
HARLAND	m	(speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause)  Those machines, those tripods they got...  They buried them... right under our  feet. Since before there were even people  here. They've been planning this for  a million years. We're beat to shit.
RAY	m	Please, my daughter.
HARLAND	m	Think about it.    ...    They defeated  the greatest power in the world in a  couple days. Walked right over us.   they'll keep coming. This is not a war  any more than there's a war between  men and maggots. This is an extermination.
HARLAND	m	(feeling he's not grasping the reality)  Are you afraid?
RAY	m	Of course I am.
HARLAND	m	(going on) I been around death plenty.  Drive an ambulance in the city. Well,  drove and ambulance in the city. That's  all over now, huh?    ....   You know  the people who make it Ray? The ones  that don't flatline before the hospital?  It's the ones who keep their eyes open,  keep looking at you, keep thinking.  Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll  kill you.    ......     I'm dead set  on livin'.
HARLAND	m	Hah. Dead set on Living.
RAY	m	Thank you for taking us in.
HARLAND	m	We're not going to be exterminated.
HARLAND	m	(with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come  on, I wanna show you something!
HARLAND	m	We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta  have a weakness. Come on, take a look.
HARLAND	m	Somehow they killed a few of these things  in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling  me the Japanese can figure it out but  we can't?
HARLAND	m	We can do it. We can get 'em. We can  figure it out.
RAY	m	Stay right there!
RAY	m	I have a daughter! Why did you bring  us here?
HARLAND	m	To fight 'em together, Ray.   ....   underground. When the time is right,  we'll take 'em by supries, the way they  took us. We'll take 'em by surprise.
HARLAND	m	We're right under their feet, Ray. Right  here, under their feet.
HARLAND	m	You miss your mommy? I had a little  girl nearly your age. You know, if anything  happens to your daddy, I'll take care  of you.
RAY	m	Rachel!
RAY	m	(distinctly angry, but not yelling)  You don't have anything to say to her,  do you understand? If you want to talk  to somebody, or ask somebody a question,  you ask me!
HARLAND	m	(also angry at Ray) What exactly is  your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna  do. How about you? You gonna sit here,  wait for them to come get you? Is that  your plan?
HARLAND	m	Maybe you want to get caught. Couple  of days hiding in a basement too much  for you, I bet. You'll probably turn  yourself right in!
RAY	m	Listen. It stopped.
HARLAND	m	(paying no attention) Maybe you'll be  okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll  train you as their pet. You know, train  you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...
RAY	m	(yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!
RAY	m	(dead silent) Give me that!
HARLAND	m	You and I... I don't  think we are on  the same page.
HARLAND	m	(repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My  Blood!!!
RAY	m	Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it!  You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!
HARLAND	m	(with an insane expression and tone)  They drink us!
RAY	m	Please, they'll hear you!
HARLAND	m	Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!
RAY	m	You gotta be quiet!
HARLAND	m	Drink US and....
RAY	m	They're gonna come back down here!
HARLAND	m	Then they spit us out all over their  goddamn red weeds!
RAY	m	(no longer whispering) Do you understand  what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let  my daughter die because of you.
HARLAND	m	This tunnel will get us to the city.  We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready  Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!
RAY	m	Stop it!
HARLAND	m	You can hide a whole army down there!
RAY	m	Stop it!!
HARLAND	m	... We'll go underground!
HARLAND	m	Sneak attacks at night!
HARLAND	m	We're the resistance Ray! They can't  occupy this country! Occupations always  fail! History's taught us that a thousand  times. This is our land.
HARLAND	m	(continues) ... We eat it, we breathe  it, only we can live on it! They can't  survive here Ray. They weren't built  for it.
RACHEL	f	What are you doing?
RAY	m	Whatever you hear... don't take this  off.
RACHEL	f	Dad??
RAY	m	Rach?
RACHEL	f	Dad?
RAY	m	What was that song... that lullaby I  didn't know?
RACHEL	f	Hushabye Mountains
RAY	m	Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it.
RACHEL	f	(begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....
RAY	m	Don't stop.
RACHEL	f	... On Hushabye Mountain...
RAY	m	That's my girl.
RACHEL	f	... For far away my baby goes...
RACHEL	f	... it fills the sails ...
RACHEL	f	... of boats that are waiting ...
RACHEL	f	... Waiting to sail your worries away
RACHEL	f	... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye  Mountain ...
RACHEL	f	... Wave goodbye to the cares of the  day and watch your boat, from Hushabye  Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby  Bay.
RACHEL	f	(screams) AHHHH!!!
RAY	m	Rachel???
RAY	m	RACHEL!!!  (to himself) Oh, my god,  no!
RAY	m	Rachel? Rachel? (looks up the stairs)  Rachel??
RAY	m	(searching) Rachel, make some noise  baby. Rachel??
RAY	m	Rachel? Rachel? Talk to me baby, come  on!
RAY	m	Rachel?!? RACHEL?!?!?!
RAY	m	(screams) AHH!
RACHEL	f	(screams) AHHHHH!!!!
RAY	m	(screams in pain) AHHH!
RAY	m	(reaching Rachel) Rachel. (no response)  Rachel.
RAY	m	Rachel.
RACHEL	f	Dad?
SOLDIER 2	m	Pull me! Pull me!!!
SOLDIER 2	m	We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me!
RACHEL	f	What happened to it?
RAY	m	It's dying.
RAY	m	What happened?
SOLDIER 3	m	I don't know, something's happening  to them. Please keep moving.
RAY	m	Something's happening to them?
SOLDIER 4	m	Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir.
RAY	m	Excuse me, excuse me, what happened  here? You guys take it down?
SOLDIER 5	m	No sir, it was behaving erratically,  walking in circles then it went down  on it's own about an hour ago. (to people)  not stop! Keep moving!
RACHEL	f	How is it dead all by it's self?
RAY	m	Rachel, I'm not sure.
RAY	m	(to a soldier, during the robot noise)
RAY	m	(louder) LOOK AT THE GOD DAMN BIRDS!!!
SOLDIER 6	m	(motions and says) I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!
RAY	m	(pointing) NO SHIELDS!!!
SOLDIER 6	m	(now getting it) (to the soldiers) THE
RAY	m	(to the people in the tunnel and Rachel)  It's safer in here!
MARY ANN	f	(just barely hearable) Thank you.
RACHEL	f	Robbie?
ROBBIE	m	Hey dad!
NARRATOR	m	From the moment the invaders arrived,  breathed our air, ate and drank, they  were doomed. They were undone, destroyed,  after all of man's weapons and devices  had failed, by the tiniest creatures  that God and his wisdom, put upon this  earth. At the toll of a billion deaths,  man had earned his immunity, is right  to survive among this planet's infinite  organisms. And that right is ours against  all challenges, for men do not live  nor die in vein.
