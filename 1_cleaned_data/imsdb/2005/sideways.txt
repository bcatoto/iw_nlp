MILES	m	...the fuck...
MILES	m	Yeah?
WORKER	m	Hi, Miles. Can you move your car,  please?
MILES	m	Why?
WORKER	m	The painters got to put the truck  in, and you didn't park too good.
MILES	m	Yeah, hold on.
MILES	m	Fuck!
MILES	m	Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there  by noon, but there's been all this  work going on at my building, and  it's like a total nightmare, and I  had a bunch of stuff to deal with  this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm  out the door right this second. It's  going to be great. Yeah. Bye.
BARISTA	m	Hey, Miles.
MILES	m	Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please.
BARISTA	m	Rough night, huh? For here?
MILES	m	No, I'm running late. Make it to go.  And give me a New York Times and... ...a spinach croissant.
MRS. ERGANIAN	f	Look what the cat dragged!
MILES	m	Hi, everybody.
JACK	m	About time you got here, bud. Mr.  Prompt.
MR. ERGANIAN	m	We were thinking maybe you took the  wrong way and went to Tijuana and  they didn't let you back in.
MILES	m	I had to bribe them.
CHRISTINE	f	Hey, Miles.
MILES	m	Seriously though, the freeway was  unbelievable today. Unbelievable.  Bumper to bumper the whole way. People  getting an early start on the weekend,  I guess. Granted I got a late start,  but still.
MRS. ERGANIAN	f	Christine, why don't you ask Miles  about the cake?
CHRISTINE	f	Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to  the kitchen with me.
JACK	m	Don't bother him with that. We got  to get going.
CHRISTINE	f	It'll just take a second.
MRS. ERGANIAN	f	Jack tells us you are publishing a  book. Congratulations.
MR. ERGANIAN	m	Yes, congratulations.
MILES	m	Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized  yet, but, um, there has been some  interest and --
MRS. ERGANIAN	f	Your friend is modest.
JACK	m	Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest.  Indulge them. Don't make me out to  be a liar.
MR. ERGANIAN	m	What subject is your book? Non- fiction?
MILES	m	No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although  there's a lot from my own life, so I  guess technically some of it is non- fiction.
MR. ERGANIAN	m	Good, I like non-fiction. There is  so much to know about the world that  I think reading a story someone just  invented is kind of a waste of time.
CHRISTINE	f	So which one do you like better?
MILES	m	I like them both, but if pressed I'd  have to say I prefer the dark.
JACK	m	See?
JACK	m	Where the fuck were you, man? I was  dying in there. We were supposed to  be a hundred miles away by now.
MILES	m	I can't help the traffic.
JACK	m	Come on. You're fucking hungover.
MILES	m	Okay, there was a tasting last night.  But I wanted to get us some stuff  for the ride up. Check out the box.
MILES	m	Why did you tell them my book was  being published?
JACK	m	You said you had it all lined up.
MILES	m	No, I didn't. What I said was that  my agent had heard there was some  interest at Conundrum...
JACK	m	Yeah, Conundrum.
MILES	m	...and that one of the editors was  passing it up to a senior editor.  She was supposed to hear something  this week, but now it's next week,  and... It's always like this. It's  always a fucking waiting game. I've  been through it too many times  already.
JACK	m	I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds  like you're in to me.
MILES	m	It's a long shot, all right? And  Conundrum is just a small specialty  press anyway. I'm not getting my  hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's  it. I've stopped caring.
JACK	m	But I know it's going to happen this  time. I can feel it. This is the  one. I'm proud of you, man. You're  the smartest guy I know.
MILES	m	Don't open that now. It's warm.
JACK	m	Come on, we're celebrating. I say we  pop it.
MILES	m	That's a 1992 Byron. It's really  rare. Don't open it now. I've been  saving it!
MILES	m	For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just  wasted like half of it!
JACK	m	Shut up. Here's to a great week.
MILES	m	Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass  behavior, I'm really glad we're  finally getting this time together.
JACK	m	Yeah.
MILES	m	You know how long I've been begging  to take you on the wine tour. I was  beginning to think it was never going  to happen.
JACK	m	Oh, that's tasty.
MILES	m	100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard.  They don't even make it anymore.
JACK	m	Pinot Noir? How come it's white?  Doesn't noir mean dark?
MILES	m	Jesus. Don't ask questions like that  up in the wine country. They'll think  you're a moron.
JACK	m	Just tell me.
MILES	m	Color in the red wines comes from  the skins. This juice is free run,  so there's no skin contact in the  fermentation, ergo no color.
JACK	m	Sure is tasty.
MILES	m	Did you read the latest draft, by  the way?
JACK	m	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
MILES	m	And?
JACK	m	I liked it a lot. A lot of  improvements. It just seemed overall,  I don't know, tighter, more...  congealed or something.
MILES	m	How about the new ending? Did you  like that?
JACK	m	Oh yeah. Much better.
MILES	m	There is no new ending. Page 750 on  is exactly the same.
JACK	m	Well, then I guess it must have felt  new because everything leading up to  it was so different.
JACK	m	It's Christine. Hey you.
CHRISTINE	f	You guys having fun?
JACK	m	Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have  been a blast.
CHRISTINE	f	Good. That's good.
JACK	m	So what's up?
CHRISTINE	f	Just seeing how you're doing. And,  um, Mom and I were starting to look  over the seating charts again, and  we're wondering if you wanted Tony  Levin to sit next to the Feldmans,  or should he be at one of the singles  tables?
CHRISTINE	f	So what do you think? With the  Feldmans?
JACK	m	Yeah. The Feldmans.
CHRISTINE	f	Really? Because I don't know, I was  thinking that --
JACK	m	Well, then put him at the singles  table.
CHRISTINE	f	The problem with that is that then  there's one extra --
JACK	m	Then put him with the Feldmans.  Whatever you and your Mom decide is  fine with me.
CHRISTINE	f	Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to  include you in this decision. He's  your friend.
JACK	m	I didn't dismiss you. I told you  what I thought, but it didn't seem  to matter, so you decide. Besides,  this is supposed to be my time with  Miles. I hope you're not going to  call every five minutes.
CHRISTINE	f	I'm not going to call every five  minutes, but this is important.
JACK	m	Honey, I'm just saying you know I  need a little space before the  wedding. Isn't that the point of  this? Isn't that what we talked about  with Dr. Gertler?
CHRISTINE	f	Why are you being so defensive?
JACK	m	I don't know, Christine. Perhaps  it's because I feel attacked.
CHRISTINE	f	I ask you one simple question, and  suddenly I'm attacking you.
JACK	m	Listen. I'll call you when we get  there, and we can talk about it then,  okay?
CHRISTINE	f	Bye.
JACK	m	I love you.
CHRISTINE	f	Bye.
MILES	m	Tony Levin? Why did you fucking invite  Tony Levin?
JACK	m	Whoa, why are we getting off?
MILES	m	I've just got to make one quick stop.  Won't take a second.
JACK	m	What?
MILES	m	I thought we could just say a quick  hello to my mother.
JACK	m	Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were  supposed to be up there hours ago.
MILES	m	It's her birthday tomorrow. And I  don't feel right driving by her house  and not stopping in, okay? It'll  just take a second. She's right off  the freeway.
JACK	m	How old's she going to be?
MILES	m	Um... seventy... something.
JACK	m	That's a good age.
MILES	m	Wait a second.
MILES AND JACK	m	Surprise! Happy Birthday!
PHYLLIS	f	My God. Miles. And Jack! What a  surprise. I can't remember the last  time you brought me flowers.
JACK	m	They're from both of us.
PHYLLIS	f	A famous actor bringing me flowers  on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
MILES	m	A famous actor who's getting married  next week.
PHYLLIS	f	Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I  hope that girls knows how lucky she  is, marrying no less than Derek  Summersby.
JACK	m	Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven  years ago.
PHYLLIS	f	Well, you were wonderful on that  show. I never understood why they  had to give you that brain tumor so  soon. Why that didn't make you the  biggest movie star in the world is a  sin. It's a sin.
JACK	m	Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
PHYLLIS	f	If I was, I would sing your praises  up and down the street until they  put me in the loony bin. Now Miles,  why didn't you tell me you were coming  and bringing this handsome man? Look  how I'm dressed. I've got to run and  put my face on.
JACK	m	You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
PHYLLIS	f	Oh, stop it. Make yourselves  comfortable. You boys hungry?
MILES	m	Yeah, I'm hungry.
MILES	m	Just a snack. Calm down.
MILES	m	Let me show you something. The secret  to opening champagne is that once  the cork is released, you keep  pressure on it so you don't --
PHYLLIS	f	Ready for my close up!
PHYLLIS	f	Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you  bring that out onto the lanai? I  thought we could eat on the lanai.
JACK	m	Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious.  Absolutely delicious.
PHYLLIS	f	They're just leftovers.
JACK	m	Is it chicken?
PHYLLIS	f	I could have made something fancier  if a certain someone had let me know  that a certain someone was coming  for a visit with a certain special  friend. Could have made a pork roast.
MILES	m	It was a surprise, Mom.
PHYLLIS	f	And I could have already put clean  sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and  the twins are picking us up at 11:30  to go to brunch at the Sheraton.  They do a magnificent job there.  Wendy is so excited you're coming.
MILES	m	You talked to Wendy?
PHYLLIS	f	Just now. She's thrilled. And the  kids.
MILES	m	Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty  eager to get up to... you know, but,  uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
PHYLLIS	f	Well, you boys do what you want. I  just think it would be nice for us  to be together as a family on my  birthday.
MILES	m	Uh-huh. I'll be right back.
MILES	m	...six, seven, eight,... Nine.
PHYLLIS	f	And what was that other one you did,  the one where you're the jogger?
JACK	m	Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That  was for Spray and Wash.
PHYLLIS	f	Spray and Wash. That's the one.
JACK	m	Yeah, I remember the girl who was in  it with me. She was something.
PHYLLIS	f	I just remember you jogging. So when's  the wedding?
MILES	m	This Saturday, Mom, remember? We  told you.
JACK	m	And Miles is my best man, Mrs.  Raymond. My main man.
PHYLLIS	f	Miles, when are you going to get  married again?
MILES	m	I just got divorced. Phyllis.
JACK	m	Two years ago, buddy.
PHYLLIS	f	You should get back together with  Victoria. She was good for you.
PHYLLIS	f	She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent.  You knew her, right?
JACK	m	Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
PHYLLIS	f	I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you  need some money?
MILES	m	I'm fine.
MILES	m	Jack. Jack.
MILES	m	She'll wake up.
JACK	m	Fuck, man. Too early in the morning  for that, you know what I mean?
MILES	m	She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look  at that stuff anymore.
JACK	m	That's your problem, Miles.
MILES	m	As if she'd even be attracted to  guys like us in the first place.
JACK	m	Speak for yourself. I get chicks  looking at me all the time. All ages.
MILES	m	It's not worth it. You pay too big a  price. It's never free.
JACK	m	You need to get laid.
JACK	m	It'd be the best thing for you. You  know what? I'm going to get you laid  this week. That's going to be my  best man gift to you. I'm not going  to give you a pen knife or a gift  certificate or any of that other  horseshit.
MILES	m	I'd rather have a knife.
JACK	m	No. No. You've been officially  depressed for like two years now,  and you were always a negative guy  anyway, even in college. Now it's  worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching  English to fucking eighth-graders  when they should be reading what you  wrote. Your books.
MILES	m	I'm working on it.
JACK	m	You still seeing that shrink?
MILES	m	I went on Monday. But I spent most  of the time helping him with his  computer.
JACK	m	Well, I say fuck therapy and what's  that stuff you take, Xanax?
MILES	m	And Lexapro, yes.
JACK	m	Well, I say fuck that. You need to  get your joint worked on, that's  what you need.
MILES	m	Jack. This week is not about me.  It's about you. I'm going to show  you a good time. We're going to drink  a lot of good wine, play some golf,  eat some great food, enjoy the scenery  and send you off in style.
JACK	m	And get your bone smooched.
JACK	m	What?
MILES	m	You know what? Let's take the Santa  Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
JACK	m	Whatever's closest, man. I need a  glass.
MILES	m	These guys make top-notch Pinot and  Chardonnay. One of the best producers  in Santa Barbara county. Look how beautiful this view is.  What a day!
JACK	m	I thought you hated Chardonnay.
MILES	m	I like all varietals. I just don't  generally like the way they manipulate  Chardonnay in California -- too much  oak and secondary malolactic  fermentation.
MILES	m	Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous?  And the ocean's just right over that  ridge. See, the reason this region's  great for Pinot is that the cold air  off the Pacific flows in at night  through these transverse valleys and  cools down the berries. Pinot's a  very thin-skinned grape and doesn't  like heat or humidity.
JACK	m	Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel  sells.
MILES	m	Thanks, Jack. So do I. Here we are.
MILES	m	So what'd you guys finally decide on  for the menu?
JACK	m	I told you. Filet and salmon.
MILES	m	Yeah, but how are they making the  salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill  sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
JACK	m	I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always  have white wine with fish?
MILES	m	Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we  have to find out because it's going  to make a big difference.
JACK	m	Let me call Christine.
MILES	m	Doesn't have to be now. Let's go  taste.
JACK	m	I owe her a call anyway.
JACK	m	Hey, honey. So we're up here about  to taste some whites, and we need to  know how the caterers are going to  make the salmon.
JACK	m	No, I know, I didn't forget, but we  wound up at Miles's mom's house, and  it got really late, and it was hard  to call, so I'm calling you now. I  said I was sorry. Yes, I did. You heard me say I was sorry, right?
JACK	m	Miles heard me say I was sorry.
JACK	m	Give me a break, will you? I just  called to find out about the salmon --  for our wedding -- to be more  involved, like you said -- and all  you want to do is get into it about  last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm  sorry I didn't call. You're totally  right. I know, but I'm trying to  make this the best wedding I can  with the best wine we can find. Don't  I get any credit for that? Okay.  Look, I've got to go. I'm out here  in the parking lot, and Miles is  waiting for me...
JACK	m	Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
MILES	m	Now we're talking.
CHRIS	m	This is the condemned man?
MILES	m	Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack.
JACK	m	How you doing?
CHRIS	m	You guys want to start with the Vin  Gris?
JACK	m	Sounds good.
JACK	m	This is rose, right?
MILES	m	Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this  one is rather atypically made from  100% Pinot Noir.
JACK	m	Pinot noir? Not again! You know, not all Pinots are noir.
MILES	m	Let me show you.
MILES	m	First take your glass and examine  the wine against the light. You're  looking at color and clarity.
JACK	m	What color is it supposed to be?
MILES	m	Depends on the varietal. Just get a  sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery?  Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
JACK	m	Huh.
MILES	m	Now tip it. What you're doing here  is checking for color density as it  thins toward the rim. Tells you how  old it is, among other things, usually  more important with reds. This is a  very young wine, so it's going to  retain its color pretty solidly. Now  stick your nose in it.
MILES	m	Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.
MILES	m	What do you smell?
JACK	m	I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
MILES	m	There's not much there yet, but you  can still find... ...a little citrus... maybe some  strawberry... passion fruit... and  there's even a hint of like  asparagus... or like a nutty Edam  cheese.
JACK	m	Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah,  strawberry. I'm not so sure about  the cheese.
MILES	m	Now set your glass down and get some  air into it.
MILES	m	Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks  the aroma and the flavors. Very  important. Now we smell again.
MILES	m	That's what you do with every one.
JACK	m	When do we get to drink it?
MILES	m	Now.
JACK	m	How would you rate this one?
MILES	m	Usually they start you on the wines  with learning disabilities, but this  one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris?
CHRIS	m	Released it about two months ago.
MILES	m	Nice job.
CHRIS	m	We like it.
JACK	m	You know, you could work in a wine  store.
MILES	m	Yeah, that would be a good move.
MILES	m	Are you chewing gum?
JACK	m	Want some?
MILES	m	Hey Jack, hurry up!
JACK	m	Just a minute!
JACK	m	I thought you said it was close. Now  I'm all pitted out.
MILES	m	It's not even a mile.
JACK	m	We should have driven.
MILES	m	Not with the wine list these people  have. We don't want to hold back.
JACK	m	You think I'm making a mistake  marrying Christine?
MILES	m	Whoa.
JACK	m	Come on, do you think I'm doing the  right thing? Tell the truth. You've  been through it.
MILES	m	Well, you waited for good reason,  and you proposed to Christine for  some good reason. So I think it's  great. It's time. You've got to have  your eyes open, that's all. I mean,  look at me. I thought Victoria and I  were set for life.
JACK	m	Christine's dad -- he's been talking  about bringing me into his property  business. Showing me the ropes. And  that's something, considering how  long it took him to get over I'm not  Armenian. So I'm thinking about it.  But I don't know, might get a little  incestuous. But Mike does pretty  well. A lot of high-end commercial  stuff.
MILES	m	So you're going to stop acting?
JACK	m	No way. This would just provide some  stability is what I'm saying. I can  always squeeze in an audition or a  commercial here and there, you know,  keep myself in the game in case  something big comes along.
MILES	m	Uh-huh.
JACK	m	We're not getting any younger, right?  And my career, well, it's gotten  pretty, you know, frustrating. Even  with my new manager. Maybe it's time  to settle down.
MILES	m	If that's what feels right.
JACK	m	It does. Feels right.
MILES	m	Then it's a good thing.
JACK	m	Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
GARY	m	Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
MILES	m	Gary.
GARY	m	When's that novel of yours coming  out?  We  all want to read it.
MILES	m	Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy  Jack. He's getting married next week.
GARY	m	My condolences.
MILES	m	What are you pouring tonight?
GARY	m	Lot of good stuff. Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
MILES	m	Absolutement. They have their own label that's  just outstanding.
GARY	m	What do you think?
MILES	m	Tight as a nun's asshole but qood  concentration. Nice fruit.
JACK	m	Yeah. Tight.
MILES	m	Pour us a couple.
JACK	m	Here's to my last week of freedom.
MILES	m	It's going to be great. Here's to  us.
JACK	m	Miles. Check it out.
MILES	m	Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
JACK	m	You know her?
MILES	m	Sure I know Maya.
JACK	m	You know that chick?
MILES	m	Jack, this is where I eat when I  come up here. It's practically my  office. And sometimes I have a drink  with the employees. Maya's great.  She's worked here about a year, maybe  a year and a half.
JACK	m	She is very hot.
MILES	m	And very nice. And very married.  Check out the rock.
JACK	m	Doesn't mean shit. When Christine  was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she  wore a big engagement ring to keep  guys from hitting on her. Think it  worked? Fuck no. How do you think I  met her?
MILES	m	This gal's married to I think a  Philosophy professor at UC Santa  Barbara.
JACK	m	So what's a professor's wife doing  waitressing? Obviously that's over.
MILES	m	You don't know anything about this  woman. Calm down. Let's just eat,  okay? The duck is excellent and pairs nicely  with the Highliner Pinot.
MAYA	f	Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
MILES	m	Maya, how are you?
MAYA	f	I'm doing good, good. You look great.  Did you lose some weight?
MILES	m	Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
MAYA	f	Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been  out tasting today?
MILES	m	You know it. This is my friend Jack.  Jack, Maya.
JACK	m	Hiya.
MAYA	f	Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here.  Bye, Miles.
JACK	m	Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes  you. What else do you know about  her?
MILES	m	Well, she does know a lot about wine.
JACK	m	Ooooooohh. Now we're getting  somewhere.
MILES	m	And she likes Pinot.
JACK	m	Perfect.
MILES	m	Jack, she's a fucking waitress in  Buellton. How would that ever work?
JACK	m	Why do you always focus on the  negative? Didn't you see how friendly  she was to you?
MILES	m	She works for tips!
JACK	m	You're blind, dude. Blind.
MILES	m	I also recommend the ostrich. Very  lean. Locally raised.
MILES	m	I hate Tony Levin.
MAYA	f	Highliner, please.
JACK	m	That's on us.
MAYA	f	Hey, guys.
MILES	m	You want to join us?
MAYA	f	Sure.
MAYA	f	So how's that book of yours going,  Miles? I think you were almost done  with it last time we talked.
MILES	m	I finished it.
MAYA	f	Good for you.
JACK	m	It's getting published. That's what  we're up here celebrating.
MAYA	f	That's fantastic. Congratulations.
MAYA	f	Are you a writer too?
JACK	m	No, I'm an actor.
MAYA	f	Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
JACK	m	A lot of TV. I was a regular on a  couple of series. And lately I've  been doing a lot of commercials.  National mostly.
MAYA	f	Anything I'd know?
JACK	m	Maybe. Recognize this?
JACK	m	"Now with low, low 5.8% APR  financing."
MAYA	f	That's hilarious. You sound just  like one of those guys.
JACK	m	I am one of those guys.
MAYA	f	You are not.
MILES	m	He is.
JACK	m	Consult your doctor before using  this product. Side effects may include  oily discharge, dizziness, hives,  loss of appetite, difficulty breathing  and low blood pressure. If you have  diabetes or a history of kidney  trouble... you're fucked!
MAYA	f	Oh. I needed that. Thank you.
MAYA	f	So what are you guys up to tonight?
MILES	m	We're pretty wiped. Probably go back  to the hotel and crash.
MAYA	f	Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a  long drive up here. Where're you  staying?
MILES	m	The Windmill.
JACK	m	Windmill.
MAYA	f	Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
MILES	m	See you.
JACK	m	We'll catch up with you later, okay?
JACK	m	We'll probably go back to the hotel  and crash?
JACK	m	The girl is looking to party, and  you tell her we're going to go back  to our motel room and crash? Jesus,  Miles!
MILES	m	Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
JACK	m	The chick digs you. She lit up like  a pinball machine when she heard  your novel was getting published.
MILES	m	Now I've got another lie to live  down. Thanks, Jack.
JACK	m	I'm trying to get you some action,  but you've got to help me out just a  little bit.
MILES	m	Didn't seem to me like that's what  was going on. You were all over her.
JACK	m	Somebody had to do the talking. And  by the way, I was right. She's not  married.
MILES	m	How do you know?
JACK	m	No rock. When she came to the bar,  sans rock.
JACK	m	Single. Waitress. Getting off work.  Looking for love. A little slap and  tickle.
MILES	m	Shut up.
JACK	m	She probably went home, lit some  candles, put on some relaxing music,  took a nice hot bath, and laid down  on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
MILES	m	Have you no shame?
JACK	m	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
MILES	m	Fuck you.
MILES	m	Shut the fuck up!
JACK	m	You need to get your prostate checked.
MILES	m	So what're we going to have? Pigs in  a blanket? The "rancher's special  breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease  and fat with a side of lard?
JACK	m	So what's the plan today?
MILES	m	We head north, begin the grape tour  up there, make our way south so the  more we drink the closer we get to  the motel.
MILES	m	What's your problem?
MILES	m	What is it?
JACK	m	I am going to get my nut on this  trip, Miles. And you are not going  to fuck it up for me with all your  depression and anxiety and neg-head  downer shit.
MILES	m	Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
JACK	m	Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do  not fuck with me. I am going to get  laid before I settle down on Saturday.  Do you read me?
MILES	m	Sure, big guy. Whatever you say.  It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in  the way and dragging you down. Maybe  you'd have a better time on your  own. You take the car. I'll catch  the train back.
JACK	m	No, see, I want both of us to get  crazy. We should both be cutting  loose. I mean, this is our last  chance. This is our week! It should  be something we share.
WAITRESS	?	Can I take your order?
JACK	m	But I am warning you.
MILES	m	Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye  toast. Dry.
WAITRESS	?	Okay. And you?
JACK	m	Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup.
MILES	m	How much skin and stem contact?
POURER	?	About four weeks.
MILES	m	Huh. That explains all the tannins.  And how long in oak?
POURER	?	About a year.
MILES	m	French or American?
POURER	?	Both.
MILES	m	Good stuff.
JACK	m	Yeah, oak. That's a good wood.
MILES	m	Nice, huh?
JACK	m	Beautiful.
MILES	m	Victoria and I used to like this  view. Once we had a picnic here and drank  a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon  and artichokes, but we didn't care.
JACK	m	Miles.
MILES	m	She has the best palate of any woman  I've ever known. She could even  differentiate Italian wines.
JACK	m	Miles, I gotta tell you something.  Victoria's coming to the wedding.
MILES	m	I know. You told me. I'm okay with  it.
JACK	m	Yeah, but that's not the whole story.  She got remarried.
MILES	m	She what? When?
JACK	m	About a month ago. Six weeks.
MILES	m	To that guy? That guy with the  restaurant...
JACK	m	Miles... MILES...
JACK	m	Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
MILES	m	I want to go home now.
JACK	m	You've been divorced for two years  already. People move on. She has!  It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes  you feel special or something.
MILES	m	Is she bringing him to the wedding?
JACK	m	What do you think?
MILES	m	You drop this bombshell on me. Why  didn't you tell me before?
JACK	m	Because I knew you'd freak out and  probably get so depressed you wouldn't  even come on this trip. But then I  figured here would be the best place  to tell you. We're here to forget  about all that shit. We're here to  party!
MILES	m	I'm going to be a fucking pariah.  Everyone's just going to be holding  their breath to see if I'm going to  get drunk and make a scene. Plus  Tony fucking Levin?
JACK	m	No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to  Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's  cool.
MILES	m	You've all been talking about it?  Behind my back? Talking about it?
JACK	m	Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't!
JACK	m	Miles?
JACK	m	You going to be okay?
STEPHANIE	f	Hey, guys. How's it going?
JACK	m	Excellent. My friend and I are up  here doing the wine tour, and he  tells me that you folks make one  hell of a Syrah.
STEPHANIE	f	That's what people say.
MILES	m	You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he  didn't know Pinot Noir from film  noir.
JACK	m	I'm a quick learner.
MILES	m	I'm trying to teach my friend here  some basics about wine over the next  few days before he goes off and --
JACK	m	That's right -- I'm here to learn. I  never had that much interest in wine  before, but this trip has been very  enlightening. Always like wine, of  course, but I don't know. More of a  beer man, really. Microbreweries.
STEPHANIE	f	Well, no better way to learn than  tasting.
JACK	m	Now there's a girl who knows how to  pour. What's your name?
STEPHANIE	f	Stephanie.
JACK	m	Nice.
STEPHANIE	f	So what do you think?
MILES	m	Quaffable but far from transcendent.
JACK	m	I like it. Tastes great. Oaky.
STEPHANIE	f	Cabernet Franc. This is only the fifth year we've  made this varietal. Very few wineries  around here do a straight Cabernet  Franc. It's from our vineyard up in  Santa Maria. And it was a Silver  Medal winner at Paso Robles last  year.
MILES	m	Well, I've come to never expect  greatness from a Cab Franc, and this  one's no exception. Sort of a flabby,  overripe --
JACK	m	Tastes good to me. You live around  here, Stephanie?
STEPHANIE	f	In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
JACK	m	Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton.  Windmill Inn.
STEPHANIE	f	Oh yeah.
JACK	m	You know a gal named Maya? Works at  the Hitching Post?
STEPHANIE	f	Sure I know Maya. Real well.
JACK	m	No shit. We just had a drink with  her last night. Miles knows her.
MILES	m	Could we move on to the Syrah, please?
STEPHANIE	f	This is our Estate Syrah...
JACK	m	You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
STEPHANIE	f	I know. I might need to be spanked.
STEPHANIE	f	Excuse me.
JACK	m	A bad girl, Miles. She might need to  be spanked.
MILES	m	Do you know how often these pourers  get hit on?
JACK	m	Get the trunk.
MILES	m	You have the keys.
JACK	m	We're on.
MILES	m	What?
JACK	m	She called Maya, who's not working  tonight, so we're all going out.
MILES	m	With Maya?
JACK	m	Been divorced for a year now, bud.
JACK	m	Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it  all going on.
MILES	m	Well, she is cute.
JACK	m	Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And  you almost tell her I'm getting  married. What's the matter with you? Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
JACK	m	You know how often these pourers get  hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood  flowing. Want to come?
MILES	m	Nah. I want to watch this.
JACK	m	Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up.
JACK	m	Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi -- goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts  up here. Whole place is wide open.  Assylvania.
MILES	m	So what should I wear?
JACK	m	I don't know. Casual but nice. They  think you're a writer.
JACK	m	Don't you have any other shoes?
JACK	m	Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking  in. Not much. We're about to go out  for dinner, probably be out pretty  late, so I thought I'd say goodnight  now. I know, I love you too. I miss  you.
JACK	m	Please just try to be your normal  humorous self, okay? Like who you  were before the tailspin. Do you  remember that guy? People love that  guy. And don't forget -- your novel  is coming out in the fall.
MILES	m	Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it  called?
JACK	m	Do not sabotage me. If you want to  be a lightweight, that's your call.  But do not sabotage me.
MILES	m	Aye-aye, captain.
JACK	m	And if they want to drink Merlot,  we're drinking Merlot.
MILES	m	If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving.  I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
JACK	m	Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No  Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
JACK	m	And don't drink too much. I don't  want you going to the dark side or  passing out. Do you hear me? No going  to the dark side.
MILES	m	Okay! Fuck!
JACK	m	We're going in.
JACK	m	How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
STEPHANIE	f	Good. How're you?
JACK	m	Great. You look great. You both do.
STEPHANIE	f	Not so bad yourself.
MILES	m	What are you drinking?
MAYA	f	A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
MILES	m	Oh yeah? How is it?
MAYA	f	Try it.
MILES	m	Nice. Very nice.
MAYA	f	Twelve months in oak.
MILES	m	On a Sauvignon Blanc?
MAYA	f	I know the winemaker. She comes in  the restaurant all the time.
MILES	m	This is good. Little hints of clove.
MAYA	f	I know. I love that.
WAITER	m	...medallions of pork with a dusting  of black truffles served with a root  vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped  potatoes. And finally a Copper River  salmon grilled on an alder wood plank.  And that comes with roasted new  potatoes and steamed watercress.
WAITER	m	And who gets the wine list?
MAYA	f	I guess Miles wants it.
MILES	m	Nope. You ladies choose.
MAYA	f	You choose, Stephanie.
STEPHANIE	f	So what does everyone feel like?
JACK	m	Whatever you girls want. It's on us  tonight. Sky's the limit.
MAYA	f	No, we're paying for the wine.
JACK	m	I don't think so. We're celebrating  Miles's book deal.
MAYA	f	Well, in that case...
STEPHANIE	f	What's everyone ordering? Then we  can sort out the wine.
MILES	m	Exactement!
MAYA	f	I'm having the salmon.
MILES	m	That's what I'm having.
STEPHANIE	f	I'm thinking about the duck breast.
JACK	m	Me too.
MAYA	f	Well, that narrows things down.
STEPHANIE	f	Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.
JACK	m	Pinot!
VICTORIA	f	Hello?
MILES	m	Victoria.
VICTORIA	f	Miles?
MILES	m	Victoria! How the hell are you?
VICTORIA	f	Fine. What's, uh, what's on your  mind?
MILES	m	Heard you got remarried!  Congratulations. Didn't think you  had the stomach for another go-round.
VICTORIA	f	Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
MILES	m	Just some local Pinot, you know,  then a little Burgundy. That old  Cotes de Beaune!
VICTORIA	f	Where are you?
MILES	m	A little place in Los Olivos. New  owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent  food too -- you should try it. Thought  of you at the Hitching Post last  night.
MILES	m	Hello?
VICTORIA	f	Miles, don't call me when you're  drunk.
MILES	m	I just wanted you to know I've decided  not to go to the wedding, so in case  you were dreading some uncomfortable,  you know, run-in or something, well,  worry no more. You won't see me there.  My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
VICTORIA	f	Ken.
MILES	m	Ken.
VICTORIA	f	Miles, I don't care if you come to  the wedding or not.
MILES	m	Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you  guys have fun.
VICTORIA	f	I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
MILES	m	You see, Vicki, I just heard about  this today, you getting married that  is, and I was kind of taken aback.  Kind of hard to believe.
MILES	m	I guess I just thought there was  still some hope for us somewhere  down the road and I just, I just --
VICTORIA	f	Miles, maybe it is better if you  don't come to the wedding.
MILES	m	Whatever you say, Vicki. You're the  boss.
JACK	m	Easy, boy. Easy.
MAYA	f	Are you all right?
MILES	m	Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood.
STEPHANIE	f	Excuse us.
MAYA	f	Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.
MILES	m	That's okay.
JACK	m	What the fuck, man? What is up?
JACK	m	Pull yourself together, man.
MILES	m	I'm fine!
JACK	m	Where were you?
MILES	m	Bathroom.
JACK	m	Did you drink and dial?
JACK	m	Why do you always do this? Victoria's  gone, man. Gone. Poof.
JACK	m	Stop it. You are blowing a great  opportunity here, Miles. Fucking  Maya, man. She's great. She's cool.  She's funny. She knows wine. What is  this morose come-down bullshit? These  girls want to party. And what was  that fucking ten-minute lecture on,  what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come  on!
MILES	m	Let's just say I'm uncomfortable  with the whole scenario.
JACK	m	Oh Jesus, Miles.
JACK	m	And don't forget all the bad times  you had with Victoria. How small she  make you feel. That's why you had  the affair in the first place.
MILES	m	Shut up. Shut your face.
JACK	m	Don't you see how Maya's looking at  you? You got her on the hook. Reel  her in! Come on, let's rachet this  up a notch. You know how to to do  it. Here. Drink some agua.
MILES	m	Should we get dessert?
STEPHANIE	f	We were thinking. Why don't we go  back to my place? I've got wine,  some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
JACK	m	Excellent idea. Waiter!
JACK	m	Let me see that.
JACK	m	Here. One for you, three for me.
MILES	m	You sure you want to do this?
JACK	m	We're here!
STEPHANIE	f	What happened to you guys?
JACK	m	Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here.
JACK	m	Hi.
STEPHANIE	f	Hi. Maya's in the kitchen.
MILES	m	Hi.
MAYA	f	Hey.
MILES	m	She got anything good?
MAYA	f	Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots  and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open  anything? Anything we want?
STEPHANIE	f	Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
MILES	m	She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I  have completely underestimated  Stephanie.
MAYA	f	Who do you think you're dealing with  here?
MAYA	f	How about this?
MAYA	f	Nope. I don't think we know each  other well enough. I'd say this guy's more our speed.
MAYA	f	So what gems do you have in your  collection?
MILES	m	Not much of a collection really. I  haven't had the wallet for that, so  I sort of live bottle to bottle. But  I've got a couple things I'm saving.  I guess the star would be a 1961  Cheval Blanc.
MAYA	f	You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's  just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up...
MAYA	f	Seriously, the '61s are peaking,  aren't they? At least that's what  I've read.
MILES	m	Yeah, I know.
MAYA	f	It might be too late already. What  are you waiting for?
MILES	m	I don't know. Special occasion. With  the right person. It was supposed to  be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
MAYA	f	The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc,  that's the special occasion.
MILES	m	How long have you been into wine?
MAYA	f	I started to get serious about seven  years ago.
MILES	m	What was the bottle that did it?
MAYA	f	Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
MILES	m	Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but  this is tasty. Really good. How about  you?
MAYA	f	I think they overdid it a bit. Too  much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
MILES	m	Yeah, I'd say you're right on the  money.
MILES	m	Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is  cute.
MAYA	f	Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
MILES	m	Is she sleeping or...?
MAYA	f	She's with her grandmother. She's  with Steph's mom. She spends a lot  of time over there. Steph's... well,  she's Stephanie.
JACK	m	"And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."
MAYA	f	You got kids?
MILES	m	Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up.  That was the one unpolluted part of  my divorce -- no kids.
MAYA	f	Yeah, same here.
MAYA	f	Let's go in there.
MAYA	f	Looks like our friends are hitting  it off.
MAYA	f	It's kind of weird sitting here with  you in Stephanie's house. All those  times you came into the restaurant.  It's like you're a real person now.  Almost.
MILES	m	Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird.  Out of context.
MAYA	f	Yeah, weird. But great.
MILES	m	Yeah. Definitely.
MAYA	f	So what's your novel about?
MILES	m	Well, it's a little difficult to  summarize. It begins as a first-person  account of a guy taking care of his  father after a stroke. Kind of based  on personal experience, but only  loosely.
MAYA	f	What's the title?
MILES	m	"The Day After Yesterday."
MAYA	f	Oh. You mean... today?
MILES	m	Um... yeah but it's more...
MAYA	f	So is it kind of about death and  mortality, or...?
MILES	m	Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It  shifts around a lot. Like you also  start to see everything from the  point of view of the father. And  some other stuff happens, some  parallel narrative, and then it  evolves -- or devolves -- into a  kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery --  you know, with no real resolution.
MAYA	f	Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing  you're getting it published. Really.  I know how hard it is. Just to write  it even.
MILES	m	Yeah. Thanks.
MAYA	f	Like me, I have this stupid paper  due on Friday, and as usual I'm  freaked out about it. Just like in  high school. It never changes.
MILES	m	A paper?
MAYA	f	Yeah. I'm working on a masters in  horticulture. Chipping away at it.
MILES	m	Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know  there was a college here.
MAYA	f	I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a  week.
MILES	m	So... you want to work for a winery  or something someday?
MAYA	f	Well...
MILES	m	I do have a copy of the manuscript  in the car. It's not fully proofed,  but if you're okay with a few typos...
MAYA	f	Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of  typos. Wow, this is really starting to open  up. What do you think?
MILES	m	My palate's kind of shot, but from  what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty  damn good.
MAYA	f	Can I ask you a personal question?
MILES	m	Sure.
MAYA	f	Why are you so into Pinot? It's like  a thing with you.
MILES	m	I don't know. It's a hard grape to  grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned,  temperamental, ripens early. It's  not a survivor like Cabernet that  can grow anywhere and thrive even  when neglected. Pinot needs constant  care and attention and in fact can  only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world. And only  the most patient and nurturing growers  can do it really, can tap into Pinot's  most fragile, delicate qualities.  Only when someone has taken the time  to truly understand its potential  can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest  expression. And when that happens,  its flavors are the most haunting  and brilliant and subtle and thrilling  and ancient on the planet.
MILES	m	I mean, Cabernets can be powerful  and exalting, but they seem prosaic  to me for some reason. By comparison.  How about you?
MAYA	f	What about me?
MILES	m	I don't know. Why are you into wine?
MAYA	f	I suppose I got really into wine  originally through my ex-husband. He  had a big, kind of show-off cellar.  But then I found out that I have a  really sharp palate, and the more I  drank, the more I liked what it made  me think about.
MILES	m	Yeah? Like what?
MAYA	f	Like what a fraud he was.
MAYA	f	No, but I do like to think about the  life of wine, how it's a living thing.  I like to think about what was going  on the year the grapes were growing,  how the sun was shining that summer  or if it rained... what the weather  was like. I think about all those  people who tended and picked the  grapes, and if it's an old wine, how  many of them must be dead by now. I  love how wine continues to evolve,  how every time I open a bottle it's  going to taste different than if I  had opened it on any other day.  Because a bottle of wine is actually  alive -- it's constantly evolving  and gaining complexity. That is,  until it peaks -- like your '61 --  and begins its steady, inevitable  decline. And it tastes so fucking  good.
MILES	m	Bathroom over there?
MAYA	f	Yeah.
MILES	m	You are such a loser. Come on!
MAYA	f	I was just getting some water. You  want some water?
MAYA	f	Nice.
MAYA	f	I should probably get going.
MAYA	f	You know how to get back to the  Windmill, right?
MILES	m	Got it.
MAYA	f	I had a good time tonight, Miles. I  really did.
MILES	m	Good. So did I.
MAYA	f	Okay. See you around.
MILES	m	Um... did you still want to read my  novel?
MAYA	f	Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
MAYA	f	Wow. Great.
MILES	m	Hope you like it. Feel free to stop  reading at any time. I'll take no  offense.
MAYA	f	Goodnight, Miles.
JACK	m	Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be- lieve-able!
JACK	m	Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty  nasty nasty.
MILES	m	Well, I'm glad you got it out of  your system. Congratulations. Mission  accomplished.
MILES	m	You didn't invite Stephanie to come  with us, did you?
JACK	m	Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's  off today, so she and I are going on  a hike.
MILES	m	We were supposed to play golf.
JACK	m	You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're  brand new -- gift from Christine's  dad. It's on me. Oh, say, by the way,  Stephanie and me were thinking we'd  all go to the Hitching Post tonight  and sit at one of Maya's tables, and  she'll bring us some great wines and  then we can all --
MILES	m	Count me out.
JACK	m	Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last  night, huh? That's a shocker. You  mean getting drunk and calling  Victoria didn't put you in the mood?  You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's  getting real old real fast, dude.
JACK	m	Later.
MILES	m	Yeah, well, maybe you should check  your messages first.
JACK	m	Oh, boy.
MILES	m	She's been leaving messages here  too.
JACK	m	Yeah. Okay.
MILES	m	You should call her.
JACK	m	I will. See ya!
MILES	m	Right now.
JACK	m	Okay! Jesus!
JACK	m	I've got no problem calling her.
JACK	m	Wait outside, will you?
STEPHANIE	f	That was fun last night.
MILES	m	Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a  wine collection. Very impressive.
STEPHANIE	f	Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this  morning. She said she had a good  time too. You should call her.
STEPHANIE	f	Where's Jack?
MILES	m	He had to make a phone call.
STEPHANIE	f	So what are you up to today, Miles?
MILES	m	Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't  know. Jack and I were supposed to go  golfing.
STEPHANIE	f	Huh.
MILES	m	Yeah, I reserved the tee time about  a month ago.
STEPHANIE	f	Oops. Sorry.
MILES	m	You golf?
STEPHANIE	f	Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid  game. I mean, at least, I could never  get into it. I tried it once.
MILES	m	Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about  it.
JACK	m	Hey Miles. Miles.
JACK	m	Do you have that other condom?
MILES	m	What'd Christine say?
JACK	m	Lucked out -- got voice mail.  Everything's cool.
SYNTHESIZED VOICE	m	No new messages.
JACK	m	Not now! Not now!
JACK	m	Hey, there you are.
MILES	m	Yep.
JACK	m	What're you drinking?
JACK	m	Any good?
JACK	m	Could I get a glass please? Stephanie took me out into the Pinot  fields today. It was awesome. I think  I finally got a handle on the whole  process, from the soil to the vine  to the -- what do you call it? --  selection and harvest. And the whole,  you know, big containers where they  mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes  right off the vine. Still a little sour but already  showing potential for great structure.  Stephanie really knows her shit,  Miles.
MILES	m	Where is Stephanie?
JACK	m	Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
MILES	m	What the fuck are you doing?
JACK	m	What?
MILES	m	With this chick.
MILES	m	Does she know about Saturday?
JACK	m	Um... not exactly. But I've been  honest. I haven't told her I'm  available. And she knows this trip  up here is only for a few days.  Besides...
MILES	m	Besides what?
JACK	m	Well... I don't know, just... the  wedding.
MILES	m	What?
JACK	m	Well, I've been doing some thinking.
MILES	m	Oh, you've been thinking. And?
JACK	m	I may have to put the wedding on  hold is all.
JACK	m	I fully realize that making a change  like that might be tricky for certain  people to accept at first, but life  is short, Miles. I've got to be sure  I'm doing the right thing before  taking such a big step. And not just  for my sake. I'm thinking about  Christine's feelings too. I take  marriage very seriously -- always  have. That's why I've never done it  before. The day I get married, it's  going to be the real thing.
JACK	m	Being with Stephanie has opened my  eyes. She's not uptight or  controlling. She's just cool. Things  are so easy with her. Smells  different. Tastes different. Fucks  different. Fucks like an animal. I'm  telling you, I went deep last night,  Miles. Deep.
MILES	m	Deep.
JACK	m	Don't get all judgmental on me. This  is my deal. It's my life, and it's  my call.
JACK	m	I was hoping to get some understanding  from you. And I'm not getting it.
MILES	m	Understanding of what?
JACK	m	Like I might be in love with another  woman.
MILES	m	In love? Twenty-four hours with some  wine-pourer chick and you think you're  in love? And give up everything?
JACK	m	Look who's talking. You've been there.
MILES	m	Yes I have, and do I look like a  happy man? Was all that drama with  Brenda a happy thing for me to do?  Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my  life now?
JACK	m	This is totally different. I'm talking  about avoiding what you're talking  about. That's the distinction. I  have not made the commitment yet. I  am not married. I have not said the  words. In a few days, I might get  married, and if I do, then I won't  be doing stuff like this anymore.  Otherwise, what's the whole point of  getting married?
MILES	m	And what about Stephanie? She's a  woman -- with a kid. A single mom.  What do you think she's looking for?  Huh?
JACK	m	Here's what I'm thinking. We move up  here, you and me, buy a vineyard.  You design your own wine; I'll handle  the business side. Then you get  inspired and write a new novel. As  for me, if an audition comes along,  hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
MILES	m	You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
JACK	m	What do you care anyway? You don't  even like Christine.
MILES	m	What? Of course I like Christine.
JACK	m	You said she was shallow. Yeah, and  a nouveau riche.
MILES	m	That was three years ago after that  first party!
JACK	m	Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an  actor. All I have is my instinct. My intuition -- that's all I have.  And you're asking me to go against  it. And that's just wrong.
STEPHANIE	f	Hi, guys. We should probably get  going.
MILES	m	Where?
CARYL	f	Stephanie's heard this a thousand  times, but if I'd done what I wanted  and I'd bought up in Santa Maria  when I had the chance, I would have  made a fortune when they put in that  outlet center and that Home Depot. Your father knew it too, but he was  a fucking chickenshit. Always was.
JACK	m	Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph  and Siena get home safe, and then  maybe we'll hook up with you later,  okay?
MILES	m	Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a  movie.
STEPHANIE	f	See you, Miles. You take care.
MILES	m	Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
SIENA AND CARYL	f	Bye, Miles.
JACK	m	Call me on my cell if you go out.
MILES	m	Yeah.
MILES	m	And could I get a Barely Leqal?
MILES	m	NO, um, the new one.
GARY	m	How's it hanging, Miles?
MILES	m	You know me. I love it up here. How  about you?
GARY	m	Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a  busload of retired folks in on a  wine tour. Usually they're not too  rowdy, but tonight there was something  going on. Full moon or something.  What can I get you?
MILES	m	Highliner.
GARY	m	Glass or bottle?
MILES	m	Bottle.
GARY	m	You got it.
MILES	m	Say, is Maya working?
GARY	m	Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's  off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
MILES	m	Oh, that's tasty.
GARY	m	You okay, Miles?
MILES	m	I'm good.
JACK	m	Come on, dude. Let's go golfing! I  got us in at Alisal.
MILES	m	That's a public course. No Stephanie?
JACK	m	She's working. I need a break anyway.  She's getting a little clingy. This is our day!
JACK	m	Crap.
JACK	m	Did you ever got ahold of Maya  yesterday?
MILES	m	Nope.
JACK	m	She likes you, man. Stephanie'll  tell you.
MILES	m	Can you give me some room here?
JACK	m	Oh yeah. Sure.
JACK	m	You know, in life you gotta strike  when the iron's hot.
MILES	m	Thanks, Jack.
JACK	m	Don't whiff it.
JACK	m	Nice shot.
MILES	m	You're an asshole.
JACK	m	What about your agent? Hear anything  yet?
MILES	m	Nope.
JACK	m	What do you think's going on?
MILES	m	Could be anything.
JACK	m	Been checking your messages?
MILES	m	Obsessively.
JACK	m	Huh.
MILES	m	They probably think my book is such  a piece of shit that it's not even  worthy of a response. I guess I'll  just have to learn how to kiss off  three years of my life.
JACK	m	But you don't know yet, so your  negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't  you say?
JACK	m	Or fuck those New York publishers.  Publish it yourself. I'll chip in.  Just get it out there, get it  reviewed, get it in libraries. Let  the public decide.
JACK	m	Don't come over the top. Stay still.
MILES	m	Shut up.
JACK	m	Just trying to be helpful. It's all about stillness, Miles.  Inner quiet.
MILES	m	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's  the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
JACK	m	Why are you so hostile? I know you're  frustrated with your life right now,  but you can choose not to be so  hostile. Here.
MILES	m	What is it?
JACK	m	I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
MILES	m	Huh. Let me see the label.
JACK	m	What the fuck?
HUSBAND #1	m	Hurry it up, will you?
MILES	m	Fucker hit into us.
JACK	m	Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
MILES	m	Throw me his ball.
JACK	m	Nice shot.
JACK	m	Oh, this is going to be fun. This is going to be fun.
JACK	m	Hit into us again, motherfuckers,  and I'll ass-rape all four of you!
JACK	m	Just don't give up on Maya. Cool  smart chicks like that --they like  persistence.
MILES	m	I don't want to talk about it.
JACK	m	All I know is she's beautiful. Lots  of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not  going to feel good about this trip  until you guys hook up. Don't you  just want to feel that cozy little  box grip down on your Johnson?
GOLFER	m	Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?
JACK	m	Is it the money thing?
MILES	m	Is what the money thing?
JACK	m	With Maya.
MILES	m	Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman  finds out how I live, that I'm not a  published author, that I'm a liar  essentially, then yeah, any interest  is gonna evaporate real quick. If  you don't have money at my age, you're  not even in the game. You're just a  pasture animal waiting for the  abattoir.
JACK	m	Is an abattoir like a... like a...  what is that?
MILES	m	Slaughterhouse.
JACK	m	Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to  get the good news this week about  your book. I know you are. I can  feel it.
JACK	m	It's Steph. Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss. I  mean I would, but let me see. Hey,  Miles... Oh fuck it, we're going.  We'll be right there. Me too.
JACK	m	We're on.
MILES	m	What's happening?
JACK	m	We're going to have some fun. Remember  fun? We're going to have some of it.  Okay?
MILES	m	What exactly are we going to do?
JACK	m	I said okay?
MILES	m	You have to tell me --
JACK	m	I SAID OKAY?
MILES	m	Okay.
MAYA	f	Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the  restaurant last night looking for  me.
MILES	m	Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped  by for a drink. Didn't see you.
MAYA	f	I had class.
MILES	m	Well, nice to see you now.
MAYA	f	You too.
JACK	m	You ever actually read any of this  guy's books?
MILES	m	He wrote a great one on Burgundy,  and I used to get his newsletter,  but then there were doubts about  whether he does all his own tasting.  Plus a couple of times he declared  certain years vintages of the century,  and they turned out to be turkeys.  Fucker never retracted.
JACK	m	Huh.
MAYA	f	You guys should stop by the restaurant  for lunch today.
MILES	m	Great. What's the latest we can get  there?
MAYA	f	About two-thirty.
MILES	m	Okay.
MAYA	f	Did you hear about this Bordeaux  tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara  Saturday night? It's a little pricey,  but if you wanted to go, I'd be into  it. Why don't you stay through the  weekend?
MILES	m	No, we've got to get back Friday for  the rehearsal dinner.
MAYA	f	What rehearsal dinner?
MAYA	f	Who's getting married?
MAYA	f	Were you ever going to say anything?
MILES	m	Of course I was. I mean, just now I  could have made up some story, but I  didn't. I told you the truth.
MILES	m	Maya.
MAYA	f	Don't touch me. Just take me home.
MILES	m	I've told him. I've told him over  and over, but he's out of control.
MAYA	f	Do you know what he's been saying to  her?
MILES	m	He's an actor, so it can't be good.
MAYA	f	Oh, just that he loves her. That  she's the only woman who has ever  really rocked his world. How he adores  Siena. How he wants to move up here  and get a place with the two of them  and commute when he has to.
MILES	m	I'm sure he believed every word.
MILES	m	Please believe me. I was even on the  verge of telling you last night,  but...
MAYA	f	But you wanted to fuck me first.
MILES	m	Oh, Maya. No.
MAYA	f	Yeah.
MAYA	f	You know, I just spent three years  trying to extricate myself from a  relationship that turned out to be  full of deception. And I've been  doing just fine.
MILES	m	And I haven't been with anyone since  my divorce. This has been a big deal  for me, Maya -- hanging out with  you, and last night. I really like  you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm  just his... his freshman roommate  from San Diego State.
MAYA	f	Could I have my paper, please?
JACK	m	Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my  boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is  yo' daddy?
MILES	m	Put me down, Jack.
MILES	m	I said put me down. Jack!
JACK	m	I'm so proud of you! Let me love  you!
JACK	m	So tell me everything. Details. I  like details.
MILES	m	No.
JACK	m	What?
MILES	m	It's private.
JACK	m	You're kidding, right? Tell me what  happened, you fucker, or I'll tie  your dick in a knot.
MILES	m	Let's leave it alone.
JACK	m	You didn't get any, did you? You're a homo.
MILES	m	Just stop, okay? Make something up,  and that's what happened. Whatever  you want. Write my confession, and  I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me  all the time! I can't take it! You're  an infant! This is all a big party  for you, but not for me! This is  serious. And you -- Just... leave me  alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
JACK	m	Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
JACK	m	Did you have trouble performing?  Yeah, that's...
MILES	m	Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
MILES	m	Don't answer it.
MILES	m	I'm telling you, don't.
JACK	m	Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing?  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Christine.
JACK	m	Listen, honey. Let me call you back.  Miles and I are in the middle of  something. No, it's nothing serious --  Miles is just having one of his freak- outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call  you right back.
MILES	m	This whole week has gone sour. It  isn't turning out like it was supposed  to. I want to go home.
JACK	m	Who's being selfish now? I'm the one  getting married. I thought this week  was supposed to be about me.
MILES	m	We gotta slow down. I'm so tired. Let's just get out of  here.
JACK	m	I know what you need.
SALES ASSOCIATE	m	There you go.
MILES	m	Do you like them?
JACK	m	Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're  really sporty.
MILES	m	Are they too sporty?
JACK	m	Feel better?
JACK	m	Oh here, wait a second. I want to  run in here real quick.
JACK	m	I want to get something for Siena.
JACK	m	How about this one? We didn't hit  this one.
MILES	m	Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
JACK	m	You ever actually been in there,  Miles?
MILES	m	I don't have to.
JACK	m	I say we check it out. You never  know.
MILES	m	Tastes like the back of a fucking LA  schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem,  hoping for some semblance of  concentration, crushed it up with  leaves and mice, wound up with this  rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash  bullshit. Fucking Raid.
JACK	m	I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
MILES	m	Let me use your phone.
JACK	m	What's up?
MILES	m	I can't take it anymore. I've got to  call Evelyn.
ASSISTANT	m	Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.
MILES	m	Hi, it's Miles.
ASSISTANT	m	Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can  get her. You're in luck. I'll put you through.
EVELYN	f	Miles.
MILES	m	Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite  client.
EVELYN	f	How's the trip?
MILES	m	Good, good. Drinking some good wines  and kicking back, you know. So what's  happening? Still no word?
EVELYN	f	Actually there is word. I spoke to  Keith Kurtzman this morning.
MILES	m	And?
EVELYN	f	And... they're passing. Conundrum's  passing. He said they really liked  it. They really wanted to do it, but  they just couldn't figure out how to  market it. He said it was a tough  call.
MILES	m	Huh.
EVELYN	f	I'm sorry, Miles. So I don't know where that leaves  us. I'm not sure how much more mileage  I can get out of continuing to submit  it. I think it's one of those  unfortunate cases in the business  right now -- a fabulous book with no  home. The whole industry's gotten  gutless. It's not about the quality  of the books. It's about the  marketing.
EVELYN	f	Are you there? Miles?
MILES	m	Yeah, I'm here.
EVELYN	f	I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could.  You've been a real trooper. Tell him I'll call back.
MILES	m	So I guess that's it.
EVELYN	f	You're a wonderful writer, Miles.  Don't be discouraged.
EVELYN	f	Just hang in there, and who knows?  After you get something else  published, we can revisit this one.  And next time we can try a different  title.
MILES	m	Hit me again.
MILES	m	Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for  it.
POURER	?	This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
MILES	m	Just give me a full goddamn pour.
POURER	?	Sir, what are you doing?
MILES	m	I told you I need a drink.
POURER	?	Then buy a bottle and go outside.
POURER	?	Put the glass down.
POURER	?	You're going to have to leave, sir.
JACK	m	It's all right. His mother just died.
JACK	m	Just write another one. You have  lots of ideas, right?
MILES	m	No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.  I'm a middle-school English teacher.  I'm going to spend the rest of my  life grading essays and reading the  works of others. It's okay. I like  books. The world doesn't give a shit  what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. I'm so insignificant, I can't even  kill myself.
JACK	m	What's that supposed to mean?
MILES	m	You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf,  Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't  kill yourself before you've even  been published.
JACK	m	What about that guy who wrote  Confederacy of Dunces? He committed  suicide before he got published, and  look how famous he is.
MILES	m	Thanks.
JACK	m	Don't give up. You're going to make  it.
MILES	m	Half my life is over, and I have  nothing to show for it. I'm a  thumbprint on the window of a  skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement  on a tissue surging out to sea with  a million tons of raw sewage.
JACK	m	See? Right there. Just what you just  said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint  on a skyscraper. I couldn't write  that.
MILES	m	Neither could I. I think it's  Bukowski.
JACK	m	Oh, look. There's Steph!
JACK	m	Hey, baby.
JACK	m	Look what I got for our favorite  girl.
STEPHANIE	f	YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
MILES	m	Stephanie! Stop!
STEPHANIE	f	You fucking bastard! Lying piece of  shit! You're getting married on  Saturday? What was all that shit you  said to me?
JACK	m	I can explain.
STEPHANIE	f	You said you loved me! You fuck! I  hope you die!
STEPHANIE	f	Fuckface! You too!
MILES	m	Aren't you glad you didn't move up  here and marry her?
JACK	m	Don't need a lecture. You fucking  told Maya, didn't you?
MILES	m	No, I did not. Must have been Gary  at the Hitching Post. I think we  mentioned it to him the first night.
JACK	m	You told him. I'm fucking hurting  here.
MILES	m	Keep it elevated.
MAYA	f	Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
MILES	m	It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if  you even care, but I had to call and  tell you again how much I enjoyed  our time together and how sorry I am  things turned out the way they did.  I think you're great, Maya -- always  have. From the first time you waited  on me. And while I'm at it, I guess you  should know that my book is not  getting published. I thought this  one had a chance, but I was wrong.  Again. Don't bother reading it --  you've got better things to do. So  you see I'm not much of a writer.  I'm not anything really. The only  real talent I seem to have is for  disappointing people and now you  know that firsthand. We're leaving  in the morning, and I want you to  know that I take with me wonderful  memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really  sorry.
MILES	m	Well?
JACK	m	I'm going to need an operation. Maybe  a couple of them. They have to wait  for it it to heal first. Then they  break it again.
MILES	m	Good thing you have a voice-over  career.
JACK	m	Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue  her ass. Only reason I won't is to  protect Christine.
MILES	m	That's thoughtful.
JACK	m	Yeah.
JACK	m	I hate this place.
MILES	m	Take a couple of these, and you'll  learn to love it.
MILES	m	Two for you. And two for me.
JACK	m	So how did Stephanie know it was  Saturday? We didn't get into that  with Gary.
MILES	m	Huh. Let me think.
JACK	m	You sure you didn't say anything to  Maya?
MILES	m	Sure I'm sure. And just what are you  implying? I'm really pissed off at  you about all this, if you want to  know the truth. What's Maya going to  think of me now just for associating  with you? You're the one who's  sabotaging me, not the other way  around, pal. Not by a longshot.
JACK	m	I don't know. Just seems fishy.
JACK	m	What's it look like to you?
MILES	m	Looks like you were in a bad car  accident.
JACK	m	I'm hungry.
JACK	m	You know what I'm thinking?
MILES	m	What's that?
JACK	m	I'm thinking it's time to settle  down. One woman. One house. You know.  It's time.
MILES	m	Uh-huh.
JACK	m	Mm. Mm.
WAITRESS	?	And here're your Handi-wipes.
JACK	m	Oh, so that's what those are? For a  second there I thought you guys were  promoting safe sex.
WAITRESS	?	I'll be right back with more corn  bread.
JACK	m	I bet you that chick is two tons of  fun. You know, the grateful type.
MILES	m	I don't know. I wouldn't know.
JACK	m	Nice technique there... ...Cammi.
CAMMI	f	It's all in the wrist. You know, you look really familiar.  You from around here? Where'd you go  to high school?
JACK	m	No, we're from San Diego. Why?
CAMMI	f	I don't know. You just seem really  familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy  your meals.
JACK	m	Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek  Sommersby?
CAMMI	f	Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean  from "One Life to Live"?
JACK	m	You have to imagine him with a bandage  and shorter hair.
CAMMI	f	No. Way. No way!
CAMMI	f	Oh, my God!
MILES	m	Could you tell me where the bathroom  is?
CAMMI	f	Uh, sure, it's right over there,  right past the buffalo.
JACK	m	She gets off in an hour, so I think  I'm just going to have a drink and  then... make sure she gets home safe.
MILES	m	You're joking, right? What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to  the hotel and hang out and get up  early and play nine holes before we  head home?
JACK	m	Look, Miles. I know you're my friend  and you care about me. And I know  you disapprove. I respect that. But  there are some things I have to do  that you don't understand. You  understand wine and literature and  movies, but you don't understand my  plight. And that's okay.
JACK	m	Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing.
JACK	m	Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My  nose.
JACK	m	Fucking chick's married.
MILES	m	What?
JACK	m	Her husband works a night shift or  something, and he comes home, and  I'm on the floor with my cock in his  wife's ass.
MILES	m	Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked  all the way back from Solvang?
JACK	m	Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
MILES	m	That's five clicks, Jackson.
JACK	m	Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one  point I had to cut through an ostrich  farm. Fuckers are mean.
JACK	m	We gotta go back.
MILES	m	What?
JACK	m	I left my wallet. My credit cards,  cash, fucking ID, everything. We  gotta go back.
MILES	m	Big deal. We'll call right now and  cancel your cards.
JACK	m	You don't understand. The wedding  bands. The wedding bands are in my  wallet.
MILES	m	Okay, so they were in your wallet,  and you left your wallet somewhere.  Some bar. Christine'll understand.
JACK	m	No. She ordered them special. Took  her forever to find them. They've  got this design on them with dolphins  and our names engraved in Sanskrit.  We've got to go back. Christine'll  fucking crucify me.
MILES	m	No way. No way.
JACK	m	Please, Miles, please.
MILES	m	Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at  a bar. Happens every day.
JACK	m	No, we've got to get my wallet! Those  rings are irreplaceable! We've got  to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I  know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up.  You gotta help me. You gotta help  me. Pleeeease!
JACK	m	Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know  I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing.  Help me, Miles. Just this one thing,  this one last thing. I can't lose  Christine. I can't. I'm nothing  without her. Please, Miles, please...  uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......
MILES	m	She tell you she was married?
JACK	m	Yeah.
MILES	m	So what the fuck were you thinking?
JACK	m	Wasn't supposed to be back till six.  Fucker rolls in at five.
MILES	m	Cutting it a little close, don't you  think? So how was she? Compared to Stephanie,  say.
JACK	m	Horny as shit. Flopping around like  a landed trout.
JACK	m	Yeah, this is the block. Just keep  going... Yeah! This is it. There's her car.
MILES	m	So what's the plan?
JACK	m	The plan is... you go.
MILES	m	Me?
JACK	m	My ankle. Just go explain the  situation.
MILES	m	Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend  was the one balling your wife a couple  hours ago, and he seems to have left  his wallet behind, and we were  wondering...
JACK	m	Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like  that.
JACK	m	Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
MILES	m	Hold on.
MAN	m	You don't think I fuck you, bitch?  I'll fuck you.
CAMMI	f	I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
MAN	m	You picked him up and you fucked  him, didn't you, bitch?
CAMMI	f	I picked him up and I fucked him.  I'm a bad girl.
MAN	m	And you liked fucking him, didn't  you, you fat little whore?
CAMMI	f	I liked it when you caught me fucking  him.
MAN	m	The fuck was that?
CAMMI	f	The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
CAMMI	f	Get him!
MILES	m	Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn  door!
MAN	m	You motherfuckers! I'll kill you!  I'll kill you motherfuckers!
JACK	m	You did it! You fucking did it!
MAID	m	Housekeeping.
MILES	m	Hey, Jack. Jack.
JACK	m	Hrnrnrn?
MILES	m	That was quite a day yesterday.
JACK	m	Yep. Quite a day.
MILES	m	Quite a week.
JACK	m	Want me to drive?
MILES	m	No, I'm okay.
JACK	m	Hey, why don't you invite Maya to  the wedding?
MILES	m	Somehow I don't think inviting Maya  to your wedding is the right move.  In fact, after your bullshit, it's  going to be hard for me to even go  to the Hitching Post again.
JACK	m	You're so negative.
JACK	m	Come on, let me drive.
MILES	m	I'm fine. You rest.
JACK	m	I feel like driving.
MILES	m	What's wrong?
JACK	m	Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
MILES	m	What the fuck!
JACK	m	You said it looked like a car  accident.
MILES	m	What the fuck!
JACK	m	I'll pay for it.
MILES	m	Look at this!
JACK	m	I don't know. Doesn't look like  anybody got hurt in this one.
MILES	m	Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
JACK	m	You need a new car anyway.
JACK	m	I said I'd pay for it.
MILES	m	You broke some.
JACK	m	Whatever. Sorry.
MILES	m	No, not whatever. You fucking  derelict.
JACK	m	You ready?
MILES	m	Oh, fuck!
JACK	m	It's okay. I've got Triple A.
MILES	m	Well. That about does it.
JACK	m	Why don't you come in?
MILES	m	Uh-uh. You're on your own.
JACK	m	So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
MILES	m	Yeah.
JACK	m	Love you, man.
MILES	m	Back at you.
JACK	m	Hey, don't pull away till they see  the car.
MILES	m	Yeah. Hey, why wasn't I injured?
JACK	m	You were wearing your belt.
VICTORIA	f	Hey, Miles.
MILES	m	Hi, Vicki. You look beautiful.
VICTORIA	f	Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my  husband.
KEN	m	How are you?
MILES	m	Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky  guy.
KEN	m	Thanks. I'll wait for you at the car. Nice to meet you, Miles.
MILES	m	Ken.
MILES	m	That was big of him.
VICTORIA	f	Yeah, he's good that way. Very  considerate.
MILES	m	That's great.
VICTORIA	f	So how're you doing?
MILES	m	Since the last time we spoke? I don't  know. Could be better. Could be worse.
VICTORIA	f	So what's happening with your book?
MILES	m	Universally rejected. Strike three.
VICTORIA	f	Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are  you going to do?
MILES	m	Back to the drawing board, I guess.  Or not. So... you're married.  Congratulations. You look happy.
VICTORIA	f	I am.
MILES	m	Seems like everyone's getting married.  A year ago it was all divorces. Now  it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
VICTORIA	f	I guess.
MILES	m	Well, let's go have some champagne,  shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
VICTORIA	f	Not me. I'm not drinking.
MILES	m	You quit drinking?
VICTORIA	f	I'm pregnant.
MILES	m	Oh. Huh. Well... Congratulations again, Vicki. That's  wonderful news.
VICTORIA	f	See you over there, Miles.
MILES	m	Yeah.
14-YEAR-OLD BOY	m	"The marrow of his bone," I repeated  aimlessly. This at least penetrated  my mind. Phineas had died from the  marrow of his bone flowing down his  blood stream to his heart.
14-YEAR-OLD BOY	m	I did not cry then or ever about  Finny. I did not cry even when I  stood watching him being lowered  into his family's straight-laced  burial ground outside of Boston. I  could not escape a feeling that this  was my own funeral, and you do not  cry in that case.
14-YEAR-OLD BOY	m	Do you want me to keep reading the  next chapter, Mr. Raymond?
MILES	m	Hrnrnrn? No, we'll pick up there on  Monday.
ANSWERING MACHINE	m	One new message.
MAYA'S VOICE	f	Hello, Miles. It's Maya.
MAYA'S VOICE	f	Thanks for your letter. I would have  called you sooner, but I think I've  needed some time to think about  everything that happened and what  you wrote to me. Another reason I  didn't call sooner is that I wanted  to finish your book, which I finally  did last night.
MAYA'S VOICE	f	I think it's really lovely, Miles.  You're so good with words. Who cares  if it's not getting published? There  are so many beautiful and painful  things about it. Did you really go  through all that? It must have been  awfully hard. And the sister character -- Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to  say I was really confused by the  ending. Did the father finally commit  suicide, or what? It's driving me  crazy. And the title.
MAYA'S VOICE	f	Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy  here lately. But I like winter. So  listen, if you ever do decide to  come up here again, you should let  me know. I would say stop by the  Hitching Post, but to tell you the  truth I'm not sure how much longer  I'm going to be working there. I'm  going to graduate soon so I'll  probably relocate. We'll see.
MAYA'S VOICE	f	Anyway, like I said, I really loved  your novel. Don't give up, Miles.  Keep writing. You're really good.  Hope you're well. Bye.
