MR. SMITH	m	Look sharp.
MS. JONES	f	That one.
MR. SMITH	m	Nah.  Hates his wife.
MS. JONES	f	I hate rollerblades.
GENE	m	Lynn!  Lynn!!
GENE	m	Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?
GENE	m	I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of  my sight, all right? I want you to  stay right by me. Will you do that  for me?
LYNN	f	Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the  platform and gives out an exaggerated  sigh.
GENE	m	We made it.
LYNN	f	We made it.
MS. JONES	f	Skate-boarders I don't mind, even  though they dress like fuckin' idiots,  but when I see some pin-head on  rollerblades, I get the definite  urge to grease the grill of my car  with 'em.
MR. SMITH	m	Keep your eyes peeled.
MS. JONES	f	What about them?
MR. SMITH	m	Too old.
MR. JONES	m	Him!
MR. SMITH	m	If you ever had an idea it would die  of malnutrition. First those blue  hairs then some Spic.  Leave this to  me. I know people. It's my job. I'm  a people person.
MS. JONES	f	What the fuck are you looking for?
MR. SMITH	m	I'm looking for them.
MS. JONES	f	Where?
MR. SMITH	m	Right there.
GENE	m	I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do  you see a phone?
GENE	m	Come on, you.
GENE	m	Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss  like that?
LYNN	f	On TV.
GENE	m	You never saw your Mom and me kiss  like that?
GENE	m	Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You  can talk about her all you want. You  know that, don't you?
GENE	m	So, come on. You never saw us kiss  like that?
LYNN	f	No way.
GENE	m	How did you see us kiss?
GENE	m	That's it? That little peck of a  kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some  kisses.
GENE	m	Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call.
MR. SMITH	m	Look at 'em. He'd do anything for  her.-
MS. JONES	f	Young love.
MR. SMITH	m	Foreigners! Fuck!
MS. JONES	f	Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and  when we need their help in Kuwait,  where the fuck are they?
GENE	m	Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have  an interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is  Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at  the last minute like this but...  Hey, hey!
GENE	m	Watch that! Lynn, come here!
GENE	m	Sorry. There's some crazy kids on  skates. Listen, the train just got  in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few  minutes late.
GENE	m	Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as  I can. Bye, now.
GENE	m	Ready?
LYNN	f	Nods.
GENE	m	Let' s do it.
GENE	m	Whoops.
GENE	m	Now, see, this is why you should  always wear a helmet and knee pads.  You never know when you're going to  fall down and go boom. Right?
LYNN	f	Right.
MR. SMITH	m	Perfect.
MS. JONES	f	Perfect.
MR. SMITH	m	Could I see some identification,  sir?
GENE	m	What?
MS. JONES	f	I.D. Could we see some?
GENE	m	Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem?  Will a driver's license do?
MR. SMITH	m	That'll do just fine.
GENE	m	Is this about those kids? Look, I'm  sorry about that. But they darn  near...
MR. SMITH	m	You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
GENE	m	Yes.
MS. JONES	f	Where's that?
GENE	m	Near Lompoc, north. What's...
MR. SMITH	m	Come with us, sir.
GENE	m	I'd like to know what...
MR."SMITH	m	Don't cause a ruckus, sir.
MR. SMITH	m	You don't want to cause a ruckus,  with the little girl and all.
MS. JONES	f	Come with me, honey.
GENE	m	Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take  the girl!
MR. SMITH	m	Don't worry. She's good with kids.
LYNN	f	You stole that.
MS. JONES	f	No, I didn't. I confiscated it.  There's a difference.
GENE	m	What is going on?
MR. SMITH	m	Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.
MS. JONES	f	Let's get your seatbelt on. Always  gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that  right?
LYNN	f	I want my daddy.
MS. JONES	f	There's your daddy. See? We're your  daddy's friends.
MR. SMITH	m	That's right. The policeman is your  friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?
MR. SMITH	m	Daddy?
GENE	m	Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our  friends.
MS. JONES	f	Hey, would you look at this crazy  car? Everybody has their own radio.  What do you think of that?
LYNN	f	Everybody does?
MS. JONES	f	Yep. And you can listen to it without  anybody else listening. Let's try it  out.
MS. JONES	f	This is what they call the jack. Hi,  Jack!
LYNN	f	Laughs.
MS. JONES	f	It goes in that little hole.
LYNN	f	Let me do it.
LYNN	f	It's loud!
MS JONES	f	Removes a Pro Label Machine from  under the seat. She begins to type  in several characters.
MR. SMITH	m	Let's get down to business.
GENE	m	Who are you? You're not the police.
MS. JONES	f	Brilliant.
MR. SMITH	m	Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay  attention and your daughter won't be  hurt.
GENE	m	You wouldn't...
MS. JONES	f	Try us.
GENE	m	Get your hands off her.
MR. SMITH	m	Mr. Watson, you're not paying  attention. Your daughter's life  depends on you. Do you understand  that?
GENE	m	Yes, yes, I understand.
MR. SMITH	m	Good.
MR. SMITH	m	This is for you. In it there is a  picture of a woman and an itinerary.  It is her itinerary. She is presently -  are you listening, Mr. Watson?
GENE	m	Yes, I'm listening.
MR. SMITH	m	She is presently at the Bonaventure  Hotel. That's right near here.
MR. SMITH	m	When you leave this van you will get  yourself a cab and take it to the  Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will  take this.
MR. SMITH	m	...and you will kill the woman whose  picture is in there. Not just shoot  her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend  you empty the gun into her. Close  up. Got all that?
GENE	m	You're out of your mind.
MR. SMITH	m	What's your point?
GENE	m	I will do no such thing.
MR. SMITH	m	Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
MS. JONES	f	Don't worry. We'll take good care of  the kid.
MR. SMITH	m	It is now 12:16. If the woman in the  picture is alive at 1:30... ...I call my partner, your daughter  is dead.
MR. SMITH	m	And what happens if I don't call  you?
MS. JONES	f	I kill her anyway.
MR. SMITH	m	Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do  you understand?
MR. SMITH	m	The woman in the picture...
MR. SMITH	m	...or your daughter.
GENE	m	Oh, my God...
MR. SMITH	m	God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only  you can help her.
MS. JONES	f	Only you.
MR. SMITH	m	You're wasting time.
LYNN	f	Where is my daddy going?
MS. JONES	f	He's going to help the police. Your  daddy is going to be a hero.
LYNN	f	My daddy is going to be a hero? Like  Power Rangers?
MS. JONES	f	Just like Power Rangers.
MR. SMITH	m	Let's test this thing. You on?
MS. JONES 	f	Reading you.
MR. SMITH	m	You'11 need some cash. I'll hang onto this for the time  being. Oh, and...
MR. SMITH	m	You'll need these.
MR. SMITH	m	Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a  wastin'.
LITTLE GIRL	f	Mama!
MR. SMITH	m	You talk to a cop, you even look at  a cop too long and your daughter is  dead. Do it.
MS. JONES 	f	Go ahead, sugar Die.
LYNN 	f	Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling  Daddy. Come in, Daddy.
GENE	m	Lynn!
LYNN 	f	I can hear you good. Can you hear  me?
GENE	m	Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
MR. SMITH	m	That's enough.
MS. JONES 	f	'Daddy has to go now.
LYNN	f	He has to say "over and out". Daddy,  you have to say "over and out".
GENE	m	Over and out.
MR. SMITH	m	Look at your watch. Look at it! At  one-thirty your little girl is dead.  Say it with me. At one-thirty my  little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
GENE	m	At one thirty my little girl is dead.
MR. SMITH	m	Unless you do what you're told. Go  do it!
MR. SMITH	m	And don't forget I'll be watching  you.
CABBIE	m	Where to, sir?
GENE	m	The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure  Hotel. Do you know where that is?
CABBIE	m	Amtrack?
GENE	m	What?
CABBIE	m	You just come in on Amtrack?
GENE	m	Uh, yes..
CABBIE	m	Business or pleasure?
GENE	m	Business.
CABBIE	m	Where'd you come from?
GENE	m	San Diego.
CABBIE	m	Oh, San Diego? I've thought about  moving to San Diego.  It's hard to  make a living in this town. These  short hops.  Can't make a dime on  'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can  make a buck. These little hops cost  me money.
GENE	m	Sorry.
CABBIE	m	'S okay. What do you think?
GENE	m	Huh?
CABBIE	m	Better in San Diego? More opportunity  there? What?
GENE	m	I really don't know. I don't live  there. I was just visiting...a grave.
CABBIE	m	Aw, too bad.
CABBIE	m	Somebody close?
GENE	m	What?
CABBIE	m	The grave. Somebody close?
GENE	m	Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were  separated. She was thinking about a  divorce.
GENE	m	Look...I've... I've got a problem. A  big problem...
CABBIE	m	Oh, yeah?
CABBIE	m	Jesus! Watch it, buddy!
CABBIE	m	I'd love to hear about your problem,  but the ride's over. Three-fifty.
CABBIE	m	Three-fifty. I hope your problem  doesn't have anything to do with my  three-fifty.
GENE	m	Right. Right.
CABBIE	m	What do I want with an accountant?
DOORMAN	m	I got one for the airport. You free?
CABBIE	m	You bet.
GENE	m	Oh, my God. Oh, no.
GENE	m	Oh, shit.
GENE	m	Oh, sweet Jesus...
GENE	m	Could you tell me where the Emerald  Bay Room is?
GUSTINO	m	Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow  the signs.
GENE	m	Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
GUSTINO	m	No problem.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Whoops!
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Nice body check.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	You know my wife has a deeply personal  reason for going after repeat drunk  drivers. They are felons and they  should be treated as such. A drivers  license is a privilege, not a right.
GENE	m	Excuse me, is the...thing over?
WOMAN	f	Yes. You didn't miss much. The  food...chicken again.
GENE	m	Eleanor Grant is gone?
WOMAN	f	Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same  at all these...
MR. SMITH	m	Check your itinerary. Move along.
GENE	m	This says "invitation only".
MR. SMITH	m	Of course you're invited. You're a  big donor to the campaign. They love  you.
MR. SMITH	m	This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red  Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
GENE	m	Where did you get these? Who are  you?
MR. SMITH	m	I'm the guy who's going to kill your  daughter if you don't get moving.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	They-didn't hear a word I said. The  mike was too low on the podium.
KRISTA	f	How much did we pay for that room?
CHIEF AIDE	m	We didn't.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Somebody did.
KRIST	m	A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.
BODYGUARD	m	Excuse me, sir, this car is for the  Governor. You can take the next one.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Don't you dare, Franco. This is one  of our biggest supporters.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial  incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't-  it? I love saying that.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Whose idea was it to have a lunch  right after the brunch? I'm about to  bust as it is.
KRISTA	f	We'll just walk through, do a little  grip-and-grin, then get ready for  the press con.
GENE	m	Governor...
GENE	m	I need your help.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
GENE	m	Its'...ah...about my daughter....
MR. SMITH 	m	Room for one more?
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I think we can accommodate you.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial  incumbent.
MR. SMITH	m	A pleasure to meet you, Governor.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	You were saying?  Your daughter....?
GENE	m	I...
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Yes?
GENE	m	She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure  to get your autograph.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Of course.  I wish everything were  that easy.
KRISTA	f	I've got the pen if you've got the  paper.
KRISTA	f	How about that?
KRISTA	f	Is that something precious?
GENE	m	No, that's,..that's fine
ELEANOR GRANT	f	What's her name?
GENE	m	Her name? Her name is Lynn.
KRISTA	f	It's funny. I don't even keep a pad  of paper with me anymore, everything's  gone so electronic.
KRISTA	f	If it wasn't for double A batteries  I'd be in big trouble.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Are you all right? Elevators make me  queasy, too.
MR. SMITH	m	She was right in front of you! What's  wrong with you!?
MR. SMITH	m	Are you 'fucking with me!?
GENE	m	The gun...
MR. SMITH	m	What about the gun?
GENE	m	It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the  bullets in it.
MR. SMITH	m	You...
MR. SMITH	m	You won't get many chances like that,  Mr. Watson. That's the way life works.  Don't blow the next one.
MS. JONES	f	That's pretty good.
LYNN	f	I've done much better ones than this.
MS. JONES	f	You have, huh?
LYNN	f	Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much  more colors at home.
MS. JONES	f	That's good. That's good, sweetie pie.
MR. SMITH	m	There, all loaded. Ready for the  hunt.
HUEY	f	Having a rough day? Down at the heels  as they...?
HUEY	f	You don't see your face, you don't  pay!
HUEY	f	Having a rough day? Down at the heels  as they say? What you need is a shoe  shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
HUEY	f	Take ten, take a break, take a seat,  take a load off. Put the world in  perspective.
HUEY	f	So, are you a visitor or lucky enough  to live in The City of Angels?
GENE	m	I'm...I'm visiting.
HUEY	f	What do you do, if I may be so bold?
GENE	m	I'm just an accountant.
HUEY	f	Don't denigrate yourself, my friend.  Where would the government be without  accountants?  They wouldn't know how  hard they can squeeze us before we  pop, isn't that right?
HUEY	f	Now you take tips. Time was a tip  was between a man and his customer.  Not any more. They've figured out  what they call a formulae, don't  laugh, it ain't for babies. They  take your sales, see, and slap a  percentile on there, figuring that  somewhere between your lies and your  bad luck they'll hit on the mean  amount, mean meaning "in the middle",  but if you ask me it means "just  plain mean". Why you can have Uncle  Scrooge wring a nickel over your  poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy  Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins  like manna from heaven, don't make  no difference, they'll tax your behind  according to that same figure. Doesn't  seem quite right., does it?
GENE	m	No. No, it doesn't.
GUSTINO	m	Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?
HUEY	f	It's a load, my friend, but somebody's  got to carry it.
GENE	m	I have to do something.
HUEY	f	What's that? You have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between  that and my wooden leg I'm a mess.  Compliments of the United States  Army Artillery Corps.
GENE	m	I said I have to do something.
HUEY	f	I'll have you out of here in two  shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
GENE	m	Is within himself.
GENE	m	Drove me crazy. There must have been  one on me. I didn't add up so she  left. That's what attracted me to  her In the first place. She made up  her mind and she did it. She wouldn't  sit around waiting for...whatever.  She'd do something. She'd do  something.
HUEY	f	Yes, well, you know, for a quality  shoe you can't beat a good wingtip.  Wears like iron. You're a wise man.  There ya' go. Two bucks.
HUEY	f	You got anything smaller?
GENE	m	Keep it.
HUEY	f	It's a twenty.
GENE	m	Keep it.
HUEY	f	Well...thanks muchly...
GENE	m	Can I get out to Flower Street from  here?
HUEY	f	Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you  right out there.
GENE	m	Thanks.
MR. SMITH	m	You get another chance in ten minutes.
GENE	m	Then I have time for a drink.
MR. SMITH	m	All right, Mr. Watson, but make it  just one. I don't want you...
REPORTER	m	So where was I?
BARTENDER	m	I don't know. Something about the  Governor's new regime.
REPORTER	m	Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old  Boys like yesterday's newspapers.
REPORTER	m	The white boys are in for it. When  they got her elected they never  thought she was gonna make the  Governor's office look like the United  Nations.
REPORTER	m	We're talking Custer's Last Stand  here. The only minorities not on her  staff are the ones still lost in the  Rain Forest.
GENE	m	Lynn!
MS. JONES 	f	Shhh. You'll wake the baby up.
MS. JONES	f	What we have here is what they call  a Mexican standoff. The thing you  gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind  the seat?"  Now, a twenty-two'd go  right through it, but even a button  will throw a twenty-two off so there's  a good chance it'd get screwed up  somewhere along the way, miss the  target. Maybe a thirty-eight?  A  thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll  bust up in little bitty pieces.  They'll keep going but they'll be  slowed down quite a bit. How's about  a three-fifty-seven?  It'll go through  the seat, her, you, the dashboard,  shit, it'll go through the engine  block before it knows it's hit  anything, end up in some pedestrian  three blocks away. What do you think?  What's my poison?
MS. JONES	f	Well it's a comfort to know you've  got the co-Jones to pull that thing  out. Whether you've got the balls to  pull the trigger we've still got to  see.
MS. JONES	f	He's coming back in.
MR. SMITH	m	I've got him in the crosshairs.
GENE	m	Pool Deck?
HECTOR	m	Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	My wife is not interested in negative  campaigning. She wants to accentuate  the positive. I don't know about you  but I find that refreshing.
A REPORTER	m	Have you ever thought of running for  office yourself?
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Me?
BRENDAN GRANT	m	I'm just a business man.
MR. SMITH 	m	I know what you're thinking.
GENE	m	What would you do in my place?
MR. SMITH	m	Me?
MR. SMITH	m	The bitch would be dead. Course I  ain't sayin' which bitch.
GENE	m	There's a plot to kill the Governor.  If you don't believe me, check that  guy right there. He has a gun.
OFFICER TRUST	m	So do you, Mr. Watson.
OFFICER TRUST	m	You got this under control?
MR. SMITH	m	Yeah.
OFFICER TRUST	m	It doesn't look like it.
MR. SMITH	m	It's under control.
OFFICER TRUST	m	It better be.
MR. SMITH	m	I oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but I'm going to give you a  break because you're an amateur.
WAITER M 	m	Gentlemen...
MR. SMITH	m	Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.
MR. SMITH	m	Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.
MR. SMITH	m	There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired,  jolly son-of-a-bitch.
MR. SMITH	m	Nobody could make me laugh like him.  We closed more bars together than I  can count. He was my pal. I loved  that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to  say it. But he was fuck-up. He had  this image of himself. Thought he  was con man. Always trying to shave  the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always  miss him. Tell me why.
GENE	m	What...?
MR. SMITH	m	Tell me why I miss him.
GENE	m	He's dead?
MR. SMITH	m	That's right. He's dead. Tell me  why.
GENE	m	How should I...?
MR. SMITH	m	Tell me why he's dead.
GENE	m	You killed him.
MR. SMITH	m	That's right, I killed him. He fucked  up one too many times so I put a  bullet in his eye. Then I put two  more into him just to make sure. Now  that was somebody I loved.
MR. SMITH	m	I loved that motherfucker but I got  the call and I put him down like a  sick animal. So if you've got any  doubts about what's going to happen  if you don't deliver let me tell you  something. I'd make gravy out of  your little girl just to season that  black Irish cocksucker's meat.
MR. SMITH	m	Do what you're supposed to do. Do it  now.
MR. SMITH	m	Shit!
TOM BRADLEY	m	It is my extreme pleasure this  afternoon to introduce to you...
TOM BRADLEY	m	...a woman who can only be  characterized as a one-of-a-kind.
KRISTA 	f	Feeling better?
TOM BRADLEY	m	An iconoclast with class...
KRISTA	f	The elevator. You weren't feeling  well.
TOM BRADLEY	m	A genuine lady who's not afraid to  get into the trenches...
KRISTA	f	Are you better now?
TOM BRADLEY	m	...and go to the mat with greedy  special interests...
TOM BRADLEY	m	The finest Governor our state has  ever had...
TOM BRADLEY	m	My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor  Grant!
GENE	m	My wife always said I had a problem  trusting people.
KRISTA	f	Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara  Grant.
GENE	m	You don't understand. I'm going to  trust you. And you have to trust me.
KRISTA	f	Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
GENE	m	Look...my daughter ... she's going  to die...unless you can help me.
KRISTA	f	Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me  get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist  you, he's our...
GENE	m	No! You have to listen to me.
KRISTA	f	I'm listening, I'm listening.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	My friends, my good friends...
GENE	m	Please...please...you have to believe  me... They have my daughter.  They  want me to kill Eleanor Grant � or  they'll kill my daughter.
KRISTA	f	All right, let's just...let's get  security in on this.
GENE	m	No! You can't! They're in on it.
KRISTA	f	I don't see how they could be in on  it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
GENE	m	I don't know. One of them is following  me. If he knew what I'd just told  you they'd...
GENE	m	Look, how did I get in here with  this!?
KRISTA	f	I don't know.
GENE	m	You've got to trust me. I'm putting  my daughter's life in your hands.  She's only six. She's just a little  girl. Please, please, trust me.
KRISTA	f	It's a little hard to trust you under  the circumstances.
GENE	m	You're right, it is. Here.
GENE	m	Will you trust me now?
KRISTA	f	I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's  one person we can go to.
GENE	m	The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll  call his partner. I do anything out  of line and he'll send the word to  kill my daughter.
KRISTA	f	He'll think you're in the crowd until  the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
ELEANOR GRANT 	f	...I remember that horrible night as  if it were yesterday. A phone call  pulling me out of sleep, the terrible  news...
ELEANOR GRANT 	f	My husband and child senselessly  killed by a drunk driver.
KRISTA	f	We've got about ten minutes.
GENE	m	Are you sure?
KRISTA	f	I've heard this speech a lot. Come  on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
GENE	m	But...
KRISTA	f	Trust me. You asked me for help. Let  me help. Trust me.
GENE	m	Okay...
GENE	m	Hey.
GENE	m	I think you better put that away.
KRISTA	f	I think you're right.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy  us, has a curious way of giving us  strength.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I doubt if I would be before you  now, if I hadn't been put through  that crucible of loss.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	And though I can never forget William  and Bill Junior or the love I felt  for them...
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I have found joy again in serving  this great state. I have found love  again in my second husband Brendan...
GENE	m	Where are we going?
HALL GUARD	m	Ms. Brooks ...
KRISTA	f	Is he in?
HALL GUARD	m	Yes, ma'am.
GENE	m	Who is this? Are you sure we can  trust him?
KRISTA	f	I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her  Campaign Manager.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	What is it? Is there a problem?
KRISTA	f	We need to see you, Brendan.
GENE	m	We have to hurry.
KRISTA	f	I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone  is trying to kill Eleanor.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	What? What are you talking about?
KRISTA	f	We need people we can "trust. We  only have a few moments...
BRENDAN GRANT	m	This is...this is insane. How do you  know this?
GENE	m	I know it because I'm the one who's  supposed to kill her.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	You are!? You brought this man here!? You  brought this man to my room!?
KRISTA	f	I had to. Her Security people may be  involved...
MYSTERY MAN	m	Is there a problem, Brendan?
BRENDAN GRANT	m	There certainly is. This man says  he's been hired to kill Eleanor.
GENE	m	Not hired. They're blackmailing me.
MYSTERY MAN	m	Who is this "they"?
GENE	m	I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr.  Grant! They have my daughter. I'm  not some lunatic. Your wife is in  trouble.  Someone is trying to kill  her. Someone is trying to make me  kill her. Please, listen...
MYSTERY MAN	m	And on the strength of this story,  you bring this man to Brendan's suite?   Does that show good judgment, Ms.  Brooks?  I'm just a friend of  Brendan's, but it seems to me...
KRISTA	f	He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
MYSTERY MAN	m	What?
KRISTA	f	He got onto the pool deck with a  gun. How did he get past her Security  carrying a
MYSTERY MAN	m	I see. Where is this gun?
KRISTA I	f	Have it.
MYSTERY MAN	m	Well, is it real? Do we know anything  about it?
KRISTA	f	It looks real. I don't know anything  about guns.
MYSTERY MAN	m	Could I see it?
MYSTERY MAN	m	My goodness. It certainly looks real.
MYSTERY MAN	m	What's your opinion? You're the expert  in these matters, supposedly.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Jesus Christ!
MYSTERY MAN	m	Are you out of your fucking mind!?
OFFICER TRUST	m	Somebody mind telling me... What the hell happened!?
MR. SMITH	m	Help me get her off the rug.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	What have you done to me!? Christ  almighty!
GENE	m	No!
MR. SMITH	m	You fucked up.
MYSTERY MAN 	m	That's enough.
MR. SMITH	m	You want me to kill your kid!? You  want me to kill you!?
MYSTERY MAN	m	Don't let him go!
GENE	m	I killed you.
MR. SMITH	m	You fucked up.
MYSTERY MAN 	m	You nearly killed him, too, you idiot!
MR. SMITH 	m	Nearly doesn't count.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	I'm on record. I never wanted this.  I wanted simplicity; a telescopic  sight, a powerful rifle, but no.  What was good enough for Oswald wasn't  good enough for you two. You had to  get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off  the street, stick a gun in his hand.
MYSTERY MAN	m	It's academic now. She had to be  killed.
MR. SMITH	m	What were you going to do, Brendan?  Lock her in a closet?  You're in the  fucking kitchen now. Get used to the  heat. He's been seen all over the  hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes.  We even got him on video. It'll work.  Don't worry about it.
MYSTERY MAN	m	(about GENE) Is he awake?
MR. SMITH	m	Yeah.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Oh Great. Why don't we just give him  our home phone numbers while we're  at it?
MR. SMITH	m	It doesn't matter what he hears.
MR. SMITH	m	That's what it looks like. She was  alive a minute ago. Now she's dead.  Because you wouldn't do what I told  you to do.
MYSTERY MAN	m	Get going. You've only got a few  minutes to pull it together.
MYSTERY MAN	m	It's too late for that.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	There is a dead woman on my bathroom  floor!
MYSTERY MAM	m	What about it? She's Eleanor's  assistant and they will have been  shot with the same gun, by the same  lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who  went over the edge.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Only thing better would be if he  were a postal worker.
OFFICER TRUST	m	He won't be doing any work once I  get through with him.
MYSTERY MAN	m	And in a few months you're in the  Governor's mansion. The people'd  make you king of California if they  could.
GENE	m	I'm not stupid.. I know how this is  supposed, to work.
MR. SMITH	m	Do you now, Mr. Watson?
GENE	m	I kill her - and you kill me.
MR. SMITH	m	Keep your voice down.
GENE	m	Even if you don't, Her Security men  will.
GENE	m	How am I supposed to get away?
MR. SMITH	m	That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
MR. SMITH	m	Come back.
GENE	m	How do I know you won't kill my  daughter once I'm gone?
MR. SMITH	m	Come Back....Fucking Radio.
MR.SMITH	m	I told you she'd be alright, if you  do your job.
GENE	m	And I'm supposed to trust you?
MR. SMITH	m	What choice do you have?
MR. SMITH	m	After you.
MR. SMITH	m	Look out there! You see the van?
MR. SMITH	m	You see it?!
MR. SMITH	m	Come back.
MS. JONES 	f	Yeah.
MR. SMITH	m	Do it!
LYNN 	f	Daddy...?
GENE	m	Lynn!
MR. SMITH	m	Security. Take the next car.
MR. SMITH	m	Again.
GENE	m	No, please...
MR. SMITH	m	You got one last chance. Half an  hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill  her myself. I'll rip her fucking  head off right in front of you!
LYNN 	f	Daddy, did you hear me scream?
LYNN 	f	She told me to scream as loud as I  could. Did you hear me?
MR. SMITH	m	The next time I tell you to do  something, you goddamn well do it!
MS. JONES	f	Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit  a screaming kid in traffic, come out  here and do it yourself. He got the  message, didn't he?
HUEY 	f	Having a rough day? Down at the heels  as they say? What you need is a shoe  shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
HUEY	f	Take ten, take a break, take a seat,  take a load off. Put the world in  perspective.
HUEY	f	So, are you a visitor or are you  lucky enough to...
HUEY	f	You got a complaint?
GENE	m	You remember me?
HUEY	f	I remember. The big tipper.
GENE	m	Something is going to happen. When  it's over you'll know what I was  talking about.
HUEY	f	Oh, man...
GENE	m	Please. Something is going to  happen...
HUEY	f	What? The end of the world? Man,  don't give me your mad rap. I'm not  a bartender. I don't want to hear  it. I raise a family doing this  bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your  crazy white ass out of my chair.
GENE	m	Please...
HUEY	f	Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the  right to crap in my ear. You want  change?  You got it, brother. What  was that you gave me, a twenty?
MR. SMITH	m	Come on, let's get some privacy.
GENE	m	He's deaf.
GENE	m	He can't hear a word we're saying.
MR. SMITH	m	You wouldn't be kidding me now, would  you, Mr. Watson? Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't  hear me? Nigger?
HUEY	f	Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient  just got multiplied by two. What do  you think of that?  You'll have to  forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your  approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm  deef as a post. Compliments of the  United States Army... ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a  shine, sir? You don't see your face,  you don't pay.
MR. SMITH	m	Yeah, sure, give me a shine... ...shine.
MR. SMITH	m	I'm putting your toy back in your  pocket, Mr. Watson.
MR. SMITH	m	It's all wound up. Now let's get out  your itinerary.
GENE	m	One thirty. California Ballroom.
MR. SMITH	m	That's right. That gives you...
MR. SMITH	m	...twenty-six minutes to get your  shit together.
GENE	m	Let me talk to her again.
MR. SMITH	m	No.
GENE	m	I want'to talk to her.
MR. SMITH	m	Forget about it.
GENE	m	I talk to her or you can forget about  it.
MR. SMITH	m	Don't you threaten me.
GENE	m	What are you going to do about it,  shoot me?
MR. SMITH	m	(glances again at HUEY) You know  what I'm gonna do.
GENE	m	What? Walk out there and twist her  arm off?
GENE	m	It would be a lot less trouble just  to let me talk to her.
MR. SMITH	m	Come Back.
MS. JONES 	f	Yeah.
MR. SMITH	m	Put her on.
MS. JONES 	f	What gives?
MR. SMITH	m	Just put her on.
LYNN 	f	Daddy?
GENE	m	Yes, sweetie, it's me.
LYNN 	f	I'm tired. I want to.go now.
GENE	m	I know you do, honey.
LYNN	f	Can we go now?
GENE 	m	Not just yet, baby. There's...there's  something Daddy has to do.
LYNN	f	To be a hero?
GENE	m	No, honey, not to be a hero. But I  want you to remember something for  me, all right?
LYNN 	f	All right.
GENE	m	He's doing it for you. No matter  what anybody tells you, no matter  who they are, he's doing it for you,  because he loves you.
MR. SMITH	m	That's enough.
GENE	m	Will you promise me that?
LYNN 	f	I promise.
GENE	m	All right. Kisses to you.
LYNN 	f	No...kisses to you.
GENE	m	No. Kisses to you.
LYNN 	f	No, kisses to...
MR. SMITH	m	I don't care who the fuck you do it  for just so you do it. Hey.
MR. SMITH	m	You done yet?
HUEY	f	Just about.
HUEY	f	Two dollars, if it pleases you.
MR. SMITH	m	It doesn't. I remember when it was a  fuckin' quarter.
MR. SMITH	m	Twenty-five minutes.
HUEY	f	Thanks for the tip.
HUEY	f	Mister, what are you dragging me  into?
GENE	m	I'm not dragging you into anything.  I don't expect...
HUEY	f	Cover your mouth.
GENE	m	What?
HUEY	f	This gorilla's watching you, is that  right?
GENE	m	That's right.
HUEY	f	Then don't let him be seeing you  talking to me. I don't want him  twisting my arm off.
HUEY	f	That was your kid on the walkie- talkie?
GENE	m	My daughter. They have her in a van  across the street. They say they'll  kill her if I don't do something for  them.
HUEY	f	In twenty-five minutes in the  California Ballroom.
GENE	m	There was a woman. She was trying to  help me. I watched him murder her.
HUEY	f	What are you supposed to do?
GENE	m	Kill the Governor.
HUEY	f	I knew I should have packed up and  gone home as soon as I got that  twenty. What am I supposed to do  about this situation?
GENE	m	One of them is in on it. He might  even be in charge. Her Security is  in on it. There's only one person I  know for sure isn't in on it.
HUEY	f	Who?
GENE	m	The Governor. If I could just talk  to her...
HUEY	f	Oh, Jesus ...
GENE	m	No way, there's nothing you can do  to help me.
HUEY	f	Then why'd you drag me into it?
GENE	m	It's my kid. I've got to...to  somehow...do right by my little girl.
GENE	m	It's about time I did. I was one of  those guys, workaholics. I worked my  ass off for them - my wife, my  daughter.  That's just what I thought  I was supposed to do.
HUEY	f	Yeah, all right, listen...
GENE	m	So when she wanted a divorce...I  was...I didn't know what I'd done  wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see  it....
HUEY	f	Why don't you tell me about the early  years some other time?
GENE	m	I'm sorry. You understand I don't  mind dying if I could save my  daughter. I mean that.
HUEY	f	Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with  these shoes any more or it's gonna  look funny. You go down get yourself  something to drink. Make sure Godzilla  there, follows you.
GENE	m	What are you going to do?
HUEY	f	I haven't the faintest idea. Go on  now. I'll get word to you.
GENE	m	If nothing else, someone heard my  story.
GENE	m	Keep the change.
HUEY	f	Don't think I won't.
GENE	m	I need a drink.
GAME SHOW HOST 	m	...and time is running out...
GENE	m	Give me a ...a gingerale?
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1	m	Man, I thought she was going to get  out the violins.
TV REPORTER	m	No shit. If I hear that stop the  violence routine one more time I'm  going to shoot somebody.
WAITRESS	?	Here's your Ginger Ale, sir.
DOWN THE BAR:	m	T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Politicians.
TV REPORTER	m	They're all the same.
TV REPORTER	m	You know what bothers me?
TV REPORTER	m	When they get all weepy eyed about  the "ordinary citizen", the "regular  Joe", the "normal American". Gimme a  break. There ain't no such animal.  We're a nation of two hundred forty  million special interest groups.
GENE	m	Well, I'm just a regular guy.
TV REPORTER	m	Is that right?
GENE	m	Yeah, that's right. But I've built a  good solid business out of nothing.  Don't underestimate the regular guy.
BARTENDER	m	Sir, you haven't paid.
GENE	m	It's on the Special Interest at the  end of the bar.
BARTENDER	m	Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop.
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1	m	Left field bleachers heard from.
T.V. REPORTER	m	Laughs.
OFFICER TRUST	m	Where is he? Did you lose him?
MR. SMITH	m	Shut up.
GENE	m	Let's all hope so.
HUEY	f	Quick, off with the shoes and pants.  Trade with Gustino. The big guy's  coming.
HUEY	f	C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy.
HUEY	f	Gustino! Drop 'em!
HUEY	f	And cover up them socks. Man, who  dresses you?
JANITOR	m	Fue.  (Gone.)
HUEY	f	Meet Irene.
GENE	m	Hi.
HUEY	f	Irene is going to help.
GENE	m	Thank you.
GENE	m	Where am I going?
HUEY	f	You said there was only one person  you knew wasn't in on this thing.
GENE	m	Yeah.
HUEY	f	You're going to go see her.
GENE	m	What!?
HUEY	f	You sure she's asleep?
IRENE	f	I took up extra pillows. She take a  nap before her big speech.
GENE	m	What am I supposed to say to her?
HUEY	f	It'll come to you. See if you can  stop this thing 'fore it gets started.  Save us all considerable  embarrassment.
HUEY	f	Irene...?
GENE	m	Excuse me...
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Who the hell are you?
GENE	m	No, please.
GENE	m	Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt  you.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	My security people are right next  door.
GENE	m	I appreciate that.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	One loud scream will bring them in  here instantly. You won't get very  far. Think it over.
GENE	m	If I were here to hurt you I would  have done it already.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	That's...a comfort to hear.
GENE	m	I have a problem.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Ah.
GENE	m	Only you can help me. I'm also sorry  to say, my problem is your problem,  Mrs. Grant.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I remember you...in the elevator.
GENE	m	That's right.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	You were very nervous.
GENE	m	It was because I had this...in my  pocket
GENE	m	I need you to listen to me. Carefully.  Three lives depend on you listening  very carefully to what I have to  say.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Of course. But suppose we set up an  appointment. I have an important  speech to deliver and you're cutting  into my nap time.
GENE	m	Krista Brooks is dead.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	How do you know that?
GENE	m	I saw her die. She was shot. With  this gun.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	You shot her?
GENE	m	No.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Who did?
GENE	m	I don't know. The only thing I know  about him is that he works for your  husband.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	What?
GENE	m	And your husband works for somebody  else.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	What the hell are you saying?
HECTOR	m	He's gone.
HECTOR	m	Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long?  You need to eat more fiber.
GUSTINO 	m	You got anything to read?
GENE	m	I knew you wouldn't believe me.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I said I'd listen to you, not  necessarily believe you. You're  telling me my people are in a plot  against me. You're telling me my  husband wants me killed. What do you  expect?
GENE	m	I don't blame you. I don't have any  proof. But nothing like this occurs  in a vacuum. You can't be totally  oblivious. You must suspect something.  You're doing things which are making  people angry. People who have been  in power a long time are losing their  jobs. You know them better than me.  How much does it mean to them?  How  far would they go to hang onto it?
GENE	m	There's only one way to find out for  sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as  my last speech.
GENE	m	It's the last chance they have for  me to kill you. Try to get out of  it. They won't let you. They can't.  Try to change the schedule and you'll  know I'm right. What have you got to  lose? It comes down to who you trust,  them or me? Test them.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I love it when pistolero's talk of  trust.
GENE	m	This? I've never even fired one.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Indeed.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Franco! Franco.'
FRANCO	m	What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream,  Franco.
HUEY	f	Well?
GENE	m	I don't know.
HUEY	f	What are you going to do now?
GENE	m	I don't know. I have to get back.
HUEY	f	What are you going to do!?
GENE	m	This is about power and you haven't  got any. There's nothing more you  can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
OFFICER TRUST 	m	Where is he?
MR. SMITH	m	In the john.
OFFICER TRUST	m	Get moving.
MR. SMITH	m	You' oughta learn to relax. I told  you I've got it under control.
OFFICER TRUST	m	It's time. It's time now.
LYNN	f	Where are we going?
MS. JONES	f	Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at  all.
MR. SMITH	m	Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's  up!
MR. SMITH	m	You forgot to wash your hands.
MR. SMITH	m	I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I  know you're not just a regular guy,  see, I know that. Even if you don't  know it yourself. Maybe that's why I  picked you.
GENE	m	I know what I have to do. I'll do  it. Let's go.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Hey, El, how's the head?
MYSTERY MAN	m	Eleanor.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm  thinking of canceling the speech.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	It's an important speech.
MYSTERY MAN	m	I'd say critical, not that it's any  of my business.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	It's just another speech in a Tower  of Babel so high that Nimrod himself  would be put to shame. Cancel. Make  my apologies.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Excuse me.
MYSTERY MAN	m	I'll trot along. Nice to see you,  Eleanor.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	During a campaign every speech is  important. This is free media  exposure. Primetime news coverage  that we couldn't buy.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	What's he doing here?
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Who, him? Just visiting.
ELEANOR GRANT T	f	Hings have changed, Brendan. I thought  you understood that.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	He's my friend. And he did help you  to get elected, after all.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Don't remind me.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	What happened here?
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Nothing. I broke a lamp.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Eleanor, please. I'll put it this  way. This speech or a half-dozen  rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do  you say?
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Truth is, besides the headache I've  come down with a little lower  intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll  get you some Pepto, you'll make one  of your patented tributes to the  common person, then back to  Sacramento. This is no time to lay  down on the job. I don't care what  the polls say, you can't afford to  relax. Look what happened to Bush.  Tell you what, if you want to blow  off the Sacramento speech, fine. But  do this one and we'll get out of the  smog.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	All right, I'll do it.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	That's my girl.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	But I want to make some changes. Get  Krista in here right away won't you?
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	You sent my assistant on an errand.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	I've been a bad boy.
POLITICO	m	Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great  pleasure to introduce to you the  esteemed spouse of our Governor.  Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr.  Brendan Grant.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Ladies and gentlemen of the press,  campaign volunteers, and those of  you who were looking for any excuse  to take off work for the afternoon...
BRENDAN GRANT	m	We have with us today the first woman  Governor of our great state...
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What  can I say about her....that won't  get me in trouble when I get home  tonight.
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN	m	Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, are you  reading me?
BRENDAN GRANT	m	She's a woman who loves our great  state.
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN	m	Charlie... I can't get shit on this stupid radio.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	A brilliant legislator.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	...who will soon win her second term  as the greatest Governor California  has ever seen!
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN	m	Somebody's going to ave to run down  to the truck. Tell them this radio's  fucked.
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN	m	I can't get through. Walkie-Talkies  don't work from here. There's too  much concrete and stuff.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	Ladies and gentlemen...
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN	m	Nothin's getting out.
BRENDAN GRANT	m	I am honored to present to you our  esteemed Governor and my beloved  wife, Eleanor Samara Grant!
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Thank you! Thank you all!
GENE	m	Look out! Look out!
GENE	m	Look out!
BRENDAN GRANT	m	My God, he did it!
OFFICER TRUST	m	You little son of a bitch.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Are you all right, Franco?
FRANCO	m	I'd be better if they'd put sleeves  on these damn vests.
MS. JONES	f	It's time....You read me?  I don't  hear from you I'm going ahead now.
LYNN	f	Why do you keep looking at me?
MS. JONES	f	That's my job. I'm your babysitter.
LYNN	f	I'm not a baby.
MS. JONES	f	You're a big girl, huh?
LYNN	f	I'm not a big girl but I'm not a  baby.
MS. JONES	f	Close your eyes.
LYNN	f	Why?
MS. JONES	f	I've got something for you.
LYNN	f	A surprise?
MS. JONES	f	You ask too many questions. You want  the surprise or not?
HUEY	f	Good afternoon, madam. Hello there,  little girl.
MS. JONES	f	Hey, hey, what are you doing!?
HUEY	f	Just giving you the gift of a clean  windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
MS. JONES	f	I don't want my windshield cleaned.
HUEY	f	You just think you don't want your  windshield cleaned.
MS. JONES	f	No, I know I don't want it cleaned.  Get out of here.
HUEY	f	Don't be like that. Think of me as  the Moses of dirty windshields leading  you through the desert of dead bugs.
MS. JONES	f	For the last time, I don't want it  cleaned. Now get the hell out of  here!
HUEY	f	It's already done. I've already done  it. You have to pay me now.
MS. JONES	f	I don't have to pay you nothin'.
HUEY	f	You're going to deny me a lousy dollar  after I've sweated like a pig giving  you the gift of a clean windsheild?
MS. JONES	f	Fuckin' A.
HUEY	f	I don't think so.
MS. JONES	f	Hey!
HUEY	f	I think this is worth a dollar.
MS. JONES	f	Goddamnit! Gimme that!
HUEY	f	Oh, we'll have to do better than  that.
MS. JONES	f	You worthless piece of shit! Gimme  that!
MS. JONES	f	Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come  here!
HUEY	f	Gimme a dollar.
MS. JONES	f	Fuck you!
MS. JONES	f	Gimme that thing!
MS. JONES	f	Goddammit, give it to me, you  Sunnavabitch!
MR. SMITH	m	Daddy blew it.
MR. SMITH	m	Very good...Mr. Watson. I told  them...I could make a killer out of  you.
HUEY	f	There's nothing like a good wing- tip.
HUEY	f	What time is it?
GENE	m	Lost my watch.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Any comment at this time would be  most premature. Please, we'll have  something for you in a couple of  hours. Please...
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I...1 would like to...thank you,  Mister Wat... Gene.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	I would also like to apologize.
GENE	m	For what?
ELEANOR GRANT	f	For not believing you.
GENE	m	Believe me, I don't blame you. This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	You have a very brave father, Lynn.
LYNN	f	He's a hero.
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Yes, yes he is.
LYNN	f	Dads are like that.
GENE	m	Can we go now?
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Of course. I'll get a car to drive  you.
GENE	m	No, that's... That's OK. We don't  need any help. We'll be just fine.  Won't we, Lynn?
ELEANOR GRANT	f	Good luck.
GENE	m	Same to you.
GENE	m	Thanks for the shine.
HUEY	f	Thanks for the tip.
GENE	m	Come on, kid. I gotta make a phone  call.
HUEY	f	Kisses to you.
LYNN	f	No, kisses to you!
HUEY	f	No, kisses to you.
