BERT	m	What time is it?
CYBIL	f	Four. Why?
BERT	m	This milk is bad.
CYBIL	f	When did you buy it?
BERT	m	Tuesday? I don't know. What's today?
CYBIL	f	Monday. There's a deli on Broadway.
BERT	m	Nothing closer?
CYBIL	f	Nothing that's open.
BERT	m	Is it that bad?
CYBIL	f	I don't know. You're the one who  said it was bad.
WOLF	m	This is the worst fucking coffee  I've had in my life.
CYBIL	f	Then don't drink it.
GAFFER	m	What're we doing today?
WOLF	m	"Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks  to Mom."
AC	m	Any nudity?
CYBIL	f	Yeah, you have to take your fucking  pants off.
AC	m	I'll do it. I like Ellen.
GAFFER	m	Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse  in that Richard Gere movie.
BERT	m	I worked on that.
AC	m	The shower scene.
WOLF	m	Start with the 5K in the window. Run  feeders for three blonds into the  living room.
GAFFER	m	Two people. Sitting? Standing?
WOLF	m	Who fuckin' knows?
GAFFER	m	"Ellen talks to Mom."
JEFF	m	Tired?
NICOLE	f	No, I've been up since four. I've  got a big scene today and I'm kind  of nervous.
JEFF	m	"Ellen talks to Mom."
NICOLE	f	Have you read the script?
JEFF	m	No. It's on the callsheet.
NICOLE	f	Oh. Well, it's pretty emotional. I  tell my mother I never felt she really  loved me.
JEFF	m	You're going to yell at each other?
NICOLE	f	I don't know. I'm just going to go  with how I feel. Which is the scary  part. I'm very close to this  character.
JEFF	m	Problems with your own mom?
NICOLE	f	Yes. But she died before I, well  before we could reconcile...
JEFF	m	You were great in that Richard Gere  movie.
NICOLE	f	Thanks.
CORA	f	Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO  memory of this whatsoever.
NICOLE	f	Good morning, "Mom."
CORA	f	Morning.
NICOLE	f	Sleep well?
CORA	f	Not a wink.
NICK	m	Look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda.  I'm just saying we left last night  and I knew we didn't get that scene.
WANDA	f	I'm sorry, I thought it was a great  scene, Nick.
NICK	m	It was OK; and it's going to be  alright. But I'm not settling for OK  today. This is a big scene and I'm  not leaving till we get it.
WANDA	f	Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here  for you.
NICK	m	Alright, here's what I'm thinking.  Wolf, I want to do the whole scene  in one shot.
WOLF	m	It's been done.
NICK	m	I know that but I'd like to try it  anyway.
WOLF	m	Handheld.
NICK	m	No, dolly. We go from Close-up to  Wide-shot and back to Close-up in  the same shot.
WOLF	m	I'll use the 35, minimize distortion;  I'll light it all from the ceiling.  It could be kind of great.
WANDA	f	Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf?
WOLF	m	I'll need to see a couple run- throughs.
NICK	m	Not too many. It's a tough scene for  the actors. I want them to feel  relaxed, fresh...
WANDA	f	We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it  takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an  hour, 45?
WOLF	m	I don't know how you drink that shit  black, Nick. I got to dump in the  milk. It's the only way I can cut  the taste.
NICK	m	Jesus!
WOLF	m	What the fuck?!
WANDA	f	Flame on, asshole!!
WANDA	f	OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the  work. Lock it up. Going for picture.
NICK	m	OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing  fine. Remember, really listen and  really answer. I've got nothing to say to you. Just  let it happen. It's all there.
WANDA	f	Ready, Nick?
WOLF	m	Look at this a second, Nick.
WOLF	m	I pushed in a foot. She's incredible.  It's coming right through the lens.
NICK	m	That's great, man. Beautiful.
WANDA	f	Ready, Nick?
NICK	m	Let's go. Right away.
WANDA	f	And, roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	And, roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take one.
NICK	m	Action.
NICOLE	f	Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny.
CORA	f	Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever.
NICOLE	f	You were just standing there looking  at me. Then you pulled me up and  said, "You're not hurt." Like I was  disgusting for faking, for doing the  only thing I could think of to keep  him from hitting me again.
CORA	f	I was worried about Danny.
NICOLE	f	You do remember.
CORA	f	He was smaller than you.
NICOLE	f	You were so worried about Danny --
WOLF	m	Cut! Boom in. Sorry, I had to cut.  Les, your boom was all the way in  the shot.
BOOM	m	Well, where's the frame line?
WANDA	f	OK, can we get a frame line? Hold it  down. We're going again right away.  Nobody moves. Les, you got the frame  line?
BOOM	m	I guess so.
WANDA	f	OK, here we go. Right away. Picture's  up.
NICK	m	Beautiful; both of you. Stay focused.  Stay with it. No big deal. Let's go,  Wanda. Right away.
WANDA	f	Roll sound!
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take two.
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny.
CORA	f	Ellen, I --
AC	m	I'm sorry, I have to cut. I was  completely off on the focus. It's my  fault, I'm sorry.
WANDA	f	Thanks for the apology but you'll  never work in this town again.
AC	m	I've got it now.
WANDA	f	Here we go, right away. Lock it up.  And roll sound...
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll Camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take three.
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny.
CORA	f	Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever.
SOUND	m	Street noise!
WANDA	f	That's a cut! What the fuck's going on down there!?  You call that a lock-up!? Get that  car out of there!
NICK	m	Jesus Christ. Why doesn't the guy  just get a flatbed trailer with about  600 speakers on it and tow it behind  his car.
SOUND	m	And... it's clear.
WANDA	f	Do I have a lock-up?
WALKIE 	m	kkkkkssst... sttttss yes.
WANDA	f	Is that a real lock-up?
WALKIE 	m	ssssssssssssppppkkss.
WANDA	f	OK, right away. Picture's up. Roll  sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	And, roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take four.
NICK	m	Action.
NICOLE	f	Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny.
CORA	f	Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever.
NICOLE	f	You were just standing there looking  at me. Then you pulled --
WOLF	m	Boom's in.
NICK	m	Jesus Christ.
BOOM	m	Where?
WOLF	m	The whole left side of frame, Les.
WANDA	f	Alright, can we please get a  motherfucking frame line please?!
BOOM	m	The frame keeps changing.
WOLF	m	That's the idea, Les.
SOUND	m	May I make a suggestion? Is it  possible to maybe break the shot  down? Maybe two shots instead? Might  make it easier for Les.
NICK	m	No.
SOUND	m	Then I need ten minutes to switch to  radio mikes.
WANDA	f	Your call, Nick.
NICK	m	There won't be any other sound  problems?
SOUND	m	No more boom problems.
NICK	m	Switch to radios.
WANDA	f	That's a ten-minute break. Release  the lock-up. Stand by.
WOLF	m	Get me a coffee. Half milk.
NICK	m	I'm sorry about all this, Nicole.
NICOLE	f	It's not your fault, Nick. Is there  a way to use some of the earlier  takes?
NICK	m	Not unless I change the shot; do a  cutaway of Cora or something and  intercut the takes. I don't want to  do that. It's a really nice shot and  what you're doing is incredible.
NICOLE	f	Thanks, Nick.
NICK	m	The radio mikes are going to make  everything easier. So, look. Take a  moment. Let all this shit go. We  don't roll till you're ready.
NICOLE	f	OK.
SCRIPT 	m	How was she in that Richard Gere  movie?
CYBIL 	f	So-so.
SCRIPT	m	Her career really took off, didn't  it?
CYBIL	f	I saw her in a Michael Bolton video.
SCRIPT	m	She is nice; but I could do a better  job.
WANDA	f	Where's that flag going?
GAFFER	m	It's a scrim.
WANDA	f	Wolf!
WOLF	m	Two seconds, Wanda.
WANDA	f	No. No more tweaking. Picture's up. Lock it up!
WANDA	f	And, roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take five.
NICK	m	Action.
NICOLE	f	Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny.
CORA	f	Ellen, I have no memory --
CORA	f	Oh, God!
NICK	m	Jesus fucking Christ!
WOLF	m	Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug.  Right there by your foot.
WANDA	f	That's a cut. Anybody hurt? Cora,  are you alright?
WANDA	f	Props. Props! Let's get a broom up  here right away. Clear the set!
NICK	m	Well, let's see. What do you think  is going to happen next, Cora?
CORA	f	I'm going to have a heart attack!
NICK	m	No, you're not. You're going in there  in two minutes and we are really  going to nail this scene. I know it.  I have no doubt about it. Nicole...
WANDA 	f	Nick! Nick!
NICK	m	One second!
CORA	f	I'll tell you this much right now; I  am never, ever doing another fucking  low-budget movie.
NICK	m	What's up?
WANDA	f	Wolf and I were talking... Ellen's  losing it a little bit. You got three  quarters of the scene really, really  incredible in the first take. Do a  quick cut-away and all you need is a  pickup of the last part of the scene.
NICK	m	Wolf?
WOLF	m	You know how I feel; I love this  shot. Hell, I designed it.
NICK	m	Then let's just stick with the game  plan, OK? It's a simple shot. We're  going to get it this time, I feel  it.
WANDA	f	We're here for you, Nick. Whatever  it takes.
WANDA	f	Thanks.
WANDA	f	And, roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	And, roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take six.
NICK	m	Action.
NICOLE	f	Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny.
CORA	f	I...
NICK	m	Cut. That's OK, Cora. What's the  line? Just say it to me; no acting.
CORA	f	I...
AC	m	"Ellen, I have no memory of this  line whatsoever."
WANDA	f	OK, could we get the line please?!  Script!
SCRIPT	m	"Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever."
WANDA	f	Thank you. And, roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	And, roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take seven.
NICK	m	Action.
NICOLE	f	Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway --
CORA	f	I was worried about Danny!
NICOLE	f	I'm sorry, I'm lost...
NICK	m	Cut. It's OK. No big deal.
NICK	m	Everyone relax. We're just going to  run the lines. That's all. No acting.  Just run the lines. Then we're going  to shoot this fucking scene.
CORA	f	I'm so sorry. I'm fucking this up  for you.
NICOLE	f	Cora, don't even think that. You're  doing great. I'm the one who's fucking  it up. If I get through this I swear  I'm never acting again.
NICK	m	And, action on the run-through.
NICK 	m	And action on the run-through.
NICOLE	f	Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny.
CORA	f	Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever.
NICOLE	f	You were just standing there looking  at me.
NICK	m	Roll camera... roll camera.
NICK	m	Where's Wolf?
AC	m	In the bathroom... he doesn't feel  good.
NICK	m	Get him! Get him!
NICOLE	f	Then you pulled me up and said,  "You're not hurt." Like I was  disgusting for faking, for doing the  only thing I could think of to keep  him from hitting me again.
CORA	f	I was worried about Danny.
NICOLE	f	You do remember.
CORA	f	He was smaller than you.
NICOLE	f	You were so worried about Danny.  What about me, Mom? Why weren't you  worried about me?
NICK	m	Where the fuck is Wolf?!!!
WOLF	m	One second!
WANDA	f	OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the  milk downstairs. OK? It appears to  be bad.
NICK	m	I've had to, well I've changed the  shot; we're just a little pressed  for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen  for the last part of the scene,  starting with Cora's "I was worried  about Danny." OK? I'll find a way to  cut this into the fourth take. We  almost had it. That was unbelievable,  both of you. But let's not think  about it. That moment is gone, and...  we'll, we'll get another one. I have  no doubt about it. OK? Here we go.
WOLF	m	I'm ready, Nick.
NICK	m	Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	And, roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	And, roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, Pickup, take one.
NICK	m	Action.
CORA	f	I was worried about Danny.
NICOLE	f	You do remember.
CORA	f	He was smaller than you.
NICOLE	f	You were so worried about Danny.  What about me, Mom? Why weren't --
NICK	m	CUT!!!!
WANDA	f	What the fuck is that?! Sound?
SOUND	m	It's not me.
BOOM	m	It's the camera.
WOLF	m	The fuck it is. It's off; it's not  even running.
WANDA	f	What's going on down there?! Do I  have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't  hear a beeping sound? The street's quiet.
NICK	m	Then what the fuck is it!!?
AC	m	It's somebody's watch!
WOLF	m	Not mine.
WANDA	f	Not mine.
SOUND	m	Not mine.
BOOM	m	Not mine.
NICK	m	Where is it!! You motherfucker! You  cock-sucking motherfucking bastard!  Where the fuck are you!? Where!!  Where!!
NICK	m	Can someone help me please?! Do I  have to do everything myself here?!
NICK	m	Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn  your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you  finally going to pay attention here?!  Hey, focus puller, you want to make  a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got  some great fuckin' Thai Stick here!  Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing motherfucker! I saw your  reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell  would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda,  next time can you wear a shirt that's  a little more distracting to my  actors! Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make  a little more noise on the dolly you  creaky motherfucker! What is your name!? What do you  fucking do around here?! Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't  even find a teeny fucking beep?!
NICK	m	See what I have to put up with,  Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do  some of that magic on camera!? But  no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking  his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!"
NICK	m	God...
WOLF	m	Well, when did he ask you?
WANDA	f	Yesterday, when I was helping him  check into his hotel.
WOLF	m	What, the guy can't even check into  a hotel by himself?
WANDA	f	Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino  in this movie will benefit us all.  If being there when he checks into  his hotel makes him feel better,  then I'm happy to do it.
WOLF	m	Well, how did it come up?
WANDA	f	He asked me if I liked jazz, I said  yes, and he suggested we meet tonight  at a jazz club.
WOLF	m	I like jazz.
WANDA	f	He did not invite you.
WOLF	m	Why are you wearing perfume to work?
WANDA	f	Because I feel like it.
WOLF	m	You didn't wear it yesterday.
WANDA	f	Oh, stop it. You're acting like a  child.
WOLF	m	My eye!
WANDA	f	Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright?
WOLF	m	Do I look alright?!
WANDA	f	Let me see. Christ, we're going to  be late.
NICK	m	Should we call up to the room again?
JEFF	m	He said he'd be right down.
JEFF	m	Tired?
NICK	m	I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the  set all night. I was just trying to  do one shot and everything kept going  wrong.
JEFF	m	That's an anxiety dream. Are you  anxious about something?
NICK	m	I don't know. Sometimes I wonder  what the hell I'm doing in this  business. It's all just one compromise  and disappointment after another. I  don't know if I have the personality  for it.
JEFF	m	Sounds kind of like an identity  crisis.
NICK	m	Maybe you're right. Who am I? What  am I really capable of? Maybe I should  just get a job teaching at a women's  college somewhere.
JEFF	m	How'd you get into cinematography?
NICK	m	I'm not a cinematographer.
JEFF	m	You're not?
NICK	m	No. I'm directing this movie.
JEFF	m	How'd you get into directing?
PALOMINO	m	They're waiting downstairs.
WOMAN	f	Go ahead, I'll take a taxi.
PALOMINO	m	Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell  you, I had a lot of fun last night,  really, but for me, where I'm at  right now in my life, a relationship  is...
WOMAN	f	Chad; hold it. This was a one-time  deal. You know it, I know it. There  is no need for melodrama.
PALOMINO	m	I just thought you might...
WOMAN	f	Look, all I ask is that you don't  mention this to anyone.
PALOMINO	m	Hey, that's not my style.
WOMAN	f	Good.
PALOMINO	m	So, I'll see you on the set.
NICOLE	f	God damn it.
PALOMINO	m	I got two films coming up right after  yours, Nick. One I play a rapist  that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love  with. The other I'm kind of a sexy  serial killer who shacks up with  Winona Ryder.
NICK	m	That's great, man.
PALOMINO	m	Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess  twinkie shit, Nick.
NICK	m	Hostess twinkie?
PALOMINO	m	That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff,  man. These are the kind of movies I  want to do, right here.
NICK	m	I'm glad you feel that way, Chad.  And I just want to tell you, I'm  really happy we can work together.
PALOMINO	m	Hey, me too! You're a great director,  man. Your films are wacked! And I'm  gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a  hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick.  I'm gonna pick your brain.
NICK	m	Good. Then you can pick my nose.
PALOMINO	m	See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey,  what are we sitting here for?
NICK	m	We're waiting for Nicole.
PALOMINO	m	Nicole? She's takin' a tax --
NICK	m	What?
PALOMINO	m	Probably taking a shower or something.  Hey, how was her shower scene in  that Richard Gere movie?
NICK	m	Good.
JEFF	m	Really great.
GAFFER	m	I think we got nudity today.
AC	m	It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and  Damian kiss."
GAFFER	m	Could be a kiss with nudity.
AC	m	I like Ellen. She's my type.
GAFFER	m	Why is that?
AC	m	She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky.
GAFFER	m	Maybe I'll give her a part. That's  right; I'm makin' my own movie pretty  soon.
AC	m	Oh yeah?
GAFFER	m	Yup. Feature. I brought my script.
GAFFER	m	Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm  going to give it to him right during  lunch. Maybe right after.
AC	m	Alright.
GAFFER	m	Got to be aggressive. You want to  shoot it?
AC	m	Sure.
GAFFER	m	You ever shot anything?
AC	m	No.
GAFFER	m	That's alright; got to start  somewhere.
NICK	m	Jesus, what are you doing?
LORDE	m	Shrinking tissue. That's what this  stuff is for. Let that sit for two  minutes, pumpkin; I'll be right back.
NICK	m	How'd you get here?
NICOLE	f	Took a taxi.
NICK	m	Oh. We've been waiting in front of  your apartment for half an hour.
NICOLE	f	God, I'm sorry, Nick. Something came  up. I forgot to call. I'm sorry, I  feel like such an asshole.
NICK	m	You're just saying that because you  have Preparation H on your face.
NICOLE	f	I never should have gone out last  night. I hate jazz. God, I look  terrible.
NICK	m	No you don't.
NICOLE	f	Don't bullshit me, Nick.
NICK	m	I'm not. You really look beautiful.
PALOMINO	m	Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole?
NICOLE	f	I took a cab.
PALOMINO	m	Oh, cause we were wondering how you  got here.
NICK	m	Alright, good; everybody's here.  We'll do a run-through as soon as  you guys are ready.
PALOMINO	m	You got it, Chief.
WANDA	f	Hold it down, hold it down, people.  Actors working.
PALOMINO	m	Great shirt, Wanda.
WANDA	f	Why, thank you, Chad.
NICK	m	OK, let's work out the rest of this  blocking. Wolf -- What happened to your eye?
WOLF	m	A little accident.
NICK	m	You going to be alright?
WOLF	m	I think so.
PALOMINO	m	It looks good on you, man.
NICK	m	Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're  there by the chair. Camera is close  on Ellen: her first line.
NICOLE	f	I've always admired you from afar.
PALOMINO	m	Admired? That sounds rather  professional.
NICK	m	Good! "Professional," that's the  cue; Damian steps up to the bed.  Camera pulls back. The scene  continues.
NICOLE	f	Well, then: loved. How does that  sound?
PALOMINO	m	It sounds like the champagne talking.
NICOLE	f	I've loved you from the moment we  met.
PALOMINO	m	Why didn't you tell me?
NICOLE	f	We were working together. I didn't  want anything to interfere.
PALOMINO	m	God. And all this time I thought...
NICK	m	Then the kiss. How's that feel?
PALOMINO	m	Great.
NICK	m	Nicole?
NICOLE	f	Good.
NICK	m	Wolf, any thoughts?
WOLF	m	Nope.
PALOMINO	m	I've got a thought. What about Damian  having an eyepatch like Wolf's?
NICK	m	Let me think about that one, Chad.
PALOMINO	m	OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve,  Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take  One. Let's shoot it!
NICK	m	One second, Chad. You ready for one,  Wolf?
WOLF	m	Hell, I been ready.
PALOMINO	m	Alright, Wolfman.
NICK	m	Good. Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take one!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I've always admired you from afar.
PALOMINO	m	Admired? That sounds rather  professional.
NICOLE	f	Well, then: loved. How does that  sound?
PALOMINO	m	It sounds like the champagne talking.
NICOLE	f	I've loved you from the moment we  met.
PALOMINO	m	Why didn't you tell me?
NICOLE	f	We were working together. I didn't  want anything to interfere.
PALOMINO	m	God. And all this time I thought...
NICK	m	Cut. Very good.
WOLF	m	Not for camera. Chad was completely  out of frame.
NICK	m	Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy?  Forget your cue?
PALOMINO	m	Oh no, man. I held back. It really  felt like something Damian would do;  holding back to the last moment.
NICK	m	Oh, I see. How's that for you, Wolf?
WOLF	m	I don't care when he moves. Just  give me a fucking cue.
PALOMINO	m	The Lone Wolf!
NICK	m	What line did he move on?
SCRIPT	m	"Why didn't you tell me?"
NICK	m	Alright, "me" is the new cue. Nicole,  how does that feel to you?
NICOLE	f	Fine, if that's what Chad wants to  do.
PALOMINO	m	"Me, me, me," that's the cue. Let's  shoot; I'm stoked!
NICK	m	One second, Chad.
NICK	m	Chad, how would you describe this  scene, in one word?
PALOMINO	m	Great. It's a great scene, man.
NICK	m	No, I mean it's a love scene. Right?
PALOMINO	m	Definitely.
NICK	m	These two people really love each  other. And we want to see that,  especially in the kiss.
PALOMINO	m	Hey, say no more, Chief.
NICK	m	Nicole?
NICOLE	f	I understand, Chief.
NICK	m	Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take two!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I've always admired you from afar.
PALOMINO	m	Admired? That sounds rather  professional.
NICOLE	f	Well, then: loved. How does that  sound?
PALOMINO	m	It sounds like the champagne talking.
NICOLE	f	I've loved you from the moment we  met.
PALOMINO	m	Why didn't you tell me?
NICOLE	f	We were working together. I didn't  want anything to interfere.
PALOMINO	m	God. And all this time I thought...
NICK	m	And, cut. Very good. Wolf?
WOLF	m	Chad missed his cue again; the whole  dolly is unusable.
NICK	m	Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought  you were going to hold back till  "me"?
PALOMINO	m	The more I thought about it the more  it didn't seem right. And I'm  thinking, watch me here, instead of  coming around the bed, what if I  just slip here like this and do the  whole scene lying down?
NICK	m	I don't know, that seems a little...
PALOMINO	m	Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas  here. Trying to get the juices  flowing.
NICK	m	Nicole, how does that feel to you?
NICOLE	f	Well, I can turn to look at him. But  won't you be shooting the back of my  head?
WOLF	m	Plus Chad is completely out of the  light down there.
PALOMINO	m	Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my  face, man. It's about the acting;  that's all I care about.
WOLF	m	It's your call, Nick. His acting or  his face.
NICK	m	For some reason I was hoping we could  get both. I thought that's what we were trying  to do here.
WOLF	m	I'll have to set another light.
WANDA	f	We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I  think we can afford a few minutes to  set a light for Mr. Palomino.
NICK	m	Good, let's do it. Ellen, Damian;  let's talk for a second.
WANDA	f	We'll pause to set this light and go  again right away. How long, Wolf?
WANDA	f	Wolf?
NICK	m	OK, let's make sure we know what's  going on here. These two people have  loved each other for years, each of  them not knowing the other was in  love with them. And tonight, in this  little room it all comes out. It's  like a dam bursting. Does that make  sense? Nicole?
NICOLE	f	It makes perfect sense. I just haven't  found it yet. I'll get it though.
NICK	m	What about you, Chad?
PALOMINO	m	I'm there, man. I got the dam going,  the river, everything. You watch,  that little change in the blocking  is going to open the whole scene up  for me.
WANDA 	f	We're ready, Nick!
NICK	m	Good. Let's go.
WANDA	f	Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take three!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I've always admired you from afar.
PALOMINO	m	Admired? That sounds rather  professional.
NICOLE	f	Well, then: loved. How does that  sound?
PALOMINO	m	It sounds like the champagne talking.
NICOLE	f	I've loved you from the moment we  met.
PALOMINO	m	Why didn't you tell me?
NICOLE	f	We were working together -- I'm sorry,  can we cut, Nick?
NICK	m	Cut!
WANDA	f	That's a cut!
PALOMINO	m	Dammit! That was a good one!
NICOLE	f	I know, I'm sorry. But this feels  really awkward; turning all the way  around like this.
NICK	m	Yeah, I think the lying on the bed  is not quite working, Chad. Let's  try one with the original blocking.
PALOMINO	m	Which one was that? There's been so  many damn changes. Could somebody  help me out please?
SCRIPT	m	The cue for the original blocking is  "professional."
PALOMINO	m	Thank you. Thank you very much.
NICK	m	OK, right away. Call it, Wanda.
NICOLE	f	Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is  that alright?
NICK	m	Of course, Nicole; are you kidding?  Hold the roll, Wanda.
WANDA	f	Holding the roll!
PALOMINO	m	Someone over here smells very, very  nice.
NICK	m	Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	And roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take four!
PALOMINO	m	Nick, I just had a great idea!
WANDA	f	Hold the roll!
NICK	m	What is it, Chad?
PALOMINO	m	Just stop me if I'm out of line here,  but she says "admired from afar,"  right? Doesn't it make sense to see  Damian up close and her "afar?" You  start on a Close-up of Damian, watch  me here; as she declares her love,  the camera moves with me into this  primo two-shot that you and the  Wolfmeister have set up here.
NICK	m	What do you think, Wolf?
WOLF	m	I don't like it. This is Ellen's  scene.
NICK	m	I don't know; it sort of makes sense.
PALOMINO	m	Hey, you did it, man. It's all there  in the writing.
WOLF	m	I'd have to relight.
WANDA	f	We're still ahead of schedule, Nick;  if that means anything to you.
NICK	m	Let's do it.
WOLF	m	Get me a tweenie right here, with  diffusion.
WANDA	f	OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing  briefly to set one little light,  then we're going again, right away.  Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino.
GAFFER	m	I'll do it.
WOLF	m	Get the fucking light!
SCRIPT	m	Thanks.
PALOMINO	m	My pleasure. Sugar?
SCRIPT	m	Just a bit.
PALOMINO	m	You like jazz?
SCRIPT	m	Very much.
PALOMINO	m	Maybe we could go hear some tonight.
WANDA	f	It's going well I think. Don't you  think?
SCRIPT	m	Very well. What time do you think  we'll finish?
WANDA	f	Early I hope. I'm going to a jazz  club tonight.
SCRIPT	m	Really? So am I. He's wonderful,  isn't he?
WANDA	f	Chad?
SCRIPT	m	He's so natural, like... air.
SCRIPT	m	I wonder what his sign is. Do you  know, Nicole?
NICOLE	f	I don't know his sign, but I think  his moon is in Uranus.
SCRIPT	m	You don't have to be nasty.
PALOMINO	m	Yo, Wolfman. Is this my new mark?
WOLF	m	Until you change it. Where's my  fucking eyepatch?!
GAFFER	m	Hey, Chad.
PALOMINO	m	Hey, whatya say.
GAFFER	m	I'm Bob. I'm lighting this show.
PALOMINO	m	Chad Palomino; Actor.
GAFFER	m	I know.
PALOMINO	m	Hey, what's your name?
AC	m	Maurice.
PALOMINO	m	Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any  relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking  crew guys, really.
GAFFER	m	Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a  script.
PALOMINO	m	Oh, yeah?
PALOMINO	m	Hey, Bill. See that light over there?
GAFFER	m	Uh, yeah.
PALOMINO	m	Lower it about three feet.
NICK	m	Would you care to have a drink  tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you  say you and I have a drink tonight?
NICOLE	f	Oh, Nick! I'm sorry!
NICK	m	That's OK, no problem. I'm just  slapping a little water on my face.
NICK	m	So, it's going pretty good, huh?
NICOLE	f	Is it? Something feels off.
NICK	m	Yeah, you seem a little tense.
NICOLE	f	Do I?
NICK	m	But don't worry about it. Just take  your attention off yourself and put  it on Chad. Work off him a little  more.
NICOLE	f	OK, I'll try that.
NICK	m	And listen, I know he's no Olivier.  But he's got something, don't you  think? Kind of a natural presence.
NICOLE	f	Oh yes, he's very natural.
NICK	m	So Nicole... anything else I can  help you with?
NICOLE	f	Actually there is. Could you maybe  ask him to brush his teeth?
NICK	m	Oh, sure.
WOLF	m	My eye is killing me.
WANDA	f	Put your eyepatch on.
WOLF	m	I lost it.
WANDA	f	Is that little light set yet?
WOLF	m	That little light was set ten minutes  ago.
WANDA	f	Get me the A Team in here right away.  Nick, Nicole, and Mr. Palomino. Why didn't you tell me?
WOLF	m	Hey, you're not worried about the  time, I'm not worried about the time.
WANDA	f	Oh, I am very worried about the time!
WOLF	m	I know you are.
WANDA	f	What is that supposed to mean?
WOLF	m	What do you think it means?!
WANDA	f	I don't know what it means!
WOLF	m	Oh yes you do, you know exactly what  it means.
WANDA	f	I have no idea what you're talking  about! Why are you --
WOLF	m	You don't understand me, Wanda! You  have no idea --
WANDA	f	I don't understand you?!! All I do  is take care of you!!!
NICK	m	Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going  on here?! Jesus, Wanda. This is a  very intimate scene and a lot of  tension on the set doesn't help. OK?  Now, Wolf, let's just go through the  first part of the move. Damian, on  your new mark. Good. Close-up, Damian;  Ellen in the background.
NICK	m	Chad, what are you doing?
WOLF	m	Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.
PALOMINO	m	Wolf, could I borrow it? Cause I'm  telling you, Nick; it really feels  right. I feel like this guy now,  man.
NICK	m	I don't know, Chad. I don't think it  works.
PALOMINO	m	You're wrong, man. I'm going to fight  you on this one.
WOLF	m	Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and I  don't want anyone wearing it. It's  insanitary.
PALOMINO	m	Fine. I'll get my own. Nick, send  someone out for an eyepatch. I'll  fucking pay for it myself.
NICK	m	Listen, Chad. I didn't want to say  this in front of Wolf but it makes  you look a little... gay.
PALOMINO	m	Really?
NICK	m	Yeah, a little bit.
PALOMINO	m	Jesus.
PALOMINO	m	You're right. Thanks, buddy. Good  call.
WANDA	f	Are you ready, Nick?
NICK	m	One second. You need a rehearsal,  Wolf?
WOLF	m	Let's just fucking shoot it!!
PALOMINO	m	El Lobo!
NICK	m	Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take four!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I've always admired you from afar.
PALOMINO	m	Admired? That sounds rather  professional.
NICOLE	f	Well, then: loved. How does that  sound?
PALOMINO	m	It sounds like the champagne talking.
NICOLE	f	I've loved you from the moment we  met.
PALOMINO	m	Why didn't you tell me?
NICOLE	f	We were working together. I didn't  want anything to interfere -- God!
NICK	m	Cut!
WANDA	f	That's a cut. Hold the work, going  again, right away.
NICOLE	f	I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I  did that. I'm sorry.
PALOMINO	m	Nick, could I talk to you a second?
WANDA	f	A momentary delay. Everyone stand  by. We're going again, right away.
SOUND	m	Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low  on that take.
NICOLE	f	Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually  could I listen to the take before?
PALOMINO	m	I'm out of here, man!
NICK	m	What's the matter?!
PALOMINO	m	I like you, but I made a big mistake  taking this part. Have someone call  me a cab.
NICK	m	Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to  me. What's going on!?
PALOMINO	m	I can't act with this woman. I know  she's a friend of yours but I got to  tell you: she cannot act worth a  shit! I'm giving her everything! The  whole thing I just did with the hair;  did you see that? I came up with  that on my own because I thought it  would help her. But no, she's giving  me nothing! I'm out of here.
PALOMINO	m	God, and all this time I thought...
PALOMINO 	m	Why did you cast her? She sucked in  that Richard Gere movie!
NICK 	m	You're right. She is not the best  actress in the world. I see that now  but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm  asking you to please help me here.  We've got to get through this somehow.
PALOMINO	m	I'll tell you what this is about,  man. You know why she took a cab  this morning?
NICK	m	Something came up.
PALOMINO	m	No. She was in my hotel room and she  didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm  sorry it had to come out like this  but I told her this morning "thanks  a lot, it was a lot of fun last night  but let's get something straight --  it was just a one-time deal," and  she didn't want to hear that. She  wanted more, you see what I'm saying?  It's rejection.
NICK	m	Nicole, listen...
NICOLE	f	Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't  working. I apologize. Chad, I  apologize to you too. I'm completely  unfocused here and I think you're  absolutely right; what we need to do  is loosen the scene up somehow.
NICK	m	What would you like to do?
NICOLE	f	I was wondering if we could try  improvising the scene. More along  the lines of what Chad has been doing.  Maybe that would help me find  something.
NICK	m	That's a fantastic idea. What do you  think, Chad?
PALOMINO	m	Hey, that's the only way I can work.  Let's take it apart, let's cut loose.
NICK	m	Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why  not?!
PALOMINO	m	Roll that motherfucking camera,  Wolfie!
WOLF	m	Kiss my ass!
PALOMINO	m	Yeah! Let's go!
NICK	m	Alright, now we're making a fucking  movie! Call it, Wanda!
WANDA	f	Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take five!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I've always admired you from afar.
PALOMINO	m	Have you? That's, wow; that's  incredible. But that sounds kind of  professional doesn't it? Admired?
NICOLE	f	You're right. How does despised sound?
PALOMINO	m	Great! What's it mean?
NICOLE	f	It's sort of like I think you're a  piece of shit.
PALOMINO	m	That sounds like the champagne  talking.
NICOLE	f	It's not. I really do think you are  a piece of shit.
PALOMINO	m	No, you don't. You love me.
NICOLE	f	The fuck I do. I can't stand looking  at you!
PALOMINO	m	Then I guess I have nothing else to  say.
NICOLE	f	No, I think you have a lot more to  say, Damian.
PALOMINO	m	Well, I am surprised you feel this  way, Ellen. I always thought you  admired --
NICOLE	f	That's not what I meant. You should  tell everyone what you just told  Nick behind the set.
PALOMINO	m	Hey, this isn't part of the scene.
NICOLE	f	Say it anyway: The reason this scene  isn't working is because you and I  slept together last night. Did  everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad  last night!
PALOMINO	m	See, Nick! I told you this was about  rejection!
NICOLE	f	You fucking scumbag! You think I  give a rat's ass about you?! I was  there to get laid and even that was  a joke!
PALOMINO	m	You know, you are really starting to  piss me off!
NICOLE	f	Oh, does that mean you're not going  to come wiggle on the bed anymore,  or stroke my hair real soft and  concerned, or kiss me like a soap  opera acting piece of shit!
NICOLE	f	Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come  on!
NICK	m	OK, guys, I think we can stop there.
PALOMINO	m	You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda,  call me a cab!
NICK	m	Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to  calm down.
PALOMINO	m	Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This  movie is bullshit.
NICK	m	Now wait a second, Chad. There's no  reason for hostility.
PALOMINO	m	Shut up, you fucking loser. The only  reason I took this part was because  someone said you knew Quentin  Tarantino! You're nowhere, man.
NICK	m	Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of  your shit, you hostess twinkie  motherfucker!
PALOMINO	m	What'd you call me?
NICK	m	You heard me.
PALOMINO	m	Say it again.
NICK	m	You hostess twinkie motherfucker!
WANDA	f	Alright, everyone just stop. Stop!  Stop this right now!
WOLF	m	Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!
WANDA	f	Wolf!
NICOLE	f	Oh, God!
NICK	m	You want to pick my brain?! This is  the way I direct hostess twinkie  scumbags like you!
NICK	m	Get him out of here! Someone take  him back to his hotel!
SCRIPT	m	Chad...
NICK	m	Are you alright?
NICOLE	f	Don't touch me.
GAFFER	m	It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese  tidal wave hits New York. You've an  ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working  undercover. You save the city. You'd  be perfect for the lead. That's my  number; call me, or I'll call you.  Either way it's been great working  with you, man.
NICK	m	Nicole, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.  You were great in that Richard Gere  movie.
NICOLE	f	Shut up. You're no different than he  is. You lie, you're deceitful...
NICK	m	I'm not lying. Christ, I tell everyone  how great you are. I've got nothing  but respect and admiration for you.
NICOLE	f	Oh God, now you're doing your own  fucking script.
NICK	m	Well, why do you think I wrote it?!
NICOLE	f	I have no idea!
NICK	m	It's about you. It's about how I  feel about you.
NICOLE	f	Christ, did you get a bump on your  head, Nicky. 'Cause you're talking  like an idiot.
NICK	m	Nicole. I've loved you since the day  we met.
NICOLE	f	Why didn't you tell me?
NICK	m	I didn't want anything to get in the  way of us working together.
NICOLE	f	God, and all this time I thought...
NICOLE	f	Oh, God.
WANDA	f	Don't go out that door!
AC	m	Why not?
WANDA	f	It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now  go around.
AC	m	Next time. This is an emergency.
WANDA	f	Has Ellen showed up yet?
WALKIE	m	ssss... kkkkkrrk.
WANDA	f	Get her into wardrobe right away.
WALKIE	m	ssskk... ssssrrrk?
WANDA	f	No! Scene six; Scene five has been  postponed. I'm not going to say it  again; Mr. Palomino is not working  today. Now where is that smoke  machine!
AC	m	Oh. Sorry.
TITO	m	What do you want?!
AC	m	I need to use the bathroom. Kind of  an emergency.
TITO	m	Well, fucking knock!!
TITO	m	I swear to Christ, one of these days  I'm going to punch somebody in the  balls!
NICK	m	Just as we pull up to your apartment  Palomino suddenly says he feels so  sick he can't work today.
NICOLE	f	God. Was it something he ate?
SACHIKO	f	Stand up, please.
NICK	m	I don't know.
NICOLE	f	Can he work tomorrow?
SACHIKO	f	Turn around, please.
NICK	m	Don't know that either. But I'm not  worrying about it. I had this dream  last night where I was on the set.  You were in it, and another woman,  someone older. Anyway, everything  was going wrong. The harder I tried  to hold things together the more  they fell apart. And you know what  that dream was telling me, Nicole?  You just got to roll with it. And  that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling  with it. So, we'll just shoot the  Dream Sequence today.
NICK	m	Hey, Tito. You look great, man.
TITO	m	I feel like shit.
NICK	m	No, you look good. Thanks for coming  in on such short notice. This is  Nicole; she's playing Ellen.
NICOLE	f	Hello. Toto, is it?
TITO	m	Tito.
NICOLE	f	Oh, I'm sorry.
NICK	m	Listen, if there's anything I can do  to make you... if you need... uh,  just let me know.
TITO	m	Put a stool in the bathroom.
NICK	m	Did I just offend him?
NICOLE	f	What did you say?
NICK	m	"Short notice?"
NICOLE	f	Come on; that was nothing. I'm the  one who called him "Toto." Jesus,  I'm out of it. I dreamt I was on the  set last night too.
NICK	m	Oh yeah?
NICOLE	f	Yeah. You were in the dream.
NICK	m	Was I freaking out?
NICOLE	f	Actually, you were.
NICK	m	That's great: I freak out in my dream;  I freak out in your dream. No wonder  I'm fucking exhausted.
NICOLE	f	Nick...
NICK	m	Yeah?
WOLF	m	Alright, guys; special effects today.  Could be fun. Who knows how to work  this baby?
GAFFER	m	It's the old T-160. I used it once  in '85.
AC	m	Damn. '85.
WOLF	m	What's this?
GAFFER	m	That's where the gas goes.
BOOM	m	No, that's where the oil goes.
GAFFER	m	Is it?
BOOM	m	I think so.
GAFFER	m	You're right. It's coming back now.
WOLF	m	I'm going to let you handle this  one, Bob. This is your baby. And  Les, if he needs help you give him a  hand. OK, guys? We're all working  together today.
GAFFER	m	Yup, all coming back now. Like riding  a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160.
AC	m	Way to go, Bob.
NICK	m	How are we doing, Wanda?
WANDA	f	Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not  good. We need to finish this scene  and do Scene thirty-one today.
NICK	m	Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes  for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't  know we were --
WANDA	f	Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to  your apartment to pick them up. Now,  relax.
NICK	m	Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment  to pick them up; it's the red  notebook, under the bed.
WANDA	f	It's taken care of, Nick.
NICK	m	Good. Great. Good.
WOLF	m	We're all lit, the smoke machine is  under control; we're ready to go.
WANDA	f	What about the dolly?
WOLF	m	Just need to see a run-through and  we're all set. I'm going to make  your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful. Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume.  And don't worry about Palomino; I'll  take you to a jazz club tonight.
WANDA	f	Oh, I can't make it. I have to go  see Chad; he's extremely ill.
WOLF	m	Oh, by the way my eye's much better.
WANDA	f	Listen, Wolf, this may not be the  best time to say this but our  relationship is going nowhere.
WOLF	m	What do you mean?
WANDA	f	Please, don't take it personally.  Because I care for you, Wolf, I really  do. But I've had this feeling for  quite a while and I think it's time  we ended it. OK?
WANDA	f	I think it's better.
WOLF	m	So do I.
WANDA	f	Well, good. Still friends?
WOLF	m	Sure.
WANDA	f	Great, cause we still have to work  together and there's no reason it  has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug.
WANDA	f	You're a real special guy, Wolf.
WOLF	m	Thanks.
WANDA	f	OK, let's get the A Team in please!  Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito!
NICK	m	OK, here's the shot. We start wide  with Ellen standing absolutely still  right in the middle of the frame.  You got that, Wolf?
WOLF	m	Yeah.
NICK	m	What happened to your eye?
WOLF	m	Nothing. It's a little sensitive  today.
NICK	m	Can you see?
WOLF	m	Of course I can see!
NICK	m	OK, Ellen is standing there. The  smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's  line.
NICOLE	f	I am so hungry.
NICK	m	Good, Tito, that's your cue.
NICK	m	You walk around her once, hold the  apple out, that's right; just beyond  her reach. You're staring at her  hard. Harder, good. Then stop right  here. Can we get a mark, please?
NICK	m	Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up.  Alright, Wolf?
WANDA	f	It should be hand-held.
NICK	m	No, I think it's better on the dolly.
WOLF	m	Whatever.
NICOLE	f	Nick, do I see him?
NICK	m	No, just the apple. And Tito, right  after we dolly in give me a little  laugh there.
TITO	m	A little laugh?
NICK	m	Big, little; anything you feel like  doing. OK? Good. Let's shoot one.  Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	OK, here we go. Camera back to One.  Action on the smoke.
WANDA	f	And roll sound.
NICK	m	Hold it, Wanda. Can we get a little  more smoke? Is that possible?
GAFFER	m	Oh, sure.
NICK	m	Good. Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take one!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I am so hungry.
NICK	m	And... cut.
WANDA	f	That's a cut. Nick; comments?
NICK	m	Yeah, just a couple. I thought that  was uh... good. Tito, that was very  good, man, really. You didn't feel  like laughing?
TITO	m	I laughed.
NICK	m	Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You  could make it bigger if you want.  And Ellen, maybe just a little more  tension when you see him.
NICOLE	f	I thought I didn't see him.
NICK	m	Right, maybe you see him a little  bit.
NICOLE	f	Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him  or not?
NICK	m	You see him.
NICOLE	f	OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto?
TITO	m	It's Tito.
NICOLE	f	What did I say?
TITO	m	Toto.
NICOLE	f	Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't  know why I'm doing that. I'm really  sorry.
NICK	m	Ellen, come on now; concentrate.  Remember; you're marrying Damian  tomorrow. You're a little anxious.  You have this dream. Let's call it  an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents  the anxiety.
NICK	m	OK? It seems pretty simple.
NICOLE	f	Let's just try it.
NICK	m	Good. And Bob, let's really have  some smoke on this one.
GAFFER	m	OK, more smoke.
WOLF	m	I still think it should be hand-held.
NICK	m	Yeah, well, I don't want it hand- held. I want it on the dolly. Where's  my notebook, Wanda?
WANDA	f	On it's way, Nick.
NICK	m	Good. Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	Lock it up. Going for picture. And  roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take two!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I am so hungry.
NICK	m	Cut.
WANDA	f	That's a cut. Going again, Nick?
NICK	m	Yes.
WANDA	f	Going again, please stand by.
NICK	m	OK, Ellen, good. You're on to  something there.
NICOLE	f	No, something's not right. It all  feels fake to me.
NICK	m	Well, it's not fake; it's real. Just  remember, you really want the apple.  Tito, I still think we could see  more of a laugh at the end.
TITO	m	What kind of laugh?
NICK	m	Just a laugh.
TITO	m	Show me.
NICK	m	Oh, OK. A laugh. I'm thinking maybe  like this. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
NICK	m	Something like that. OK? And remember,  Tito, this is a dream. Not everything  has to make sense. A laugh right  there heightens our sense of... of...
TITO	m	Anxiety.
NICK	m	Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you?
WOLF	m	I still think it should be hand-held.
NICK	m	Well, God damn it! It's not going to  be! It's on the dolly so just forget  about it!
NICK	m	And Bob, what the fuck is that smoke?  Might as well get a couple hamsters  in here blowing smoke rings for  Christ's sake.
GAFFER	m	The septic valve wasn't open. I got  it now. We're going to see some smoke  now.
NICK	m	Alright, let's try another take.
WANDA	f	And, lock it up.
WOLF	m	Nick, could I talk to you for a  minute?
NICK	m	What?!
WOLF	m	In private.
NICK	m	Alright.
WANDA	f	Release the lock-up. Everyone stand  by.
GAFFER	m	We'll see some smoke now.
AC	m	Way to go, Bob.
WOLF	m	I really don't like being spoken to  like that, Nick!
NICK	m	Yeah, well I don't like your attitude!
WOLF	m	I don't have an attitude!
NICK	m	The hell you don't! Every time I ask  you to do something all I get is No,  No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired  you to do a job; if you're not going  to do it you better let me know right  now!
WOLF	m	I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through  some heavy shit.
NICK	m	What do you mean?
WOLF	m	I can't really go into it. It's pretty  heavy.
NICK	m	Personal?
WOLF	m	Personal, professional, emotional.  It's doing a number on me. And now  you're telling me you're going to  fire me.
NICK	m	I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on,  I'm not going to fire you. You're  doing a great job here.
WOLF	m	Am I?
NICK	m	Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without  you, man. You've got a great eye. I  just hope it's not the one under  that eyepatch.
NICK	m	Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one  thing I've learned; sometimes you  just have to roll with things. You  know?
WOLF	m	You're right.
NICK	m	Roll with it, man. You'll be OK.
WOLF	m	Thanks, bro.
BOOM	m	That's where the oil goes.
GAFFER	m	No, that's where the gas goes.
BOOM	m	I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where  the oil goes.
SOUND	m	Lester, don't you think Bob knows  where the oil goes?!
GAFFER	m	I don't remember using oil in '85.
AC	m	Maybe both the oil and gas go in  there?
BOOM	m	I think he's right.
GAFFER	m	I think he is too. OK, three parts  gas, one part oil.
NICK	m	Is my notebook here yet, Wanda?
WANDA	f	Any minute, Nick.
NICK	m	Good. Call it, Wanda.
WANDA	f	Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take three!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I am so hungry.
NICK	m	Cut! Cut! Cut!
WANDA	f	Turn it off! Turn it off!
GAFFER	m	I can't find the switch!
WOLF	m	Pull the plug! Bob! Pull the plug!
WANDA	f	Open the door! Get some water!
GAFFER	m	I got it! I got it!
WANDA	f	Clear the set! Ellen! Tito! Please  step off the set!
TITO 	m	I'm off the set!
NICOLE 	f	So am I.
WANDA	f	Then who is that? Who is that? Please  step off the set!
CORA	f	Hi, Nicky.
NICK	m	Mom!
WANDA	f	Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat,  blue slippers. How do I know? Because  she's sitting ten feet away from me.  Well sweetheart, that's going to be  a real fucking problem.
JEFF	m	She was waiting outside Nick's  apartment when I went to pick up his  notebook. She said she was looking  for him so I figured I should just  bring her up here. You look really  pretty in that dress.
NICK	m	How did you get here?
CORA	f	I took a bus in; went right to your  apartment.
NICK	m	How did you get out of your room?
CORA	f	Oh, I just went right through the  door.
NICK	m	It was unlocked!?
CORA	f	No, it was locked. I just went through  it. It's something I've learned to  do, Nicky. I can walk through just  about anything; like air.
NICK	m	Mom, you've got to stop doing this.  I'm serious. I'm a little upset with  you. You could have gotten lost, or  hurt.
CORA	f	I wanted to see you. I've missed  you.
NICK	m	I know, Mom; I've missed you too.  But it's not really a good time.
NICOLE	f	They're sending a car. It should be  here in a couple of hours. They didn't  even know she was gone.
NICK	m	Jesus, I don't believe this.
CORA	f	I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was  going to be a wedding I would have  worn my fucking hat.
NICK	m	There. How's that, Mom? Can you see?
CORA	f	Is the little fellow going to do  gymnastics?
NICK	m	Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've  got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet.
WANDA	f	How are you doing?
WOLF	m	Good; real good.
NICK	m	How's the smoke machine?
WANDA	f	It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out  to every Effects house in the city  but I just can't seem to locate --
NICK	m	Forget it. We'll shoot without it.
WANDA	f	But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence.
NICK	m	That's the way it goes, Wanda. We're  just going to have to roll with it.  Nothing else we can do. We've got to  roll with it, right, Wolf?
NICK	m	OK, here we go. Ellen, you've got to  keep reaching for that apple. I don't  feel that you really want it. I mean,  Christ, how many times do I have to  tell you!
WANDA	f	Everyone stand by. Nobody move. Going  again, right away.
NICK	m	Alright, Nicole. What's the matter?
NICOLE	f	You tell me! You're the one with the  bug up your ass!
NICK	m	Now wait just a second!
NICOLE	f	You've been picking on me all day! I  can't do anything right!
NICK	m	I'm sorry if I was short with you,  Nicole, but I think you can see I'm  under a little pressure here. I'm  shooting a Dream Sequence without a  smoke machine, my mother's out there  thinking she's at a circus wedding  and you tell me the whole movie seems  fake!
NICOLE	f	I never said that!
NICK	m	You did too. You said, "Everything  feels fake."
NICOLE	f	I meant me! I feel fake! Everything  I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I  should just do shower scenes in  Richard Gere movies for the rest of  my life!
NICK	m	Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a  fantastic actress. All you have to  do is show me you want that apple  more than anything else in the world;  don't give up. Understand? You cannot  give up.
NICOLE	f	OK.
WANDA	f	Ready, Nick?!
NICK	m	Ready!
NICK	m	OK, here we go. Everybody focus,  concentrate. And Tito, we're still  looking for that little laugh, pal.  OK? Call it, Wanda!
WANDA	f	Picture's up. There will be no smoke  in this scene. No smoke. No smoke in  the Dream Sequence. And roll sound.
SOUND	m	Speed!
WANDA	f	Roll camera!
AC	m	Rolling!
CLAPPER	m	Scene six, take four!
NICK	m	And, action.
NICOLE	f	I am so hungry.
CORA	f	Oh, I thought this was the TV room.
NICK	m	Cut!
WANDA	f	That's a cut. Going again, right  away.
NICK	m	Mom, listen to me. I don't want you  to move from this chair. Do you  understand?
CORA	f	Oh Jesus, you sound just like your  father...
NICK	m	Mom, I'm serious.
CORA	f	OK, OK. I won't move.
NICK	m	Thank you.
NICK	m	OK, good. Very good. Tito, I think we're having a little  communication problem here. All I  want you to do is laugh. OK?
TITO	m	Why?
NICK	m	I told you why.
TITO	m	Tell me again.
NICK	m	Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal.  It's a dream, alright. Strange things  happen in a dream. All you have to  do is laugh. Why is that such a  problem?
TITO	m	Why does it have to be a dwarf?
NICK	m	What?
TITO	m	Why does my character have to be a  dwarf?
NICK	m	He doesn't have to be a dwarf.
TITO	m	Then why is he?! Is that the only  way you can make this a dream; put a  dwarf in it?
NICK	m	No, Tito; that's not --
TITO	m	Have you ever had a dream with a  dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone  who's had a dream with a dwarf in  it? NO! I don't even have dreams  with dwarves in them! The only place  I've seen dwarves in dreams is in  stupid movies like this! Make it  weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone  will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a  dream, there's a fucking dwarf in  it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can  take this Dream Sequence and shove  it up your ass!
WANDA	f	Nick? I can get right on the phone. We'll  try to get another... small person  here as soon as possible.
NICK	m	No. He's absolutely right.
WOLF	m	You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick?  She could be in the dream by herself.
NICK	m	No. We're not going to shoot anything.  I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help,  but it's over. I can't take it  anymore. I tried to roll with it but  it's time to face the music; I can't  do this. I am not a director. The  shoot is over. I give up.
WOLF	m	Take the camera off the dolly. Start  putting it away.
CORA	f	Give me that apple!
CORA	f	I'm ready, Nick!
NICK	m	Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go.  Right away.
NICOLE	f	I am so hungry.
NICK	m	And cut!!
NICK	m	Wolf, talk to me, man! Did you get  it?
WOLF	m	Got it, Nick! Everything!
NICK	m	The Close-up?
WOLF	m	Perfect. See? That's what I meant  about going hand-held!
NICK	m	You're a genius, man! What about the  focus?!
AC	m	Nailed it.
WOLF	m	Fuckin' A!
WANDA	f	Going again, Nick?
NICK	m	How was the sound?
SOUND	m	I could use another but definitely  acceptable.
NICK	m	Mom, you kook! That was incredible!  Did you know we were filming?
CORA	f	Of course I knew you were filming.
NICK	m	You were great, you're a natural.  And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't  you dare tell me that felt fake.
WANDA	f	Going again, Nick?
NICK	m	Oh, hold on. Let me think a second.
NICK	m	Can I use it for the Dream Sequence,  that's the question. Does it work  for the Dream Sequence?
NICK	m	We're going with it, Wanda!
WANDA	f	Alright everyone, listen up. That is  a wrap on Scene Six.
SOUND	m	Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
WANDA	f	What?!
SOUND	m	I need to record room tone. I'll  need thirty seconds of silence.
WANDA	f	Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!!  Thirty seconds of room tone. The  sooner you're quiet the sooner we're  done.
CORA	f	What's room tone?
NICK	m	It's for the sound, Mom. We just  have to be quiet.
WANDA	f	And roll sound. Nobody move.
SOUND	m	Speed.
CHAD	m	We have a new category this year:  Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being.  And the winner is none other than my  Best Bud, Nick Reve!
MAN	m	Had any experience?
NICOLE	f	I was an actress for a while.
MAN	m	Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger?
NICOLE	f	Probably.
WANDA	f	Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me!  I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me  one more chance. Let me prove it! I  love you! I love you, Wolf!
WANDA	f	What I love about you, Chad, is you're  not afraid of my power.
CHAD	m	Oh God, Wanda! I love your power.  It's like an afferdesiac to me!
NICK	m	In closing I'd like to say to all  the people who told me not to make  this movie, who wouldn't meet with  me or return a simple phone call. To  my favorite professor at Film School  whose parting advice to me was to  take a job teaching at a women's  college. To Delores DelSporto, the  girl I loved in high school who left  me for a Jr. Varsity football player:  to all these people I'd like to say  thank you but I can't because what I  really feel like saying is go fu --
SOUND	m	And, that's a cut on room tone.
WANDA	f	OK, strike the set. Props! Art  Department! Redress for Scene thirty- one. Let's go! Right away people!  Nick! Nick! Anyone seen Nick?!
