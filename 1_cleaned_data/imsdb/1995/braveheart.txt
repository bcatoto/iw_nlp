FATHER	m	Told ya to stay. 
WILLIAM	m	I finished my chores. Where we goin'? 
FATHER	m	MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit  when the truce was over. 
FATHER	m	Stay here. 
FATHER	m	MacAndrews!... MacAndrews!? 
FATHER	m	MacAndrews. 
JOHN	m	William! Get out of here! 
WILLIAM	m	Why would MacAndrews make so many  scarecrows? 
WILLIAM	m	R -- real!!!... Ahhhhhgggg!... 
FATHER	m	William! William! 
FATHER	m	Murderin' English bastards. 
GHOUL	m	Will--iam...! 
CAMPBELL	m	Wallace is right! We fight 'em! 
MACCLANNOUGH	?	Every nobleman who had any will to  fight was at that meeting. 
MALCOLM WALLACE	m	So it's up to us! We show them we  won't lie down to be their slaves! 
MACCLANNOUGH	?	We can't beat an army, not with the  fifty farmers we can raise! 
MALCOLM WALLACE	m	We don't have to beat 'em, just fight  'em. To show 'em we're not dogs, but  men. 
MALCOLM WALLACE	m	They have a camp here. We attack  them at sunset tomorrow. Give us all  night to run home. 
MALCOLM	m	William, you're staying here. 
WILLIAM	m	I can fight. 
MALCOLM	m	Aye. But it's our wits that make us  men. I love ya, boy. You stay. 
WILLIAM	m	They're coming! 
HAMISH	m	How many? 
WILLIAM	m	Three, maybe more! 
HAMISH	m	Armed? 
WILLIAM	m	They're English soldiers, ain't they? 
HAMISH	m	With your father and brother gone,  they'll kill us and burn the farm! 
WILLIAM	m	It's up to us, Hamish! 
WILLIAM	m	Not yet! Here he comes, be ready! 
HAMISH	m	Wanna stay with me tonight? 
WILLIAM	m	I wanna have supper waitin'. 
HAMISH	m	We'll get those English pigs tomorrow. 
WILLIAM	m	Aye, we'll get 'em. 
CAMPBELL	m	William... Come down here, lad. 
PRIEST	m	...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen. 
PRIEST	m	You must be the relative of the  deceased... William, this is your  Uncle Argyle. 
ARGYLE	m	You were wise to hurry. 
LEADER	m	Someone dead from this household? 
ARGYLE	m	We just had a funeral, isn't that  what it means in England as well? 
LEADER	m	What it means in England -- and in  Scotland too -- is that rebels have  forfeited their lands. We were  ambushed last night. But the Scots  dragged their dead away. 
ARGYLE	m	My brother and nephew perished two  days ago, when their hay cart turned  over. 
LEADER	m	Then we'll just have a peek at the  wounds. Dig 'em up! 
ARGYLE	m	They've been sanctified and buried  in the holy rites of God's church,  and any hand that disturbs them now  takes on eternal damnation. So please --  do it. 
ARGYLE	m	Funeral's over. Go home. 
ARGYLE	m	Not that spoon, that one's for soup.  Dip away from you. And don't slurp. 
ARGYLE	m	We'll sleep here tonight. You'll  come home with me. We'll let the  house, and the lands too; plenty of  willing neighbors. 
WILLIAM	m	I don't want to leave. 
ARGYLE	m	Didn't want your father to die either,  did ya? But it happened. 
ARGYLE	m	Did the priest say anything about  the Resurrection? Or was it all about  Judgment? 
WILLIAM	m	It was in Latin, sir. 
ARGYLE	m	Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak  Latin? We have to fix that, won't  we? Did he give the poetic benediction?  The Lord bless thee and keep thee?  Patris Benefactum et -- ...It was Malcolm's favorite. 
WILLIAM	m	Good night, Uncle. 
ARGYLE	m	"The Lord bless thee and keep thee..." 
WILLIAM	m	What are they doing? 
ARGYLE	m	Saying goodbye in their own way --  in outlawed tartans, with outlawed  pipes, playing outlawed tunes. 
ARGYLE	m	Your Daddy and I, we saw our own  father buried like this, dead from  fighting the English. 
ARGYLE	m	First learn to use this. 
ARGYLE	m	Then I will teach you to use this. 
LONGSHANKS	m	Scotland! Scot-land! 
LONGSHANKS	m	The French will grovel to anyone  with strength! But how will they  credit our strength when we cannot  rule the whole of our own island?! 
LONGSHANKS	m	Where is my son? 
PRINCESS	f	Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to  come in his stead. 
LONGSHANKS	m	I sent for him -- and the little  coward send you?! 
PRINCESS	f	Shall I leave, M'lord? 
LONGSHANKS	m	If he wants his queen to rule, then  you stay and learn how! I will deal  with him. 
LONGSHANKS	m	Nobles are the key to the Scottish  door. Grant their nobles land here  in England. Give our own nobles  estates in the north. Make them too  greedy to oppose us. 
OLD ADVISOR	m	Sire... Our nobles will be reluctant  to relocate. New lands mean new taxes,  and they are taxed already for our  war in France. 
LONGSHANKS	m	Perhaps it's time to reinstitute an  old custom. Grant them prima noctes,  "First night." When any common girl  inhabiting their lands is married,  our lords shall have sexual rights  to her on the night of her wedding.  That should fetch just the kind of  lords we want in Scotland. 
EDWARD	m	What is it?! 
PRINCESS	f	You directed me to report to you the  moment the king's conference was  ended. 
EDWARD	m	So I did! And what was so important  about it? 
PRINCESS	f	Scotland. He intends -- 
PRINCESS	f	He intends to grant -- 
EDWARD	m	Shut up, would you! How can I  concentrate?! 
PRINCESS	f	...His majesty was quite keen that  you should understand -- 
EDWARD	m	All so very boring! He wants me to  learn to fight too, so let me do it! 
EDWARD	m	Stop there. 
EDWARD	m	Do you disapprove of Phillip? 
PRINCESS	f	No, M'lord. 
EDWARD	m	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME! 
EDWARD	m	Now, my flower, do you understand? 
PRINCESS	f	Yes. I had thought that... I was  loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I  may be excused, M'lord. 
EDWARD	m	You may. 
EDWARD	m	Don't worry, m'Lady, it is my royal  responsibility to breed. And I assure  you, when the time comes, I shall...  manage. 
CRAIG	m	Young Robert, we are honored -- 
ROBERT	m	My father hears that Longshanks has  granted prima noctes. 
CRAIG	m	Clearly meant to draw more of his  supporters here. 
MORNAY	m	The Balliol clan has endorsed the  right, licking Longshanks' boots so  he will support their claim to the  throne. If we make a show of  opposition, the commoners will favor  us. 
ROBERT	m	It is too soon to step out alone. My  father believes we must lull  Longshanks into confidence, by neither  supporting his decree nor opposing  it. 
CRAIG	m	A wise plan. And how is your father?  We have missed him at the council. 
ROBERT	m	He strained his leg so that it pains  him to ride. But he sends his  greetings -- and says that I speak  for all the Bruces. And for Scotland. 
SOLDIER	m	Hey boy! You hunt this bird? 
SOLDIER	m	It's against the law for Scots to  own bows. You shot this bird? 
WILLIAM	m	I hit it in the head. With a rock. 
WILLIAM	m	Miz MacDougal. You look well. 
FARM WOMAN	f	...William? It's William Wallace,  back home! -- Have you met my  daughter? 
WILLIAM	m	Hamish? 
HAMISH	m	Test of manhood. 
WILLIAM	m	You win. 
HAMISH	m	Call it a test of soldiery, then.  The English won't let us train with  weapons, so we train with stones. 
WILLIAM	m	The test of a soldier is not in his  arm. It's here. 
HAMISH	m	No. It's here. 
WILLIAM	m	A contest, then. 
WILLIAM	m	I still say this is no test. A  catapult can throw a stone farther  than a man can. 
HAMISH	m	That depends on the man. 
WILLIAM	m	Can you do it when it matters? As it  matters in battle? Could you crush a  man with that throw? 
HAMISH	m	I could crush you like a roach. 
WILLIAM	m	Then do it. Come, do it. 
HAMISH	m	You'll move 
WILLIAM	m	I will not. 
FARMER STEWART	m	That's not fair! 
CAMPBELL	m	He's tired, he should get a longer  run. 
CAMPBELL	m	Brave show! 
HAMISH	m	I threw longer than last time! 
CAMPBELL	m	An ox is strong, but not clever. 
HAMISH	m	An ox is stupid enough to just stand  in one place. 
WILLIAM	m	That's not the point. 
WILLIAM	m	That is. 
CAMPBELL	m	A fine display, young Wallace! 
WILLIAM	m	Good to see you again. 
HAMISH	m	I should'a remembered the eggs. 
WILLIAM	m	Would you honor me with a dance? 
GIRL	f	You've taken over your father's farm? They say he died long ago. Fighting  the English. 
WILLIAM	m	He died in an accident, with my  brother. Their cart turned over. 
NOBLEMAN	m	I have come to claim the right of  prima noctes. As the lord of these  lands, I will bless this marriage by  taking the bride into my bed on the  first night of her union. 
STEWART	m	No, by God! 
NOBLEMAN	m	It is my noble right. 
WILLIAM	m	Good evening, sir. May I speak with  your daughter? 
WILLIAM	m	Marion... Would you like to go for a  ride on this fine evening? 
MOTHER	f	The boy's insane! 
WILLIAM	m	It's good Scottish weather, Madam,  the rain is fallin' straight down. 
MOTHER	f	She absolutely may not, she'll --  Marion! 
WILLIAM	m	Your father doesn't like me, does  he? 
MARION	f	It's not you. He dislikes that you're  a Wallace. He just says... the  Wallaces don't seem to live for very  long. 
WILLIAM	m	Thank you for accepting. 
MARION	f	Thank you for inviting. 
WILLIAM	m	I'll invite you again, but your mother  thinks I'm crazy. 
MARION	f	You are. And I'll come again. 
MOTHER	f	Marion, come in! 
MOTHER	f	Marion, come in! 
MACCLANNOUGH	?	Young Wallace -- 
WILLIAM	m	Sir, I know it was strange of me to  invite Marion to ride last night. I  assure you, I -- 
CAMPBELL	m	MacClannough's daughter is another  matter. We come to fetch you to a  meeting. 
WILLIAM	m	What kind of meeting? 
CAMPBELL	m	The secret kind. 
CAMPBELL	m	Your father was a fighter. And a  patriot. 
WILLIAM	m	I know who my father was. I came  back home to raise crops. And, God  willing, a family. If I can live in  peace, I will. 
MACCLANNOUGH	?	If you can keep your intention to  stay out of the troubles, you may  court my daughter. If you break your  intention, I'll kill you. 
MARION	f	You've been here before? 
WILLIAM	m	Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly  dreams I don't want. I started riding  at night to fill up my mind so that  when I did sleep I'd dream only of  the ride and the adventure. 
MARION	f	Did it work? 
WILLIAM	m	No. You don't choose your dreams.  Your dreams choose you. 
WILLIAM	m	I want... to marry you! 
MARION	f	I... accept your proposal! 
WILLIAM	m	I'm not just saying it! 
MARION	f	Nor I! 
WILLIAM	m	But I won't give you up to any  nobleman. 
MARION	f	You scare me. 
WILLIAM	m	I don't want to scare you. I want to  be yours, and you mine. Every night  like this one. 
MARION	f	This night is too beautiful to have  again. 
WILLIAM	m	I will be with you, like this.  Forever. 
PRIEST	m	You have come to pledge, each to the  other, before Almighty God. 
WILLIAM	m	I will love you my whole life. You  and no other. 
MARION	f	And I you. You and no other. Forever. 
PRIEST	m	Agus bhayd lauch... The Lord bless  and keep thy love, now and forever. 
PRIEST	m	I trust him -- or I'd'a killed him  me'self. A weddin' needs pipes. 
WILLIAM	m	I've missed you. 
MARION	f	Shush. It's only been a day. And it's seemed like forever. 
WILLIAM	m	Tonight then. 
MARION	f	My parents are growing suspicious! I  can't keep meeting you every night! 
WILLIAM	m	Then when? 
MARION	f	...Tonight! 
SOLDIER	m	Where are you going... lass? 
MARION	f	Let go. 
SOLDIER #2	m	Why don't you marry my friend here?  Then I'll take the first night! 
SOLDIER #1	m	Bitch, who do you think you are? 
MARION	f	William! 
MARKET WOMEN	f	Wallace Wallace! William Wallace! 
FALLEN SOLDIER	m	Rebels! Help! 
VILLAGE FOLKS	m	Run, William! Run! 
MAGISTRATE	m	What happened? 
SOLDIER	m	...girl. 
MAGISTRATE	m	What girl?! 
SOLDIER	m	...on horse. 
MAGISTRATE	m	The girl on the horse! Stop her! 
MAGISTRATE	m	So this is the little whore he was  fighting for. 
WILLIAM	m	Marion! 
MAGISTRATE	m	One Scot buggers six of us? Hell to  pay when that gets round. 
CORPORAL	m	Burn the village. 
MAGISTRATE	m	But he is free. You never catch 'em  in the Highlands. 
CORPORAL	m	Clans weave that cloth in their own  patterns. 
MAGISTRATE	m	So why is this strip concealed? He fought for you, eh? 
MAGISTRATE	m	An assault on the king's soldiers is  the same as assaulting the king! 
MAGISTRATE	m	Now. Let this scrapper come to me. 
MAGISTRATE	m	Don't look surprised! We knew he'd  bring friends! 
MAGISTRATE	m	No! I beg you... mercy! 
MAGISTRATE	m	Please. Mercy! 
CAMPBELL	m	Say Grace to God, lads. We've just  seen the coming of the Messiah. 
CROWD	m	AHHHHHHH-UHHHHHH! AHHHHHH-UHHHHHH! 
CAMPBELL	m	Pour it straight into the wound. I  know it seems a waste of good whiskey,  but indulge me. 
CAMPBELL	m	Ah. Now that'll clear your sinuses,  lads. 
CAMPBELL	m	Well bloody Hell, look at this! Now  it's nothing but a fly swatter. 
CAMPBELL	m	MacGregor -- from the next valley! 
MACGREGOR	m	We heard about what was happenin'.  And we don't want ya thinkin' ya can  have your fun without us. 
WALLACE	m	Go home. Some of us are in this, I  can't help that now. But you can  help yourselves. Go home. 
MACGREGOR	m	We'll have no homes left when the  English garrison at the castle comes  through to burn us out. 
LORD BOTTOMS	m	Gather the horses! Align the infantry! Ride to the Lord Governor in Stirling. 
LORD BOTTOMS	m	Stop them... Don't let... Align... 
WALLACE	m	On your way somewhere, M'lord? 
LORD BOTTOMS	m	Murdering bloody bandit! 
WALLACE	m	My name is William Wallace. I am no  bandit who hides his face... Find  this man a horse. 
WALLACE	m	Give him a horse. 
WALLACE	m	Not this horse. That one. 
WALLACE	m	Today we will spare you, and every  man who has yielded. Go back to  England. Tell them Scotland's  daughters and her sons are yours no  more. Tell them Scotland is free. 
SCOTS	m	Wal-lace, Wal-lace, Wal-lace!... 
LONGSHANKS	m	Scottish rebels have routed Lord  Bottoms! 
EDWARD	m	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit,  nothing more. 
LONGSHANKS	m	You weak little coward! Stand up! 
LONGSHANKS	m	I go to France to press our rights  there! I leave you to handle this  little rebellion, do you understand?  
LONGSHANKS	m	And turn yourself into a man. 
EDWARD	m	Get away from me! 
EDWARD	m	Convene my military council! 
NICOLETTE	f	They say this Wallace killed thirty  men to avenge the death of his woman.  I hope your husband goes to Scotland.  Then you'll be a widow. 
WOMAN	f	I wanted to please you. 
ROBERT	m	You did. 
ROBERT	m	In Lanark village, the king's soldiers  killed a girl. Her lover fought his  way through the soldiers and killed  the magistrate. 
ROBERT	m	He rebelled. He rebelled. He acted.  He fought! Was it rage? Pride? Love?  Whatever it was, he has more of it  than I. 
WOMAN	f	You might have lied. 
ROBERT	m	I'm too arrogant to lie. 
ROBERT THE BRUCE	m	Father. A rebellion has begun. 
THE LEPER	m	Under whom? 
ROBERT	m	A commoner named William Wallace. 
THE LEPER	m	A commoner? So no one leads Scotland? 
THE LEPER	m	You will embrace this rebellion.  Support it, from our lands in the  north. I will gain English favor by  condemning it and ordering it opposed  from our lands in the south. Whichever  way the tide runs, we will rise. 
ROBERT	m	This Wallace. He doesn't even have a  knighthood. But he fights with  passion, and he is clever. He inspires  men. 
THE LEPER	m	You admire him. Uncompromising men  are easy to admire. He has courage.  So does a dog. But you must understand  this: Edward Longshanks is the most  ruthless king ever to sit on the  throne of England, and none of us,  and nothing of Scotland, will survive  unless we are as ruthless, more  ruthless, than he. 
THE LEPER	m	Press your case to the nobles. They  will choose who rules Scotland. 
HAMISH	m	Ah, William... I am so sorry. 
HAMISH	m	I'll wait... back there. 
WALLACE	m	Hamish, I... thank... 
CAMPBELL	m	What're ya doin'? 
WALLACE	m	Thinking. 
CAMPBELL	m	Does it hurt? 
WALLACE	m	What do we do when Longshanks sends  his whole northern army against us?  They have heavy cavalry. Armored  horses, that shake the very ground.  They'll ride right over us. 
WALLACE	m	We make spears. A hundred spears.  Fourteen feet long. 
HAMISH	m	Fourteen? -- 
SENTRY 	m	Volunteers coming in! 
RECRUIT 	m	William Wallace? We have come to  fight and die for you! 
WALLACE	m	Stand up, man, I'm not the Pope. 
FAUDRON	?	I am Faudron! My sword is yours! And  I brought you this tarta -- 
SENTRY	m	We checked them for arms. 
FAUDRON	?	It's your family tartan! My wife  wove it with her own hands. 
WALLACE	m	Thank her for me. 
VOICE	m	Him? That can't be William Wallace!  I'm prettier than this man! 
STEPHEN	m	All right, Father, I'll ask him! If I risk my neck for you, will I  get a chance to kill Englishmen? 
HAMISH	m	Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you  converse with God Almighty? 
STEPHEN	m	In order to find his equal, and  Irishman is forced to talk to God. Yes, Father!... The Almighty says don't change the  subject, just answer the fookin'  question. 
CAMPBELL	m	Insane Irish -- 
STEPHEN	m	Smart enough to get a dagger past  your guards, old man. 
WALLACE	m	That's my friend, Irishman. And the  answer's yes. You fight for me, you  kill the English. 
STEPHEN	m	Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm  the most wanted man on the Emerald  Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald  Isle of course, more's the pity. 
HAMISH	m	A common thief. 
STEPHEN	m	A patriot! 
SCOUT	m	Scotsmen, Sire! Headed west! 
DOLECROFT	?	They've blundered at last! After  them! 
SCOUT	m	We're in a bog! 
DOLECROFT	?	Here, it's firm this way -- 
WALLACE	m	Stop here and rest. 
PICKERING	f	Another ambush! My God! ...What about  our infiltrator? 
ASSISTANT	m	He has already joined them, M'lord. 
WALLACE	m	Marion! Is... is it you? 
WALLACE	m	I'm dreaming. 
MARION	f	Yes, you are. And you must wake. 
WALLACE	m	I don't want to wake. I want to stay  with you. 
MARION	f	And I with you. But you must wake. 
WALLACE	m	I need you so much! I love you! 
MARION	f	Wake up, William. Wake up! 
HAMISH'S VOICE	m	Wake up, William!... 
MARION/HAMISH	?	Wake up!... 
HAMISH	m	William! Hounds! 
STEPHEN	m	We must run in different directions! 
HAMISH	m	We don't split up! 
STEPHEN	m	They used hounds on us in Ireland,  it's the only way! 
WALLACE	m	He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide  them and run! 
WALLACE	m	Split again! 
WALLACE	m	No matter how we go, they follow.  They have our scent. My scent. 
FAUDRON	?	Run! You must not be caught! 
STEPHEN	m	We can't stop! 
WALLACE	m	They've tricked us. 
STEPHEN	m	What's the crazy man saying, Lord? 
WALLACE	m	The dogs have a scent. My scent.  Someone must have given it to them. 
STEPHEN	m	Who would do such a thing? 
WALLACE	m	Exactly. 
HANDLER	m	Be ready! We have them! 
LORD PICKERING	m	Damnation! Damnation! 
LORD PICKERING	m	After him! Get them going again! 
HANDLER	m	Their noses are drowned in new blood,  they'll follow nothing now! 
STEPHEN OF IRELAND	m	The Almighty says for you to give  His regards to the Devil. 
WALLACE/HAMISH/STEPHEN	?	ARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH! 
STEPHEN	m	I thought I was dead when ya pulled  that dagger! 
WALLACE	m	No English lord would trust an  Irishman! 
HAMISH	m	Let's kill him anyway. 
VILLAGER	m	...and William Wallace killed fifty  men! Fifty, if it was one! 
FARMER	m	A hundred men! With his own sword!  He cut a through the English like -- 
DRINKER	?	-- Moses through the Red Sea! Hacked  off two hundred heads! 
DRINKER #2	?	Two hundred?! 
DRINKER	?	Saw it with my own eyes. 
NICOLETTE	f	When the king returns he will bury  them in those new clothes. Scotland  is in chaos. Your husband is secretly  sending an army north. 
PRINCESS	f	How do you know this? 
NICOLETTE	f	Last night I slept with a member of  the War Council. 
PRINCESS	f	He shouldn't be telling secrets in  bed. 
NICOLETTE	f	Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what  a tongue is for. 
PRINCESS	f	This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He  fights to avenge a woman? 
NICOLETTE	f	A magistrate wished to capture him,  and found he had a secret lover, so  he cut the girl's throat to tempt  Wallace to fight -- and fight he  did. 
NICOLETTE	f	Knowing his passion for his lost  love, they next plotted to take him  by desecrating the graves of his  father and brother and setting an  ambush at the grave of his wife. He  fought his way through the trap and  carried her body to a secret place!  Now that is romance, Oui? 
PRINCESS	f	...I wouldn't know. 
RUNNER	m	The English are advancing an army  toward Stirling! 
WALLACE	m	Do the nobles rally? 
RUNNER	m	Robert the Bruce and most of the  others will not commit to war! But  word has spread and Highlanders are  coming down on their own, by the  hundreds -- by the thousands! 
PEOPLE	m	Wallace! It's William Wallace! God  bless Wallace and Scotland! 
LOCHLAN	m	It sounds like twenty thousand! 
MORNAY	m	The scouts say it is ten. 
LOCHLAN	m	And we have but two! 
YOUNG SOLDIER	m	So many! 
SCOTTISH VETERAN	m	The nobles will negotiate. If they  deal, they send us home. If not, we  charge. When we are all dead and  they can call themselves brave, they  withdraw. 
YOUNG SOLDIER	m	I didn't come to fight so they could  own more lands that I could work for  them! 
VETERAN	m	Nor did I. Not against these odds! 
LOCHLAN	m	Stop! Men! Do not flee! Not now!  Wait until we have negotiated! 
MORNAY	m	They won't stop -- and who could  blame them? 
YOUNG SOLDIER	m	William Wallace? 
VETERAN	m	Couldn't be. 
STEPHEN	m	The Almighty says this must be a  fashionable fight, it's drawn the  finest people. 
LOCHLAN	m	Where is thy salute? 
WALLACE	m	For presenting yourselves on this  battlefield, I give you thanks. 
LOCHLAN	m	This is our army. To join it, you  give homage. 
WALLACE	m	I give homage to Scotland. And if  this is your army, why does it go? 
SCOTTISH VETERAN	m	We didn't come to fight for them! 
SHOUTS FROM MOB	m	Home! The English are too many! 
WALLACE	m	Sons of Scotland!... I am William  Wallace! 
SOLDIER	m	William Wallace is seven feet tall! 
WALLACE	m	Yes, I have heard! He kills men by  the hundreds! And if he were here,  he would consume the English with  fireballs from his eyes, and bolts  of lightning from his ass! 
WALLACE	m	I am William Wallace. And my enemies  do not go away. I saw our good nobles  hanged. My wife... I am William  Wallace. And I see a whole army of  my countrymen, here in defiance of  tyranny. You have come to fight as  free men. And free men you are! What  will you do with freedom? Will you  fight? 
VETERAN	m	Two thousand, against ten? We will  run -- and live! 
WALLACE	m	Yes. Fight and you may die. Run and  you will live, at least awhile. And  dying in your bed many years from  now, would you be willing to trade  all the days from this day to that,  for one chance to come back here as  young men, and tell our enemies that  they make take our lives, but they  will never take our freedom? 
VETERAN	m	Look! The English comes to barter  with our nobles for castles and  titles. And our nobles will not be  in the front of the battle! 
WALLACE	m	No! They will not! 
WALLACE	m	And I will. 
SCOTS	m	Wal-lace! Wal-lace! WAL-LACE! 
STEPHEN	m	Fine speech. Now what do we do? 
WALLACE	m	Bring out our spearmen and set them  in the field. 
CHELTHAM	?	Mornay. Lochlan. Inverness. 
MORNAY	m	Cheltham. This is William Wallace 
CHELTHAM	?	Here are the King's terms. Lead this  army off the field, and he will give  you each estates in Yorkshire,  including hereditary title, from  which you will pay him an annual -- 
WALLACE	m	I have an offer for you. 
CHELTHAM	?	...From which you will pay the King  an annual duty... 
LOCHLAN	m	You disrespect a banner of truce?! 
WALLACE	m	From his king? Absolutely. Here are  Scotland's terms. Lower your flags  and march straight to England,  stopping at every Scottish home you  pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred  years of theft, rape, and murder. Do  that, and your men shall live. Do it  not, and every one of you will die  today. 
CHELTHAM	?	You are outmatched! You haven't even  any cavalry! In two centuries no  army has won without it! 
WALLACE	m	I'm not finished. Before we let you  leave, your commander must cross  that bridge, stand before this army,  put his head between his legs, and  kiss his own ass. 
MORNAY	m	I'd say that was rather less cordial  that he was used to. 
WALLACE	m	Be ready, and do exactly as I say. 
HAMISH	m	Wish I could see the noble lord's  face when he tells him. 
TALMADGE	m	Insolent bastard! Full attack! Give  no quarter! And I want this Wallace's  heart brought to me on a plate! 
STEPHEN	m	The Lord tell me He can get me out  of this mess. But He's pretty sure  you're fooked. 
TALMADGE	m	Amateurs! They do not even contest  us! Send across the infantry. 
GENERAL	m	M'lord, the bridge is so narrow -- 
TALMADGE	m	The Scots just stand in their  formations! 
WALLACE	m	Steady! Hold... hold... NOW! 
WALLACE	m	FORM! 
WALLACE	m	Here I am, English coward! Come get  me!! 
TALMADGE	m	Press the men across! 
CHELTHAM	?	But M'lord! 
TALMADGE	m	PRESS THEM! 
WALLACE	m	Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and  cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be  sure the English see him ride away! 
LOCHLAN	m	If he waits much longer -- 
HAMISH	m	Ride around and ford behind them! 
MORNAY	m	We should not divide our forces! 
HAMISH	m	Wallace says do it! And he says for  you to let the English see you! 
MORNAY	m	They shall think we run away. 
TALMADGE	m	See! Every Scot with a horse is  fleeing! Hurry! Hurry! 
WALLACE	m	For Scotland! 
TALMADGE	m	Press reinforcements across! 
MORNAY	m	He's taking the bloody bridge! The  English can't get across! He's evened  the odds at one stroke! 
TALMADGE	m	Use the archers! 
GENERAL	m	They're too close, we'll shoot out  own men! 
GENERAL	m	We are still five thousand! Rally! 
SCOTTISH SOLDIERS	m	Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace! 
ELDER	m	I knight thee Sir William Wallace. 
CROWD	m	Wal-lace, Wal-lace!! 
ROBERT	m	Does anyone know his politics? 
CRAIG	m	No. But his weight with the commoners  could unbalance everything. The  Balliols will kiss his ass, so we  must. 
STEWARD	m	Lords of Scotland: Sir William  Wallace! 
CRAIG	m	Sir William. In the name of God, we  declare and appoint thee High  Protector of Scotland! And thy  captains as aides decamp! 
BALLIOL	?	Sir William!! Inasmuch as you and  your captains hail from a region  long known to support the Balliol  clan, may we invite you to join us? 
WALLACE	m	You are Robert the Bruce. 
ROBERT THE BRUCE	m	I am. 
WALLACE	m	My father fought in support of yours. 
BALLIOL	?	With this new success, the result of  all of Scotland's efforts, now is  the time to declare a king! 
MORNAY	m	Then you are prepared to recognize  our legitimate succession! 
BALLIOL	?	You're the ones who won't support  the true claim! I demand consideration  of these documents! 
MORNAY	m	Those were lies when they were  written! Our documents prove  absolutely that -- 
CRAIG	m	Sir William! Where are you going? 
WILLIAM	m	We have beaten the English! But  they'll come back, because you won't  stand together. There is one clan in  this country -- Scotsmen. One class --  free. One price -- courage. 
CRAIG	m	But... what will you do? 
WALLACE	m	I will invade England. And defeat  the English on their own ground. 
CRAIG	m	Invade?! That's impossible, it -- 
WALLACE	m	LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands  this! This! 
WALLACE	m	There is a difference between us.  You think the people of this country  exist to provide you with position.  I think your position exists to  provide the people with freedom. And  I go to make sure they have it. 
ROBERT	m	Wait! ...I respect what you said.  But remember, these men have lands,  castles. Much to risk. 
WALLACE	m	And the common man who bleeds on the  battlefield, does he risk less? 
ROBERT	m	No. But from top to bottom this  country has no sense of itself. Its  nobles share allegiance with England  and its clans war with each other.  If you make enemies on both sides of  the border, you'll end up dead. 
WALLACE	m	We all end up dead. It's only a  question of how. And why. 
ROBERT	m	I'm no coward! I want what you want!  But we need the nobles. 
WALLACE	m	Nobles? What does that mean -- to be  noble? Your title gives you claim to  the throne of our country. But men  don't follow titles, they follow  courage! Your arm speaks louder than  your tongue. Our people know you.  Noble and common, they respect you.  If you would lead them toward freedom,  they would follow you. And so would  
CAPTAIN	m	Message from your cousin, the Prince.  He says London has no more troops to  send. 
GOVERNOR	m	Every town in Northern England is  begging for help! Where will Wallace  strike first? 
CAPTAIN	m	I should think these smaller  settlements along the border... 
RIDER	m	He advances! 
GOVERNOR	m	To what town? 
RIDER	m	He comes here! 
GOVERNOR	m	We will not allow a bandit to panic  the greatest city in Northern England!  Close off the escapes! Let no one  leave! 
CAPTAIN	m	The city has emptied already, Sire.  Only the Scottish civilians remain. 
WALLACE	m	Back! Wait for it to burn! 
CAPTAIN	m	They've breached the wall! 
GOVERNOR	m	Then do as I ordered. 
WALLACE	m	STOP! NOT YET! LISTEN TO ME! 
WALLACE	m	Behold the enemy we fight! We will  be more merciful than they have been.  We will spare women, children, and  priests. For all else, no mercy. 
PHILLIP	m	It is not your fault! Stand up to  him. 
EDWARD	m	I will stand up to him, and more. 
LONGSHANKS	m	What news of the north? 
EDWARD	m	Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent  riders to speed any word. 
LONGSHANKS	m	While I am in France fighting to  expand your future kingdom I learn  that Stirling castle is lost, our  entire northern army wiped out! And  you have done nothing?! 
EDWARD	m	I have ordered conscriptions... 
EDWARD	m	Wallace has sacked York! 
LONGSHANKS	m	Impossible. How dare you bring a panicky lie. 
PHILLIP	m	Sire! Thy own nephew! What beast  could do such a thing?! 
LONGSHANKS	m	If he can sack York, he can invade  lower England. 
PHILLIP	m	We would stop him! 
LONGSHANKS	m	Edward, who is this shitpoker who  speaks to me as if I needed his  advice? 
EDWARD	m	I have declared Phillip my High  Counselor. 
LONGSHANKS	m	You fight back at last! 
LONGSHANKS	m	We must sue for a truce, and buy him  off. But who will go to him? Not I.  If I came under the sword of this  murderer, I would end up like my  nephew. And not you, the sight of my  faggot son would only encourage an  enemy to take over this country. So  whom do I send? 
CAMPBELL	m	A royal entourage comes, flying  banners of truce, and the standards  of Longshanks himself! 
WALLACE	m	Longshanks! I have come. 
PRINCESS	f	I am the Princess of Wales. 
WALLACE	m	Wife of Edward, the king's son? 
PRINCESS	f	I come as the king's servant, and  with his authority. 
WALLACE	m	It's battle I want, not talk. 
PRINCESS	f	But now that I am here, will you  speak with a woman? 
PRINCESS	f	I understand that you have recently  been given the rank of knight. 
WALLACE	m	I have been given nothing. God makes  men what they are. 
PRINCESS	f	Did God make you the sacker of  peaceful cities? The executioner of  the king's nephew, my husband's own  cousin? 
WALLACE	m	York was the staging point for every  invasion of my country. And that  royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots,  even women and children, from the  city walls. 
PRINCESS	f	That is not possible. 
WALLACE	m	Longshanks did far worse, the last  time he took a Scottish city. 
CRONY	m	He is a murdering bandit, he lies. 
WALLACE	m	I am no bandit. And I do not lie. 
WALLACE	m	Or in French if you prefer that:  Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to  his face, and see if his eyes can  convince you of the truth. 
PRINCESS	f	Hamilton, leave us. 
CRONY 	m	M'lady -- 
PRINCESS	f	Leave us now. 
STEPHEN	m	Her husband's more of a queen than  she is. Did you know that? 
PRINCESS	f	Let us talk plainly. You invade  England. But you cannot complete the  conquest, so far from your shelter  and supply. The King proposes that  you withdraw your attack. In return  he grants you title, estates, and  this chest with a thousand pounds of  gold, which I am to pay to you  personally. 
WALLACE	m	A Lordship. And gold. That I should  become Judas. 
PRINCESS	f	Peace is made is such ways. 
WALLACE	m	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS! 
PRINCESS	f	I understand you have suffered. I  know... about your woman. 
WALLACE	m	She was my wife. We married in secret  because I would not share her with  an English lord. They killed her to  get to me. And she was pregnant. 
WALLACE	m	I've never told anyone. I don't know  why I tell you -- except because you  look... much like her. And someday  you will be a queen, and you must  open your eyes! Tell your king that William Wallace  will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot,  while I live. 
PRINCESS	f	Sir. I leave this money, as a gift.  Not from the king, but from myself.  And not to you, but to the orphans  of your country. 
LONGSHANKS	m	My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled  by the heathen. So he accepted our  bribe. 
PRINCESS	f	No. He did not. 
LONGSHANKS	m	Then why does he stay? My scouts say  he has not advanced. 
PRINCESS	f	He waits. For you. He says he will  attack no more towns -- if you are  man enough to come fight him. 
LONGSHANKS	m	You spoke with this Wallace in  private. What kind of man is he? 
PRINCESS	f	...A mindless barbarian. Not a king  like you, M'lord. 
LONGSHANKS	m	The Scottish nobles have sent him no  support. His army starves. Our stall  has worked, he must withdraw. You  may return to your embroidery. 
PRINCESS	f	Humbly, M'lord. 
EDWARD	m	You brought back the money, of course? 
PRINCESS	f	No. I have it to ease the suffering  of the children of this war. 
LONGSHANKS	m	This is what happens when you must  send a woman. And a fool. 
PRINCESS	f	Forgive me, Sire. I thought that  generosity might demonstrate your  greatness to those you mean to rule. 
LONGSHANKS	m	My greatness is better demonstrated  with this. 
EDWARD	m	The weapon has been outlawed by the  Pope himself! 
LONGSHANKS	m	So the Scots will have none of them,  will they? My armorers have already  made a thousand. 
HAMISH	m	William -- French guards? 
CRAIG	m	That is why the Pope outlawed the  weapon! It makes war too terrible. 
MORNAY	m	How many does Longshanks have? 
WALLACE	m	A thousand. You have made me Guardian of Scotland.  So I tell you this is what we face. 
CRAIG	m	We must sue for peace. 
WALLACE	m	Peace?! 
CRAIG	m	We cannot defeat this -- 
WALLACE	m	With cavalry -- not heavy, like the  English, but light, fast horsemen,  like you nobles employ -- we could  outmaneuver their bowmen! 
CRAIG	m	It is suicide. 
ROBERT	m	Sir William -- 
WALLACE	m	We won at Stirling and still you  quibbled! We won at York and you  would not support us! Then I said  nothing! Now I say you are cowards! 
ROBERT	m	Please, Sir William! Speak with me  alone! I beg you! 
ROBERT	m	You have achieved more than anyone  dreamed. But fighting these odds  looks like rage, not courage. Peace  offers its rewards! Has war become a  habit you cannot break? 
WALLACE	m	War finds me willing. I know it won't  bring back all I have lost. But it  can bring what none of us have ever  had -- a country of our own. For  that we need a king. We need you. 
ROBERT	m	I am trying. 
WALLACE	m	Then tell me what a king is! Is he a  man who believes only what others  believe? Is he one who calculates  the numbers for and against him but  never weighs the strength in your  own heart? There is strength in you.  I see it. I know it. 
ROBERT	m	I must... consult with my father. 
WALLACE	m	And I will consult with mine. 
WALLACE	m	Remember when the English turned  their hounds on us? Maybe we should  introduce them to our dogs. 
ROBERT	m	This... cannot be the way. 
THE LEPER	m	You have said yourself that the nobles  will not support Wallace, so how  does it help us to join the side  that is slaughtered? 
THE LEPER	m	My son. Look at me. I cannot be king.  You, and you alone, can rule Scotland.  What I tell you, you must do -- for  yourself, and for your country. 
HAMISH	m	The Bruce is not coming, William. 
WALLACE	m	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce. 
WALLACE	m	Stephen ready? 
HAMISH	m	Aye. 
WALLACE	m	Irish troops! 
STEPHEN	m	So that's where Longshanks got his  soldiers. Irishmen, willing to kill  Scottish cousins for the English. 
WILLIAM	m	Their families are starving, they'll  feed them however they can. If you  don't want to fight them -- 
STEPHEN	m	No. I'll stand with you. 
STEPHEN	m	They can't be that stupid to attack  the schiltrons again. 
WALLACE	m	It's only a faint to shield the  crossbows! 
WALLACE	m	Now! Give 'em the dogs! 
WALLACE	m	Now! Charge! Charge them! 
GENERAL	m	Mornay? 
LONGSHANKS	m	For double his lands in Scotland,  and matching estates in England. 
STEPHEN	m	Betrayed! 
GENERAL	m	My God, and still they come! 
LONGSHANKS	m	Use the reinforcements! But take  Wallace alive! 
WALLACE	m	Hamish! Ham -- 
WALLACE	m	Get him away! 
WALLACE	m	A charge! Form up! Form up! 
ROBERT	m	Fight me! Fight me! 
ROBERT	m	FIGHT ME! 
CAMPBELL	m	Son... I want to die on the ground. 
CAMPBELL	m	Whew. That'll clear your sinuses.  Goodbye, boys. 
HAMISH	m	No. You're going to live. 
CAMPBELL	m	I don't think I can do without one  of those... whatever it is... 
WALLACE	m	You... were like my father... 
CAMPBELL	m	...And glad to die, like him... So  you could be the men you are. All of  ya. 
CAMPBELL	m	I'm a happy man. 
ADVISOR	m	Their nobles have sworn allegiance,  M'lord. Every last one. 
LONGSHANKS	m	Now we kill two birds at one stroke.  We recruit from Scotland for our  armies in France. 
EDWARD	m	The Scots will fight for us? 
LONGSHANKS	m	What choice do they have? Now they  must serve us or starve. 
EDWARD	m	But if we have not caught Wallace -- 
LONGSHANKS	m	He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he  has not yet bled to death or had his  throat cut for him, he will not  survive the winter. It is very cold --  is it not, our flower? 
LEPER	m	I am the one who is rotting. But I  think your face looks graver than  mine. 
ROBERT	m	He was so brave. With courage alone  he nearly won. 
LEPER	m	So more men were slaughtered  uselessly! 
ROBERT	m	He broke because of me. I saw it. He  lost all will to fight. 
LEPER	m	We must have alliance with England  to prevail here. You achieved that!  You saved your family, increased  your lands! In time you will have  all the power in Scotland!... Yet  you grieve. 
ROBERT	m	In my heart I had begun to hope that  he would never break. 
LEPER	m	All men lose heart. All betray. It  is exactly why we must make the  choices we make. 
PEOPLE	m	Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace! 
ROBERT	m	Is it true about Mornay? 
ROBERT	m	And he rode through the window? My  God. 
LONGSHANKS	m	His legend grows! It will be worse  than before! 
EDWARD	m	You let Wallace escape your whole  army. You cannot blame me for this. 
PRINCESS	f	Good day to you, M'Lords. 
EDWARD	m	You mock us with a smile? 
PRINCESS	f	I am cheerful with a plan to soothe  your miseries. All of England shudders  with the news of renewed rebellion. 
EDWARD	m	Wallace's followers. 
PRINCESS	f	Wallace himself. If you wish to  pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers  in every Scottish town, I leave you  to your hauntings. If you wish to  take him, I know a way. 
PRINCESS	f	I have faced him. Have you? 
LONGSHANKS	m	Let her speak. 
PRINCESS	f	He will fight you forever. But what  does he fight for? Freedom first,  and peace. So grant them. 
EDWARD	m	The little cow is insane -- 
PRINCESS	f	Grant, as you do everything else,  with treachery. Offer him a truce to  discuss terms, and send me to my  castle at Locharmbie as your emissary.  He trusts me. Pick thirty of your  finest assassins for me to take along.  And I will set the meeting, and the  ambush. 
LONGSHANKS	m	You see, my delicate son? I have  picked you a Queen. 
CHIEF ASSASSIN	m	We came in small groups, so the rebels  would not suspect. 
PRINCESS	f	And you have reached Wallace's men? 
CHIEF ASSASSIN	m	We tell the villagers, and the  traitors pass it on. All that's left  is for you to say where. 
WALLACE	m	Thanks for the food and drink. And  for bringing 'em yourselves. 
HAMISH	m	We're here to stay. We don't care to  live, if we can't fight beside ya. 
HAMISH	m	There is... one thing, William.  Longshanks is offering a truce. He  has dispatched his daughter-in-law  as his emissary, and she has sent  word that she wishes to meet you --  in a barn. 
CHIEF ASSASSIN	m	It's William Wallace, sure! And...  he's given up his sword! Be ready! 
WALLACE	m	A meeting in a barn. It had to be a  trap. And only you would know I would  be aware of it. 
PRINCESS	f	It does me good to see you. 
WILLIAM	m	I am much diminished since we met. 
PRINCESS	f	There will be a new shipment of  supplies coming north next month.  Food and weapons. They will trav -- 
WILLIAM	m	No. Stop. I didn't come here for  that. 
PRINCESS	f	Then why did you come? 
WALLACE	m	Why did you? 
PRINCESS	f	Because of the way you're looking at  me now. The same way... as when we  met. 
PRINCESS	f	I know. You looked at me... and saw  her. 
PRINCESS	f	You must forgive me what I feel. No  man has ever looked at me as you  did. 
WALLACE	m	You have... you have a husband. 
PRINCESS	f	I have taken vows. More than one.  I've vowed faithfulness to my husband,  and sworn to give him a son. And I  cannot keep both promises. 
PRINCESS	f	You understand. Consider, before you  laugh and say no. You will never own  a throne, though you deserve one.  But just as the sun will rise  tomorrow, some man will rule England.  And what if his veins ran not with  the blood of Longshanks, but with  that of a true king? 
WALLACE	m	I cannot love you for the sake of  revenge. 
PRINCESS	f	No. But can you love me for the sake  of all you loved and lost? Or simply  love me... because I love you? 
PRINCESS	f	No one! Hurry! 
PRINCESS	f	When we... did you think of her? 
HAMISH	m	Rest, William. 
WALLACE	m	I rest. 
HAMISH	m	Your rest is making me exhausted. 
STEPHEN	m	Come, it'll help you sleep. 
WALLACE	m	Aye. But it won't let me dream. 
CRAIG	m	May he rest in peace... You have  already sealed the coffin? 
ROBERT	m	He was a modest man. 
CRAIG	m	It will not be long before Longshanks  too is encased in stone, and his  crowns divided for others to wear. 
CRAIG	m	Our nobles are frightened and  confused... Wallace has the commoners  stirred up again, from the Highland  clans to the lowland villages. In  another six months Christ and the  Apostles could not govern this  country. 
CRAIG	m	Longshanks knows his son will scarcely  be able to rule England, much less  half of France. He needs Scotland  settled, and he trusts you, after  Falkirk. If you pay him homage, he  will recognize you as king of  Scotland. Our nobles have agreed to  this as well. 
ROBERT	m	If I pay homage to another's throne,  then how am I a king? 
CRAIG	m	Homage is nothing. It is the crown  that matters! 
ROBERT	m	The crown is that of Scotland. And  Scotland is William Wallace. 
CRAIG	m	That is another matter. There is a  price to all this, required both by  Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it,  and you will be our king. And we  will have peace. 
CRAIG	m	Sir William. We come to seek a  meeting. 
WALLACE	m	You've all sworn to Longshanks. 
CRAIG	m	An oath to a liar is no oath at all.  An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed.  Every man of us is ready to swear  loyalty to you. 
WALLACE	m	So let the council swear publicly. 
CRAIG	m	We cannot. Some scarcely believe you  are alive. Other think you'll pay  them Mornay's wages. We bid you to  Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates,  two days from now, at sunset. Pledge  us your pardon and we will unite  behind you. Scotland will be one. 
WALLACE	m	I will meet you, but only one way --  if Robert the Bruce is there, and  puts his hand on my Bible, and swears  his loyalty to Scotland. 
CRAIG	m	He has already agreed to come. 
HAMISH	m	You know it's a trap. 
WALLACE	m	Probably. But we can't win alone. We  know that. This is the only way. 
HAMISH	m	I don't want to be a martyr. 
WALLACE	m	Nor I! I want to live! I want a home  and children and peace. I've asked  god for those things. But He's brought  me this sword. And if He wills that  I must lay it down to have what He  wants for my country, then I'll do  that too. 
HAMISH	m	That's just a dream, William! 
WALLACE	m	We've lived a dream together. A dream  of freedom! 
HAMISH	m	Your dreams aren't about freedom!  They're about Marion! You have to be  a hero, because you think she sees  you! Is that it? 
WALLACE	m	My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed  them myself. If I knew I could live  with her on the other side of death,  I'd welcome it. 
HAMISH	m	Keep these. We're going too. 
WALLACE	m	No. One of us is enough. 
CRAIG	m	He won't come. 
ROBERT	m	He will. I know he will. 
ROBERT	m	Here. And unarmed. My God, he has a  brave heart. 
ROBERT	m	He is not to be harmed. I have your  king's absolute promise that he will  be imprisoned only! 
CRAIG	m	Now we will have peace. 
PEOPLE	m	Don't look so fearsome, does he?! 
PRINCESS	f	Is it true? Wallace is captured? 
EDWARD	m	Simply because he eluded your trap,  do you think he is more than a man?  My father is dying. Perhaps you should  think of our coronation. 
PRINCESS	f	When will his trial be? 
EDWARD	m	Wallace's? For treason there is no  trial. Tomorrow he will be charged,  then executed. 
ROBERT	m	Longshanks promised! 
CRAIG	m	You are surprised he would lie?  Balliol was murdered in a church  yesterday. You are Longshanks' new  designate. You will be king. 
ROYAL MAGISTRATE	m	William Wallace! You stand in taint  of high treason. 
WALLACE	m	Treason. Against whom? 
MAGISTRATE	m	Against thy king, thou vile fool!  Hast thou anything to say? 
WALLACE	m	Never, in my whole life, did I swear  allegiance to your king -- 
MAGISTRATE	m	It matters not, he is thy king! 
WALLACE	m	-- while many who serve him have  taken and broken his oath many times.  I cannot commit treason, if I have  never been his subject! 
MAGISTRATE	m	Confess, and you may receive a quick  death. Deny, and you must be purified  by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU  
WALLACE	m	I do not confess. 
MAGISTRATE	m	Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive  they purification... And in the end,  I promise you'll beg for the axe. 
WALLACE	m	I am so afraid... Give me strength. 
JAILER	m	Your Highness! 
PRINCESS	f	I will see the prisoner. 
JAILER	m	We've orders from the king -- 
PRINCESS	f	The king will be dead in a month!  And his son is a weakling! Who do  you think will rule this kingdom?  Now OPEN THIS DOOR! 
JAILER	m	On your feet, you filth! 
PRINCESS	f	Stop! Leave me! There is no way out of this hell!  Leave me with him! 
WALLACE	m	M'lady... what kindness of you to  visit a stranger. 
PRINCESS	f	Sir, I... come to beg you to confess  all, and swear allegiance to the  king, that he might show you mercy. 
WALLACE	m	Will he show mercy to my country?  Will he take back his soldiers, and  let us rule ourselves? 
PRINCESS	f	Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps  even live in the Tower. In time, who  knows what can happen, if you can  only live. 
WALLACE	m	If I swear to him, then everything I  am is dead already. 
WALLACE	m	Your people are lucky to have a  princess so kind that she can grieve  at the death of a stranger. 
PRINCESS	f	You will die! It will be awful! 
WALLACE	m	Every man dies. Not every man really  lives. 
PRINCESS	f	Drink this! It will dull your pain. 
WALLACE	m	It will numb my wits, and I must  have them all. If I'm senseless, or  if I wail, then Longshanks will have  broken me. 
PRINCESS	f	I can't bear the thought of your  torture. Take it! 
PRINCESS	f	I have come to beg for the life of  William Wallace. 
EDWARD	m	You fancy him. 
PRINCESS	f	I respect him. At worst he was a  worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou  great king... and win the respect of  your own people. 
PRINCESS	f	Even now, you are incapable of mercy? 
PRINCESS	f	Nor you. To you that word is as  unfamiliar as love. 
EDWARD	m	Before he lost his powers of speech,  he told me his one comfort was that  he would live to know Wallace was  dead. 
PRINCESS	f	You see? Death comes to us all. And  it comes to William Wallace. But  before death comes to you, know this:  your blood dies with you. A child  who is not of your line grows in my  belly. Your son will not sit long on  the throne. I swear it. 
MAGISTRATE	m	We will use it all before this is  over. Or fall to your knees now,  declare yourself the king's loyal  subject, and beg his mercy, and you  shall have it. 
CROWD	m	That's it! Stretch him! 
MAGISTRATE	m	Pleasant, yes? Rise to your knees,  kiss the royal emblem on my cloak,  and you will feel no more. 
MAGISTRATE	m	Very well then. Rack him. 
MAGISTRATE	m	Wonderful, isn't it, that a man  remains conscious through such pain.  Enough? 
WALLACE	m	That... will... clear your sinuses. 
MAGISTRATE	m	It can all end. Right now! Bliss.  Peace. Just say it. Cry out. "Mercy!"  Yes?... Yes? 
CROWD	m	Mer-cy! Mer-cy! Mer-cy! 
MAGISTRATE	m	The prisoner wishes to say a word! 
HAMISH AND STEPHEN	m	Mercy, William... Say Mercy... 
WALLACE	m	FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM! 
ROBERT 	m	After the beheading, William Wallace's  body was torn to pieces. His head  was set on London bridge, where  passerby were invited to jeer at the  man who had caused so much fear in  England. His arms and legs were sent to the  four corners of Britain as warning. 
ROBERT 	m	It did not have the effect that  Longshanks planned. 
ROBERT 	m	And I, Robert the Bruce, backed by a  body of Scottish veterans, rode out  to pay homage to the armies of the  English king, and accept his  endorsement of my crown. 
ENGLISH COMMANDER	m	I hope you washed your ass this mornin --  it's never been kissed by a king  before. 
CRAIG	m	Come, let's get it over with. 
ROBERT	m	Stop. 
ROBERT THE BRUCE	m	You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed  with me! 
SCOTS	m	Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace! 
WALLACE'S VOICE	m	In the year of our Lord 1314, patriots  of Scotland, starving and outnumbered,  charged the fields of Bannockburn.  They fought like warrior poets. They  fought like Scotsmen. And won their  freedom. Forever. 
SCOTS	m	Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!
