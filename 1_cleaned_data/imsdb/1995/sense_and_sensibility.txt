MR DASHWOOD	m	Is John not yet arrived? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	We expect him at any moment, dearest. 
MR DASHWOOD	m	The girls--I have left so little. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Shh, hush, Henry. 
MR DASHWOOD	m	Elinor will try to look after you  all, but make sure she finds a good  husband. The men are such noodles  hereabouts, little wonder none has  pleased her. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	But Marianne is sure to find her  storybook hero. 
MR DASHWOOD	m	A romantic poet with flashing eyes  and empty pockets? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	As long as she loves him, whoever he  is. 
MR DASHWOOD	m	Margaret will go to sea and become a  pirate so we need not concern  ourselves with her. 
THOMAS	m	Your son is arrived from London,  sir. 
MR DASHWOOD	m	Let me speak to John alone. 
MR DASHWOOD	m	Ah, my dear. How happy you have made  me. 
JOHN	m	Father... 
MR DASHWOOD	m	John you will find out soon enough  from my will that the estate of  Norland was left to me in such a way  as prevents me from dividing it  between my families. 
JOHN	m	Calm yourself, Father. This is not  good for you. 
MR DASHWOOD	m	Norland in its entirety is therefore  yours by law and I am happy for you  and Fanny. 
MR DASHWOOD	m	But your stepmother my wife and  daughters are left with only five  hundred pounds a year, barely enough  to live on and nothing for the girls'  dowries. You must help them. 
JOHN	m	Of course 
MR DASHWOOD	m	You must promise to do this. 
JOHN	m	I promise, Father, I promise. 
JOHN	m	Come! Come quickly! 
MR DASHWOOD	m	Help them. 
FANNY 	f	'Help them?' 
FANNY	f	What do you mean, 'help them'? 
JOHN	m	Dearest, I mean to give them three  thousand pounds. 
JOHN	m	The interest will provide them with  a little extra income. Such a gift  will certainly discharge my promise  to my father. 
FANNY	f	Oh, without question! More than  amply... 
JOHN	m	One had rather, on such occasions,  do too much than too little. 
JOHN	m	Of course, he did not stipulate a  particular sum. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	To be reduced to the condition of  visitor in my own home! It is not to  be borne, Elinor! 
ELINOR	f	Consider, Mamma! We have nowhere to  go. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	John and Fanny will descend from  London at any moment, followed no  doubt by cartloads of relatives ready  to turn us out of our rooms one by  one do you expect me to be here to  welcome them? Vultures! 
ELINOR	f	I shall start making inquiries for a  new house at once. Until then we  must try to bear their coming. 
JOHN	m	Fifteen hundred then. What say you  to fifteen hundred? 
FANNY	f	What brother on earth would do half  so much for his real sisters--let  alone half-blood? 
JOHN	m	They can hardly expect more. 
FANNY	f	There is no knowing what they expect.  The question is, what can you afford? 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, cannot you play something  else? Mamma has been weeping since  breakfast. 
ELINOR	f	I meant something less mournful,  dearest. 
JOHN	m	A hundred pounds a year to their  mother while she lives. Would that  be more advisable? It is better than  parting with the fifteen hundred all  at once. 
FANNY	f	But if she should live longer than  fifteen years we would be completely  taken in. People always live forever  when there is an annuity to be paid  them. 
ELINOR	f	Margaret, are you there? Please come  down. John and Fanny will be here  soon. 
MARGARET 	f	Why are they coming to live at  Norland? They already have a house  in London. 
ELINOR	f	Because houses go from father to  son, dearest not from father to  daughter. It is the law. 
ELINOR	f	If you come inside, we could play  with your atlas. 
MARGARET 	f	It's not my atlas any more. It's  their atlas. 
JOHN	m	Twenty pounds now and then will amply  discharge my promise, you are quite  right. 
FANNY	f	Indeed. Although to say the truth, I  am convinced within myself that your  father had no idea of your giving  them money. 
JOHN	m	They will have five hundred a year  amongst them as it is-- 
FANNY	f	--and what on earth can four women  want for more than that? Their  housekeeping will be nothing at all  they will have no carriage, no horses,  hardly any servants and will keep no  company. Only conceive how comfortable  they will be! 
ELINOR	f	As you know, we are looking for a  new home. When we leave we shall be  able to retain only Thomas and Betsy. 
ELINOR	f	We are very sorry to have to leave  you all. But we are certain you will  find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and  generous mistress. 
FANNY 	f	They will be much more able to give  you something. 
JOHN	m	So we are agreed. No money but the  occasional gift of game and fish in  season will be very welcome. 
FANNY	f	Your father would be proud of you. 
ELINOR	f	How is Mrs Ferrars? 
FANNY	f	My mother is always in excellent  health, thank you. My brother Robert  is in town with her this season and  quite the most popular bachelor in  London! He has his own barouche. 
ELINOR	f	You have two brothers, have you not? 
FANNY	f	Indeed, yes. Edward is the eldest  Mamma quite depends upon him. He is  traveling up from Plymouth shortly  and will break his journey here. 
JOHN	m	If that is agreeable to you, of  course. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	My dear John this is your home now. 
MARIANNE	f	Fanny wishes to know where the key  for the silver cabinet is kept. 
ELINOR	f	Betsy has it, I think. What does  Fanny want with the silver? 
MARIANNE	f	I can only presume she wants to count  it. What are you doing? 
ELINOR	f	Presents for the servants. Have you  seen Margaret? I am worried about  her. She has taken to hiding in the  oddest places. 
MARIANNE	f	Fortunate girl. At least she can  escape Fanny, which is more than any  of us is able. 
ELINOR	f	You do your best. You have not said  a word to her for a week. 
MARIANNE	f	I have! I have said 'yes' and 'no'. 
MARIANNE	f	Good morning, Fanny. 
FANNY	f	Good morning, Marianne. 
MARIANNE	f	How did you find the silver? Is it  all genuine? 
ELINOR	f	Pray, when may we expect the pleasure  of your brother's company? 
FANNY	f	Edward is due tomorrow. And my dear  Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact  that he will not be with us for long,  I wondered if Miss Margaret would  mind giving up her room to him the  view is quite incomparable from her  windows and I should so much like  Edward to see Norland at its best. 
MARIANNE	f	Intolerable woman! 
ELINOR	f	There is but one consolation if Edward  is anything like Fanny, we shall be  only too happy to leave. 
FANNY	f	But where is Miss Margaret? I declare,  Mrs Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt  of her existence! She must run  positively wild! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest  is not to be found this morning. She  is a little shy of strangers at  present. 
EDWARD	m	Naturally. I am also shy of strangers  and I have nothing like her excuse. 
MARIANNE	f	How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars? 
EDWARD	m	Very much. Your stables are very  handsome and beautifully kept, Mrs  Dashwood. 
FANNY	f	Stables! Edward--your windows overlook  the lake. 
EDWARD	m	An oversight, Fanny, led me to the  wrong room. I have rectified the  situation and am happily settled in  the guest quarters. 
FANNY	f	They are all exceedingly spoilt, I  find. Miss Margaret spends all her  time up trees and under furniture  and I have barely had a civil word  from Marianne. 
EDWARD	m	My dear Fanny, they have just lost  their father their lives will never  be the same again. 
FANNY	f	That is no excuse. 
FANNY	f	I have never liked the smell of books. 
EDWARD	m	Oh? No. The dust, perhaps. 
EDWARD	m	I hear you have great plans for the  walnut grove. 
FANNY	f	Oh yes! I shall have it pulled down  to make room for a Grecian temple. 
EDWARD	m	How picturesque. Will you show me  the site? 
ELINOR	f	Too expensive. We do not need four  bedrooms, we can share. 
MARIANNE	f	This one, then? 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, we have only five hundred  pounds a year. I will send out more  inquiries today. 
EDWARD	m	Pardon my intrusion, but I believe I  have found what you are looking for. 
ELINOR 	f	Won't you come out, dearest? We  haven't seen you all day. Mamma is  very concerned. 
EDWARD	m	Oh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was  wondering do you by any chance have  such a thing as a reliable atlas? 
ELINOR	f	I believe so. 
EDWARD	m	Excellent. I wish to check the  position of the Nile. 
EDWARD	m	My sister says it is in South America. 
ELINOR	f	Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong.  For I believe it is in--in Belgium. 
EDWARD	m	Belgium? Surely not. You must be  thinking of the Volga. 
MARGARET	f	The Volga? 
ELINOR	f	Of course. The Volga, which, as you  know, starts in... 
EDWARD	m	Vladivostok, and ends in... 
ELINOR	f	St Albans. 
EDWARD	m	Indeed. Where the coffee beans come  from. 
MARGARET	f	The source of the Nile is in  Abyssinia. 
EDWARD	m	Is it? Good heavens. How do you do.  Edward Ferrars. 
MARGARET	f	Margaret Dashwood. 
ELINOR	f	That was my father's favourite. 
ELINOR	f	Thank you so much for your help with  Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed  girl since your arrival. 
EDWARD	m	Not at all. I enjoy her company. 
ELINOR	f	Has she shown you her tree-house? 
EDWARD	m	Not yet. Would you do me the honour,  Miss Dashwood? It is very fine out. 
ELINOR	f	With pleasure. 
ELINOR	f	Margaret has always wanted to travel. 
EDWARD	m	I know. She is heading an expedition  to China shortly. I am to go as her  servant but only on the understanding  that I will be very badly treated. 
ELINOR	f	What will your duties be? 
EDWARD	m	Sword-fighting, administering rum  and swabbing. 
ELINOR	f	Ah. 
EDWARD	m	All I want--all I have ever wanted  is the quiet of a private life but  my mother is determined to see me  distinguished. 
ELINOR	f	As? 
EDWARD	m	She hardly knows. Any fine figure  will suit a great orator, a leading  politician, even a barrister would  serve, but only on the condition  that I drive my own barouche and  dine in the first circles. 
ELINOR	f	And what do you wish for? 
EDWARD	m	I always preferred the church, but  that is not smart enough for my mother  she prefers the army, but that is a  great deal too smart for me. 
ELINOR	f	Would you stay in London? 
EDWARD	m	I hate London. No peace. A country  living is my ideal a small parish  where I might do some good, keep  chickens and give very short sermons. 
ELINOR	f	You talk of feeling idle and useless  imagine how that is compounded when  one has no choice and no hope  whatsoever of any occupation. 
EDWARD	m	Our circumstances are therefore  precisely the same. 
ELINOR	f	Except that you will inherit your  fortune. 
ELINOR	f	We cannot even earn ours. 
EDWARD	m	Perhaps Margaret is right. 
ELINOR	f	Right? 
EDWARD	m	Piracy is our only option. 
EDWARD	m	What is swabbing exactly? 
EDWARD	m	No voice divine the storm allayed No  light propitious shone, When snatched  from all effectual aid, We perished  each alone: But I beneath a rougher  sea, And whelmed in deeper gulfs  than he. 
MARIANNE	f	No, Edward! Listen. 
MARIANNE	f	Can you not feel his despair? Try  again. 
MARIANNE	f	Mamma, look. This has just arrived. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	'I should be pleased to offer you a  home at Barton Cottage as soon as  ever you have need of it' why, it is  from my cousin, Sir John Middleton! 
MARIANNE	f	Even Elinor must approve the rent. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Has Elinor not yet seen this? 
MARIANNE	f	No I will fetch her. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Wait. No. Let us delay. 
MARIANNE	f	Why? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	I think--I believe that Edward and  Elinor have formed an attachment. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	It would be cruel to take her away  so soon and Devonshire is so far. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Why so grave? Do you disapprove her  choice? 
MARIANNE	f	By no means. Edward is very amiable. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Amiable but? 
MARIANNE	f	But there is something wanting. He  is too sedate his reading last night. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Elinor has not your feelings, his  reserve suits her. 
MARIANNE	f	Can he love her? Can the ardour of  the soul really be satisfied with  such polite, concealed affections?  To love is to burn to be on fire,  all made of passion, of adoration,  of sacrifice! Like Juliet, or  Guinevere or Heloise. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	They made rather pathetic ends, dear. 
MARIANNE	f	Pathetic! To die for love? How can  you say so? What could be more  glorious? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	I think that may be taking your  romantic sensibilities a little far. 
MARIANNE	f	The more I know of the world, the  more I am convinced that I shall  never see a man whom I can truly  love. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	You require so much! 
MARIANNE	f	I do not! I require only what any  young woman of taste should a man  who sings well, dances admirably,  rides bravely, reads with passion  and whose tastes agree in every point  with my own. 
MARIANNE	f	Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It  is immortal as immaculate truth 'Tis  not a blossom shed as soon as Youth  Drops from the stem of life for it  will grow In barren regions, where  no waters flow Nor ray of promise  cheats the pensive gloom-- 
MARIANNE	f	What a pity it is that Edward has no  passion for reading. 
ELINOR	f	It was you who asked him to read and  then you made him nervous. 
MARIANNE	f	Me? 
ELINOR	f	But your behaviour to him in all  other respects is perfectly cordial  so I must assume that you like him  in spite of his deficiencies. 
MARIANNE	f	I think him everything that is amiable  and worthy. 
ELINOR	f	Praise indeed! 
MARIANNE	f	But he shall have my unanswering  devotion when you tell me he is to  be my brother. 
MARIANNE	f	How shall I do without you? 
ELINOR	f	Do without me? 
MARIANNE	f	I am sure you will be very happy.  But you must promise not to live too  far away. 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, there is no question of  that is, there is no under standing  between... 
MARIANNE	f	Do you love him? 
ELINOR	f	I do not attempt to deny that I think  very highly of him that I greatly  esteem that I like him. 
MARIANNE	f	Esteem him! Like him! Use those  insipid words again and I shall leave  the room this instant! 
ELINOR	f	Very well. Forgive me. Believe my  feelings to be stronger than I have  declared but further than that you  must not believe. 
MARIANNE	f	'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Or a  Ferrars? 
ELINOR	f	Go to bed! 
MARIANNE	f	'I do not attempt to deny that I  think highly of him greatly esteem  him! Like him!' 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	We are all so happy that you chose  to invite Edward to Norland. He is a  dear boy and we are all very fond of  him. 
FANNY	f	We have great hopes for him. Much is  expected of him by our mother with  regard to his profession 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Naturally. 
FANNY	f	And in marriage. She is determined  that both he and Robert will marry  well. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Of course. But I hope she desires  them to marry for love, first and  foremost? I have always felt that,  contrary to common wisdom, true  affection is by far the most valuable  dowry. 
FANNY	f	Love is all very well, but  unfortunately we cannot always rely  on the heart to lead us in the most  suitable directions. 
FANNY	f	You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward  is entirely the kind of compassionate  person upon whom penniless women can  prey--and having entered into any  kind of understanding, he would never  go back on his word. He is quite  simply incapable of doing so. But it  would lead to his ruin. I worry for  him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has  always made it perfectly plain that  she will withdraw all financial  support from Edward, should he choose  to plant his affections in less...  exalted ground than he deserves. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	I understand you perfectly. 
EDWARD	m	Devonshire! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	My cousin Sir John Middleton has  offered us a small house on his  estate. 
JOHN	m	Sir John Middleton? What is his  situation? He must be a man of  property. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	He is a widower. He lives with his  mother-in-law at Barton Park and it  is Barton Cottage that he offers us. 
FANNY	f	Oh, a cottage! How charming. A little  cottage is always very snug. 
EDWARD	m	But you will not leave before the  summer? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Oh, my dear Edward, we can no longer  trespass upon your sister's good  will. We must leave as soon as  possible. 
MARGARET	f	You will come and stay with us,  Edward! 
EDWARD	m	I should like that very much. 
FANNY	f	Edward has long been expected in  town by our mother. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Come as soon as you can, Edward.  Remember that you are always welcome. 
EDWARD	m	Cannot you take him with you? 
ELINOR	f	We cannot possibly afford him. 
EDWARD	m	Perhaps he could make himself useful  in the kitchen? 
EDWARD	m	Miss Dashwood--Elinor. I must talk  to you. 
EDWARD	m	There is something of great importance  I need... to tell you-- 
EDWARD	m	--about--about my education. 
ELINOR	f	Your education? 
EDWARD	m	Yes. It was less... successful than  it might have been. 
EDWARD	m	It was conducted in Plymouth--oddly  enough. 
ELINOR	f	Indeed? 
EDWARD	m	Yes. Do you know it? 
ELINOR	f	Plymouth? 
EDWARD	m	Yes. 
ELINOR	f	No. 
EDWARD	m	Oh--well--I spent four years there-- at a school run by a--a Mr Pratt-- 
ELINOR	f	Pratt? 
EDWARD	m	Precisely--Mr Pratt--and there, I-- that is to say, he has a-- 
FANNY	f	Edward! Edward! 
FANNY	f	I have been all over for you! You  are needed in London this instant! 
EDWARD	m	Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon  as it is-- 
FANNY	f	No, no, that will not do. Family  affairs are in chaos owing to your  absence. Mother is quite adamant  that you should leave at once. 
EDWARD	m	Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. 
MARGARET	f	Edward promised he would bring the  atlas to Barton for me. 
MARIANNE	f	Did he? Well, I will wager he will  do so in less than a fortnight! 
MARGARET 	f	Are we there yet? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Sir John! 
SIR JOHN	m	Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my  word, here you are, here you are,  here you are! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Sir John, your extraordinary kindness-- 
SIR JOHN	m	Oh, none of that, hush, please, none  of that, but here is my dear mamma- in-law Mrs Jennings. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Was the journey tolerable, you poor  souls? 
SIR JOHN	m	Why did you not come up to the Park  first and take your ease? We saw you  pass--Like many people who live rather  lonely lives together. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	--but I would not wait for you to  come to us, I made John call for the  carriage-- 
SIR JOHN	m	She would not wait, you know. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	--as we get so little company. 
MRS JENNINGS 	f	But I feel as if I know you already-- delightful creatures! 
SIR JOHN 	m	Delightful! And you know you are to  dine at Barton Park every day. 
MRS DASHWOOD 	f	Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot-- 
SIR JOHN 	m	Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall  not brook refusals. I am quite deaf  to 'em, you know-- 
MRS JENNINGS 	f	--deaf-- 
SIR JOHN 	m	But I insist! 
ELINOR 	f	Let us only settle in for a few days,  Sir John, and thank you-- 
SIR JOHN 	m	Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't  bear 'em, embarrassing, you know-- 
SIR JOHN 	m	We will send game and fruit as a  matter of course-- 
MRS JENNINGS 	f	--fruit and game-- 
SIR JOHN 	m	--and the carriage is at your beck  and call-- 
MRS JENNINGS	f	--call--and here is Miss Marianne! 
SIR JOHN	m	Where did you disappear to? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I declare you are the loveliest girl  I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get  them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must  not leave it too long! 
SIR JOHN	m	But, alas, there are no smart young  men hereabouts to woo them-- 
MRS JENNINGS	f	--not a beau for miles! 
SIR JOHN	m	Come, Mother, let us leave them in  peace. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	But there is Colonel Brandon! 
SIR JOHN	m	Excellent fellow! We served in the  East India Regiment together. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Just wait till he sees you! If we  can persuade him out to meet you! 
SIR JOHN	m	Reclusive individual. But you are  fatigued. I can see that you are  fatigued. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Of course she is fatigued! 
SIR JOHN	m	Come along, Mother, we really must  leave them to themselves. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	You must get your maidservant to  make you up some camphor--it is the  best tonic for the staggers! 
SIR JOHN	m	Send Thomas to us for the carriage  when you are ready! 
MARGARET	f	I like them. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	What generosity. 
ELINOR	f	Indeed. I am surprised they did not  offer us their clothing. 
BETSY	f	Sugar is five shilling a pound these  parts, Miss Dashwood. 
ELINOR	f	No more sugar then. 
MRS JENNINGS 	f	Not a beau for miles. 
SIR JOHN 	m	Where can Brandon be, poor fellow? I  hope he has not lamed his horse. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Colonel Brandon is the most eligible  bachelor in the county--he is bound  to do for one of you. Mind, he is a  better age for Miss Dashwood--but I  dare say she left her heart behind  in Sussex, eh? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Aha! I see you, Miss Marianne! I  think I have unearthed a secret! 
SIR JOHN	m	Oho! Have you sniffed one out already,  Mother? You are worse than my best  pointer, Flossie! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	What sort of man is he, Miss Dashwood?  Is he butcher, baker, candlestick- maker? I shall winkle it out of you  somehow, you know! 
SIR JOHN	m	She's horribly good at winkling. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	You are in lonely country now, Miss  Dashwood, none of us has any secrets  here-- 
SIR JOHN	m	--or if we do, we do not keep them  for long! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	He is curate of the parish, I dare  say! 
SIR JOHN	m	Or a handsome lieutenant! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he  in uniform? 
MARGARET	f	He has no profession! 
SIR JOHN	m	No profession! A gentleman, then! 
MARIANNE	f	Margaret, you know perfectly well  there is no such person. 
MARGARET	f	There is! There is! And his name  begins with an F! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Margaret! 
SIR JOHN	m	F indeed! A very promising letter.  Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word,  but I cannot think of a single name  beginning with F-- 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty? 
MARIANNE	f	Sir John, might I play your  pianoforte? 
SIR JOHN	m	Of course, yes--my goodness. We do  not stand on ceremony here, my dear. 
SIR JOHN	m	Brandon! Where have you been? Come,  come and meet our beautiful new  neighbours! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	What a pity you are late, Colonel!  You have missed the most delightful  singing! 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	A great pity, indeed. 
SIR JOHN	m	Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear  friend Colonel Brandon? We served  together in the East Indies and I  assure you there is no better fellow  on earth-- 
MARGARET	f	Have you really been to the East  Indies, Colonel? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I have. 
MARGARET	f	What is it like? 
SIR JOHN	m	Like? Hot. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	The air is full of spices. 
SIR JOHN	m	Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn  to entertain us! 
ELINOR	f	Oh no, Sir John, I do not-- 
SIR JOHN	m	--and I think we can all guess what  key you will sing in! 
SIR JOHN/MRS JENNINGS	m	F major! 
MARIANNE	f	As for you, you have no right, no  right at all, to parade your ignorant  assumptions-- 
MARGARET	f	They are not assumptions. You told  me. 
MARIANNE	f	I told you nothing-- 
MARGARET	f	They'll meet him when he comes,  anyway. 
MARIANNE	f	That is not the point. You do not  speak of such things before strangers-- 
MARGARET	f	But everyone else was-- 
MARIANNE	f	Mrs Jennings is not everyone. 
MARGARET	f	I like her! She talks about things.  We never talk about things. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Hush, please, now that is enough,  Margaret. If you cannot think of  anything appropriate to say, you  will please restrict your remarks to  the weather. 
MARGARET	f	I like Colonel Brandon too. He's  been to places. 
SIR JOHN	m	You know what they're saying, of  course... 
SIR JOHN	m	The word is that you have developed  a taste for--certain company. 
SIR JOHN	m	And why not, say I. A man like you-- in his prime--she'd be a most  fortunate young lady-- 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Marianne Dashwood would no more think  of me than she would of you, John. 
SIR JOHN	m	Brandon, my boy, do not think of  yourself so meanly-- 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	And all the better for her. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Besotted! Excellent match, for he is  rich and she is handsome. 
ELINOR	f	How long have you known the Colonel? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever  I have been here, and I came fifteen  years back. His estate at Delaford  is but four miles hence and he and  John are very thick. He has no wife  or children of his own, for-- 
MRS JENNINGS	f	--he has a tragic history. He loved  a girl once--twenty years ago now--a  ward to his family, but they were  not permitted to marry... 
ELINOR	f	On what grounds? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Money. Eliza was poor. When the father  discovered their amour, she was flung  out of the house and he packed off  into the army. I believe he would  have done himself a harm if not for  John... 
ELINOR	f	What became of the lady? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Oh, she was passed from man to man-- disappeared from all good society.  When Brandon got back from India he  searched for heaven knows how long,  only to find her dying in a poor  house. You have seen how it has  affected him. Once I thought my  daughter Charlotte might have cheered  him up, but she is much better off  where she is. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Look at him now, though. So attentive.  I shall try an experiment on him. 
ELINOR	f	Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings,  leave the poor Colonel alone. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	No, no, it is just the thing--all  suitors need a little help, my dear 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Colonel Brandon! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	We have not heard you play for us of  late! 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	For the simple reason that you have  a far superior musician here. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Perhaps you did not know, Miss  Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares  your passion for music and plays the  piano forte very well. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Play us a duet! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I'll trow you know quite as many  melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Come! Let us see you both side by  side! 
MARIANNE	f	I do not know any duets. Forgive me,  Colonel. 
MARIANNE	f	Oh! Are we never to have a moment's  peace? The rent here may be low but  I think we have it on very hard terms. 
ELINOR	f	Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with  a married daughter--she has nothing  to do but marry off everyone else's. 
BETSY	f	There's a parcel arrived for you,  Miss Dashwood! 
MARGARET	f	A parcel! 
MARIANNE	f	It is too ridiculous! When is a man  to be safe from such wit if age and  infirmity do not protect him? 
ELINOR	f	Infirmity! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I  am at death's door. 
ELINOR	f	It is a miracle your life has extended  this far... 
MARIANNE	f	Did you not hear him complain of a  rheumatism in his shoulder? 
ELINOR	f	A slight ache' I believe was his  phrase... 
MARGARET	f	But Edward said he would bring it  himself. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	'Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,  Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret-- it gives me great pleasure to restore  this atlas to its rightful owner.  Alas, business in London does not  permit me to accompany it, although  this is likely to hurt me far more  than it hurts you. For the present  my memories of your kindness must be  enough to sustain me, and I remain  your devoted servant always. E. C.  Ferrars.' 
MARGARET	f	But why hasn't he come? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	He says he is busy, dear. 
MARGARET	f	He said he'd come. 
MARGARET	f	Why hasn't he come? 
MARIANNE	f	I am taking you for a walk. 
MARGARET	f	No! I've been a walk. 
MARIANNE	f	You need another. 
MARGARET	f	It is going to rain. 
MARIANNE	f	It is not going to rain. 
MARGARET	f	You always say that and then it always  does. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	I fear Mrs Jennings is a bad  influence. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	You must miss him, Elinor. 
ELINOR	f	We are not engaged, Mamma. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	But he loves you, dearest, of that I  am certain. 
ELINOR	f	I am by no means assured of his regard  for me. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Oh, Elinor! 
ELINOR	f	But even were he to feel such a...  preference, I think we should be  foolish to assume that there would  not be many obstacles to his choosing  a woman of no rank who cannot afford  to buy sugar... 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	But Elinor--your heart must tell you-- 
ELINOR	f	In such a situation, Mamma, it is  perhaps better to use one's head. 
MARIANNE	f	Is there any felicity in the world  superior to this? 
MARGARET	f	I told you it would rain. 
MARIANNE	f	Look! There is some blue sky! Let us  chase it! 
MARGARET	f	I'm not supposed to run. 
MARGARET	f	Marianne! 
MARIANNE	f	Help me! 
MARIANNE	f	Margaret, run home and fetch help. 
MARGARET	f	I think it is this way. I will run  as fast as I can, Marianne. 
THE STRANGER	m	Are you hurt? 
MARIANNE	f	Only my ankle. 
THE STRANGER	m	May I have your permission to-- 
THE STRANGER	m	--ascertain if there are any breaks? 
THE STRANGER	m	It is not broken. Now, can you put  your arm about my neck? 
THE STRANGER	m	Allow me to escort you home. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Marianne was sure it would not rain. 
ELINOR	f	Which invariably means it will. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	At last! 
MARGARET	f	She fell over! She fell down--and  he's carrying her! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Marianne! 
ELINOR	f	In here, sir--this way. Margaret,  open the door wider. Please, sir,  lay her here. Marianne, are you in  pain? 
THE STRANGER	m	It is a twisted ankle. 
MARIANNE	f	Do not be alarmed, Mamma. 
THE STRANGER	m	I can assure you it is not serious.  I took the liberty of feeling the  bone and it is perfectly sound. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Sir, I cannot even begin to thank  you. 
THE STRANGER	m	Please do not think of it. I'm  honoured of be of service. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Will you not be seated? 
THE STRANGER	m	Pray excuse me--I have no desire to  leave a water mark! But permit me to  call tomorrow afternoon and inquire  after the patient? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	We shall look forward to it! 
MARIANNE	f	His name! His name! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Please tell us to whom we are so  much obliged? 
THE STRANGER	m	John Willoughby of Allenham--your  servant, ma'am! 
MARIANNE	f	Mr John Willoughby of Allenham! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	What an impressive gentleman! 
MARIANNE	f	He lifted me as if I weighed no more  than a dried leaf! 
ELINOR	f	Is he human? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Tell me if I hurt you. 
ELINOR	f	She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret,  ask Betsy to make up a cold compress,  please. 
MARGARET	f	Did you see him? He expressed himself  well, did he not? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	With great decorum and honour. 
MARIANNE	f	And spirit and wit and feeling. 
ELINOR	f	And economy--ten words at most. 
MARIANNE	f	And he is to come tomorrow! 
ELINOR	f	You must change, Marianne--you will  catch a cold. 
MARIANNE	f	What care I for colds when there is  such a man? 
ELINOR	f	You will care very much when your  nose swells up. 
MARIANNE	f	You are right. Help me, Elinor. 
MARGARET	f	What has happened? 
ELINOR	f	We have decided to give you to the  Gypsies. 
MARGARET	f	Will they be married before Edward  and Elinor, do you think, Mamma? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Margaret, you are worse than Mrs  Jennings. 
SIR JOHN 	m	Mr Willoughby is well worth catching,  Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must  not expect to have all the men to  herself! 
MARIANNE	f	But what do you know of Mr Willoughby,  Sir John? 
SIR JOHN	m	Decent shot--and there is not a bolder  rider in all England. 
MARIANNE	f	But what is he like? 
SIR JOHN	m	Like? 
MARIANNE	f	What are his tastes? His passions?  His pursuits? 
SIR JOHN	m	Well, he has the nicest little bitch  of a pointer--was she out with him  yesterday? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Where is Allenham, Sir John? 
SIR JOHN	m	Nice little estate three miles east.  He is to inherit it from an elderly  relative--Lady Allen is her name. 
MARGARET	f	It is Colonel Brandon. I shall go  outside and keep watch. 
SIR JOHN	m	You are all on the lookout for  Willoughby, eh? Dear me, poor Brandon.  You will none of you think of him  now. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	How is the invalid? 
MARIANNE	f	Thank you so much, Colonel. 
SIR JOHN	m	Miss Marianne, I cannot see why you  should set your cap at Mr Willoughby  when you have already made such a  splendid conquest! 
MARIANNE	f	I have no intention of 'setting my  cap' at anyone, Sir John! 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Mr Willoughby--Lady Allen's nephew? 
SIR JOHN	m	Aye, he visits every year for he is  to inherit Allenham--and he has a  very pretty estate of his own, Miss  Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset.  If I were you, I would not give him  up to my younger sister in spite of  all this tumbling down hills. 
SIR JOHN	m	Here is the man himself. Come, Brandon-- we know when we are not wanted. Let  us leave him to the ladies! 
ELINOR	f	Marianne! Sir John and the Colonel  are leaving. 
MARIANNE	f	Goodbye, Colonel. Thank you for the  flowers. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	How do you do, Colonel? 
SIR JOHN	m	How does he do? How do you do, more  like. Go on in, they're waiting for  you! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Mr Willoughby! What a pleasure to  see you again! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	The pleasure is all mine, I can  asstire you. I trust Miss Marianne  has not caught cold? 
MARIANNE	f	You have found out my name! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Of course. The neighbourhood is  crawling with my spies. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	And since you cannot venture out to  nature, nature must be brought to  you! 
MARIANNE	f	How beautiful. These are not from  the hothouse. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Ah! I see mine is not the first  offering, nor the most elegant. I am  afraid I obtained these from an  obliging field. 
MARIANNE	f	But I have always preferred wild  flowers! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	I suspected as much. 
ELINOR	f	I will put these in water. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is  beyond expression-- 
WILLOUGHBY	?	But it is I who am grateful. I have  often passed this cottage and grieved  for its lonely state--and then the  first news I had from Lady Allen  when I arrived was that it was taken.  I felt a peculiar interest in the  event which nothing can account for  but my present delight in meeting  you. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets? 
MARIANNE/ELINOR/MRS DASHWOOD	?	I am. / We all are. / Marianne. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Marianne has been reading them out  to us. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Which are your favourites? 
MARIANNE	f	Without a doubt, mine is 116. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Let me not to the marriage of true  minds Admit impediments. Love is not  love Which alters when it alteration  finds, Or bends with the remover to  remove--then how does it go? 
MARIANNE	f	'0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.' 
WILLOUGHBY	?	'That looks on storms'--or is it  tempests? Let me find it. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	It is strange you should be reading  them--for, look, I carry this with  me always. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets  are yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman  against further injury! 
MARIANNE	f	Goodbye! Thank you! 
ELINOR	f	Good work, Marianne! You have covered  all forms of poetry; another meeting  will ascertain his views on nature  and romantic attachments and then  you will have nothing left to talk  about and the acquaintanceship will  be over. 
MARIANNE	f	I suppose I have erred against  decorum. I should have been dull and  spiritless and talked only of the  weather, or the state of the roads. 
ELINOR	f	No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no  doubt of your enthusiasm for him. 
MARIANNE	f	Why should he doubt it? Why should I  hide my regard? 
ELINOR	f	No particular reason, Marianne, only  that we know so little of him-- 
MARIANNE	f	But time alone does not determine  intimacy. Seven years would be  insufficient to make some people  acquainted with each other and seven  days are more than enough for others. 
ELINOR	f	Or seven hours in this case. 
MARIANNE	f	I feel I know Mr Willoughby well  already. If I had weaker, more shallow  feelings perhaps I could conceal  them, as you do-- 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Marianne, that is not fair-- 
MARIANNE	f	I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean 
ELINOR	f	I know. Do not trouble yourself,  Marianne. 
MARIANNE	f	I do not understand her, Mamma. Why  does she never mention Edward? I  have never even seen her cry about  him, or about Norland. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or  I, dear. She does not like to be  swayed by her emotions. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Surely you are not going to deny us  beef as well as sugar? 
ELINOR	f	There is nothing under tenpence a  pound. We have to economise. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Do you want us to starve? 
ELINOR	f	No. Just not to eat beef. 
MARIANNE	f	If there was any true impropriety in  my behaviour, I should be sensible  of it, Elinor-- 
ELINOR	f	But as it has already exposed you to  some very impertinent remarks, do  you not begin to doubt your own  discretion? 
MARIANNE	f	If the impertinent remarks of such  as Mrs Jennings are proof of  impropriety, then we are all offending  every moment of our lives-- 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne! 
ELINOR	f	Good morning, Colonel! 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I come to issue an invitation. A  picnic on my estate at Delaford--if  you would care to join us on Thursday  next. Mrs Jennings's daughter and  her husband are traveling up  especially. 
ELINOR	f	Thank you, Colonel, we shall be  delighted. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I will of course be including Mr  Willoughby in the party. 
MARIANNE	f	I should be delighted to join you,  Colonel! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good  morning, Colonel. 
MARIANNE	f	The Colonel has invited us to  Delaford, Willoughby! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Excellent. I understand you have a  particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	A Broadwood Grand. 
MARIANNE	f	A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really  be able to play for you! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	We shall look forward to it! 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Your sister seems very happy. 
ELINOR	f	Yes. Marianne does not approve of  hiding her emotions. In fact, her  romantic prejudices have the  unfortunate tendency to set propriety  at naught. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	She is wholly unspoilt. 
ELINOR	f	Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The  sooner she becomes acquainted with  the ways of the world, the better. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I knew a lady like your sister--the  same impulsive sweetness of temper-- who was forced into, as you put it,  a better acquaintance with the world.  The result was only ruination and  despair. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood,  when Charlotte and her lord and master  appeared with our cousin Lucy! The  last person I expected to see! 'Where  did you pop out from, Miss?' says I.  I was never so surprised to see anyone  in all my life! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	She probably came on purpose to share  the fun, for there are no funds for  such luxuries at home, poor thing. 
LUCY	f	I had not seen you for so long, dear  Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the  opportunity. 
CHARLOTTE	f	Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses  Dashwood she wanted to see, not  Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing  but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood  that' for I don't know how long! And  what do you think of them now you do  see them, Lucy? My mother has talked  of nothing else in her letters since  you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr  Palmer--are they not the very  creatures she describes? 
MR PALMER	m	Nothing like. 
CHARLOTTE	f	Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are  quite rude today? He is to be an MP,  you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is  very fatiguing for him for he is  forced to make everybody like him-- he says it is quite shocking-- 
MRS PALMER	f	I never said anything so irrational.  Don't palm all your abuses of the  language upon me. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always  out of humour. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Here he is! Now you shall see,  Charlotte. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	How now, Mr Willoughby! You must  greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr  Palmer-- 
WILLOUGHBY	?	How do you do? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	And my little cousin, Miss Lucy  Steele. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Welcome to our party, Miss Steele! 
CHARLOTTE	f	I know Mr Willoughby extremely well-- not that I ever spoke to him but I  have seen him forever in town. Your  sister is monstrous lucky to get  him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is  in love with her as well, which is a  very great compliment for he hardly  ever falls in love with anyone. 
LUCY	f	May I beg a seat beside you, Miss  Dashwood? I have so longed to make  your better acquaintance! I have  heard nothing but the highest praise  for you. 
ELINOR	f	I would be delighted. But Sir John  and Mrs Jennings are too excessive  in their compliments. I am sure to  disappoint. 
LUCY	f	No, for it was from quite another  source that I heard you praised and  one not at all inclined to  exaggeration. 
SIR JOHN	m	What can this be? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	My horse! Quickly! 
SIR JOHN	m	What is the matter, Brandon? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I must away to London. 
SIR JOHN	m	No! Impossible! 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Imperative. 
SIR JOHN	m	But Brandon, we are all assembled.  We cannot picnic at Delaford without  our host! Go up to town tomorrow. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Or wait till we return and start  then--you would not be six hours  later. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I cannot afford to lose one minute. 
LUCY	f	Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it!  Just when I was to have the  opportunity of speaking with you. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Frailty, thy name is Brandon! 
MARIANNE	f	There are some people who cannot  bear a party of pleasure. I think he  wrote the letter himself as a trick  for getting out of it. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	You are a very wicked pair, Colonel  Brandon will be sadly missed. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Why? When he is the kind of man that  everyone speaks well of and no one  wants to talk to. 
MARIANNE	f	Exactly! 
ELINOR	f	Nonsense. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Colonel Brandon is very highly  esteemed at the Park. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Which is enough censure in itself. 
ELINOR	f	Really, Willoughby! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you  and your wicked ways--oh! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your  beau, reveal him, I say! Let's have  no secrets between friends! Let me  winkle them out of you! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do  not have you married to the Colonel  by teatime, I shall swallow my own  bonnet. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	As if you could marry such a  character. 
ELINOR	f	Why should you dislike him? 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Because he has threatened me with  rain when I wanted it fine, he has  found fault with the balance of my  curricle and I cannot persuade him  to buy my brown mare. If it will be  of any satisfaction to you, however,  to be told I believe his character  to be in all other respects  irreproachable, I am ready to confess  it. And in return for an  acknowledgement that must give me  some pain. You cannot deny me the privilege... of disliking him... as much as I adore... 
WILLOUGHBY	?	--this cottage! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	I have great plans for improvements  to it, you know, Mr Willoughby. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Now that I will never consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its  walls. Were I rich enough, I would  instantly pull down Combe Magna and  build it up again in the exact image  of that cottage! 
ELINOR	f	With dark, narrow stairs, a poky  hall and a fire that smokes? 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Especially the fire that smokes!  Then I might be as happy at Combe  Magna as I have been at Barton. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	But this place has one claim on my  affection which no other can possibly  share. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Promise me you will never change it. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	I do not have the heart. 
ELINOR	f	Or the money. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Miss Marianne, will you--will you do  me the honour of granting me an  interview tomorrow--alone? 
MARIANNE	f	Willoughby, we are always alone! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	But there is something very particular  I should like to ask you. 
MARIANNE	f	Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I  may stay behind from church. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Thank you. Until tomorrow then--Miss  Marianne. 
MARGARET	f	Do you think he will kneel down when  he asks her? 
ELINOR	f	Shhh! 
MARGARET	f	They always kneel down. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	What is wrong, my dearest? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Willoughby! What is the matter? 
WILLOUGHBY	?	I--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am  sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has  exercised the privilege of riches  upon a dependent cousin and is sending  me to London. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	When--this morning? 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Almost this moment. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	How very disappointing! But your  business will not detain you from us  for long, I hope? 
WILLOUGHBY	?	You are very kind--but I have no  idea of returning immediately to  Devonshire. I am seldom invited to  Allenham more than once a year. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait  for an invitation from Barton Cottage? 
WILLOUGHBY	?	My engagements at present are of  such a nature--that is--I dare not  flatter myself-- 
WILLOUGHBY	?	It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself further. 
MARGARET	f	Willoughby, come back! 
ELINOR	f	Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to  make a cup of hot tea for Marianne. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	What is wrong, my love? 
MARIANNE	f	Nothing! Please do not ask me  questions! 
MARIANNE	f	Please let me be! 
ELINOR	f	They must have quarreled. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	That is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady  Allen--disapproves of his regard for  Marianne and has invented an excuse  to send him away? 
ELINOR	f	Then why did he not say as much? It  is not like Willoughby to be  secretive. Did he think Marianne was  richer than she is? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	How could he? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	What is it you suspect him of? 
ELINOR	f	I can hardly tell you. But why was  his manner so guilty? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	What are you saying, Elinor? That he  has been acting a part to your sister  for all this time? 
ELINOR	f	No, he loves her, I am sure. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Of course he loves her! 
ELINOR	f	But has he left her with any assurance  of his return? Cannot you ask her if  he has proposed? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Certainly not. I cannot force a  confidence from Marianne and nor  must you. We must trust her to confide  in us in her own time. 
ELINOR	f	There was something so underhand in  the manner of his leaving. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	You are resolved, then, to think the  worst of him. 
ELINOR	f	Not resolved-- 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	I prefer to give him the benefit of  my good opinion. He deserves no less.  From all of us. 
ELINOR	f	Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby-- 
MARGARET	f	She would not let me in. 
MARIANNE	f	How like a winter hath my absence  been from thee, the pleasure of the  fleeting year! What freezings have I  felt, what dark days seen! What old  December's bareness everywhere! 
CHARLOTTE	f	Oh! If only this rain would stop! 
MR PALMER	m	If only you would stop. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	'Twas you took her off my hands, Mr  Palmer, and a very good bargain you  made of it too, but now I have the  whip hand over you for you cannot  give her back! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Miss Marianne, come and play a round  with us! Looking out at the weather  will not bring him back. 
CHARLOTTE	f	She ate nothing at dinner. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Mind, we are all a little forlorn  these days. London has swallowed all  our company. 
LUCY	f	Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we  might have our--discussion. 
ELINOR	f	Our discussion? 
LUCY	f	There is a particular question I  have long wanted to ask you, but  perhaps you will think me impertinent? 
ELINOR	f	I cannot imagine so. 
LUCY	f	But it is an odd question. Forgive  me, I have no wish to trouble you-- 
ELINOR	f	My dear Miss Steele-- 
CHARLOTTE	f	Miss Dashwood, if only Mr Willoughby  had gone home to Combe Magna, we  could have taken Miss Marianne to  see him! For we live but half a mile  away. 
MR PALMER	m	Five and a half. 
CHARLOTTE	f	No, I cannot believe it is that far,  for you can see the place from the  top of our hill. Is it really five  and a half miles? No! I cannot believe  it. 
MR PALMER	m	Try. 
ELINOR	f	You have my permission to ask any  manner of question, if that is of  any help. 
LUCY	f	Thank you. I wonder, are you at all  acquainted with your sister-in-law's  mother? Mrs Ferrars? 
ELINOR	f	With Fanny's mother? No, I have never  met her. 
LUCY	f	I am sure you think me strange for  inquiring--if I dared tell-- 
MRS JENNINGS	f	If she tells you aught of the famous  'Mr F', Lucy, you are to pass it on. 
LUCY	f	Will you take a turn with me, Miss  Dashwood? 
ELINOR	f	I had no idea at all that you were  connected with that family. 
LUCY	f	Oh! I am certainly nothing to Mrs  Ferrars at present--but the time may  come when we may be very intimately  connected. 
ELINOR	f	What do you mean? Do you have an  understanding with Fanny's brother  Robert? 
LUCY	f	The youngest? No, I never saw him in  my life. No, with Edward. 
ELINOR	f	Edward? 
ELINOR	f	Edward Ferrars? 
LUCY	f	Edward and I have been secretly  engaged these five years. 
LUCY	f	You may well be surprised. I should  never have mentioned it, had I not  known I could entirely trust you to  keep our secret. Edward cannot mind  me telling you for he looks on you  quite as his own sister. 
ELINOR	f	I am sorry, but we surely--we cannot  mean the same Mr Ferrars? 
LUCY	f	The very same--he was four years  under the tutelage of my uncle Mr  Pratt, down in Plymouth. Has he never  spoken of it? 
ELINOR	f	Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has. 
LUCY	f	I was very unwilling to enter into  it without his mother's approval but  we loved each other with too great a  passion for prudence. Though you do  nor know him so well as I, Miss  Dashwood, you must have seen how  capable he is of making a woman  sincerely attached to him. I cannot  pretend it has not been very hard on  us both. We can hardly meet above  twice a year. 
LUCY	f	You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood-- are you quite well? 
ELINOR	f	Perfectly well, thank you. 
LUCY	f	I have not offended you? 
ELINOR	f	On the contrary. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I can stand it no longer, I must  know what you are saying, Lucy! Miss  Dashwood is quite engrossed! 
LUCY	f	Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds  out, it will ruin him--you must not  tell a soul! Edward says you would  not break your word to save your  life! Promise me! 
ELINOR	f	I give you my word. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Well, what can have fascinated you  to such an extent, Miss Dashwood? 
CHARLOTTE	f	Tell us all! 
LUCY	f	We were talking of London, ma'am,  and all its--diversions. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Do you hear, Charlotte? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	While you were so busy whispering,  Charlotte and I have concocted a  plan! 
CHARLOTTE	f	It is the best plan in the world. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I make for London shortly and I invite  you, Lucy, and both the Misses  Dashwood to join me! 
MARIANNE	f	London! 
MARGARET	f	Oh, can I go! Can I go? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	You know perfectly well you are too  young, dearest. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I shall convey you all to my house  in Berkeley Street and we shall taste  all the delights of the season--what  say you? 
MARGARET	f	Oh, please can I go? I'm twelve soon. 
CHARLOTTE	f	Mr Palmer, do you not long to have  the Misses Dashwood come to London? 
MR PALMER	m	I came into Devonshire with no other  view. 
ELINOR	f	Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but  we cannot possibly leave our mother... 
LUCY	f	Indeed, the loss would be too great. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Your mother can spare you very well. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Of course I can! 
CHARLOTTE	f	Of course she can! 
SIR JOHN	m	And look at Miss Marianne--it would  break her heart to deny her! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I will brook no refusal, Miss  Dashwood! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Let you and me strike hands upon the  bargain--and if I do not have the  three of you married by Christmas,  it will not be my fault! 
MARIANNE	f	I was never so grateful in all my  life as I am to Mrs Jennings. What a  kind woman she is! I like her more  than I can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall  see Willoughby. Think how surprised  he will be! And you will see Edward! 
MARIANNE	f	Are you asleep? 
ELINOR	f	With you in the room? 
MARIANNE	f	I do not believe you feel as calm as  you look, not even you, Elinor. I  will never sleep tonight! Oh, what  were you and Miss Steele whispering  about so long? 
ELINOR	f	Nothing of significance. 
LUCY	f	I have written to Edward, Miss  Dashwood, and yet I do not know how  much I may see of him. Secrecy is  vital--he will never be able to call. 
ELINOR	f	I should imagine not. 
LUCY	f	It is so hard. I believe my only  comfort has been the constancy of  his affection. 
ELINOR	f	You are fortunate, over such a lengthy  engagement, never to have had any  doubts on that score. 
LUCY	f	Oh! I am of rather a jealous nature  and if he had talked more of one  young lady than any other... but he  has never given a moment's alarm on  that count. 
LUCY	f	Imagine how glad he will be to learn  that we are friends! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	To be sure, my dear, you must just  hand it to Pigeon there. He will  take care of it. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Lord above, you do not waste any  time, Miss Marianne! 
LUCY	f	A letter! So they are definitely  engaged! Mrs Jennings says your sister  will buy her wedding clothes here in  town. 
ELINOR	f	Indeed Miss Steele, I know of no  such plan. 
ELINOR	f	John and Fanny are in town. I think  we shall be forced to see them. 
ELINOR	f	I think it was for next door. 
MARIANNE	f	Yes, you are right. 
MARIANNE	f	Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed  it is! 
MARIANNE	f	Oh! Excuse me, Colonel-- 
ELINOR	f	Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to  see you! Have you been in London all  this while? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I have. How is your dear mother? 
ELINOR	f	Very well, thank you. 
ELINOR	f	Colonel, is there anything-- 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but I  have heard reports through town...  is it impossible to--but I could  have no chance of succeeding--indeed  I hardly know what to do. Tell me  once and for all, is everything  finally resolved between your sister  and Mr Willoughby? 
ELINOR	f	Colonel, though neither one has  informed me of their under standing,  I have no doubt of their mutual  affection. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Thank you, Miss Dashwood. To your  sister I wish all imaginable  happiness. To Mr Willoughby, that  he... may endeavour to deserve her. 
ELINOR	f	What do you mean? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Forgive me, I--forgive me. 
MARIANNE	f	Where is dear Edward, John? We expect  to see him daily. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	And who is 'dear Edward'? 
CHARLOTTE	f	Who indeed? 
FANNY	f	My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward  Ferrars. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F? 
MARIANNE	f	Are there any messages, Pigeon? 
PIGEON	m	No, ma'am. 
MARIANNE	f	No message at all? No cards? 
PIGEON	m	None, ma am. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I note you do not inquire for your  messages, Miss Dashwood! 
ELINOR	f	No, for I do not expect any, Mrs  Jennings. I have very little  acquaintance in town. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	She is as sly as you, Lucy! 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, is anything wrong? 
MARIANNE	f	Nothing at all. Go back to sleep. 
PIGEON	m	No messages, ma am. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Do not fret, my dear. I am told that  this good weather is keeping many  sportsmen in the country at present,  but the frost will drive them back  to town very soon, depend upon it. 
MARIANNE	f	Of course! I had not thought of-- thank you, Mrs Jennings! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	And Miss Dashwood may set her heart  at rest, for I overheard your sister- in-law say that she was to bring the  elusive Mr F to the ball tonight! 
CHARLOTTE	f	This is very merry! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	There you are! Goodness, how hot it  is, Mrs Dashwood. You are not alone,  I trust? 
FANNY	f	Indeed not. John is just gone to  fetch my brother--he has been eating  ices. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Your brother! I declare, that is  good news indeed. At long last! 
LUCY	f	Miss Dashwood, I declare I shall  faint clean away. 
JOHN	m	Mrs Jennings, may I present my brother- in-law? 
JOHN	m	Mr Robert Ferrars! 
ROBERT	m	My dear ladies--we meet at last! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	So you must be the younger brother?  Is Mr Edward not here? Miss Dashwood  here was counting on him! 
ROBERT	m	Oh! He is far too busy for such  gatherings--and has no special  acquaintance here to make his  attendance worthwhile. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Well, I declare, I do not know what  the young men are about these days-- are they all in hiding? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Come, Mr Robert, in the absence of  your brother, you must dance with  our lovely Miss Dashwood! 
ROBERT	m	It would be my honour. 
ROBERT	m	And perhaps Miss Steele might consider  reserving the allemande? 
ROBERT	m	You reside in Devonshire, I b'lieve,  Miss Dashwood? 
ELINOR	f	We do. 
ROBERT	m	In a cottage? 
ELINOR	f	Yes. 
ROBERT	m	I am excessively fond of a cottage.  If I had any money to spare, I should  build one myself. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	How do you do, Miss Dashwood? 
ELINOR	f	I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby. 
WILLOUGHBY	?	How is your--family? 
ELINOR	f	We are all extremely well, Mr  Willoughby--thank you for your kind  inquiry. 
MARIANNE	f	Willoughby! 
MARIANNE	f	Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor  shake hands with me? 
WILLOUGHBY	?	How do you do, Miss Marianne? 
MARIANNE	f	Willoughby, what is the matter? Why  have you not come to see me? Were  you not in London? Have you nor  received my letters? 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving  the information which you were so  good as to send me. 
MARIANNE	f	For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell  me what is wrong! 
WILLOUGHBY	?	Thank you--I am most obliged. If you  will excuse me, I must return to my  party. 
MARIANNE	f	Willoughby! 
ELINOR	f	Marianne! Come away! 
MARIANNE	f	Go to him, Elinor--force him to come  to me. 
ELINOR	f	Dearest, do not betray what you feel  to everyone present! This is not the  place for explanations-- 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Come along, dear. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Will you come, Lucy? 
LUCY	f	Oh, are we leaving so soon? 
ROBERT	m	If I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings,  it would be our pleasure to escort  your young charge home. 
LUCY	f	How very kind! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	That is very handsome-- 
ROBERT	m	She actually sent him messages during  the night? 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, please tell me-- 
MARIANNE	f	Do not ask me questions! 
ELINOR	f	You have no confidence in me. 
MARIANNE	f	This reproach from you! You, who  confide in no one. 
ELINOR	f	I have nothing to tell. 
MARIANNE	f	Nor I. We have neither of us anything  to tell. I because I conceal nothing  and you because you communicate  nothing. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	There now! Lovers' quarrels are swift  to heal! That letter will do the  trick, mark my word. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I must be off. I hope he won't keep  her waiting much longer, Miss  Dashwood. It hurts to see her looking  so forlorn. 
LUCY	f	What a welcome I had from Edward's  family, Miss Dashwood--I am surprised  you never told me what an agreeable  woman your sister-in-law is! And Mr  Robert--all so affable! 
ELINOR	f	It is perhaps fortunate that none of  them knows of your engagement. Excuse  me. 
MARIANNE	f	'My dear Madam--I am quite at a loss  to discover in what point I could be  so unfortunate as to offend you. My  esteem for your family is very sincere  but if I have given rise to a belief  of more than I felt or meant to  express, I shall reproach myself for  not having been more guarded. My  affections have long been engaged  elsewhere and it is with great regret  that I return your letters and the  lock of hair which you so obligingly  bestowed upon me. I am etc. John  Willoughby.' 
ELINOR	f	Oh, Marianne. 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, oh, Marianne--it is better  to know at once what his intentions  are. Dearest, think of what you would  have felt if your engagement had  carried on for months and months  before he chose to put an end to it. 
MARIANNE	f	We are not engaged. 
ELINOR	f	But you wrote to him! I thought then  that he must have left you with some  kind of understanding? 
MARIANNE	f	No--he is not so unworthy as you  think him. 
ELINOR	f	Not so unworthy! Did he tell you  that he loved you? 
MARIANNE	f	Yes. No--never absolutely. It was  every day implied, but never declared.  Sometimes I thought it had been, but  it never was. He has broken no vow. 
ELINOR	f	He has broken faith with all of us,  he made us all believe he loved you. 
MARIANNE	f	He did! He did--he loved me as I  loved him. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	I had to come straight up--how are  you, Miss Marianne? 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Poor thing! She looks very bad. No  wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but  too true. I was told here in the  street by Miss Morton, who is a great  friend: he is to be married at the  end of the month--to a Miss Grey  with fifty thousand pounds. Well,  said I, if 'tis true, then he is a  good-for-nothing who has used my  young friend abominably ill, and I  wish with all my soul that his wife  may plague his heart out! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	But he is not the only young man  worth having, my dear, and with your  pretty face you will never want for  admirers. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Ah, me! She had better have her cry  out and have done with it. I will go  and look out something to tempt her-- does she care for olives? 
ELINOR	f	I cannot tell you. 
MARIANNE	f	I cannot believe his nature capable  of such cruelty! 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, there is no excuse for him-- this is his hand-- 
MARIANNE	f	But it cannot be his heart! Oh, Mamma!  I want Mamma! Elinor, please take me  home! Cannot we go tomorrow? 
ELINOR	f	There is no one to take us. 
MARIANNE	f	Cannot we hire a carriage? 
ELINOR	f	We have no money--and indeed we owe  Mrs Jennings more courtesy. 
MARIANNE	f	All she wants is gossip and she only  likes me because I supply it! Oh,  God! I cannot endure to stay. 
ELINOR	f	I will find a way. I promise. 
ROBERT	m	Apparently they never were engaged. 
FANNY	f	Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds.  Marianne is virtually penniless. 
JOHN	m	She cannot have expected him to go  through with it. But I feel for  Marianne--she will lose her bloom  and end a spinster like Elinor. I  think, my dear, we might consider  having them to stay with us for a  few days--we are, after all, family,  and my father. 
FANNY	f	My love, I would ask them with all  my heart, but I have already asked  Miss Steele for a visit and we cannot  deprive Mrs Jennings of all her  company at once. We can invite your  sisters some other year, you know,  and Miss Steele will profit far more  from your generosity--poor girl! 
JOHN	m	That is very thoughtful, Fanny. We  shall ask Elinor and Marianne next  year, then... Certainly! 
ELINOR	f	Thank you for coming, Colonel. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	How does your sister? 
ELINOR	f	I must get her home as quickly as  possible. The Palmers can take us as  far as Cleveland, which is but a day  from Barton-- 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Then permit me to accompany you and  take you straight on from Cleveland  to Barton myself. 
ELINOR	f	I confess that is precisely what I  had hoped for. Marianne suffers  cruelly, and what pains me most is  how hard she tries to justify Mr  Willoughby. But you know her  disposition. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Perhaps I--my regard for you all-- Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to  prove it by relating some  circumstances which nothing but an  earnest desire of being useful-- 
ELINOR	f	You have something to tell me of Mr  Willoughby. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	When I quitted Barton last--but I  must go further back. A short account  of myself will be necessary. No  doubt... no doubt Mrs Jennings has  apprised you of certain events in my  past--the sad outcome of my connection  with a young woman named Eliza. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	What is not commonly known is that  twenty years ago, Eliza bore an  illegitimate child. The father,  whoever he was, abandoned them. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	As she lay dying, she begged me to  look after the child. Eliza died in  my arms, broken, wasted away--ah!  Miss Dashwood, such a subject-- untouched for so many years--it is  dangerous... 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I had failed Eliza in every other  way--I could not refuse her now. I  took the child--Beth is her name-- and placed her with a family where I  could be sure she would be well looked  after. I saw her whenever I could. I  saw that she was headstrong like her  mother--and, God forgive me, I  indulged her, I allowed her too much  freedom. Almost a year ago, she  disappeared. 
ELINOR	f	Disappeared! 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I instigated a search but for eight  months I was left to imagine the  worst. At last, on the day of the  Delaford picnic, I received the first  news her. She was with child... and  the blackguard who had-- 
ELINOR	f	Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Before I could return to confront  him, Lady Allen learned of his  behaviour and turned him from the  house. He beat a hasty retreat to  London-- 
ELINOR	f	Yes! He left us that morning, without  any explanation! 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Lady Allen had annulled his legacy.  He was left with next to nothing,  and in danger of losing all that  remained to his debtors-- 
ELINOR	f	--and so abandoned Marianne for Miss  Grey and her fifty thousand pounds. 
ELINOR	f	Have you seen Mr Willoughby since  you learned...? 
BRANDON	m	We met by appointment, he to defend,  I to punish his conduct. 
BRANDON	m	We returned unwounded, so the meeting  never got abroad. 
ELINOR	f	Is Beth still in town? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	She has chosen to go into the country  for her confinement. Such has been  the unhappy resemblance between the  fate of mother and daughter, and so  imperfectly have I discharged my  trust. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I would not have burdened you, Miss  Dashwood, had I not from my heart  believed it might, in time, lessen  your sister's regrets. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I have described Mr Willoughby as  the worst of libertines--but I have  since learned from Lady Allen that  he did mean to propose that day.  Therefore I cannot deny that his  intentions towards Marianne were  honourable, and I feel certain he  would have married her, had it not  been for--for the money. 
ELINOR	f	Dearest, was I right to tell you? 
MARIANNE	f	Of course. 
ELINOR	f	Whatever his past actions, whatever  his present course, at least you may  be certain that he loved you. 
MARIANNE	f	But not enough. Not enough. 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Here is someone to cheer you up,  Miss Dashwood! 
LUCY	f	How is your dear sister, Miss  Dashwood? Poor thing! I must say, I  do not know what I should do if a  man treated me with so little respect. 
ELINOR	f	I hope you are enjoying your stay  with John and Fanny, Miss Steele? 
LUCY	f	I was never so happy in my entire  life, Miss Dashwood! I do believe  your sister-in-law has taken quite a  fancy to me. I had to come and tell  you--for you cannot imagine what has  happened! 
ELINOR	f	No, I cannot. 
LUCY	f	Yesterday I was introduced to Edward's  mother! 
ELINOR	f	Indeed? 
LUCY	f	And she was a vast deal more than  civil. I have not yet seen Edward  but now I feel sure to very soon-- 
MAID	m	There's a Mr Edward Ferrars to see  you, Miss Dashwood. 
ELINOR	f	Do ask him to come up. 
EDWARD	m	Miss Dashwood, how can I-- 
ELINOR	f	Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see  you. You... know Miss Steele, of  course. 
EDWARD	m	How do you do, Miss Steele. 
LUCY	f	I am well, thank you, Mr Ferrars. 
ELINOR	f	Do sit down, Mr Ferrars. 
LUCY	f	You must be surprised to find me  here, Mr Ferrars! I expect you thought  I was at your sister's house. 
ELINOR	f	Let me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars.  She would be most disappointed to  miss you. 
MARIANNE	f	Edward! I heard your voice! At last  you have found us! 
EDWARD	m	Forgive me, Marianne, my visit is  shamefully overdue. You are pale. I  hope you have not been unwell? 
MARIANNE	f	Oh, don't think of me--Elinor is  well, you see, that must be enough  for both of us! 
EDWARD	m	How do you like London, Marianne? 
MARIANNE	f	Not at all. The sight of you is all  the pleasure it has afforded, is  that not so, Elinor? 
MARIANNE	f	Why have you taken so long to come  and see us? 
EDWARD	m	I have been much engaged elsewhere. 
MARIANNE	f	Engaged elsewhere! But what was that  when there were such friends to be  met? 
LUCY	f	Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think  young men never honour their  engagements, little or great. 
MARIANNE	f	No, indeed--for Edward is the most  fearful of giving pain and the most  incapable of being selfish of anyone  I ever saw. 
MARIANNE	f	Edward, will you not sit? Elinor,  help me to persuade him. 
EDWARD	m	Forgive me but I must take my leave-- 
MARIANNE	f	But you are only just arrived! 
EDWARD	m	You must excuse me, I have a  commission to attend to for Fanny-- 
LUCY	f	In that case perhaps you might escort  me back to your sister's house, Mr  Ferrars? 
EDWARD	m	I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss  Dashwood, Miss Marianne. 
MARIANNE	f	Why did you not urge him to stay? 
ELINOR	f	He must have had his reasons for  going. 
MARIANNE	f	His reason was no doubt your coldness.  If I were Edward I would assume you  did not care for me at all. 
LUCY	f	Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly  t'other day. When I think of her,  deserted and abandoned, it frightens  me to think I shall never marry. 
FANNY	f	Nonsense. You will marry far better  than either of the Dashwood girls. 
LUCY	f	How can that possibly be? 
FANNY	f	You have ten times their sense and  looks. 
LUCY	f	But I have no dowry. 
FANNY	f	There are qualities which will always  make up for that, and you have them  in abundance. It would not surprise  me if you were to marry far and away  beyond your expectations. 
LUCY	f	I wish it might be so. There is a  young man-- 
FANNY	f	Ah ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is  he of good breeding and fortune? 
LUCY	f	Oh both--but his family would  certainly oppose the match. 
FANNY	f	Tush! They will allow it as soon as  they see you, my dear. 
LUCY	f	It is a very great secret. I have  told no one in the world for fear of  discovery. 
FANNY	f	My dear, I am the soul of discretion. 
LUCY	f	If I dared tell... 
FANNY	f	I can assure you I am as silent as  the grave. 
FANNY 	f	Viper in my bosom! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Oh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr  Edward Ferrars--the very one I used  to joke you about, Miss Dashwood-- has been engaged these five years to  Lucy Steele! 
MRS JENNINGS	f	Poor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by  all accounts is very proud, demanded  that he break the engagement on pain  of disinheritance. But he has refused  to break his promise to Lucy. He has  stood by her, good man, and is cut  off without a penny! She has settled  it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert.  But I cannot stop, I must go to Lucy.  Your sister-in-law scolded her like  any fury--drove her to hysterics. 
MARIANNE	f	How long have you known? 
ELINOR	f	Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered  to take us to London. 
MARIANNE	f	Why did you not tell me? 
ELINOR	f	Lucy told me in the strictest  confidence. 
ELINOR	f	I could not break my word. 
MARIANNE	f	But Edward loves you. 
ELINOR	f	He made me no promises. He tried to  tell me about Lucy. 
MARIANNE	f	He cannot marry her. 
ELINOR	f	Would you have him treat her even  worse than Willoughby has treated  you? 
MARIANNE	f	No--but nor would I have him marry  where he does not love. 
ELINOR	f	Edward made his promise a long time  ago, long before he met me. Though  he may... harbour some regret, I  believe he will be happy--in the  knowledge that he did his duty and  kept his word. After all--after all  that is bewitching in the idea of  one's happiness depending entirely  on one person, it is not always  possible. We must accept. Edward  will marry Lucy--and you and I will  go home. 
MARIANNE	f	Always resignation and acceptance!  Always prudence and honour and duty!  Elinor, where is your heart? 
ELINOR	f	What do you know of my heart? What  do you know of anything but your own  suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I  have had this pressing on me without  being at liberty to speak of it to a  single creature. It was forced upon  me by the very person whose prior  claims ruined all my hopes. I have  had to endure her exultation again  and again while knowing myself to be  divided from Edward forever. Believe  me, Marianne, had I not been bound  to silence I could have produced  proof enough of a broken heart even  for you. 
MARIANNE	f	Oh, Elinor! 
COLONEL BRANDON 	m	I have heard that your friend Mr  Ferrars has been entirely cast off  by his family for persevering in his  engagement to Miss Steele. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Have I been rightly informed? Is it  so? 
ELINOR	f	It is indeed so. Are you acquainted  with Mr Ferrars? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	No, we have never met. But I know  only too well the cruelty--the  impolitic cruelty of dividing two  young people long attached to one  another. Mrs Ferrars does not know  what she may drive her son to-- 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I have a proposal to make that should  enable him to marry Miss Steele  immediately. Since the gentleman is  so close a friend to your family,  perhaps you will be good enough to  mention it to him? 
ELINOR	f	Colonel, I am sure he would be only  too delighted to hear it from your  own lips. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	I think not. His behaviour has proved  him proud--in the best sense. I feel  certain this is the right course. 
ELINOR	f	Mr Ferrars. 
EDWARD	m	Miss Dashwood. 
ELINOR	f	Thank you for responding so promptly  to my message. 
EDWARD	m	I was most grateful to receive it. I-- Miss Dashwood, God knows what you  must think of me... 
ELINOR	f	Mr Ferrars-- 
EDWARD	m	I have no right to speak, I know-- 
ELINOR	f	Mr Ferrars, I have good news. I think  you know of our friend Colonel  Brandon? 
EDWARD	m	Yes, I have heard his name. 
ELINOR	f	Colonel Brandon desires me to say  that, understanding you wish to join  the clergy, he has great pleasure in  offering you the parish on his estate  at Delaford, now just vacant, in the  hope that it may enable you--and  Miss Steele--to marry. 
EDWARD	m	Colonel Brandon? 
ELINOR	f	Yes. He means it as testimony of his  concern for--for the cruel situation  in which you find yourselves. 
EDWARD	m	Colonel Brandon give me a parish?  Can it be possible? 
ELINOR	f	The unkindness of your family has  made you astonished to find friendship  elsewhere. 
EDWARD	m	No. Not to find it in you. I cannot  be ignorant that to you--to your  goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I  would express it if I could, but, as  you know, I am no orator. 
ELINOR	f	You are very much mistaken. I assure  you that you owe it almost entirely  to your own merit--I have had no  hand in it. 
EDWARD	m	Colonel Brandon must be a man of  great worth and respect ability. 
ELINOR	f	He is the kindest and best of men. 
EDWARD	m	May I enquire why the Colonel did  not tell me himself? 
ELINOR	f	I think he felt it would be better  coming from... a friend. 
EDWARD	m	Your friendship has been the most  important of my life. 
ELINOR	f	You will always have it. 
EDWARD	m	Forgive me. 
ELINOR	f	Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises-- that is more important than anything  else. I wish you--both--very happy. 
EDWARD	m	Goodbye, Miss Dashwood. 
CHARLOTTE	f	What a stroke of luck for Lucy and  Edward to find a parish so close to  Barton! You will all be able to meet  very often. That will cheer you up,  Miss Marianne. I do declare I have  never disliked a person so much as I  do Mr Willoughby, for your sake.  Insufferable man! To think we can  see his insufferable house from the  top of our hill! 
CHARLOTTE	f	I shall ask Jackson to plant some  very tall trees. 
MR PALMER	m	You will do nothing of the sort. 
CHARLOTTE 	f	I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was  everything of the finest--made in  Paris, no less. I should have liked  to see it, although I dare say it  was a sorry affair, scalloped with  ruffles--but what do the French know  about fashion? 
CHARLOTTE 	f	I am resolved never to mention Mr  Willoughby's name again, and  furthermore I shall tell everyone I  meet what a good-for nothing he is. 
MR PALMER 	m	Be quiet. 
ELINOR	f	I do not think she drew breath from  the moment we left London. It is my  fault--I should have found some other  way of getting home. 
MARIANNE	f	There was no other way you said so  yourself. 
ELINOR	f	We shall be home soon enough. Mamma  will comfort you, dearest. 
MARIANNE	f	I am stiff from sitting so long.  Will you tell Charlotte that I am  going for a stroll? ELINOR glances  at the sky in concern. 
ELINOR	f	I think it is going to rain. 
MARIANNE	f	No, no, it will not rain. 
ELINOR	f	You always say that and then it always  does. 
MARIANNE	f	I will keep to the garden, near the  house. 
CHARLOTTE	f	We are very proud of our little  Thomas, Colonel--and his papa has  such a way with him... 
CHARLOTTE	f	There you are, Miss Dashwood! Mr  Palmer and the Colonel have locked  themselves up in the billiard room.  Come and meet little Thomas. Where  is Miss Marianne? 
ELINOR	f	She is taking a little air in the  garden. 
CHARLOTTE	f	Oh, very good. That is the great  advantage of the countryside--all  the fresh air and... and all the  fresh air... 
CHARLOTTE	f	He is the best child in the world-- he never cries unless he wants to  and then, Lord, there is no stopping  him. 
ELINOR	f	I cannot see Marianne. 
CHARLOTTE	f	She has probably taken shelter in  one of the greenhouses! 
MARIANNE	f	Love is not love Which alters when  it alteration finds Or bends with  the remover to remove: 0, no! it is  an ever-fixed mark That looks on  tempests and is never shaken... 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Marianne! 
MARIANNE	f	Willoughby... Willoughby... 
CHARLOTTE	f	One thing is certain--she will be  wet through when she returns. 
MR PALMER	m	Thank you for pointing that out, my  dear. Do not worry, Miss Dashwood-- Brandon will find her. I think we  can all guess where she went. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	She is not hurt--but we must get her  warm! 
ELINOR	f	I think Marianne may need a doctor. 
CHARLOTTE	f	You'll wear yourself out, Colonel!  Do not worry! A day or two in bed  will soon set her to rights! 
MR PALMER	m	You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. I  have never found a better physician. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	What is your diagnosis? 
DR HARRIS	m	It is an infectious fever that has  taken far more serious hold than I  would have expected in one so young.  I would recommend the hasty removal  of your child, Mr Palmer-- 
CHARLOTTE	f	Mrs Bunting! Mrs Bunting! 
MR PALMER	m	My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more  sorry than I can say. If you would  prefer me to stay I am at your  service. 
ELINOR	f	Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But  Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will  look after us. Thank you for  everything you have done. 
DR HARRIS	m	She is not doing as well as I would  like. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	What can I do? 
ELINOR	f	Colonel, you have done so much  already. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood,  or I shall run mad. He is dangerously  quiet. 
ELINOR	f	She would be easier if her mother  were here. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Of course. Barton is but eight hours  away. If I make no stop, you may see  us early tomorrow morning. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	In your hands I know she will be  safe. 
DR HARRIS	m	Double the number of drops and I  will return as soon as I can. 
MARIANNE	f	Who is that? 
MARIANNE	f	Look, look, Elinor. 
ELINOR	f	There is no one there, dearest. 
MARIANNE	f	It is Papa. Papa has come. 
MARIANNE	f	Dearest Papa! 
DR HARRIS	m	I must fetch more laudanum. I cannot  pretend, Miss Dashwood, that your  sister's condition is not very  serious. You must prepare yourself.  I will return very shortly. 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, Marianne, please try-- 
ELINOR	f	Marianne, please try--I cannot--I  cannot do without you. Oh, please, I  have tried to bear everything else-- I will try--but please, dearest,  beloved Marianne, do not leave me  alone. 
MARIANNE 	f	Elinor? 
ELINOR	f	My mother! 
ELINOR	f	Mamma! She is out of danger! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	There, there, my love, my Marianne. 
MARIANNE	f	Where is Elinor? 
ELINOR	f	I am here, dearest, I am here. 
MARIANNE	f	Colonel Brandon. 
MARIANNE	f	Thank you. 
COLONEL BRANDON 	m	What though the sea with waves  continuall Doe eate the earth, it is  no more at all. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	Nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth  aught. For whatsoever from one place  doth fall, Is with the tide unto  another brought... 
MRS. DASHWOOD	f	He certainly is nor so dashing as  Willoughby but he has a far more  pleasing countenance. There was always  a something, if you remember, in  Willoughby's eyes at times which I  did not like. 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	'For there is nothing lost, but may  be found, if sought... 
MARIANNE	f	Shall we continue tomorrow? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	No--for I must away. 
MARIANNE	f	Away? Where? 
COLONEL BRANDON	m	That I cannot tell you. It is a  secret. 
MARIANNE	f	But you will not stay away long? 
MARIANNE	f	There. 
MARIANNE	f	There I fell, and there I first saw  Willoughby. 
ELINOR	f	Poor Willoughby. He will always regret  you. 
MARIANNE	f	But does it follow that, had he chosen  me, he would have been content? 
MARIANNE	f	He would have had a wife he loved  but no money--and might soon have  learned to rank the demands of his  pocket-book far above the demands of  his heart. 
MARIANNE	f	If his present regrets are half as  painful as mine, he will suffer  enough. 
ELINOR	f	Do you compare your conduct with  his? 
MARIANNE	f	No. I compare it with what it ought  to have been. I compare it with yours. 
ELINOR	f	Our situations were very different. 
MARIANNE	f	My illness has made me consider the  past. I saw in my own behaviour  nothing but imprudence--and worse. I  was insolent and unjust to everyone-- 
MARIANNE	f	--but you--you I wronged above all.  Only I knew your heart and its sorrows  but even then I was never a grain  more compassionate. I brought my  illness upon myself--I wanted to  destroy myself. And had I succeeded,  what misery should I have caused  you? 
MARIANNE	f	I shall mend my ways! I shall no  longer worry others nor torture  myself. I am determined to enter on  a course of serious study---Colonel  Brandon has promised me the run of  his library and I shall read at least  six hours a day. By the end of the  year I expect to have improved my  learning a very great deal. 
MARGARET	f	You'll go blind if you're not careful. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Is Thomas back from Exeter, Betsy? 
BETSY	f	Yes, ma'am--he brung back two lovely  fillets for you. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Beef is far less expensive in Exeter,  and anyway they are for Marianne. 
BETSY	f	Sixpence a piece, Miss Dashwood. Oh,  and he says Mr Ferrars is married,  but I suppose you know that, ma'am. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Fetch Thomas to us, Betsy. 
THOMAS	m	Beg pardon, Miss Dashwood, but they  was the cheapest in the market-- 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	It was a very good price, Thomas,  well done. Would you be so kind as  to build up the fire a little? 
THOMAS	m	Yes, ma'am. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Who told you that Mr Ferrars was  married, Thomas? 
THOMAS	m	I seen him myself, ma'am, and his  lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was-- they were stopping in a chaise at  the New London Inn. I happened to  look up as I passed the chaise and I  see it was Miss Steele. So I took  off my hat and she inquired after  you, ma'am, and all the young ladies,  especially Miss Dashwood, and bid me  I should give you her and Mr Ferrars's  best compliments and service and how  they'd be sure to send you a piece  of the cake. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Was Mr Ferrars in the carriage with  her? 
THOMAS	m	Yes, ma'am--I just seen him leaning  back in it, but he did not look up. 
ELINOR	f	Did-- 
MARIANNE	f	Did Mrs Ferrars seem well? 
THOMAS	m	Yes, Miss Marianne--she said how she  was vastly contented and, since she  was always a very affable young lady,  I made free to wish her joy. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Thank you, Thomas. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Your father once told me not to allow  you to neglect yourself. Now I find  that it is I who have neglected you  most. 
ELINOR	f	No, Mamma. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Yes, I have. We all have. Marianne  is right. 
ELINOR	f	I am very good at hiding. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Then we must observe you more closely. 
ELINOR	f	Mamma? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Yes, my darling? 
ELINOR	f	There is a painful difference between  the expectation of an unpleasant  event and its final certainty. 
MRS DASHWOOD 	f	Marianne! Marianne! Come and see  what is coming! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	'At last I have found a small enough  instrument to fir the parlour. I  expect to follow it in a day or two,  by which time I expect you to have  learned the enclosed. Your devoted  friend, Christopher Brandon.' 
MARGARET	f	He must like you very much, Marianne. 
MARIANNE	f	It is not just for me! It is for all  of us. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne! 
ELINOR	f	I do not think it is the Colonel. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	It must be. He said he would arrive  today. You must play him the new  song, Marianne. 
MARGARET	f	Edward! 
MARGARET	f	It is Edward! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Calm. We must be calm. 
BETSY	f	Mr Ferrars for you, ma'am. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Edward! What a pleasure to see you. 
EDWARD	m	Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret.  Miss Dashwood. I hope I find you all  well. 
MARIANNE	f	Thank you, Edward, we are all very  well. 
MARGARET	f	We have been enjoying very fine  weather. 
MARGARET	f	Well, we have. 
EDWARD	m	I am glad of it. The... the roads  were very dry. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	May I wish you great joy, Edward. 
MARIANNE	f	I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars  well? 
EDWARD	m	Tolerably, thank you. 
EDWARD	m	I--But EDWARD cannot seem to find  any words. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish? 
EDWARD	m	No--my mother is in town. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward  Ferrars. 
EDWARD	m	Then you have not heard--the news--I  think you mean my brother--you mean  Mrs Robert Ferrars. 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Mrs Robert Ferrars? 
EDWARD	m	Yes. I received a letter from Miss  Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say-- communicating the... the transfer of  her affections to my brother Robert.  They were much thrown together in  London, I believe, and... and in  view of the change in my  circumstances, I felt it only fair  that Miss Steele be released from  our engagement. At any rate, they  were married last week and are now  in Plymouth. 
ELINOR	f	Then you--are not married. 
EDWARD	m	No. 
EDWARD	m	Elinor! I met Lucy when I was very  young. Had I had an active profession,  I should never have felt such an  idle, foolish inclination. At Norland  my behaviour was very wrong. But I  convinced myself you felt only  friendship for me and it was my heart  alone that I was risking. I have  come with no expectations. Only to  profess, now that I am at liberty to  do so, that my heart is and always  will be yours. 
MARGARET	f	He's sitting next to her! 
MRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNE	f	Margaret, come down!/Is he? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Margaret! Will you stop-- 
MARIANNE	f	What's happening now? 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Marianne! 
MARGARET 	f	He's kneeling down! 
MRS DASHWOOD	f	Oh! Is he? Oh! 
ELINOR	f	Your mother, I suppose, will hardly  be less angry with Robert for marrying  Lucy. 
EDWARD	m	The more so since she settled the  money upon him so irrevocably-- 
ELINOR	f	--no doubt because she had run out  of sons to disinherit. 
EDWARD	m	Her family fluctuates at an alarming  rate. Then, in London, when you told  me of the Colonel's offer, I became  convinced that you wanted me to marry  Lucy and that--well, that you and  Colonel Brandon... 
ELINOR	f	Me and Colonel Brandon! 
EDWARD	m	I shall not forget attempting to  thank him for making it possible for  me to marry the woman I did not love  while convinced he had designs upon  the woman I did--do--love. 
EDWARD	m	Would you--can you--excuse me--
