INTERCOM	m	Dick Laurent is dead.
RENEE	f	You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
FRED	m	What are you going to do?
RENEE	f	I thought I'd stay home and read.
FRED	m	Read?... Read what, Renee?
FRED	m	It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
RENEE	f	I like to laugh, Fred.
FRED	m	That's why I married you.
RENEE	f	Wake me up when you get home.
FRED	m	What's that?
RENEE	f	A videotape.
FRED	m	Who's it from?
RENEE	f	I don't know... There's no return address  on the envelope... In fact, there's no  address on it.
FRED	m	Does it say anything on the tape?
RENEE	f	No, nothing.
FRED	m	Well, let's see what's on it.
FRED	m	Come on.
RENEE	f	It must be from a real estate agent.
FRED	m	Maybe.
FRED	m	Good book, huh?
RENEE	f	Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
FRED	m	Same one you were reading the other night?
RENEE	f	What night?
FRED	m	When you didn't come to the club.
RENEE	f	Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different one.
FRED	m	I called, you know.
RENEE	f	Called?  When?
FRED	m	From the club.  You didn't answer.
RENEE	f	I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
FRED	m	You were asleep when I got home, yes.
RENEE	f	I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to.
FRED	m	I had a dream about you last night...
RENEE	f	Yeah?
FRED	m	You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
RENEE	f	Fred?  Fred, where are you?
FRED V.0.	m	Then there you were... lying in bed...  but it wasn't you... It looked like  you... but it wasn't.
RENEE	f	Fred, are you all right?
FRED	m	You're up early.
RENEE	f	That dog woke me.  I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
FRED	m	Who the hell owns that dog?
FRED	m	What's that?  Another tape?
RENEE	f	Yes, I just found it on the step.
FRED	m	Don't you want to watch it?
RENEE	f	I guess so.
FRED	m	Well, do you wanna watch it?
RENEE	f	Yeah.
RENEE	f	We've got to call the police.
FRED	m	All right.
RENEE	f	...yes, I've been on hold for ten minutes... I can't... All right, thanks.
RENEE	f	Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee Madison... My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician... welive at 442 Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis... near the observatory... Someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... I know because they sent,  dropped off a videotape... two  videotapes... to show us... That's  right... Yes... it... the second one...  shows us asleep... Someone broke in and  taped us while we slept!... Isn't that  enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442  Hollis... Yes, we'll be here.
FRED 	m	So?
RENEE	f	Two detectives are coming out.
FRED	m	That's it.
ED	m	Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
AL	m	Very strange.
RENEE	f	What is?
AL	m	The angle.  The high angle shot on the tape.
ED	m	How'd the camera get so high like that?
AL	m	And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
ED	m	Like you'd get if it was hand held.
AL	m	Right ... This just glided along.
ED	m	This is the bedroom.
AL	m	Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
FRED	m	This is our bedroom.
ED	m	There's no other bedroom?
FRED	m	No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
AL	m	You're a musician?
FRED	m	Yes, I thought my wife ...
ED	m	What's your axe?
FRED	m	Tenor... Tenor saxophone.  Do you...
ED	m	Tone deaf.
AL	m	Do you own a video camera?
RENEE	f	No. Fred hates them.
FRED	m	I like to remember things my own way.
AL	m	What do you mean by that?
FRED	m	How I remember them.  Not necessarily the way they happened.
ED	m	Do you have an alarm system?
RENEE	f	Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it.
AL	m	Why not?
FRED	m	It kept going off for some reason.  False alarms.
ED	m	Might be a good time to try using it again.
AL	m	Anybody else have a key to the house.
RENEE	f	No.
AL	m	Maid?  Relative?
RENEE	f	No, one of us is always here to let the  maid in.  Nobody else has a key.
ED	m	Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in.
AL	m	We'll keep a watch on the house.
ED	m	As best we can.
AL	m	If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card.
RENEE	f	We will.
FRED	m	Thanks, guys.
ED	m	It's what we do.
RENEE	f	What the hell is going on?!
FRED	m	I wish I knew.
RENEE	f	What was that?!!!
FRED	m	What?
RENEE	f	On the tape!  There was something else on the tape.
RENEE	f	There!  Play it!
AL	m	You don't remember being awakened?  It looks like you were aware of someone.
ED	m	Or something.
FRED	m	No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
RENEE	f	Why would anyone do something like this?
AL	m	Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
ED	m	Or not so recently?
FRED	m	No, not to me.
RENEE	f	I...no. No. No threats.
ED	m	We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you?
AL	m	We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
RENEE	f	I don't know if I want to stay here.  I don't feel safe.
FRED	m	Where would you feel safe?
RENEE	f	I don't know. maybe a hotel.
ED	m	Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
FRED	m	The first night ... Not the last two.
AL	m	Why not?
FRED	m	I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
RENEE	f	Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our  house while we're sleeping, filming us,  and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I  thought you set the alarm!
FRED	m	I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
RENEE	f	But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who is doing this?  And why?
AL	m	We'll find out, Mrs. Madison.
MYSTERY MAN	m	We've met before, haven't we?
FRED	m	I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met?
MYSTERY MAN	m	At your house.  Don't you remember?
FRED	m	No, no I don't.  Are you sure?
MYSTERY MAN	m	Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now.
FRED	m	What do you mean?  You're where right now?
MYSTERY MAN	m	At your house.
FRED	m	That's absurd.
MYSTERY MAN	m	Call me.
MYSTERY MAN	m	Dial your number.
MYSTERY MAN	m	Go ahead.
MYSTERY MAN	m	I told you I was here.
FRED	m	How did you do that?
FRED	m	How did you get into my house?
MYSTERY MAN	m	You invited me.  It's not my habit to go where I'm not wanted.
FRED	m	Who are you?
MYSTERY MAN	m	Give me my phone back.
MYSTERY MAN	m	It's been a pleasure talking to you.
RENEE	f	I thought you were getting me a drink?
FRED	m	Just a minute.
FRED	m	Andy, who is that guy?
ANDY	m	I don't know his name.  He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
FRED	m	Dick Laurent?
ANDY	m	Yes, I believe so.
FRED	m	But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
ANDY	m	He is?  I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
FRED	m	I don't.  I don't know him.
ANDY	m	Dick can't be dead.  Who told you he was dead?
RENEE	f	Honey, who?... Who's dead?
FRED	m	Let's go home.
RENEE	f	But...
FRED	m	Now!  We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
FRED	m	How'd you meet that asshole, Andy, anyway?
RENEE	f	It was a long time ago... I met him at  this place called Moke's... We... became  friends... He told me about a job...
FRED	m	What job?
RENEE	f	I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's  okay...
FRED	m	He's got some fucked up friends.
FRED	m	Stay in the car!
FRED	m	I told you to stay in the car!
RENEE	f	Why? what is it?  Why did you make me wait out here?
FRED	m	I thought there might be somebody inside.
RENEE	f	Was there?
FRED	m	No... of course not.
RENEE	f	It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had  the strangest feeling... Like this had  happened before.  I mean, your telling me  to stay outside while you went in like  that.
RENEE	f	Fred?  Fred, where are you?
FRED	m	Renee!
ED	m	Stay put, killer!
FRED	m	I didn't kill her! Tell me I didn't kill her!
ATTENDANT	?	Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh?
M.E.	?	Party at the mayor's house, George.  This is his daughter, Joyce.
ATTENDANT	?	Howdy, Joyce.
JOYCE	f	Howdy, George.
M.E.	?	Just like Christmas.
JOYCE	f	I don't know if I can watch this.
M.E.	?	Leave any time you want, lover.  I won't take it personally.
M.E.	?	Easy, girl, easy.
JOYCE	f	You talking to me or... her?
M.E.	?	A corpse can tell you plenty, Joyce.
JUDGE	m	Have you reached a verdict?
FOREMAN	m	Yes, we have, your honor.
JUDGE	m	Please hand it to the bailiff.
JUDGE	m	And what is your verdict?
FOREMAN	m	We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.
JUDGE	m	Fred Madison, the jury having found you  guilty of murder in the first degree, it  is my order that on a date to be  determined, you be put to death in the  electric chair.
RAQUEL	f	Did you see that about the guy who  chopped up his wife into a million  pieces?
MARIAN	m	How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit with that stuff.
RAQUEL	f	They're gonna cook him.
MARIAN	m	Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have  a choice... You can die by hanging or by  firing squad.
RAQUEL	f	Which would you choose?
MARIAN	m	Andy would go for this, don't you  think?... Firing squad, definitely.
RAQUEL	f	Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
MARIAN	m	The heart, I guess.
RAQUEL	f	I wouldn't... The brain would know what's  going on.  Your heart would be ripped  open trying to pump blood, blood pouring  into the chest cavity.  Savage pain,  Marian.
MARIAN	m	Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh?
RAQUEL	f	Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps,  you black out.  It might take a while for  the body to die, but you wouldn't feel  it.
MARIAN	m	You might be right, Raquel.
ANDY	m	Guess who?
GUARD	m	Make yourself to home, fella.
GUARD #1	m	Here he comes.
INMATE #1	m	See you soon, Sammy.  Don't think takin'  a jolt is gonna get you outta payin' me  back the twenty you owe me.
INMATE #2	m	Don't take it personal, pal.
INMATE #3	m	Un fuerte abrazo, amigo!
INMATE #4	m	Hang in there, honey.
INMATE #5	m	Keep an eye out for me, Sammy G.
INMATE #6	m	Show 'em you got big stones, bro.
WARDEN	m	Line check. Okay.
WARDEN	m	Any final words, Sam?
GUARD	m	Something wrong?
FRED	m	My... My head.
GUARD	m	Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess.   You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
FRED	m	No, no.  I want to go in.
GUARD	m	What's botbering you, Madison?
FRED	m	The pain is getting worse.  I need more aspirin.
GUARD	m	I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to the doctor.
DOCTOR	m	You sleeping okay?
FRED	m	I can't sleep.
DOCTOR	m	You'll sleep now. Take him back to his cell.
GUARD	m	What is it?
FRED	m	Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more aspirin.
GUARD	m	The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
FRED	m	But my head...
GUARD #1	m	Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty fucked up.
GUARD #2	m	Which one?
GUARD	m	Who are you?  What are you doing in this cell?
GUARD	m	This is Johnny Mack at station 8. Yeah,  look, somethin' crazy's happened.  No, I  mean, Madison ain't in his cell.  No,  there's somebody in there, but it ain't  Madison! Right, right.  Okay... Captain  Henderson's comin''?... Right.
JOHNNY MACK	m	F-u-u-u-ck me!
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	Now, Mack, what's the situation?
JOHNNY MACK	m	I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	That's not Fred Madison?
JOHNNY MACK	m	No, sir, it's not.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	Who is it?
JOHNNY MACK	m	I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	Yeah, Mack?
J0HNNY MACK	m	Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
WARDEN	m	Repeat that, Bill.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	Warden, it's not him.  It .was not Fred Madison in that cell.
WARDEN	m	Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	I don't know.  The guards say they've never seen him before.
WARDEN	m	Where is he now?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	He's in the infirmary, being examined.
WARDEN	m	Did you ask him who he is?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
WARDEN	m	If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
WARDEN	m	I want to take a look at this man myself.
WARDEN	m	What is this, Rogoff?
DR. ROGOFF	?	I don't know yet.
WARDEN	m	Who is this man?
DR. ROGOFF	?	He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll  run these blood tests right away.  We'll  find out soon enough.
WARDEN	m	He's not Madison?
DR. ROGOFF	?	Not even close.
DR. ROGOFF	?	I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
WARDEN	m	A headache?
DR. ROGOFF	?	I did a routine once-over, and gave him a  sleeping pill.  I've never seen this man  before.  Neither have the guards.  I  don't think he's in the system.
WARDEN	m	Where the hell did you come from, mister?
WARDEN	m	Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five years ago for auto theft, for which he  was put on probation for one year.  That  was his first and only offense.  No  record since then.
WARDEN	m	How about Madison?  Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an  APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed  nationwide.
PRISON OFFICIAL #1	m	I had a call from the governor's office about this.
WARDEN	m	How the hell does she know?
PRISON OFFICIAL #1	m	There's press outside right now.
WARDEN	m	How the hell... 7
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	One of the guards must have leaked it.
WARDEN	m	What's the word on the street?
PRISON OFFICIAL #2	m	Only that Madison has apparently escaped. Nothing about the other guy.
WARDEN	m	Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him.
WARDEN	m	I have a statement to read... Fred  Madison, an inmate being held on death  row has, apparently... has escaped.  An  all-points bulletin has been issued to  authorities not only statewide, but  nationwide.  We are confindent that he  will be apprehended very soon.  No  further details are available at this  time.  Thank you very much.
REPORTER	m	Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before.  How did he get out?
WARDEN	m	I'm Warden Clements.  This is Captain  Henderson and Dr. Rogoff.  Please, sit  down.
WARDEN	m	Mr. and Mrs. Dayton, as you were told  over the phone, your son, Peter, is here.
WARDEN	m	He... He was discovered this morning...  in a cell on death row.
WARDEN	m	A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
BILL	m	The wife killer?
WARDEN	m	Yes.
CLAIRE	f	How is this possible, Warden?
WARDEN	m	...Tell me, what was Peter's condition  the last time you saw him?
BILL	m	His condition?  What do you mean?
WARDEN	m	His physical condition.
BILL	m	Same as always.  Pete takes care of himself.
CLAIRE	f	I saw him before he went to the garage  day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic.  Look, is he okay?  Can we see him?
DR. ROGOFF	?	He has a hematoma on his forehead and a  condition called blepharitis... that's  redness and swelling around the eyes.
BILL	m	Was he in a fight?
DR. ROGOFF	?	These conditions don't indicate a fight.
CLAIRE	f	But what is the cause then? ... And how did he get in that cell?
DR. ROGOFF	?	He can't talk.  Or won't.
BILL	m	That doesn't sound like Pete.
DR. ROGOFF	?	Your son has experienced some sort of  trauma, I'm afraid.  We were hoping that  the two of you could help explain the  cause of the trauma and how he came to be  here.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	You don't know Fred Madison?
BILL	m	No... Only what was in the news.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	Do you think Pete knows him?
CLAIRE	f	I wouldn't know how.
WARDEN	m	You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
CLAIRE	f	When he went to work, right.
WARDEN	m	What about yesterday?
CLAIRE	f	He didn't come home.
BILL	m	Sometimes he stays at a friend's.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	Any particular friends?
BILL	m	A girl's, a buddy's.  I don't know.  He's  his own man; he comes and goes as he  pleases.
CLAIRE	f	I want to see him.
WARDEN	m	Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can. Mel, let's get Peter in here.
CLAIRE	f	Pete...
WARDEN	m	Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
CLAIRE	f	Pete, what happened to you?
CLAIRE	f	It's okay.  Take your time, honey.
PETE	m	Where ... am I?
DR. ROGOFF	?	You're in the state penitentiary.  You were found in a cell on death row.
PETE	m	My head hurts.
WARDEN	m	A man named Fred Madison was occupying  that cell.  He's missing. we're trying  to find out how it is you were in there  and not him.
PETE	m	I... I don't know.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	Do you know Fred Madison?
PETE	m	No.
CLAIRE	f	Warden, can we take him home?
DR. ROGOFF	?	From a medical standpoint, I don't see why not.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	We need to find out what happened here.
BILL	m	Have you made any charges against him?
WARDEN	m	No.
BILL	m	Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
WARDEN	m	All right... but you see our  predicament... Legally we can't hold  him, but he may be able to help us...  perhaps later.  For now, he's free to  leave.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON	m	You just gonna let him go?
WARDEN	m	We'll get a tail put on him.
BILL	m	Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
CLAIRE	f	Are you hungry, honey?  I'll fix you something.
PETE	m	No... I don't feel so good.  I would  like some aspirin.
CLAIRE	f	Coming up.
ED	m	Thanks, Al.
AL	m	Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
ED	m	Yeah.
CLAIRE	f	I'm in the kitchen.
BILL	m	Where's Pete?
CLAIRE	f	Out in back.
BILL	m	You talk to him?
CLAIRE	f	No... Here he comes.
BILL	m	How're you feelin'?
PETE	m	Better.
BILL	m	Arnie called this morning while you were  sleepin'.  They miss you pretty bad down  at the garage.  I told 'im you still had  a "fever".
PETE	m	Okay.  Thanks.
BILL	m	Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
PETE	m	Yeah.
BILL	m	You really don't remember the other night, do you?
PETE	m	What night is that?
BILL	m	The night before you showed up in the slammer...
CLAIRE	f	Do you remember?
PETE	m	No... I don't.  Why?

MR. EDDY	m	I'm sure you noticed that girl that was  with me the other day... Good lookin'  blonde?  She stayed in the car?...
MR. EDDY	m	Her name is Alice.  You know I love that  girl to death. If I ever found out  somebody was makin' out with her, I'd  take this ... ...and shove it so far up his ass it  would come out his mouth... Then you  know what?...
PETE	m	What?
MR. EDDY	m	I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
MR. EDDY	m	So, Pete, you're lookin, better.  What have you been up to?

PETE	m	In pornos?
ALICE	f	No... A job... I didn't know what.  He  set up an appointment for me to see a  man.
ALICE	f	I went to this place... They made me wait  forever.  There was some guy guardin' the  door... I started gettin' nervous... In  another room I could see some guy liftin' weights... Both these guys gave me the creeps... They never said anything to me... So I just smoked cigarettes and waited.
PETE	m	Why didn't you just leave?
PETE	m	You liked it.
ALICE	f	If you want me to go away, I'll go away.

It's  2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white  stucco job on the south side of the  street... I'll be upstairs with Andy...  The back door will be open... That leads  into the kitchen - go through the kitchen  to the living room - there's a bar  there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy  to fix me a drink... When he does, you  can crack him in the head... Okay?
PETE	m	Okay...

BILL	m	Why don't you two come inside and talk  things over quietly... Come on... Come on  in, Sheila.
SHEILA	f	You are different.
BILL	m	Sheila...
BILL	m	Sheila... Don't.
SHEILA	f	I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr.  Dayton... I won't bother you or any  member of your family again.
CLAIRE	f	Pete... There's a man on the phone.  He's called a couple of times tonight.
PETE	m	Who is it?
CLAIRE	f	He won't give his name.
PETE	m	Hello.
MR. EDDY	m	Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
PETE	m	Who is this?
MR. EDDY	m	You know who it is.
PETE	m	Mr. Eddy?
MR. EDDY	m	Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
PETE	m	Okay.
MR. EDDY	m	You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
PETE	m	Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
MR. EDDY	m	I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
MR. EDDY	m	You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
PETE	m	Yeah.
MR. EDDY	m	That's good, Pete.  Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
VOICE	m	We've met before, haven't we?
PETE	m	I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met?
VOICE	m	At your house.  Don't you remember?
PETE	m	No. No, I don't.
VOICE	m	We just killed a couple of people...
PETE	m	What?
VOICE	m	You heard me... We thought we'd come over and tell you about it.
PETE	m	What's goin' on?
VOICE	m	Great question!! In the east ... the far  east... when a person is sentenced to  death... they're sent to a place where  they can't escape... never knowing when  an executioner will step up behind them  and fire a bullet into the back of their  head... it could be days... weeks... or  even years after the death sentence has  been pronounced... This uncertainty adds  an exquisite element of torture to the  situation, don't you think?  It's been a  pleasure talking to you.
MR. EDDY	m	Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell you I'm really glad you're doin' okay.
ALICE	f	You got him.
PETE	m	Alice, I...
ALICE	f	Wow!
ALICE	f	Put this in your pocket.
ALICE	f	You all right?
PETE,	?	We killed him.
ALICE	f	You killed him.
PETE	m	Alice?
ALICE	f	It was an accident... Accidents happen every day.
PETE	m	Alice...
ALICE	f	We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
PETE	m	Is that you?  Are both of them you?
ALICE	f	That's me.
ALICE	f	Pete?...
PETE	m	Where's the bathroom?
ALICE	f	Up the stairs - down the hall.
WOMAN/ALICE	f	Did you want to talk to me?
WOMAN/ALICE	f	Did you want to ask me "why"?
ALICE	f	Don't you trust me, Pete?...
ALICE	f	Stick that in your belt.
ALICE	f	Look at all this shit... I know a  fence... he'll give us money and get us  passports in exchange for this and the  car... We can go anywhere.
PETE	m	Alice?
ALICE	f	Come on, baby.
ALICE	f	You drive.
ALICE	f	Come on.
ALICE	f	We have to go to the desert.  He's at his cabin.
ALICE	f	We'll have to wait.
PETE	m	Why me, Alice?  Why choose me?
ALICE	f	So we can be together... You still want to be with me, don't you Pete?
ALICE	f	More than ever?
PETE	m	I want you... I want you...
ALICE	f	You'll never have me.
