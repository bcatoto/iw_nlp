JANE	f	Good luck.
BOSS	m	We don't get many ladies in here. So your husband approves of you working?
MARGARET	f	(quiet; a soft Southern lilt) My husband and I are separated.
BOSS	m	"Separated"?
MARGARET	f	Sir, I realize I have no employment experience... but I sure need this job. I have a daughter to support. I'm not very good at tooting my own horn... but I love to paint, and if I could just show you my portfolio...
MARGARET	f	I studied at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville, then took Illustration classes in New York. Here's a pastel I did... here's some fashion design... a portrait in charcoal... though I enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil and ink...
BOSS	m	You do understand this is a furniture company?
DEE-ANN	f	Sugar, you made it! You're in North Beach!
MARGARET	f	Deirdre, look at you!
DEE-ANN	f	"Dee-Ann."
MARGARET	f	"Dee-Ann"?!
DEE-ANN	f	Yeah, I know. But I hit this scene... and "Deirdre" just sounded like something my mother would call me.
DEE-ANN	f	So are you flipping for all this?! Are you settled? How's Jane?
MARGARET	f	Jane -- is swell. She's started in a sweet little school. Though... it's hard without her father. I'm not sure we can do this...
DEE-ANN	f	Oh stop that. You're better off. Between us, I never liked Frank.
MARGARET	f	You were a bridesmaid!
DEE-ANN	f	Exactly. That's why I couldn't speak up. But if I ever see you wrong off again, I will tell you. Now come on. Let's have some fun.
DEE-ANN	f	Toss off your middle-class preconceptions! This is Pompeii! We're livin' in the volcano!! For jazz, check up the hungry i. For Italian, Vanessi's. For salvation, try the Buddhist temple. For art, the Six Gallery --
MARGARET	f	Do they only show Modern?
DEE-ANN	f	Everyone only shows Modern! In the basement, they've got espresso.
MARGARET	f	What's espresso? Is that like reefer?
DEE-ANN	f	You've got a lot to learn!
TOURIST GUY	m	Your stuff is cute. How much?
MARGARET	f	Today's a special: Two dollars.
TOURIST GUY	m	I'll give you one.
MAN'S VOICE	m	Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a hell of a compliment. Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro.
MAN'S VOICE	m	C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow!
WALTER	m	You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it on thick -- you're not gonna break it! I poured myself into that painting. It's thirty-five dollars.
WALTER	m	Excuse me, Ladies.
MARGARET	f	All finished.
WALTER	m	You're better than spare change. You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap.
MARGARET	f	I'm just glad they liked it.
WALTER	m	Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work...
WALTER	m	What's your name?
MARGARET	f	M-Margaret...
MARGARET	f	Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there?
WALTER	m	Mm, no. I like you, Margaret...
WALTER	m	"...Ulbrich." You know, Margaret Ulbrich, you're undervaluing yourself. Lemme show you how it's done.
WALTER	m	Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul!
JANE	f	Nah.
WALTER	m	"Nah"?! (he grabs a PAINTING) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting??
JANE	f	But that IS me! And that's me... (she POINTS all over) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy.
WALTER	m	Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. I misconstrued the situation. Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr. Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the eye.
MARGARET	f	Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...!
WALTER	m	Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. Est-ce que tout va bien?
MAITRE'D	?	Je vais bien, merci! Comment allez- vous?
WALTER	m	Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander??
WALTER	m	And I don't even have to pay! I'm set because I gave the chef a painting. You know what he said? "Nobody paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!"
MARGARET	f	I can't believe you lived in Paris.
WALTER	m	Best time of my life...
MARGARET	f	I've never even been on an airplane.
WALTER	m	Well you have to experience these things! Grab 'em!! I wanted to be an artist, so I just went! Studied painting at the Beaux- Arts. Lived in a Left Bank studio. I survived on bread and wine...
MARGARET	f	You're a romantic.
WALTER	m	Damn right!
WALTER	m	Of course, walkin' away from the bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. I had to quit my job. Leave my wife. These choices aren't easy...
MARGARET	f	I've never acted freely. I was the daughter. The wife. The mother... All my paintings are of Jane, because she's all I know.
WALTER	m	You shouldn't knock your work. I'd give an eyetooth to have your talent.
WALTER	m	You can look into someone and capture them on canvas! You paint people! (he gestures sadly) I can only paint -- things. My street scenes are charming... but at the end of the day, it's just a collection of sidewalks and buildings.
MARGARET	f	Walter, I'd bet you could paint anything.
WALTER	m	Whew... Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard.
MARGARET	f	This is moving fast. You're my first date in a long time...
MARGARET	f	Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting?
JANE	f	Mother, after all this time, you MUST know what my face looks like.
JANE	f	Hey! Your canvas is blank!
WALTER	m	Er, you can't rush inspiration --
MARGARET	f	Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. You know creativity has to well up from the inside...
WALTER	m	Don't worry. She's not bothering me...!
WALTER	m	There's something I gotta ask you. What's with the big crazy eyes...?
MARGARET	f	I believe things can be seen in eyes. They're the windows of the soul --
WALTER	m	Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of proportion!
MARGARET	f	Eyes are how I express my emotions. That's how I've always drawn them. When I was little, I had surgery that left me deaf for a period. I couldn't hear, so I found myself staring... Relying on people's eyes...
VOICE	m	Walter? Hey -- Walt!
FRIENDLY GUY	m	I thought that was you!
WALTER	m	Oh! Uh... er, hi, Don.
FRIENDLY GUY	m	Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail.
WALTER	m	Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday.
FRIENDLY GUY	m	Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects!
MARGARET	f	What was that??
WALTER	m	I -- I didn't want you to know...
WALTER	m	I'm in commercial real estate.
MARGARET	f	You're a -- Realtor?
WALTER	m	YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running!
MARGARET	f	And you're... ashamed?
WALTER	m	Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. An amateur.
JANE	f	A-hem!
WALTER	m	What's wrong...?
MARGARET	f	Frank wants to take away Jane. He says I'm an unfit mother...
WALTER	m	You're a perfect mother.
MARGARET	f	He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman...
WALTER	m	Marry me.
MARGARET	f	Walter! I --
WALTER	m	(he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense!
WALTER	m	But just think of the fun we'll have..! And I'll take care of you girls.
WALTER	m	Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend.
MARGARET	f	"Hawaii"? M-marriage? Walter, I'm crazy about you... but I'm overwhelmed. Why would we go to Hawaii?!
WALTER	m	Because you're a princess... and you deserve to get married in paradise.
MARGARET	f	You're right... this is paradise. Only God could make those colors.
WALTER	m	I knew you'd love it.
MARGARET	f	Oh, can't we stay here forever??
WALTER	m	Well, I don't know about forever. But maybe... I can arrange another week.
MARGARET	f	This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. I said a prayer to him. Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle --
DEE-ANN	f	This is all happening mighty quick. In the time you moved here, I've had two dates. You're already married.
MARGARET	f	I thought there was a void in my life. Well... Walter's filled it.
DEE-ANN	f	Walter's filled a lot of things. He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit.
MARGARET	f	You're talking about my husband!
DEE-ANN	f	I know! That's why I brought it up.
MARGARET	f	I'm not naive. (beat; she laughs) Well, I am naive. But I know the man I'm marrying. Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. And he's wonderful with Jane. Look -- we're both looking for a fresh start. I'm a divorcee with a child. Walter is a blessing.
MARGARET	f	"You are on the threshold of untold success."
RUBEN	m	What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. The image has no visual center of attention.
FANCY LADY	f	It's quite gestural.
RUBEN	m	Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes.
FANCY LADY	f	I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one.
RUBEN	m	Well... I'm not allowed to say...
RUBEN	m	Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please don't come in here...
WALTER	m	Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute?
RUBEN	m	Walter. In polite society, the word is "appointment."
FANCY LADY	f	(glancing back and forth) Uh, I could come back later...
WALTER	m	You're gonna love my stuff today.
RUBEN	m	Haven't I seen that one before?
WALTER	m	Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. This is the Sixth Arrondissement!
RUBEN	m	I don't understand. You lived in Paris for a week. How can you still be cranking out paintings?
WALTER	m	It's all up here. (beat; a sentimental
FLOURISH)	?	And here.
RUBEN	m	Well, it's not going up here. Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz! You're too literal.
WALTER	m	Hey, Art isn't fashion!
RUBEN	m	Yes it IS! People want Kandinsky, or Rothko! They don't want goopy street scenes.
WALTER	m	Would they want... this?
RUBEN	m	Good God! You've entered a new period.
WALTER	m	No... they're my wife's.
RUBEN	m	Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans.
WALTER	m	It's Expressionism. Surely you recognize it.
RUBEN	m	Well -- I'm just glad you two found each other.
WALTER	m	So... what do you say?
RUBEN	m	I say, NO! It's not art.
WALTER	m	Not -- "art"??
RUBEN	m	It's like the back of a magazine! "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel and win the Big Contest!"
WALTER	m	How dare you! Lots of people would like this.
RUBEN	m	Well, nobody who's walking through the door of this gallery! Now please! Clear out this clutter, before the taste police arrives.
WALTER	m	We'll never break in...! Because there's a CABAL. A secret society of gallery owners and critics, who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito, deciding what's "cool." They're like Freemasons. No, worse! McCarthy, in his hearings: "That painter, I anoint. That painter, I banish to nowheresville!"
MARGARET	f	I think people buy art because it touches them --
WALTER	m	Heh! You're livin' in fairy land! People don't get to discover a thing. They buy art, because it's in the right place at the right time.
BANDUCCI	?	Give it up for Cal Tjader! That set was HUMMIN'! Al-aright, be sure to stick around for the one a.m. show!
WALTER	m	Hey, Banducci. I love the music tonight. It's a gas.
BANDUCCI	?	Oh. Thanks, thanks.
WALTER	m	I'm Walter Keane. I'm a painter. I was looking at your walls, and they're pretty plain.
BANDUCCI	?	Really? Hm...! Maybe you're right. What color were you thinking?
WALTER	m	No -- I'm an artist. I used to be based on the Left Bank. But now I've relocated to the "States," and I'm looking for an... exhibition venue.
BANDUCCI	?	I like my club the way it is. Your stuff's so hot, go put it in a museum.
WALTER	m	Okay! I respect that. You're a businessman, not a charity! So how 'bout if I, uh... rented your walls?
WALTER	m	Yes! The paintings are available for public viewing daily, from 7 to 3! (an awkward beat) Er, no. 3 a.m. It's in a nightclub. (he hangs up) Maggie! It's promotion time! We gotta lay the racket!
WALTER	m	Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes sir, how may I help you?
MAN	m	I'm, uh, just looking for the john.
TIPSY LADY	m	Look at that child. She's so sad.
TIPSY MAN	m	Is she poor..?
TIPSY LADY	m	She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. (she peers at the signature, then turns) Are you "Keane"?
WALTER	m	Yeah.
TIPSY LADY	m	Well you're a hell of a painter.
WALTER	m	Why, thank you...! Thank you so much!
TIPSY LADY	m	Your work is very powerful. There's so much emotion in those eyes.
TIPSY LADY	m	Is something wrong?
WALTER	m	Huh? Uh... no. No. I just didn't realize you meant... the waif.
TIPSY MAN	m	(beat; he CHUCKLES) Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece...
BANDUCCI	?	Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh?
WALTER	m	You wouldn't know it from that broom closet you parked me in.
BANDUCCI	?	Hey, it's prime thoroughfare! People drink, they gotta relieve themselves.
WALTER	m	"Location, location, location..."
WALTER	m	It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT!
BANDUCCI	?	Whoah! Watch it with the purple language. We got ladies present --!
MARGARET	f	I've never posted bail before.
WALTER	m	I'm -- I'm sorry. Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him.
MARGARET	f	Since when are you thin-skinned? Artists have to handle criticism.
WALTER	m	You're right! I know. But... I was already in a bad place. I'd had a couple... and earlier... I let some guy think I painted your Big Eye.
MARGARET	f	I don't understand. Why would you do such a thing?!
WALTER	m	It was a misunderstanding. And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale.
MARGARET	f	Don't ever do it again.
WALTER	m	Don't give me a hard time. I'm just grabbing my stuff...
BANDUCCI	?	Can you believe this? We're sold out, and I don't even have a headliner!! Hell, it's a Monday!
BANDUCCI	?	Dope, we made the front page!! People are here, cause they wanna see the sappy paintings that made grown men fight!!
WALTER	m	I'll see you in COURT, you son of a bitch! I'm suing you for assault! Slander! False arrest!!
DICK	m	Yes sir! Whew. That was quite a load of horseshit you gents were layin' out there. Dick Nolan. The Examiner.
DICK	m	Hey pal, don't lose any sleep. I eat this stuff with a spoon! It gives me something to type about, in my column.
WALTER	m	(he laughs, relieved) I thought you only did celebrities.
DICK	m	Well, Banducci's famous -- and you hit him! So you're a celebrity, once- removed. Buy me a drink?
WALTER	m	Huh? Uh, sure --
DICK	m	Gary! I'll have a Ward Eight, in a frosted high boy. My friend'll have the same. (he beams, then turns) So! Walter, tell me about your work --
WALTER	m	Well, when I was in Paris...
DICK	m	Jesus, not those! I mean the little hobo kids.
WALTER	m	What do you wanna know...?!
WALTER	m	Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT!
WALTER	m	What a night! I sold out all your Big Eyes!!
MARGARET	f	There must be two-hundred dollars...
WALTER	m	They adore you! Cause of that article, the joint was PACKED. And then, a famous journalist showed up, and -- I need more paintings! Now!
MARGARET	f	Walter, they take at least a week. There's layering, shading --
WALTER	m	Of course! But, this is opportunity! Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack team: Me schmoozing up the club, while you're back here, doing what you love!
MARGARET	f	Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane?
WALTER	m	...yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet said they're the windows of the soul.
GROUPIE	f	They hold so much feeling.
WALTER	m	You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big. I've always done it that way.
WALTER	m	If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out.
MARGARET	f	Walter...?
WALTER	m	Baby! Hey, uh, what are you doing here? I
MARGARET	f	Why are you lying?
MARGARET	f	You're taking credit for something that isn't yours.
WALTER	m	I was... trying to close the deal --
MARGARET	f	Those children are part of my being!
WALTER	m	I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter --
MARGARET	f	They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!!
WALTER	m	Shh, QUIET!
WALTER	m	Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? What's the difference?!
MARGARET	f	You take this so lightly --
WALTER	m	Not all all! But it's not about ego! You wanna say you did the street scenes? Fine! I don't care! Say a monkey painted it!
MARGARET	f	I'm glad you can dash off your pieces without any emotional connection...!
WALTER	m	Ah, honey! I just wanna share them with the world! Would you rather have your children piled in a closet... or hanging in someone's living room?
WALTER	m	Hey. Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man?
BANDUCCI	?	That's Dino Olivetti -- as in Olivetti typewriters.
BANDUCCI	?	Don't even try, Walter. He doesn't speak a lick of English.
EUROPEAN BLONDE	m	Mr. Olivetti is enchanted with the painting. He would like to know... who is the artist?
WALTER	m	I am!
WALTER	m	It's a delight to meet you, Signore! Buon giorno! Have you been an art lover for long..?
WALTER'S VOICE	m	I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't it striking? With its juxtaposition of girl, cat, and stairs... and its almost Flemish use of underpigment...
WALTER'S VOICE	m	Baby! Baby! Can you believe it?!!
WALTER	m	We made five grand!! Five THOUSAND dollars...!!! And that wasn't even one of your good ones!
MARGARET	f	Don't you mean... one of your good ones?
WALTER	m	No. No no! One of -- OUR good ones. (the spirit of generosity, he hands her a CHECK) Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT!
MARGARET	f	What about... honesty?
WALTER	m	Aw c'mon! The paintings say "Keane"! I'm Keane, you're Keane. From now on, we are one and the same.
WALTER	m	On behalf of the children of the world, we present this painting to Mayor Christopher!
WALTER	m	In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia!
DICK	m	The Purple Onion. 9:30. Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation.
WALTER	m	Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, "The Lion and the Child"!
WALTER	m	Joan said "Marvelous"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! (he CLAPS his hands) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening.
MARGARET	f	But... isn't it strange? Artists get shown. They don't build their own galleries.
WALTER	m	Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism!
WALTER	m	He digs real art. Your art! It's beautiful. You're beautiful...
WALTER	m	Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this!
JANE	f	I remember when Momma painted that.
MARGARET	f	Are you -- sure? That was a long time ago.
JANE	f	Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen --
WALTER	m	No, dear, I'm afraid you're confused. I painted that one --
JANE	f	No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress.
MARGARET	f	L-lots of girls have that dress...
WALTER	m	You have a good eye, sweetie. I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. You know, the style she USED to paint in.
JANE	f	Well you did a really good job.
MARGARET	f	Hello. I've -- never really done this before. I'm not sure how you... I was raised Methodist. If it's a problem, I can go --
PRIEST'S VOICE	m	No, no! Please. We don't chase people away. What is troubling you?
MARGARET	f	I lied to my child.
PRIEST'S VOICE	m	Why would you do that?
MARGARET	f	My husband... he pressured me into doing it. I've never lied to her before. I'm not that kind of person.
PRIEST'S VOICE	m	Is your husband that kind of person?
MARGARET	f	Ummm, no. I don't think of him that way. I mean, he likes to tell stories... maybe he exaggerates a little... but he's a good man. He takes care of us. He wants to make enough money to buy our family a house...
PRIEST'S VOICE	m	But what of the child? Will this lie bring harm to her?
MARGARET	f	"Harm"?? Oh! Not at all. I'm just looking for answers...
PRIEST'S VOICE	m	Well, the modern world is a complicated place.
MARGARET	f	N-no. That's not what --
PRIEST'S VOICE	m	It sounds like your husband is trying to make the best of an imperfect situation. You were raised Christian, so you know what we are taught: The man is head of the household. Perhaps you should trust his judgment.
HIPSTER LADY	m	I think it's creepy, maudlin and amateurish.
HIPSTER MAN	m	Exactly. I love it.
TIPSY MAN	m	We got in early. We own three. Thanks, doll.
DEE-ANN	f	Hey, baby! Killer party! It's a hap- pen-ing...! So, where's your stuff?
MARGARET	f	Oh. Um, we decided that this would be Walter's show --
DEE-ANN	f	Oh "we" did?? And why would "we" do that??
MARGARET	f	Well... he's more established.
DEE-ANN	f	Please! Is that you talking, or did you just turn into a little felt puppet with someone's hand up your ass?
DEE-ANN	f	It's strange... Walter doesn't strike me as the cute hungry kitten type...
MARGARET	f	Thanks for coming.
WALTER	m	Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene? (he gives her a kiss)
WALTER	m	Give a hand to my beautiful wife. Without her, none of tonight would be possible!
TIPSY MAN	m	Your husband's quite a talent. Do you paint, too?
MARGARET	f	I don't... know.
NOSY GUY	m	I'm curious about your technique. How long did that piece take to execute?
WALTER	m	That? Oh, wow. Probably... months. First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils.
NOSY GUY	m	"Oils"? But isn't that acrylic...?
WALTER	m	Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain!
NOSY GUY	m	So where do you get your ideas?
WALTER	m	What do you mean?
NOSY GUY	m	I mean -- (confused at this confusion) Why are they... images of children?
WALTER	m	Well, er, I've just always loved kids. Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter...
WALTER	m	I remember when she was a baby...
WALTER	m	Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. You know? It doesn't capture your feelings. So that's when I started painting her... Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics! To protect them from such atrocities!
JANE	f	Mom! I wanna come in.
JANE	f	(she BANGS again) Let me in! What are you doing in there? Why's the door always locked?
WALTER	m	Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. Sometimes grownups need alone time. Is that the ice cream truck? Why don't you go get yourself a fudgesicle?
WALTER	m	Whew! Out of this world...!
MARGARET	f	I dunno. I'm not really comfortable with this. Jane and I used to be so close... but -- now...
WALTER	m	Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. She has a college fund.
MARGARET	f	Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. I've been in here all day.
WALTER	m	Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. Take a break!
WALTER	m	Is that a tear...? You've gone deep!
MARGARET	f	Do you -- like it?
WALTER	m	I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? Is it the highlights?
MARGARET	f	No. The secret is the shadow. I shadowed the eyelid.
WALTER	m	I owe you an apology. I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity... but they have a real strength.
MARGARET	f	Is that your best version of sincerity?
WALTER	m	I'm trying! Ah, you know me. See -- this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art.
MARGARET	f	You're going to be on television?!
WALTER	m	Yes! But... what will I say?? Meaning -- what compels me... to paint... these paintings??
MARGARET	f	Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls.
WALTER	m	Cute.
MARGARET	f	I guess you've painted yourself into a corner.
WALTER	m	Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. You want heat this winter? Help me out!
MARGARET	f	Walter... art is personal.
WALTER	m	What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?!
WALTER	m	I grew up, surrounded by six sisters. I grew up in an orphanage? I grew up... in a world where adults had vanished, and children and kittens ran wild over the desolate landscape!
MARGARET	f	What about your Paris street scenes? Why do you paint those?
WALTER	m	Well, because... I lived it! I experienced it!
MARGARET	f	(calling his bluff) And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors?
WALTER	m	Well -- NO! Of course not. It was after the War. There was destruction everywhere...
WALTER	m	I traveled the Continent. The ravages were horrifying...
WALTER	m	Good afternoon! Delighted! (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass) How many sales today?
BLONDE CLERK	f	"Sales?" None with this crowd.
BLONDE CLERK	f	These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. But we gave away a heap of posters!
WALTER'S VOICE	m	And then... we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE!
WALTER	m	Whew! Something smells in here. You should open a window.
MARGARET	f	What time is it?
WALTER	m	I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner?
WALTER	m	When's the last time you washed your hair?
MARGARET	f	I've been... busy.
WALTER	m	(he notices the turned canvas; he's intrigued) What do you got back there? Lemme see.
MARGARET	f	No --! It's just... something I'm working on. It's not for the world.
WALTER	m	"The world"? Baby, it's me! (stepping forward, a bit
MALEVOLENT)	m	I'm your number one fan.
MARGARET	f	No, please! Walter, it's -- personal.
WALTER	m	But we're husband and wife. We shouldn't have secrets...
WALTER	m	It's a completely different style.
MARGARET	f	Yes it is.
WALTER	m	It looks like you.
MARGARET	f	It's a self-portrait.
WALTER	m	How am I gonna explain that?
MARGARET	f	I thought... maybe... I could sign it myself.
WALTER	m	That seems a bit confusing. "Keane" means me.
MARGARET	f	Yes, I know... but... when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say -- that's mine.
WALTER	m	Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes?
MARGARET	f	Nobody!
WALTER	m	Was Dee-Ann here?! Did Dee-Ann see this painting?!
MARGARET	f	No! NOBODY saw it!
WALTER	m	You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? We've committed FRAUD!
MARGARET	f	I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life! Janie used to have a mother who painted. Now what's she think?! I lock myself in this room ten hours a day... and then you walk out with finished paintings!
WALTER	m	Janie thinks I'm in here, painting.
MARGARET	f	C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! (starting to sob) We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side --
WALTER	m	That was the honeymoon period!
WALTER	m	Jesus, you're so fragile.
MARGARET	f	I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! (she SOBS harder) Please! Just let me have this!
DICK	m	So you're now called "The Painting Keanes"?
WALTER	m	Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities!
DICK	m	I had no idea Margaret painted.
WALTER	m	Yeah, we don't talk about it. Sadly, people don't buy lady art.
MARGARET	f	What about Georgia O'Keefe?
WALTER	m	The bar's over there.
WALTER	m	Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. I even steal a few tips from her, now and then! Behind every great man is a great woman.
DICK	m	True true. So Margaret, where do you get your ideas?
MARGARET	f	(a bit tentative) Oh... from the world around me. And I love Modigliani's use of line.
DICK	m	ModiWHAT? The Italian joint?
WALTER	m	Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column -- Let's stick to the family angle. Get a gander at little Janie over there!
WALTER	m	What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine. Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for. Make it sound good.
JANE	f	Who's that?
WALTER	m	Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes!
WALTER	m	Lily, honey, how are you?!
LILY	f	I'm fine, Dad. I lost a tooth.
WALTER	m	Really? Did you get in a fight?
LILY	f	No. It fell out!
WALTER	m	Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it?
LILY	f	She handled it.
WALTER	m	Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun!
DICK	m	Walter... you never told me you had another daughter.
WALTER	m	Didn't I? Sure. Lil's from my first marriage.
MARGARET	f	Walter? Walter! We need to speak.
MARGARET	f	What is going on here??!
WALTER	m	That's Lily. I'm sure I mentioned her --
MARGARET	f	No you didn't.
MARGARET	f	Did she just move in??
WALTER	m	No! Her mom's just going to Vegas for the weekend. I'm supposed to have her once a month, but I don't make her mom enforce it.
MARGARET	f	How can you keep something so big a secret???
WALTER	m	She's a sweet girl.
MARGARET	f	I'm sure she is.
WALTER	m	I put up with your daughter. I never said a peep.
MARGARET	f	I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
WALTER	m	I'm sorry. Sorry! Please... let's just try to get through this.
LILY	f	Dad told me you had a bunk bed.
JANE	f	Take the bed. I can sleep on the
LILY	f	No, that's not fair! The floor's fine for me.
JANE	f	Do you live far away?
LILY	f	I guess... about a twenty minute drive.
JANE	f	"Twenty minutes"?! That's close!
JANE	f	But you never see Walter?
LILY	f	No, I see him all the time! He comes up and visits every week.
LILY	f	Doesn't he talk about me?
JANE	f	Huh? Uh... sure. I guess a little.
JANE	f	Does he talk about me?
LILY	f	Uh... yeah. Sometimes.
JANE	f	So what's your mom like?
LILY	f	She's pretty. She drives a Buick. She cries a lot.
JANE	f	Yeah, mine's the same. Except she drives a Packard.
JANE	f	I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. Do you wanna eat it?
WALTER	m	Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat...
MARGARET	f	I painted it!
RICH MAN	m	Really? It's very evocative. ...Sensual...
RICH MAN	m	"MDH"? You're so... mysterioso.
MARGARET	f	Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously. "MDH" are my initials. And more! I'm interested in numerology... and as you know, seven is a very good number.
RICH MAN	m	Er... seven?
MARGARET	f	Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven!
WALTER	m	Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? (he PULLS HER ASIDE) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? You want just one number in his head: The sales price!
SNOBBY ARTIST #1	m	Two nuts that fell from the same tree! It's insufferable. Why are we starving, while they print money?
SNOBBY ARTIST #2	m	Because that nut's a genius! He sells paintings! Then he sells pictures of the paintings! Then he sells postcards of pictures of the paintings.
SNOBBY ARTIST #1	m	I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes.
SNOBBY ARTIST #2	m	It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity.
SNOBBY ARTIST #1	m	The customers won't notice...
RUBEN	m	Christ. It's a movement.
MARGARET	f	Rembrandt, shush!
DEE-ANN	f	My God! I thought I misread the address.
MARGARET	f	Yeah. That driveway is long. (she giggles, embarrassed) Honestly, I can't believe I live here.
DEE-ANN	f	Whoa.
MARGARET	f	I know! Two acres, a pool, five
BEDROOMS --	?	Though I thought that was excessive, since there's only three of us here.
DEE-ANN	f	Three? I thought there were four.
MARGARET	f	What? Oh -- you mean Lily! No, she doesn't really live with us. That was just in the articles.
DEE-ANN	f	Crazy. A fake daughter...
DEE-ANN	f	It's been so long since I've seen you.
MARGARET	f	I know. North Beach is 30 miles, but it might as well be 300...
DEE-ANN	f	You're probably busy, hanging out with your new rich buddies. "Kim Novak."
MARGARET	f	Oh, please! She's Walter's friend. (a quiet shrug) He brings people by... the Beach Boys were here. But, it's pretty isolated.
MARGARET	f	Jane has nice friends. Sometimes I pick them up at the junior high, and we all get pizza. But she's busy... Are you hungry?
DEE-ANN	f	I'm thirsty.
MARGARET	f	Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes.
MARGARET	f	When we moved in, I thought a wet bar was extravagant... but it's surprising how much use you can get out of it.
DEE-ANN	f	How's Walter?
MARGARET	f	He couldn't be happier. He has everything he ever dreamed of.
DEE-ANN	f	And so do you! Fabulous.
DEE-ANN	f	Oh, is that your studio?
MARGARET	f	No --! You can't go in --
DEE-ANN	f	I just want a peek. See what the workspace of a wildly successful artist looks like --
MARGARET	f	Dee-Ann, please! STOP --
MARGARET	f	W-Walter paints in here too.
DEE-ANN	f	Is Walter home??
WALTER	m	What the hell's going on here?!!
MARGARET	f	Uh... Dee-Ann was just... she...
WALTER	m	You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done!
WALTER	m	There!
WALTER	m	You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!!
DEE-ANN	f	SHUT UP! You're so full of shit, Walter!
WALTER	m	Get outta my house! My big house! Go back to sellin' your coat hanger sculptures on Fisherman's Wharf!
DEE-ANN	f	Fuck you!
WALTER	m	I don't want her ever invited here again.
MARGARET	f	I won't.
JANE	f	Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball!
MARGARET	f	Okay, honey. I have to go work.
JANE	f	Can I come? (an awkward silence) No. I can never come. No! I shouldn't even ask.
MARGARET	f	Where did you appear from? Didn't you hear? No visitors!
MARGARET	f	Is this what it's come to? You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? (she lowers her voice) Well -- I painted them all! (she shudders with release) It's TRUE! I did every single one --
MARGARET	f	Well, every one except that street scene. But I did the rest. Every Big Eye! And nobody will ever know. But YOU.
MARGARET	f	No you don't! It's nice to have company, but that sofa is new. (she pushes him off) Let's find you some carpet to lay on.
MARGARET	f	I think there's a scrap back here...
MARGARET	f	Well what's this?
WALTER	m	M-Maggie! What're you doin' up?
WALTER	m	I had a helluva night. Worked three or four clubs. (he winks, loosey-goosey) Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town! Straight from Taipei! I think we should present her with a painting -- get Dick to flack it... Or the heck with Dick. I met a new guy at UPI...
MARGARET	f	Maybe you should give her one of your street scenes.
WALTER	m	You think? I dunno -- I thought you could whip off a doodle of Chinatown. With a cute little kid, sort of a big- eyed slanty-eyed thing...
MARGARET	f	No, Walter. She's a dignitary. Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes straight from you? From your experience???
WALTER	m	Yeah? Maybe you're right. She probably doesn't have a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace.
MARGARET	f	Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a Cenic.
WALTER	m	"Cenic"...? Uh, what's that?
MARGARET	f	Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings.
WALTER	m	Huhhh? (spinning his lie) Urgh... oh! CENIC! (he laughs crazily) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me "Scenic"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard "e," I became "Cenic."
MARGARET	f	The more you lie, the smaller you seem.
WALTER	m	(unyielding, scrambling) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics!
MARGARET	f	Then why do you paint over the name?
MARGARET	f	A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. It flecks off.
WALTER	m	You sound crazy! For God's sake. You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!!
MARGARET	f	No, I haven't. I always thought I had... but it's some kind of... mirage. From a distance you look like a painter, but up close... there's nothing there.
WALTER	m	I studied art in Paris. I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand Chaumiere. I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters...
MARGARET	f	Walter?
MARGARET	f	Have you even been to Paris?
WALTER	m	I wanted... I so wanted to be an artist. But -- it just never turned out good.
MARGARET	f	I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. I -- I can't keep living these lies. There's three extra bedrooms. Go pick one.
WALTER	m	What are you working on?
MARGARET	f	A new MDH. Something for me. It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. I call it, "Escape."
WALTER	m	I figured out a solution to our problems.
MARGARET	f	What?
WALTER	m	Teach me. Show me your tricks. Then you can pass off the Waifs, and we won't be lying anymore.
MARGARET	f	And then -- YOU'LL paint them?
WALTER	m	Sure! Why not?
MARGARET	f	Walter, this isn't paint-by-numbers! You think it's easy?! It took me years to learn --
WALTER	m	Y-you're right! But you know me! I'm a quick study. And I've got the basics...
MARGARET	f	If you knew the basics, you wouldn't be at the easel. You have to sketch it first!
WALTER	m	So...? What's first?
MARGARET	f	I dunno. You tell me. You're the creator.
WALTER	m	It's a -- Keane.
MARGARET	f	Oh, a Keane! How witty. You know, when we met all those years ago, I never would've imagined in my wildest dreams that one day --
WALTER	m	YEAH YEAH! Point taken. I'm standing here naked and humiliated in front of you. Look... can we just do a crying child?
MARGARET	f	How old is the subject?
WALTER	m	Huh? C'mon, it's a head --
MARGARET	f	It matters! A young child's head is round. An older child's head is oval!
WALTER	m	The child is this old! You're trying to make this difficult --
MARGARET	f	NO I'M NOT! Every line is a decision! It's easy to talk about art, but it's not easy to MAKE art!!
WALTER	m	How's SALES?
REDHEAD CLERK	f	Oh, you know. Mondays --
WALTER	m	How many posters are back here?
REDHEAD CLERK	f	Exactly? I dunno, 3,000 or --
WALTER	m	Does the printer owe us more? Do we owe him??
REDHEAD CLERK	f	Uh, let me --
WALTER	m	What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse?
REDHEAD CLERK	f	Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a --
WALTER	m	For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for?
WALTER	m	Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife?
WALTER	m	Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up??
REDHEAD CLERK	f	Do you want a glass of water, Mr. Keane?
WALTER	m	What's it all mean? Why are we put on this earth? A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...?
REDHEAD CLERK	f	I -- I don't understand. You'll always be famous. You were on the Jack Paar Show... (she glances away) Er, excuse me, sir.
WALTER	m	It's not even mine! It's one of hers.
MAITRE'D	?	Ah! Monsieur and Madame Keane! Delighted! Always such an honor!
WALTER	m	This doesn't change anything.
MARGARET	f	(trying to hold her ground) I know the truth.
WALTER	m	Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. Start puttin' my name on the MDH's.
MARGARET	f	NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs!
WALTER	m	Quiet! Lower your voice --
MARGARET	f	Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT --
WALTER	m	NO YOU WON'T! Or -- I'll have you whacked!
MARGARET	f	What??!
WALTER	m	If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler?
MARGARET	f	You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once -- Do you know what it's been like for me? I don't have any friends. I've lied to my own child...
WALTER	m	Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess. It's life imitating art! A crying Keane!
MARGARET	f	What do you want, Walter? Everything with you is calculated. We're back where we had our first date...
WALTER	m	Look, I don't deny I need you. You're the one with the gift. Right now there's a shot... God, I'm shaking I'm so excited. The New York World's Fair. 70 million visitors. Opening day, I unveil my MASTERPIECE!
MARGARET	f	What masterpiece?
WALTER	m	Exactly! What have I been missing all this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa... Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch... but where's my defining statement?
MARGARET	f	You sound insane. Artists don't announce a masterpiece --
WALTER	m	Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he was hittin' a homer, when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel?
MARGARET	f	He worked on that for FOUR YEARS!
WALTER	m	Posterity, baby...!!
WALTER	m	And here's the best part. It's for Unicef! Unicef is sponsoring the Hall of Education. Aw, we can finally give back to the children of the world!!
MARGARET	f	It's too big. Why'd you promise them Cinerama size?
WALTER	m	Because it has to encompass all children. All races! One hundred stricken faces! Marching to infinity! The ultimate Walter Keane! At least that's what I told Life Magazine.
WALTER	m	Oh, a publisher says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book. You know, classy: "Tomorrow's Masters." So they need my... uh, early portfolio. My artistic evolution...
MARGARET	f	You're right! Where are your preliminary sketches?? All that time in art school, and somehow we waylaid your youthful experiments! The half- finished charcoals, the struggles...
WALTER	m	(a bit off-balance) I know you're being sarcastic, but these are all good ideas. Berlin war orphans... early self-portraits...
MARGARET	f	Get out of here. I'm trying to work.
JANE	f	Mom, what's for dinner? Mom! Are you home...?
MARGARET	f	W-what are you doing in here --? This is -- Walter's studio! You have to leave!
JANE	f	Mom... I know.
MARGARET	f	Jane, you don't know anything!!
JANE	f	I'm not a child anymore.
CANADAY	?	Four... five... SIX pages! Is there something here I'm missing? He's like -- the Hula-Hoop! He just won't go away...!
CANADAY	?	"Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion of the Hall of Education... internationally celebrated artist has been selected... will represent the aspirations of children worldwide --" Oh this is ABSURD!
CANADAY	?	And WHO was on the selection committee?
CIVIC LEADER	m	Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee," per se. We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife... Though technically, we didn't invite submissions. Mr. Keane just contacted us directly!
WALTER	m	Stop. Let us appreciate this moment. This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. Inside this house are the movers and shakers. Kennedys. Rockefellers. Until today, we've always been on the outside, looking in. But when we enter... we will belong.
MARGARET	f	I was happier selling paintings in the park.
WALTER	m	You are one crazy bitch.
WALTER	m	So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. Thursday, our book goes on sale!
MARGARET	f	Friday, I file for divorce.
WALTER	m	Aw, why are you always so miserable? Well, I'm gonna enjoy my afternoon!
WALTER	m	Mrs. Teasdale! Walter Keane. I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree.
SOCIETY MAN	m	Hey, Keane. Have you seen the Times?
WALTER	m	Er, no. Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely --
SOCIETY MAN	m	I think you should read the Times.
"TASTELESS"	?	"Lowest common denominator"
MARGARET	f	How could anyone... say something so cruel?
WALTER	m	(a seething fury) What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud!
WALTER	m	Is he here?
SOCIETY MAN	m	Er... yes. Which is perhaps why it would be best for everybody if you --
CANADAY	?	Mr. Keane, this is not the venue. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to the editor.
WALTER	m	What are you afraid of?? Just because people like my work, that means it's automatically bad??
CANADAY	?	No. But that doesn't make it art either.
CANADAY	?	Art should elevate -- not pander! Particularly in a Hall of Education!
WALTER	m	You have no idea!
WALTER	m	Why does a man become a critic --?? Because he can't create! You don't --
CANADAY	?	Ugh! That moldy chestnut --
WALTER	m	Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like! To put your emotions out there, naked, for the world to see.
CANADAY	?	What emotions?! It's synthetic hack work! (he loses it) Your "masterpiece" has an infinity of Keanes -- which just makes it an infinity of kitsch!
WALTER	m	What's wrong with lowest common denominators?! That's what this country was built on!!
WALTER	m	I'm gonna sue EVERYBODY! I'll sue that pansy critic! And the World's Fair! And -- Unicef! Yeah! I'll take down Unicef, and all their precious little boxes of dimes!
WALTER	m	But I can't sue you, can I? (in Margaret's face) You were the ultimate betrayal! You FAILED me with that painting!
WALTER	m	You crossed over from sentimentality to KITSCH!
JANE	f	Ow!
WALTER	m	You like making me look bad?? You enjoy people laughing at me??!
MARGARET	f	Walter!
WALTER	m	Lemme in, you BITCHES!!
WALTER	m	Ow!
JANE	f	Mom, what are we gonna do??!
WALTER	m	You got all that paint and turpentine in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up!
WALTER	m	You're gonna blow like an atom bomb!
MARGARET	f	We're leaving.
MARGARET	f	I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. I -- I should have done this years ago...
JANE	f	But where are we going? We don't even have any clothes!
MARGARET	f	Where we're going, we won't need much. Hawaii.
JANE	f	Really...?
MARGARET	f	Yes, Hawaii. Because it's paradise. There's flowers, and birds, and beautiful colors. And... we're going to make a new life for ourselves.
MARGARET	f	Hello?
WALTER	m	Boy, you were sure hard to track down. Thought I might never find you... (a menacing chuckle) I'm a little agitated. I got the strangest papers in the mail today.
MARGARET	f	It's a decree of legal separation. I would appreciate if you signed it.
WALTER	m	Aren't you acting too rash?
MARGARET	f	Walter, our marriage is over.
WALTER	m	Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. The bloom is off the rose. But I'm looking out for both of us. What about Keane Incorporated?! We're a professional couple. Like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
MARGARET	f	Walter, I want a divorce.
WALTER	m	Whew. It hurts to hear you say those words.
WALTER	m	I sure hate that it's come to this. Well... I SUPPOSE I can agree to a split -- as long... as you assign me all rights to every painting ever produced.
MARGARET	f	If that's the price.
WALTER	m	Really?!
WALTER	m	Uh -- okay. And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream.
MARGARET	f	My God, Walter! How much more money do you need?
WALTER	m	It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. Surely you understand? You want me out of your life, here's my term: You'll have to paint me 100 more waifs. 100 more Walter Keanes!
MARGARET	f	Would you like to go into town? I'm stopping by the post office.
JANE	f	No, I'm gonna surf with the gang.
MARGARET	f	Your friends are a bit... wild.
JANE	f	Loosen up, Mom! You're impossible! You move me all the way to Hawaii. Then I actually make some friends, and all you do is complain about them. Maybe you need to make some.
MARGARET	f	Y-you know I can't have people over to the house.
JANE	f	That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!!
ASIAN LADY #1	m	Hello. We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief.
ASIAN LADY #2	m	We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind.
MARGARET	f	I'm not interested.
ASIAN LADY #1	m	Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general?
MARGARET	f	I'm not interested in whatever you're selling.
ASIAN LADY #2	m	But we're not selling anything. We're just here to share the good news.
MARGARET	f	From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly.
ASIAN LADY #2	m	Yes! Exactly! That is the good news!
ASIAN LADY #1	m	Bad things in the world are a sign. They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand.
ASIAN LADY #2	m	Do you know what it says in Timothy
MARGARET	f	Sounds like my ex-husband.
MARGARET	f	Would you like to come in?
MARGARET	f	It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers.
ASIAN LADY #1	m	It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted.
MARGARET	f	So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses?
MARGARET	f	I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws...
ASIAN LADY #2	m	Then they're wrong for you. Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one.
MARGARET	f	And how do you know...?
ASIAN LADY #2	m	Because our beliefs are supported by the Scriptures. Jehovah is the God of truth.
MARGARET	f	What does that mean, exactly?
ASIAN LADY #2	m	Honesty leads to self-respect. A feeling of well-being.
MARGARET	f	It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things.
JANE	f	I just can't believe you let people in the house.
MARGARET	f	I have nothing to hide! It also says no lies. "Speak truth. Let the stealer steal no more."
HIPPIE CHICK	?	Shit, this is crazy! All these copies... you're like Warhol!
WALTER	m	Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly stole my act! "The Factory"? I had a factory before he had a soup can!
WALTER	m	Ah! It's my art supplies.
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES	?	"Tremble not before your foe, Let all lovers of truth know! That my reigning Son, Christ Jesus, From the heav'ns has cast the foe. Soon will bind the Devil, Satan, Letting all his victims go!"
MARGARET	f	No... Big Lolo. Everything you just said is false.
MARGARET	f	One: Walter is no longer my husband. (a long pause) And Two: He's not... a painter.
MARGARET	f	No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years. I'm the only painter in the family.
CANADAY	?	You have got to be kidding!
DEE-ANN	f	I knew it!!!
RUBEN	m	Who would WANT credit?!
WALTER	m	Holy mother of GOD!
WALTER	m	Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down.
DICK	m	I don't know... Walter. What she has said is pretty inflammatory.
WALTER	m	But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee!
WALTER	m	Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like a
MAGICIAN)	?	See?! Berlin orphans, 1946!
DICK	m	But... how could she...
WALTER	m	Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage. Hell, she busted OUR marriage! Sleeping around with whatever trash she could find!!
DICK	m	I-I, but... why would Maggie do this?
WALTER	m	She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots: Jehovah's Witnesses.
DICK	m	I really don't know much about them...
WALTER	m	Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom!
MARGARET	f	He made me sound crazy!!
ASIAN LADY #2	m	Just rise above it.
MARGARET	f	But how can I?! He claims I copied HIM! That he taught ME how to paint! (reading the NEWSPAPER) "She used a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors."
ASIAN LADY #1	m	And which part of that is untrue?
MARGARET	f	When I finally told the truth, I felt good about myself for the first time in years!! I'm not going to let him take that away.
JANE	f	Hey. Is Jehovah okay with suing??
REPORTER #1	m	Seventeen million dollars! The art world is abuzz! Is it possible that the decade's top-selling painter can't even paint??!
REPORTER #2	m	Or is Mrs. Keane simply a bitter ex- wife, trying to steal her husband's fame and fortune? Today in Federal Court, lawyers present their opening arguments in the case of Margaret Keane vs. Walter Keane and Gannett Newspapers. A trial that could produce the largest libel and slander award in Hawaiian history.
REPORTER #1	m	Mr. Keane! Are you at all concerned about the charges?
WALTER	m	I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to have the mighty Gannett News Company watching my back. I expect to have this whole trial dismissed by noon. Truthfully, my only concern is that somebody get this woman some psychiatric care. She needs it!
GANNETT LAWYER	m	Margaret Keane is a public figure. And as such, she has to prove that our newspapers published statements, aware of probable falsity. But there is no evidence that our editors could have known that the assertions were untrue. We would like to submit 692 articles and interviews in which Mrs. Keane credits Mr. Keane as the painter of the so-called "big eye" children.
JUDGE	m	How many years back do these go?
GANNETT LAWYER	m	Mrs. Keane has been making these statements since 1958.
JUDGE	m	This is a very strange case. These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the confusion...
JUDGE	m	It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. So -- the charge against them is dismissed.
GANNETT LAWYER	m	Thank you, Your Honor!
GANNETT LAWYER	m	Good luck, Keane.
WALTER	m	"Good luck"? W-where the hell are you going?!
GANNETT LAWYER	m	We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander. Just dance your way out of it.
JUDGE	m	Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order?
WALTER	m	I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name! Let's PROCEED!
WALTER	m	I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world --
JUDGE	m	Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time.
WALTER	m	Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. It's hard to keep this all straight...
WALTER	m	Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story --
WALTER	m	Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent... So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme?
MARGARET	f	I was forced into it. You had --
MARGARET	f	He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad...
WALTER	m	(like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath.
WALTER	m	S-sorry.
MARGARET	f	I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... I was weak. I didn't feel I could leave and support myself and my daughter. He said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality. Maybe he was right... You were very talented at being charming. You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion.
WALTER	m	Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant.
MARGARET	f	That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde.
WALTER	m	What an outrageous statement! I demand we strike that from the record!
JUDGE	m	(he SLAMS his fist) Overruled!!
MARGARET	f	(she loses her temper) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!!
WALTER	m	Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial!
JUDGE	m	HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it.
WALTER	m	I'm sorry for the emotions. I'm an artist.
JUDGE	m	Maybe.
WALTER	m	I call as my witness... Mr. Walter Stanley Keane!
BAILIFF	?	Do you swear to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
WALTER	m	Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "big-eyed waifs." Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings?
WALTER	m	Why -- I created the children.
JUDGE	m	The choreography is not necessary. Just sit down and testify.
WALTER	m	I've had a wonderful life. I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities... (he gets misty-eyed) But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what mattered...
WALTER	m	it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world. It all began in Berlin. After World War II...
WALTER	m	...the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. Imploring me, begging me... "Do something!" "Do something."
WALTER	m	...and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me...
WALTER	m	...Kim Novak...
WALTER	m	...Liberace...
WALTER	m	...Wayne Newton...
WALTER	m	Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life."
WALTER	m	I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobile
JUDGE	m	You're done.
WALTER	m	B-but, I'm not finished --
JUDGE	m	Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense. We can stay here until we grow old and die... but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word.
WALTER	m	So... mistrial?
JUDGE	m	NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint.
BAILIFF	?	Awright, bring those easels down. Careful, don't bump anything... watch it with those paint cans, I got some newspaper on the floor down front...
JUDGE	m	Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough?
JUDGE	m	Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.
JUDGE	m	Mr. Keane?
WALTER	m	I'm... setting the mood. Getting the... muse to strike...
JUDGE	m	Well, your muse has 58 minutes.
JUDGE	m	Mr. Keane! Are you all right?
WALTER	m	No -- it's -- Ah shoot! My old shoulder injury just flared up. I've got a bad muscle -- I've been taking medication for the inflammation...
WALTER	m	I -- I don't think I'll be able to paint today.
MARGARET	f	Thank you! Thank you so much.
REPORTER #2	m	What are you going to call the painting?
MARGARET	f	"Exhibit 224."
REPORTER #1	m	The jury found in favor of Margaret Keane on all points. She won on charges of defamation, emotional distress, damaged reputation --
WALTER	m	What a group of idiots... a quagmire of incompetence... This doesn't change a thing!
REPORTER #2	m	Margaret! Do you feel vindicated by the high award?
MARGARET	f	Oh... it was never about the money. And honestly -- I doubt Walter will even pay.
MARGARET	f	I just wanted credit for what I had done. The justice is... I got my art back. My prayers have been answered.
PORTLY LADY	m	Margaret! Could I possibly have your autograph?
