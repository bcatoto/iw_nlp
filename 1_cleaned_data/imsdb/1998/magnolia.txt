NARRATOR	m	In the New York Herald, November 26, year 1911, there is an account of the hanging of three men --
NARRATOR	m	...they died for the murder of Sir Edmund William Godfrey --
NARRATOR	m	-- Husband, Father, Pharmacist and all around gentle-man resident of --
NARRATOR	m	Greenberry Hill, London. Population as listed.
NARRATOR	m	He was murdered by three vagrants whose motive was simple robbery.  They were identified as:
NARRATOR	m	...Joseph Green.....
NARRATOR	m	...Stanley Berry....
NARRATOR	m	...and Nigel Hill...
NARRATOR	m	Green, Berry and Hill.
NARRATOR	m	...And I Would Like To Think This Was Only A Matter Of Chance.
NARRATOR	m	As reported in the Reno Gazzette, June of 1983 there is the story of a fire ---
NARRATOR	m	--- the water that it took to contain the fire --
NARRATOR	m	-- and a scuba diver named Delmer Darion.
FIRE FIGHTER	m	What the fuck is that?
NARRATOR	m	Employee of the Peppermill Hotel and Casino, Reno, Nevada. Engaged as a blackjack dealer --
NARRATOR	m	-- well liked and well regarded as a physical, recreational and sporting sort -- Delmer's true passion was for the lake --
NARRATOR	m	-- as reported by the coroner, Delmer died of a heart attack somewhere between the lake and the tree.  But most curious side note is the suicide the next day of Craig Hansen --
NARRATOR	m	...volunteer firefighter, estranged father of four and a poor tendency to drink -- Mr. Hansen was the pilot of the plane that quite accidentally lifted Delmer Darion out of the water --
NARRATOR	m	-- added to this, Mr. Hansen's tortured life met before with Delmer Darion just two nights previous --
CRAIG HANSEN	m	...oh God...fuck...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
NARRATOR	m	The weight of the guilt and the measure of coincidence so large, Craig Hansen took his life.
CRAIG HANSEN	m	...forgive me...
NARRATOR	m	And I Am Trying To Think This Was All Only A Matter Of Chance.
NARRATOR	m	The tale told at a 1961 awards dinner for the American Association Of Forensic Science by Dr. Donald Harper, president of the association, began with a simple suicide attempt --
NARRATOR	m	Seventeen year old Sydney Barringer. In the city of Los Angeles on March 23, 1958.
NARRATOR	m	The coroner ruled that the unsuccessful suicide had suddenly become a succesful homicide.  To explain:
NARRATOR	m	The suicide was confirmed by a note, left in the breast pocket of Sydney Barringer --
NARRATOR	m	At the same time young Sydney stood  on the ledge of this nine story building,  an argument swelled three stories below --
NARRATOR	m	The neighbors heard, as they usually  did, the arguing of the tenants --
NARRATOR	m	-- and it was not uncommon for them  to threaten each other with a shotgun  or one of the many handguns kept in the house --
OLDER MAN	m	Put it down, put that fuckin' thing down Fay --
OLDER WOMAN	f	-- I'II fucking tell YOU. I'll shoot you in the face and end this argument and we see who's right --
NARRATOR	m	And when the shotgun accidentaly went off, Sydney just happend to pass --
OLDER MAN	m	You CRAZY FUCKIN' BITCH WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OLDER WOMAN	f	SHUT THE FUCK UP.
NARRATOR	m	Added to this, the two tenants turned out to be: Fay and Arthur Barringer. Sydney's mother and Sydney's father.
NARRATOR	m	When confronted with the charge, which took some figuring out for the officers on the scene of the crime, Fay Barringer  swore that she did not know that the gun was loaded.
FAY BARRINGER	f	I didn't know -- I didn't know --
ARTHUR BARRINGER	m	She always threatens me with the gun, but I don't keep it loaded --
DETECTIVE	m	-- and you didn't load the gun?
ARTHUR BARRINGER	m	Why would I load the gun?
NARRATOR	m	A young boy who lived in the building,  sometimes a vistor and friend to Sydney Barringer said that he had seen,  six days prior the loading of the shotgun --
DETECTIVE	m	C'mere a minute --
NARRATOR	m	It seems that the arguing and the  fighting and all of the violence was far  too much for Sydney Barringer and knowing  his mother and father's tendency to fight, he decided to do something --
YOUNG BOY	m	He said he wanted them to kill  each other, that all they wanted to do was kill each other and he would  help them if that's what they wanted to do --
NARRATOR	m	Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop -- His parents argue three stories below --
NARRATOR	m	Her accidental shotgun blast hits Sydney in the stomach as he passes the arguing sixth floor window --
NARRATOR	m	He is killed instantly but continues  to fall -- only to find, three stories below -- a safety net installed  three days prior for a set of window washers that would have broken his fall and saved  his life if not for the hole in his stomach.
NARRATOR	m	So Fay Barringer was charged with the  murder of her son and Sydney Barringer  noted as an accomplice in his own death...
NARRATOR	m	...and it is in the humble opinion of this narrator that this is not just "Something  That Happened."  This cannot be "One of those things..." This, please, cannot be that.  And for what I would like to say, I can't. This Was Not Just A Matter Of Chance.
NARRATOR	m	Ohhhh. These strange things happen all the time.
FRANK	m	In this big game that we play it is not what you

JIM KURRING	m	Ok. What's your name?
MARCIE	f	Marcie.
JIM KURRING	m	Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
MARCIE	f	I preffer to stand.
JIM KURRING	m	I'm not askin', Marcie.
MARCIE	f	I didn't do anything.
JIM KURRING	m	Maybe you didn't, but I'm here  to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they  heard screaming and a loud crash.
MARCIE	f	I don't know a loud crash.
JIM KURRING	m	And what about screaming?
MARCIE	f	I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just  come in here and start pokin' around --
JIM KURRING	m	What's this, how did this happen?
MARCIE	f	An ashtray fell, I don't know, maybe last night, I just woke up.
JIM KURRING	m	You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
MARCIE	f	I went out last night.
JIM KURRING	m	Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you  to have a new attitude with me.  The more  you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
MARCIE	f	It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
JIM KURRING	m	Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight  answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
MARCIE	f	Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
JIM KURRING	m	Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?

MARCIE	f	WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN
JIM KURRING	m	Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN  and don't do this. I want you to stay --
MARCIE	f	WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT?
JIM KURRING	m	This is the LAPD. If anyone is  back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself  to me with your hands in the air --
MARCIE	f	THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT
JIM KURRING	m	This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out  and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
MARCIE 	f	THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
JIM KURRING	m	Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
MARCIE 	f	THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN
JIM KURRING	m	-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet  you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
MARCIE	f	I told you there was no one in there!
JIM KURRING	m	Marcie - Do not drag that couch any further!
JIM KURRING	m	What the hell is this Marcie?

PHIL	m	She went out.  She said she went  out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
EARL	m	She's a good girl.  She's a little  nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.

EARL	m	ifyougimmethat....overonthe....fuck.... I can't hold ontothis anymore...
FRANK	m	Respect the cock and tame the cunt, boys.
FRANK	m	And you did hear me right.  Tame it. Take it on, head first -- with your  skills at work and say, "No.  You will not control me.  You will not take my soul and you will not win this game." 'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna  think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect  the cock -- you are embedding this thought: I'm in charge.  I'm the one who says yes,  no, now or here.  Shit, man.  Sad but true. Sad But True.  And you wanna know what? It must be the way.  The thing about chicks and the thing about this course that we're going  through today is how
CAPTAIN MUFFY	m	You're Gwenovier?
GWENOVIER	?	Yeah.
CAPTIAN MUFFY	m	I'm Captain Muffy, I'm Frank's personal  assistant.  This is Doc --
DOC	m	Hello.
GWENOVIER	?	Hello.
CAPTAIN MUFFY	m	We can go right in here.  He started about thirty five minutes ago, but it's all getting pumped up now --
FRANK	m	Number One: Get a calendar.  I cannot stress this enough.  This is a simple  item guys.  It's 99 cents at your corner  store: Go And Get One.  Fuck it, if you reach into your packet, you'll see I've been nice enough to include one, 'cause that's the kind of prick I am --  You're gonna need this calendar and I know it sounds like a small thing, but having it makes all the difference in the world: If you meet a girl and you're  gonna work an A-3 Interuption --  let's say an eight day waiting period before  the next call -- how you gonna know when those eight days are up?  Buy a calendar. Next move?  Mark the calendar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did I pay my eight  hundred dollars for?  To hear Frank tell me to buy a calendar and mark it?  Just stick  with me and stick by the calendar.  Mark it up -- use it to set goals -- If you wanna  make that "friend" something else -- you gotta be hard on yourself, set goals: You, there: And What's Your Name?
FEMALE VOICE	f	Hello?
PHIL	m	Hi.  Is Frank there?
FEMALE VOICE	f	I think you have the wrong number.
PHIL	m	I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
FEMALE VOICE	f	No.
PHIL	m	Is this 509-9027?
FEMALE VOICE	f	Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
PHIL	m	Alright.  Thank you.
FEMALE VOICE	f	Yep.
GWENOVIER	?	Sorry I'm late --
CAMERAMAN	m	-- we're all set upstairs.
GWENOVIER	?	Thanks.
DOC	m	You have everything you need?
GWENOVIER	?	I'm set, thanks.
FRANK	m	Denise?
GUY	m	That's right --
FRANK	m	-- and she hurt you didn't she? I know, I know.  I know how that can be brother, but let me tell you loud and clear what we will be teaching Denise when we put our calendars to work and set goals:
FRANK	m	Little Denise, I say this:  I mark it up and I write it down and you've been warned: "By the end of May, you will know I'm not gay." "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're gonna be lickin' my spoon." "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat Sausage."  I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF. And what?  I've said "enough is enough." Because why?  She's not gonna be your pal. She's not gonna be your friend.  You think she's gonna be there for you the second you need something?  Think again - this fuckin' bitch Denise! But: Listen up:  That is not to say that we don't all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna  learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple of chick-friends laying around can come in real handy in setting Jealousy Traps.  But we'll get to that.  Number One (this is page 18 in your booklets, blue cover - go to it and follow along with me.)
FRANK	m	Create a crisis -- simple and clean, and if done properly can be quite effective in getting some bush.  Here we go:  Set a date with your so-called "friend."  Let's say you make it 7:30. You call her on the phone --
GIRL	f	That sounds like fun, Frank.  I love seafood.
FRANK	m	So I'll see you about 7:30?  Great, then.  Bye-bye, Cindy.
FRANK 	m	You wait until about nine o'clock and you ring the doorbell.
FRANK 	m	She opens it up, pissed as hell, but finds you sobbing your eyes out --
FRANK	m	...I can't believe what happened...
FRANK 	m	You explain between sobs that you hit a dog on the way over to pick her up and you had to rush it to the animal  hospital but by the time you got there --
FRANK	m	...and it's paw was sticking out...  and it was too late.  It was too late.
GIRL	f	Ohhh, shhhh...shhh...Frank...
FRANK	m	I can't believe I'm telling you guys this,  but the truly terrifying part is that: THIS WORKS. Any girl that calls herself your friend is not gonna let you be alone in a situation like that. Technique #2: Staging a fight.  This is not knock down, drag out, crying screaming, yelling -- this is a simple,  direct and subtle way of planting confusion into a girl's mind.  Remember we are using  reinforcement technique "G" with these women. Here's how:
FRANK 	m	One day, she calls you up on the phone...
FRANK	m	Hello?
GIRL	f	Hey, Frank.  It's Cindy.  I'm wondering  if you wanna grab a bite and see a movie?
FRANK 	m	You very directly say:
FRANK	m	"I don't think I have anything to say to you, Cindy."
FRANK	m	Let her wonder what she did wrong.
FRANK	m	This is the way...because they will always wonder, "What did I do?"  "What could I have done different?"  "How should I behave to get this back?" And if they think that way -- then they are asking for you to hurt them and  That Is What You Must Do.  That is what you must do which is punish them many, many times over.
RECEPTIONIST	m	Mrs. Partridge --
LINDA	f	I'm here and I need to see him.
LINDA	f	-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus,  how can you tell me to calm down?
DR. LANDON	m	I can help you through this the  best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be  strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to  know that you're listening to me, ok?
LINDA	f	I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's  going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me
DR. LANDON	m	Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone  who can take care of all of that for you --
LINDA	f	He has Phil right now.
DR. LANDON	m	Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
LINDA	f	Yeah.
DR. LANDON	m	If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine,  but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
LINDA	f	-- you don't understand: it's more pain  than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's  like he can't really swallow them and I don't  know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
DR. LANDON	m	We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
LINDA	f	I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
DR. LANDON	m	Do you wanna sit down?
LINDA	f	I need to sit down.
DR. LANDON	m	Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
DR. LANDON	m	Now the thing here is making that experience  as painless and easy as possible for him,  you understand?  Now you need to get in touch  with Hospice care because they can take care of all those practical things that you're asking  me about -- they are who you call when he dies.
DR. LANDON	m	This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and  it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really  is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and  out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the  recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
LINDA	f	-- how the fuck can I say anything  to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
DR. LANDON	m	The job here is to make him as comfortable  as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
MIDDLE AGED GUY	m	Hello?
JIMMY	m	Hello.  Is Claudia here?
MIDDLE AGED GUY	m	She's asleep.
JIMMY	m	Are you her boyfriend?
MIDDLE AGED GUY	m	You're Jimmy Gator, right?

CLAUDIA	f	What do you want? Why are you here?
JIMMY	m	I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
CLAUDIA	f	He's not my boyfriend.
CLAUDIA	f	Wanna call me a slut now, something?
JIMMY	m	No.  No.
CLAUDIA	f	What the fuck do you want?
JIMMY	m	I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.

DONNIE	m	-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
THURSTON	m	Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but  I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
DONNIE	m	I have love.
THURSTON	m	A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
DONNIE	m	No.  I mean, I'm telling you:  I'm telling you that I have love.
THURSTON	m	And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
DONNIE	m	My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.

FLOOR DIRECTOR	f	Thirty Seconds.
RICHARD	m	The fuck is wrong with you?
STANLEY	m	I gotta go to the bathroom.
JULIA	f	Jesus Christ, Stanley.
RICK	m	-- you cannot do that. You have to  tone it.  Don't be real agressive, just subtely abusive.  You must say, "No. You are not leaving this house until that room is cleaned."
JULIA'S MOM	f	Julia's room is the same way.
JULIA'S DAD	m	Like a pig sty.  But it's the outfits  that we're getting into now --
JULIA'S MOM	f	You should have seen what she had on walking out the door --
JULIA'S DAD	m	-- all dolled up.
JULIA'S MOM	f	I said: "No. No. No.  We are not going to a fashion show.  You are going to school."
RICHARD'S MOM	f	-- It's not a fashion show, it's school.
JULIA'S MOM	f	It is
RICK	m	Let's make some fuckin' money, folks.
BURT	m	You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
JIMMY	m	And the book says: "We may by through with  the past, but the past ain't through with us."
BURT	m	C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
JIMMY	m	In my sleep, Burt.
FLOOR DIRECTOR	f	And...three...two...one....

JIMMY GATOR	m	Adults won a coin toss backstage and they'll have first choice: Todd.
TODD	m	I'll take "Authors," Jimmy.
PHIL	m	Got it.
JIMMY GATOR	m	First question for 25. This  female author's most famous work "O! Pioneers" --
STANLEY	m	Willa Cather.
JIMMY	m	For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --  Thomas Kyd.
JIMMY	m	This French playwright and actor joined the Bejart troupe of actors --  Moliere.
JIMMY	m	I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
STANLEY	m	Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.  What the fuck is this?
RICK	m	My little fucker -- I have no idea where he gets this stuff.
PHIL	m	Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
CHAD	m	It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
PHIL	m	Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come  up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or  what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person  if I explain myself?
CHAD	m	I'm really only equipped to take orders --
PHIL	m	Well can you connect me to someone else?
CHAD	m	Well what's the situation?
PHIL	m	Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain  this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named  Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge.  I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find  his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
CHAD	m	I'm here, I'm listening.
PHIL	m	OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl  Partridge's son....
GWEN	f	Where are you from originally?
FRANK	m	Around here.
GWEN	f	the valley?
FRANK	m	Hollywood, mainly.
GWEN	f	And what did your parents do?
FRANK	m	My father worked in televison.  My mother -- this is gonna sound  silly to you -- she was a librarian.
GWEN	f	Why does that sound silly?
FRANK	m	Well I guess it doesn't.
GWEN	f	Does you mother still work?
FRANK	m	She's retired.
GWEN	f	Are you close?
FRANK	m	She's my mother.
GWEN	f	What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
FRANK	m	"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
GWEN	f	And your father?
FRANK	m	He passed away.
GWEN	f	I'm sorry.
FRANK	m	people die.
GWEN	f	I wouldn'tve asked --
FRANK	m	Not a problem.
GWEN	f	And you ended up at UC Berkely --
FRANK	m	From '84 to '89.
GWEN	f	Psychology major?
FRANK	m	Right.
GWEN	f	Do you have your masters?
FRANK	m	...this close...
GWEN	f	In five years?
FRANK	m	Muffy, can I get another ciggy?
YOUNG PHARMACY KID	m	Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
LINDA	f	mmmhmm.
YOUNG PHARMACY KID	m	Must have alot goin' on for all that  stuff you got back there, eh?  You could  have quite a party all that stuff....
YOUNG PHARMACY KID	m	You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
LINDA	f	...I don't....
YOUNG PHARAMCY KID	m	Interesting drugs.  Dexadrine's basically speed in a pill.  Y'know?  But I guess a lot of doctors are balancing out the prozac with the dexadrine, eh?  That Liquid Morphine'll knock you down, out, around, up and down someone's not careful.....can't mix those up, y'know... ...Must have a lot goin' on in your life for all that stuff there.
YOUNG PHARAMCY KID	m	Strong, strong stuff here, boy...wow.... What exactly you have wrong, you need this stuff?
LINDA	f	You motherfucker...you motherfucker....
YOUNG PHARMACY KID	m	-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
LINDA	f	I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW,
OLDER PHARMACIST	m	Please, lady, why don't you just calm down --
LINDA	f	And FUCK YOU TOO.  Don't you call me "lady." I come in with these things, I give it over to you, you doubt, you make your  phone calls, check on me, look suspicious, ask questions, "I'm sick." I HAVE SICKNESS
CHAD	m	Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
PHIL	m	I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something,  some situation between them, like they don't  really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
CHAD	m	Uh-huh.
PHIL	m	Does this sound weird?
CHAD	m	Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
PHIL	m	There's no number for Frank in any  of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
CHAD	m	What kind of Cancer?
PHIL	m	Brain and Lung.
CHAD	m	My mother had breast cancer.
PHIL	m	It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
CHAD	m	Oh, she's fine.
PHIL	m	Oh that's good.
CHAD	m	It was scary though.
PHIL	m	It's a helluva disease.
CHAD	m	Sure is.  So why call me?
PHIL	m	I know this all seems silly.  I know that maybe I sound ridiculous, like maybe this is the scene of the  movie where the guy is trying to get ahold of the long-lost son, but this  is that scene.  Y'know?  I think they  have those scenes in movies because they're true, because they really happen.  And you gotta believe me: This is really happening.  I mean, I can give you my phone number and you can call me back  if you wanna check with whoever you can check  this with, but don't leave me hanging on this -- please -- please.  See: See:  See this is the scene of the movie where you help me out --
GWENOVIER	?	-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
FRANK	m	Like I said, yeah --
GWEN	f	And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
FRANK	m	I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then.  I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today.  Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what
GWEN	f	Where does that name come from?
FRANK	m	What name?  My name?
GWEN	f	It's not your given name, right?
FRANK	m	My mother's name, actually.  Good question.  You've done you're research.
GWEN	f	And "Frank?"
FRANK	m	"Frank" was my mother's father.
GWEN	f	Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
FRANK	m	Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
GWEN	f	They wouldn't?
FRANK	m	no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
GWEN	f	Kind of.
FRANK	m	I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up  there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are:  Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit.  So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's  what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not  even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and  saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen  to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
JIMMY GATOR	m	End of Round One! Excellent work ladies  and germs, let's see the scores on the boards: Kids up a leg with 2025, Adults down a bit with 1200.  We'll be back for Round Two and a Ring-Dang-Do --
JIMMY GATOR	m	HELLO! Musical Bonus Question before we go to break and the lucky team is --
JIMMY GATOR	m	Kids in the lead and they get a chance  to pull further and farther ahead -- with the following secret bonus musical question: I will read you a line from an opera and you are to give me the same line in the language in which the opera  was originaly written and for a bonus 25 you can sing it.  Here's the line:
STANELY	m	Well that was..uh..in French...and that was in the opera, "Carmen." And that goes...um...
JIM KURRING	m	got some coffee brewing, huh?
CLAUDIA	f	Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
JIM KURRING	m	I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
CLAUDIA	f	-- do you wanna cup?
JIM KURRING	m	That's great, thank you.
CLAUDIA	f	I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
JIM KURRING	m	Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
CLAUDIA	f	You take cream or sugar?
JIM KURRING	m	That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our  coffee (I never like to talk shop over coffee) I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here --  but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that  work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to  your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin'  to your music and that's fine, you're just  gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that --  If it's the middle of the day -- that's  what I do -- just put it on two and a half  and that's a good listening level, alright?  I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
CLAUDIA	f	Yeah.
JIM KURRING	m	Arlight, then.  Cheers.
JIM KURRING	m	Is this boyfriend bothering you?
CLAUDIA	f	I don't have a boyfriend.
JIM KURRING	m	The gentleman who came to the door --
CLAUDIA	f	-- is not my boyfriend.
JIM KURRING	m	Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen:  Young woman afraid to speak, next thing  you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio,  I got a 422 --
CLAUDIA	f	It's not -- what's a 422?
JIM KURRING	m	It's where situations like these  lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there  are certain measures you can take --
CLAUDIA	f	It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
JIM KURRING	m	I don't wanna have to come back here  in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
CLAUDIA	f	You won't.  You won't have to.
JIM KURRING	m	But I wouldn't mind comin' back in  an hour just to see your pretty face!
CLAUDIA	f	I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
JIM KURRING	m	Okey-doke.
JIMMY	m	I can't fuckin' do this.
MARY	f	Are you alright?
JIMMY	m	Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think. I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
CYNTHIA	f	Stanley, what's the problem?
STANLEY	m	I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
CYNTHIA	f	Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't  go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
STANLEY	m	I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna --
RICHARD	m	Why does this kinda shit always happen, Stanley?
LUIS	m	What's the problem over there?
RICHARD	m	Mind yer bussiness --
MIM	f	Watch your mouth, little man.
JULIA	f	Why don't you mind your own bussiness?
CYNTHIA	f	Alright, stop it, cool down, cool it. Please. Now: Stanley, you wait until the next commercial break and you can go then -- Just Hold It. Don't taunt the kids --
LUIS	m	I just asked what was going on --
CYNTHIA	f	Don't start trouble, Luis.
OC VOICE	f	Two minutes, everyone, we're back in two!
LINDA	f	I'm Linda Partridge to see Alan Kligman.
JANET	f	"Seduce and Destroy," thisz Janet.
CHAD	m	Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
JANET	f	What's wrong?
CHAD	m	Nothing's wrong, I just got some  guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
JANET	f	-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
EARL	m	LILY.  FUCK. LIL, PLEASE. LILY.
JANET	f	...mmm.hmmm.  mmm..hmm.  Alright. Put him through and lemme see what's goin' on --
CHAD	m	Phil, you there?
PHIL	m	Yeah, hey. Chad.
CHAD	m	Alright, so I'm gonna transfer  you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
PHIL	m	Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
CHAD	m	Thank you.  Thank you very much.
JANET	f	Hello?
CHAD	m	Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
JANET	f	Hello, Phil.
PHIL	m	Hi, hi, thank you for taking my call --
JIMMY GATOR	m	I have Cancer, Mary.
JIMMY GATOR	m	I have about two months, I have no time.  It's in my bones and I don't have a chance. And I'm fucked.  I had a stroke last week --
MARY	f	...Jimmy...
FLOQR DIRECTOR	m	Ten Seconds.
DONNIE	m	....do you know who I am?
THURSTON	m	You're a friend of the family I presume?
DONNIE	m	What?  What does that mean?
THURSTON	m	Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
DONNIE	m	You talk in rhymes and riddles and  ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used  to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
THURSTON	m	Might of been before my time.
PATRON #1	m	I remember you.  I remember. In the 60's right?
DONNIE	m	I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.
THURSTON	m	...like you said...
PATRON #1	m	Smart Kid!  Fuck, yeah, he-he.  You got hit by lightning that one time, right?
DONNIE	m	So what?
PATRON #1	m	I heard about that.
PATRON #2	m	Did it hurt?
DONNIE	m	Yes.
THURSTON	m	But you're alright now, so what's the what?
DONNIE	m	What?
THURSTON	m	That's right.
DONNIE	m	I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
THURSTON	m	Brad, dear?
THURSTON	m	Who was it that said: "A man of genius  has seldom been ruined but by himself."
DONNIE	m	-- Samuel Johnson.
BRAD	m	I don't know.
THURSTON	m	It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who  also spoke of a fella "Who was not only  dull but a cause of dullness in others."
DONNIE	m	"The" cause of dullness in others --
THURSTON	m	Picky, picky.
DONNIE	m	-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents?  His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and  have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an  electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and  his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
PATRON #1	m	You're parents took your money you won on that game show?
DONNIE	m	Yes they did.  What does that mean, "spoke in the wheel?"
THURSTON	m	Things go round 'n round, don't they?
DONNIE	m	Yes they do, they do, but I'll make  my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
THURSTON	m	This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
DONNIE	m	I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
THURSTON	m	Shall we drink to that?
DONNIE	m	"If a brick weighs one pound plus one  half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick  equals two pounds --" "A little more than  kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius.  "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus  20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
THURSTON	m	"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
JIMMY GATOR	m	KIDS!  Are you guys glued to those  seats or what?  Are you ever leaving? You're getting close to the record,  do you get more nervous as we go along?
RICHARD	m	A little --
JULIA	f	-- yeah....
JIMMY GATOR	m	-- kids at school must be real excited for you, eh?
JULIA	f	Oh, yeah...yeah...
RICHARD	m	Sure.
JIMMY GATOR	m	Stanley the Man! How are you?
STANLEY	m	I'm fine. Yes.
JIMMY GATOR	m	You're fast becoming a celebrity.  How are you handling it all?
STANLEY	m	Ohh, it's all fine. It's all. Nice. I'd just like to keep going....keep getting on....
JIMMY GATOR	m	Sure, sure...that's fine, then...there...with.....
JIMMY GATOR	m	Well you've got..many..things, many things happening and on the way....
JIMMY	m	What were you saying, Stanley?
STANLEY	m	I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
JIMMY	m	OK, OK, here we go: Steeper questions,  bigger payoff, individual challenges with  musical and audio pockets, no-steal-lock-out's, let's get it on in Round Two, Categories are:
FRANK	m	-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M  saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm  talking about eliminating
GWENOVIER	?	Let's talk about --
FRANK	m	I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
GWENOVIER	?	It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
FRANK	m	I warned you -- I get on a roll...
GWENOVIER	?	-- let's talk more about your background --
FRANK	m	Muffy -- coffee?
GWENOVIER	?	I'm confused about your past is the thing.
FRANK	m	Is that still lingering?
GWENOVIER	?	-- just to clarify --
FRANK	m	So boring, so useless --
GWENOVIER	?	I would just want to clear some things up:
FRANK	m	Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way  in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
GWENOVIER	?	This isn't meant --
FRANK	m	-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
GWENOVIER	?	Are you asking me that?
FRANK	m	Yes.
GWENOVIER	?	Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
FRANK	m	In aid of what?
GWENOVIER	?	I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
FRANK	m	-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself
GWENOVIER	?	It's all important --
FRANK	m	Not really.
GWENOVIER	?	It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
FRANK	m	This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna  be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world  is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
GWENOVIER	?	We talked earlier about your mother.  And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and  I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
FRANK	m	I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
GWENOVIER	?	Do you remember a Miss Simms?
FRANK	m	I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
GWENOVIER	?	She does.  From when you were a boy.
FRANK	m	Mm. Hm.
GWENOVIER	?	She lived in Tarzana.
FRANK	m	An old stomping ground --is this  the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner  or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
GWENOVIER	?	No, this is about getting something  right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
FRANK	m	Go ahead and waste your time.
GWENOVIER	?	I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
FRANK	m	And that's what you've heard?
GWENOVIER	?	I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
GWENOVIER	?	In my research I have you listed as  the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge. And what I learned from Mrs. Simms is that your mother passed away in 1980.  See:  It's my understanding that the information supplied by you and your company and answers  to question's I've asked are incorrect, Frank. And if I'd like to get to the bottom of who you are and why you are then I think your family  history -- you're accurate family history...well: this seems important...Frank...?
FRANK	m	Are you asking me a question?
GWEN	f	Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
JIMMY	m	Kids, Adults, I'd like you to put yourself at a picnic.  Place yourself there with your family and friends if you'd like -- you'll hear three musical notes and you are to tell me what it might represent that you'd find at a picnic -- The First Three Notes:
TODD	m	Well, Jimmy, I know this, I have perfect pitch, you see -- and that would be A-D-E. And that would represent lemonade.
JIMMY	m	For 250.  Next notes, please: Got it.  That's E-G-G which would be ~egg."
JIMMY	m	For 500 and the Third Set Of Notes: B-E-E -- and don't get stung.
KLIGMAN	?	You don't want any water?
LINDA	f	No...I just...(starts crying a bit) I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't  know...there's so much...so many things --
KLIGMAN	?	Are you on drugs right now?
LINDA	f	If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell  you things...then you're a lawyer, right?  You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right?  Attornery-client, you understand?
KLIGMAN	?	Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
LINDA	f	Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say  things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
KLIGMAN	?	Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave  this room, you have something you have to say --
LINDA	f	-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something.  I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
KLIGMAN	?	You can't change his will.  Only  Earl can change his will.
LINDA	f	No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never  told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II  get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love  with him now, for real, as he's dying,  and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
JIMMY	m	Let's listen:
VOICE	m	"Hello, Mary.  How are you and the  seven kids?  As you probably heard by  know, we sure gave that Pope a run for his money --"
MIM	f	Well: That would be General Robert  E. Lee.  His wife Mary Park Custiss.  And he did have seven children and he  would be talking about Pope, who he defeated at the Battle of Monasses --
RICK	m	C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, snap out of it.
JIMMY	m	Mim --
MIM	f	Well that would be Napoleon speaking to Josephine.
JIMMY	m	That's right!
LINDA	f	I don't want him to die, I didn't love him  when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want  to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
KLIGMAN	?	What kind of medication are  you on right now, Linda that's --
LINDA	f	This is not any fucking medication  talking, this isn't -- I don't know.  I don't know -- Can you give me nothing?  You have power of attorney, can you see him,  can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking  will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things --  I fucked around.  I fucked around on him,  I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked  other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck -  Other Things I've Done..
KLIGMAN	?	Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
LINDA	f	I can't.
KLIGMAN	?	You don't have to change the will,  if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
LINDA	f	Where will the money go?
KLIGMAN	?	Well.  Considering that there's no one  else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy,  which is -- as if someone died without a will --
LINDA	f	What does that mean?
KLIGMAN	?	The money would go to Frank.  The court  would put the money in the hands of a relative --
LINDA	f	-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
KLIGMAN	?	-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted  as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
LINDA	f	This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
KLIGMAN	?	Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
LINDA	f	Shut the fuck up.
KLIGMAN	?	I'm trying to help, Linda --
LINDA	f	Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
KLIGMAN	?	You need to sober up.
LINDA	f	Now you must really shut the fuck up, please.  Shut The Fuck Up.
KLIGMAN	?	Linda --
LINDA	f	I have to go.
KLIGMAN	?	Let me call you a car, Linda.
LINDA	f	Shut the fuck up.

GWENOVIER 	?	Frank...Frank...what are we gonna do here? Are we having a staring contest? Do you have anything to say?
CAPTAIN MUFFY 	m	I think maybe we should rap this up, Chief --
GWENOVIER 	?	I'm not trying to attack you, Frank. I think that if you have something that needs to be cleared up...Well, then... I was told that your father, (your father is Earl Partridge,) that he left you and  your mother and you were forced to take care of her during her illness...that you took  care of your mother as she struggled with Cancer.... And Miss Simms became your caretaker after your mother died...Frank...Frank... Frank, can you talk about your Mother?  Frank....can you?
CLAUDIA	f	--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear.  It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
JIM KURRING	m	What's that stand for?
CLAUDIA	f	Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just  very tight, like - it's like a muscle  spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
JIM KURRING	m	This is my job.

CLAUDIA	f	I'm sorry.

JIM KURRING	m	Bye, bye, Claudia.
CLAUDIA	f	Good bye.
JIM KURRING	m	I'm sorry, Claudia.
CLAUDIA	f	What is it?  Did you forget something?
JIM KURRING	m	No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man.  I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here  as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want  to do which is to ask you on a date.
CLAUDIA	f	You wanna go on a date with me?
JIM KURRING	m	Please, yes.
CLAUDIA	f	Well...is that illegal?
JIM KURRING	m	No.
CLAUDIA	f	Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
JIM KURRING	m	I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not  true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
CLAUDIA	f	Really?
JIM KURRING	m	Yeah.
CLAUDIA	f	I thought you were flirting with me a little.
CLAUDIA	f	Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?

CLAUDIA	f	Eight o'clock?
JIM KURRING	m	What about ten o'clock, is that  too late?  I don't get off and then --
CLAUDIA	f	Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners  are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
JIM KURRING	m	No, no, just casual maybe, maybe  I thought -- there's a spot I like to go,  it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
CLAUDIA	f	Billingsley's?
JIM KURRING	m	Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
CLAUDIA	f	It's my favorite place --

PHIL	m	Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
FRANK	m	...are you Phil...?
PHIL	m	Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
FRANK	m	I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
PHIL	m	Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through  the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
FRANK	m	Is Linda here?
PHIL	m	She's not here, she went out.  I'm sorry.  This is all just so,  I don't know what, what to do -- your  Dad asked me to try and track you down.  To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
FRANK	m	Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
PHIL	m	These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
PHIL	m	He's in here.
FRANK	m	Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
PHIL	m	Ok.
FRANK	m	How long have you taken care of him?
PHIL	m	For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
FRANK	m	Uh-huh.  What's going on?
PHIL	m	He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen  this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
FRANK	m	Is he in pain?
PHIL	m	I just...he was...but I gave him,  I just had to give him a small dose of  liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now,  I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
FRANK	m	...uh-huh...
FRANK	m	How long...you think?
PHIL	m	Um...soon tonight...I think, yes?  Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
FRANK	m	When did he go off chemo?
PHIL	m	About three weeks ago.
FRANK	m	.....have you ever seen this..I mean,  never mind, you said --
PHIL	m	I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
FRANK	m	Uh. huh.
PHIL	m	I'm really sorry.
FRANK	m	He's in here --?
PHIL	m	Yeah.
FRANK	m	No, let's just wait one minute, let's just stand here one minute or so --
PHIL	m	I've heard your tapes on the phone.
FRANK	m	Oh yeah.
PHIL	m	When they put me on hold, to  talk to you...they play the tapes.  I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
FRANK	m	Uh. huh.
PHIL	m	It's interesting.
FRANK	m	Mmm.
DIXON	m	Lady...hey Lady...Lady....you ok? you alive...huh...hey?
DIXON	m	Lady.  Lady. Hey wake up.  Lady?
DIXON	m	Hello?  Hello?  I have an emergency situation -- this lady -- this lady seems like she's dead -- hello?  She's in the parking lot -- (etc. gives information regarding location. etc.)
JIMMY	m	I don't think I want that.
ROSE	f	It'll take the pain away.
JIMMY	m	It's not really pain.
JIMMY	m	I gotta ask you for a cigarette, 'cause I don't wanna spend six hours tryin' to get it to my mouth --
JIMMY	m	How do we do this, then?
ROSE	f	We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
JIMMY	m	Do you love me, Rose?
ROSE	f	You're my handsome man.
JIMMY	m	I'm a bad person.
ROSE	f	No.  No.
JIMMY	m	No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and  apologize for me....for all the stupid  things I've done....that will eat me up....
ROSE	f	You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on  your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
JIMMY	m	--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey.... ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
JIMMY	m	I've cheated on you and it kills me and the guilt of what I've done...I don't want you to think...maybe you knew, I think that maybe you've known... So I hope that I'm not saying this for  me...for me to make myself feel better about what I've done...but for making  you not feel like you're sitting there  like a jerk...you've been the good one...  You understand...I'm so sorry for all I've done wrong...and this is pathetic...what?  "Dying man, confess the sins" something? Is it selfish for me to say this?  To  say what I've done...I feel better already. I do...do you hate me?
ROSE	f	...No...I don't hate you. Do you want talk...do you really  want to talk to me and say things  and get things figured out, Jimmy?
JIMMY	m	Yeah.
ROSE	f	The question isn't wether or not  you cheated on me, the question is  how many times have you cheated on me?
JIMMY	m	Will that help?
ROSE	f	Yeah.
CLAUDIA	f	Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to  make yourself look cool or better  than you are or whatever, or smarter  or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
JIM KURRING	m	Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
CLAUDIA	f	So you've done it --
JIM KURRING	m	Well I don't go out very much.
CLAUDIA	f	Why not?
JIM KURRING	m	I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
CLAUDIA	f	And I bet you say that to all the girls --
JIM KURRING	m	No, no.
CLAUDIA	f	You wanna make a deal with me?
JIM KURRING	m	ok.
CLAUDIA	f	What I just said...y'know, people  afraid to say things....no guts to  say the things that they...that are real or something...
JIM KURRING	m	...yeah...
CLAUDIA	f	To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
JIM KURRING	m	Let's make a deal.
CLAUDIA	f	Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss  and shit and lies that kill other people....
JIM KURRING	m	Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
CLAUDIA	f	What?
JIM KURRING	m	You really use strong language.
CLAUDIA	f	I'm sorry --
JIM KURRING	m	-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
CLAUDIA	f	I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
JIM KURRING	m	It's fine.
CLAUDIA	f	I'm sorry.
JIM KURRING	m	...nothing.  I'm sorry...
CLAUDIA	f	No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
JIM KURRING	m	-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
CLAUDIA	f	I'm sorry.
CLAUDIA	f	I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
JIM KURRING	m	ok.
CLAUDIA	f	ok.
FRANK	m	So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say  something if he can...talk...I mean:
PHIL	m	...ok...
FRANK	m	Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
PHIL	m	yeah.
FRANK	m	...Dad...Dad...hey...Earl?
FRANK	m	...hey...Dad...Dad can you wake up a minute Dad?
FRANK	m	He's not waking up.
ROSE	f	How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
JIMMY	m	I don't even remember...many...twenty...  maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
ROSE	f	I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
JIMMY	m	I'll answer anything.
ROSE	f	Was there anyone that I know?
JIMMY	m	Yes.
ROSE	f	Who?
JIMMY	m	Rose, I don't --
ROSE	f	hey.
JIMMY	m	Paula.  Ellen.
JIMMY	m	That's it.
ROSE	f	No one else that I know?
JIMMY	m	No.
ROSE	f	How long with Ellen?
JIMMY	m	Just once.
ROSE	f	How long with Paula?
JIMMY	m	Two years...three years...
ROSE	f	What about now?
JIMMY	m	It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
ROSE	f	Is it over 'cause you're sick?
JIMMY	m	It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
ROSE	f	Do you have any children with anyone?
JIMMY	m	What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
ROSE	f	Well maybe.
JIMMY	m	I don't.
ROSE	f	Do you feel better now that you've said this?
JIMMY	m	I don't know....
ROSE	f	I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
JIMMY	m	I love you so much.
ROSE	f	I'm not through asking my questions.
ROSE	f	Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
JIMMY	m	Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
ROSE	f	I think that you know.
JIMMY	m	Maybe...I don't...
WORM	m	Hi.
STANLEY	m	Hi.
WORM	m	..sorry...
STANLEY	m	It's ok.
STANLEY	m	Are you alright?
CLAUDIA	f	I wanted to do that.
JIM KURRING	m	Well.
CLAUDIA	f	That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
JIM KURRING	m	Yeah.
CLAUDIA	f	Can I tell you something?
JIM KURRING	m	Yeah, of course.
CLAUDIA	f	I'm really nervous that you're  gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
JIM KURRING	m	-- no, like what, what do you mean?
CLAUDIA	f	You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and  you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
JIM KURRING	m	I lost my gun.
CLAUDIA	f	What?
JIM KURRING	m	I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot  of people.  I wanted to tell you that.  I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and  I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie  about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good  cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
CLAUDIA	f	Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
JIM KURRING	m	I'm sorry --
CLAUDIA	f	That was so great what you just said.
JIM KURRING	m	I haven't been on a date since I  was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think  might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener  to you if that's what you want...and  you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but  I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
CLAUDIA	f	You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
JIM KURRING	m	It's ok.
CLAUDIA	f	You don't know how crazy I am.
JIM KURRING	m	It's ok.
CLAUDIA	f	I've got troubles.
JIM KURRING	m	I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
CLAUDIA	f	Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
JIM KURRING	m	Say what you want and you'll see --
CLAUDIA	f	Wanna kiss me, Jim?
JIM KURRING	m	Yes I do.
WORM	m	Hi.
STANLEY	m	Hi.
WORM	m	..sorry...
STANLEY	m	It's ok.
STANLEY	m	Are you alright?
ROSE	f	...say it, Jimmy...
JIMMY	m	Do you know the answer to this?
ROSE	f	I'm asking you.  I'm asking you  if you know why Clauida will not  speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
JIMMY	m	I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
JIMMY	m	She thinks terrible things that  somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door,  "You touched me wrong..." "I know that."  Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
ROSE	f	Did you ever touch her?
JIMMY	m	...No....
ROSE	f	Jimmy, did you touch her?
JIMMY	m	I don't know.
ROSE	f	...Jimmy...
JIMMY	m	I really don't know.
ROSE	f	But you can't say....
ROSE	f	Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
JIMMY	m	...I don't know...
JIMMY	m	What...? ...no...no, please...
ROSE	f	You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
JIMMY	m	I don't know what I've done.
ROSE	f	Yes you do.
JIMMY	m	Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
ROSE	f	No.
JIMMY	m	I don't know what I've done.
ROSE	f	You should know better.
CLAUDIA	f	....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
JIM KURRING	m	What?
CLAUDIA	f	Just say no.
JIM KURRING	m	I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
CLAUDIA	f	Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
JIM KURRING	m	please, what is it, please --
CLAUDIA	f	just let me walk out, ok?
DONNIE	m	What am I doing?  What am I doing?  What the fuck am I doing?
DONNIE	m	WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING?
FRANK	m	Dad...dad it's me...it's Frank... It's Jack....It's Jack....Dad....
FRANK	m	I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?

WORM	m	....you have it...easy....you know?  You have a father who loves you, huh?
STANLEY	m	Yes.
WORM	m	You know what it's like to come home  scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to  go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me  with a belt, Stanley.... I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without  the money....
STANLEY	m	....Why does he do it...?
WORM	m	Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
STANLEY	m	It's not right.
WORM	m	I hate it.
WORM	m	I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
STANLEY	m	I have money.
WORM	m	...what...?
STANLEY	m	I have money to give you.
WORM	m	No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
STANLEY	m	I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't
WORM	m	Where do you have it?
DONNIE	m	Fuck.
PHIL	m	There are frogs falling from the sky.
ROSE	f	HONEY, HONEY, CLAUDIA. IT'S ME.
EARL	m	You are not what you think you are.
WORM	m	What is that?
STANLEY	m	It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
WORM	m	...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
STANLEY	m	It's raining frogs from the sky.

WORM	m	That idea is over now.  We're not gonna do that now.
DIXON	m	DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME.
WORM	m	I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad  at you and it's ok and please put it  down and I won't be mad and I won't --
DIXON	m	DAD.
DIXON	m	I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
WORM	m	It's ok, boy.
MUSIC/KERMIT THE FROG	m	"It's not that easy bein' green... Having to spend each day the color  of the leaves..."
DONNIE	m	My teeff...my teeef....
JIM KURRING	m	YOU'RE OK...you're gonna be ok....
NARRATOR	m	And there is the account of the hanging of three men....and a scuba diver and  a suicide.....
NARRATOR	m	There are stories of coincidence and chance and intersections and strange  things told and which is which and who only knows...
NARRATOR	m	...and we generally say, "Well if that was  in movie I wouldn't believe it."
DOCTOR	m	Are you with us?  Linda?  Is it Linda?
NARRATOR	m	Someone's so and so meet someone else's so and so and so on --
NARRATOR	m	And it is in the humble opinion of this narrator that these strange things  happen all the time....
STANLEY	m	Dad...Dad.
STANLEY	m	You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
RICK	m	Go to bed.
STANLEY	m	I think that you have to be nicer to me.
RICK	m	Go to bed.
NARRATOR	m	...and so it goes and so it goes and  the book says, "We may be through with the past, but the past is not through with us."
MARCIE	f	I killed him.  I killed my husband.  He hit my son and he hit my grandson and I hit him.  I hit him with the ashtray and he was knocked out and I killed him, I strangled him.  I strangled my husband  to protect my boys.  I protected my boys.
DONNIE	m	I know that I did a thtupid thing. Tho-thtupid...getting brathes...I thought... I thought that he would love me. ...getting brathes, for what...  for thumthing I didn't even...i don't know where to put things, y'know?
DONNIE	m	I really do hath love to give, I juth don't know where to put it --
JIM KURRING	m	...these security systems can be a real joke. I mean, a frog falls from the sky and lands  on the x-4 box 'round back and opens all the doors? Triggers a siutation?  You don't know who could be driving by at any moment, walk in and rob the place -- I was you I'd talk to your boss about a new security system --
DONNIE	m	....ohh-thur-I-thur-thill....
JIM KURRING	m	You guys make alotta money, huh?
JIM KURRING	m	I got a buddy a mine down at the  med. center, he'd probably do quite a deal on a set of dentures, you're  interested in that.  He's in training, you know he's not a dentist yet, but he's real good at corrective oral surgery from what I understand...
JIM KURRING	m	...alot of people think this is just a job that you go to.....take a lunch  hour, the jobs over, something like that. But...it's a 24 hour deal...no two ways about it....and what most people don't  see:  Just How Hard It Is To Do The Right Thing. People think if I make a judgment call that it's a judgment on them...but  that's not what I do and that's not  what should be done...I have to take everything and play it as it lays.  Sometimes people need a little help. Sometimes people need to be forgiven  and sometimes they need to go to jail. And that's a very tricky thing on my  part...making that call...the law is the law and heck if I'm gonna break it...but  you can forgive someone....?  Well, that's the tough part....What Do We Forgive?  Tough part of the job.....tough part of walking down the street...
