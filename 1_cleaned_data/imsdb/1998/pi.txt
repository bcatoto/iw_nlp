MAX	m	Monday, September first.  Six-fifteen.
MAX	m	The alchemist awakes.  "Turn lead into gold, Max,  lead into gold." Today, I find it.
MAX	m	Heat's been getting  to Euclid. Feel it most in  the afternoon when I run the  set. Have to keep the fans on  all night from now on.  Otherwise, everything is  running topnotch. The stack  of 286's is now faster than  Columbia's computer science  department. I spent a couple  hundred dollars. Columbia's  cost? Half a million?  Ha...
JENNA 	f	Max, Max! Can we do one?
MOM 	f	Jenna! Jenna!
MAX 	m	Oh, no.
JENNA 	f	What's three hundred  and twenty-two times four  hundred and ninety-one.
MAX 	m	One hundred fifty-eight thousand,  a hundred two. Right?
JENNA 	f	Right.
MOM 	f	Jenna...
JENNA 	f	Okay, seventy-three  divided by twenty-two.
MAX 	m	Three point three one eight one  eight one eight...
MAX	m	Somewhere in there.  Somewhere. I know it's right  in front of me. The pattern.  They say it's chaos, it can't  be understood, too much  complexity.
MAX	m	History it's there.  Lurking, shaping.  structuring, hiding, right  beneath the surface.
MAX	m	The cycling of disease epidemics,  the wax and wane of Caribou populations  in the Arctic, sunspot cycles,  the rise and fall of the  Nile and yes! the New York Stock  Exchange, they are all the  same.
MAX	m	I'll find this structure,  this order, this perfection.
MAX	m	Turn lead into gold.  The first. Right here. Right  here. With math. The numbers  of the stock market are my  lead. When I find the  pattern, then I will find  gold.
MAX 	m	Hello?
WOMAN'S VOICE 	f	Maximilian Cohen, please.
MAX 	m	Yeah?
WOMAN'S VOICE 	f	Mr. Cohen?
MAX 	m	Who's this?
WOMAN'S VOICE 	f	Hi. my name is Marcy Dawson.  I'm a partner with the predictive  strategy firm Lancet-Percy. Can I  speak with Mr. Cohen, please?
MAX 	m	I told you...
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Mr. Cohen! How  are you? It's been a long  time. Sorry I haven't been in  touch. But I was hoping you  would allow me to take you to  lunch tomorrow, say one  o'clock?
MAX 	m	Sorry, I can't.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	We're very anxious to talk  with you, sir
MAX 	m	I can't.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	I'm prepared to  make you a generous...
MAX 	m	I don't take offers for  my research. You know that.  Sorry, I Couldn't help you.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Mr. Cohen, give  me a moment...
DEVI 	f	Max, good!
MAX 	m	Hi, Devi.
DEV1 	?	I grabbed you some  somosas.
MAX 	m	Great.
DEVI 	f	Your hair.
MAX 	m	What are you doing?
DEVI 	f	Your hair, you can't go  out like that. Don't worry.
MAX 	m	It's fine. It's fine.
DEVI 	f	You need a mom.
MAX 	m	I have to go.
DEVI 	f	Your somosas!
MAX 	m	Thanks.
MAX	m	Sixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid  shows tomorrow's Dow closing  up by four points. Anomalies  include PRONET at sixty-fire  and a quarter, a career high.  Possible explanations, either  A, an error in the June fifth  algorithm, or B, Euclid's  main processor is running a  recursion...
VOICE FROM OFFSCREEN 	m	Oh sorry, am I bothering you?
LENNY MEYER 	m	I'll put it out.  The name's Lenny Meyer
LENNY MEYER 	m	And you are?
MAX 	m	Max.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Max?
MAX 	m	Max Cohen.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Cohen!  Jewish?
LENNY MEYER 	m	It's okay.
MAX 	m	No, I'm not interested  in religion.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Have you ever  heard of Kabbalah?
MAX 	m	No.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Jewish mysticism.
MAX 	m	I'm sorry, I'm very busy.
LENNY MEYER 	m	I understand...it's just that  it's a very exciting time in  our history. Right now is a  critical moment in time.
MAX 	m	Really?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Yes, it's very exciting.  Have you ever put on Tefillin?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Tefillin. You know Tefillin.  I know it looks strange.  But it's an amazing  tradition that has a  tremendous amount of power.  It's a mitzvah for all  Jewish men to do. Mitzvahs,  good deeds, are spiritual  food for our hearts and our  heads.
LENNY MEYER 	m	They purify us and bring us  closer to God. You want to try it?
MAX 	m	I gotta go...
LENNY MEYER 	m	Are you okay? Max? Max?
MAX 	m	I'm sorry, bye.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Well, maybe some other time.
MAX 	m	Please God, Let it be a  small one.
MAX	m	Sixteen thirty-five.  Second headache in under  twenty-four hours. They're  getting more frequent  now...more painful, too. Drugs  don't work, just take the  edge off of it. Just gotta  wait for the nosebleed.  Relief comes from my nose.
FARROUHK	?	So I gotta make this drop off  in Harlem and on the way down  there's these three kids  hailing me.
DEVI	f	You stopped?
FARROUHK	?	I was tight, so...
MAX 	m	Ahh...
MAX 	m	Leave me alone.
FARROUHK	?	So I drop them off in the  Village and they dart.
DEVI	f	Oh God...
FARROUHK	?	I get out, grab my bat and  start running. One of the kids,  maybe sixteen, I catch a block  later he's cursing at me, calling  me a Paki bastard. So I whacked him,  right in the head.
DEVI	f	Farrouhk!
FARROUHK	?	I'm kicking the bastard in the  ribs banging his ass, knocking his  head against the curb, harder  and harder, I fucking lost  it. A hot dog guy starts  screaming "You're cracking his  skull, you're cracking his  skull." So they pulled me off  of him and calmed me down.  Cops said he had it coming to  him.
MAX 	m	No! No!
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Mr. Cohen. Marcy  Dawson here again I was just  looking over my schedule and  I realized I'll be in your  neighborhood tomorrow around  three.
MAX 	m	Who is...
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Marcy Dawson from  Lancet-Percy I'm so anxious  to meet you. It will be worth  it�for both of us I promise.  See you at your house at  three, okay?
MAX 	m	My house...how do...
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Oh, don't worry,  I got your address from  Columbia. So three it is.  Looking forward to it.
MAX 	m	Damn.
S0L 	?	Max! How are you7
SOL 	f	Stop thinking, Max, just  feel. Use your intuition.  It's the only way to get into  the flow.  What did you think of Hamlet?
MAX 	m	I didn't get to it.
SOL 	f	It's been a month.  You haven't taken  a single break.
MAX 	m	I'm so close, Sol. I'm  so close but I just can't  grab it.
SOL 	f	Have you met the new  fish my niece bought me? I  named her Icarus. After you.  My renegade pupil. You fly  too high, you'll get burned.
SOL 	f	The more I see you, the  more I see myself thirty  years ago. My greatest pupil.  Published at 16, Ph.D. at 20.
MAX 	m	We'll see.
SOL 	f	But life isn't just  mathematics. I spent forty  years looking for patterns in  Pi, I found nothing.
MAX 	m	You found things...
SOL 	f	I found things, but not a  pattern.
MAX	m	Tuesday, September  second, eighteen twelve. If  Sol hadn't gotten sick who  knows where math would be. He  spent years in the numbers of  Pi. Searching for meaning, for  order.
MAX	m	Three point one  four...off into infinity  and maybe insanity. Somewhere  in there he wanted sanity.  Sanity like he found in the  circles Pi represented.  Simple, sane circles. If only  the stock market had circles.  Some type of sanity. Some  type of form, of shape.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Hey, Max, how you doing?
MAX 	m	Oh, okay.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Lenny Meyer.  I'll put it out.  So, what do you do?
MAX 	m	Um, I work with computers  ...math.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Really? What type of math?
MAX 	m	Number theory. Mostly  research.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Number theory? No  way, I work in theory, too.  Not traditional, though... I work with the Torah.  Amazing.
MAX 	m	Yeah...
LENNY MEYER	m	Yeah. You know Hebrew is  all numbers. It's all math.
MAX 	m	Hm.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Here, look...the ancient  Jews used Hebrew as their  numerical system. Each  letter is a number.
LENNY MEYER	m	You see...The Hebrew "A," the  number 1. The Hebrew "B,"  Bet, is two. You can take any  Hebrew text and turn them into  a long string of numbers.
LENNY MEYER	m	The Torah is just  a long string of numbers.  Some say that it's a long  code sent to us from God.
MAX 	m	Kind of interesting.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Yeah, like take the  Hebrew word for, say, the  Garden of Eden, Kadem. Kuf,  Dalei Mem...Kuf is a  hundred. Daled, four Mem,  forty. They equal one hundred  and forty-four. Then take the  tree of knowledge...in  the garden, Aat Ha Haim, it  equals two hundred and  thirty-three. Now you can take  that number and...
MAX 	m	They're Fibonacci numbers.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Huh?
MAX 	m	The Fibonacci sequence.  Italian mathematician, thirteenth century. If you divide  a hundred and forty-four into  two hundred and thirty-three,  it approaches theta.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Theta?
MAX 	m	The Greek symbol for the  golden ratio. The golden  spiral.
LENNY MEYER 	m	You're right, I never saw  that before. That's the series  you find in nature. Like the  face of a sunflower.
MAX 	m	Wherever there's spirals.
LENNY MEYER 	m	You see, there's math everywhere.
MAX 	m	Math everywhere...
MAX 	m	Everywhere...
MAX 	m	Oh my God...
MAX	m	Simple shapes!  Tuesday, September second.  Twenty-twenty-two. Sol! Sol!  Sol! Shapes in the market.  Why not? And they're spirals!  Spirals!
MAX	m	A circle spread out overtime.  It's open-ended. It has a  beginning and it grows and  changes through time. If I  can find where it fits, if I  can spin it and lock it into  a group of numbers, then I  can calculate the future.  Lead into gold. Chaos into  order Madness into sanity. Pain  into bliss. Perfection.
MAX 	m	What the...
MAX 	m	Shit!
MAX 	m	What the...
MAX	m	Wednesday, September third,  seven-fifteen. Results: AAR  at fourteen and a half�low,  very low. ABR at six and a  half�jeez. Six and a half, ABR  hasn't been beneath twenty in  ten years. Conclusion:  Simple. There is no pattern.  No pattern. Chaos, chaos, all  chaos.
MAX 	m	Euclid crashed. I lost  all my data, my hardware.
SOL 	f	Your mainframe?
MAX 	m	Burnt...
SOL 	f	What happened?
MAX 	m	I don't know, first I got  these horrible picks. Then  Euclid spits out some  numbers. Never saw anything  like it and then it fries.  The whole machine just  crashed.
SOL 	f	You have a printout?
MAX 	m	Of?
SOL 	f	The picks, the number?
MAX 	m	I threw it out.
SOL 	f	What was the number it  spit out?
MAX 	m	I don't know, just a long  string of digits.
SOL 	f	How many?
MAX 	m	I don't know.
SOL 	f	What was it, a  hundred and fifty, a  thousand, two hundred  sixteen!? How many?
MAX 	m	I don't know. Probably  around two hundred.  Why?
SOL 	f	I dealt with  some bugs back in my Pi days.  I was wondering if it was  similar to one I ran into.
SOL 	f	Have you met Archimedes.  The one with the black spot.  You see?
MAX 	m	Yeah.
SOL 	f	Remember Archimedes of  Syracuse? The King asks  Archimedes to determine if a  present he's received was  actually solid gold. Unsolved  problem at the time. It  tortures the great Greek  mathematician for weeks.  Insomnia haunts him and he  twists and turns on his bed  for nights on end. Finally,  his equally exhausted wife,  she's forced to share a bed  with this genius, convinces  him to take a bath, to relax.  While stepping into the tub  he observes the bathwater  rise as he enters. Displacement.  A way to determine volume.  And thus, a way to  determine density, weight  over volume. And thus,  Archimedes solves the  problem. He screams  "Eureka!"�Greek for "I found  it!"�and is so overwhelmed he  runs dripping naked through  the streets to the King's  castle to report his  discovery. Now, what's the  moral of the story.
MAX 	m	That a breakthrough will  come...
SOL 	f	Wrong. The point of the  story is the wife. Listen to  your wife, she will give you  perspective. Meaning, you  need a break, Max, you have  to take a bath, otherwise  you'll get nowhere. There will  be no order, only chaos.  Go home and take a bath.
MAX 	m	Hey, excuse me, can I see  that?
MAX 	m	Six and a half.
MAX 	m	My God. My God.  Yes! Yes!
SKINNY MAN	m	Hey, paper, please!
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Mr. Cohen! Perfect timing.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	I was just waiting for you.  I thought you stood me up,  so I was going to head home.
MAX 	m	Who are you?
MARCY DAWSON	f	Oh...Marcy Dawson. From  Lancet Percy. We were  supposed to meet at three.
MAX 	m	I'm sorry, I don't...
MARCY DAWSON 	f	I can't tell you what a  pleasure it is to finally  meet you. I've studied  your papers for years.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	I have something  you won't be able to say no  to. Why don't we take a spin  in the limo?
MAX 	m	No, no, no, really, I  can't.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	We're excited by your work.  We can't wait to discuss...
MAX 	m	On the nose. On the damn nose.
DEVI	f	Farrouhk?
MAX 	m	Um, no, it's Max from next door.
DEVI 	f	Max, is everything all  right?
MAX 	m	Do you have any iodine?
DEVI 	f	Iodine...did you cut  yourself?
MAX 	m	No. I just need it to stain a  slide.
DEVI 	f	Ah, science, the pursuit  of knowledge. One second.
DEVI	f	Here we are. What are you  examining� a potato!?
MAX 	m	Just something with my  computer.
DEVI 	f	The neighbor's up  to his old science...
FARROUHK	?	What neighbor?
DEVI	f	Next door.
FARROUHK	?	Why are you talking to that dork!
DEVI	f	Shh! I just helped ...
FARROUHK	?	Pounds on wall. Hey, dork, leave my girlfriend alone!
DEVI 	f	Farrouhk!
FARROUHK	?	I don't give a shit.
DEVI 	f	Shh! C'mon, Farrouhk.
FARROUHK 	?	I'll kill the dork.  You hear me! I'll kill you.  I'll fucking kill you!
DEVI 	f	Shh! Baby! Come here, baby!
MAX 	m	I just threw out something.  I didn't realize I needed it.
MRS. OVADIA 	f	Humph.
MAX 	m	Just a printout. I, uh,  lost my data...
LENNY MEYER 	m	Max! How you doing? Lenny  Meyer.
MAX 	m	Oh, hey...
LENNY MEYER 	m	Hey, where you going? You  got a few moments to do Tefillin?
LENNY MEYER 	m	I gotta car, we can cruise  over to my...
MAX 	m	You gotta car?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Yeah, right there. That's  Ephraim, my friend.
MAX 	m	All tight, lets go.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Great...
MAX 	m	Lenny, I don't really  want to do...
LENNY MEYER 	m	Do it for me? It  means a lot, having someone  of your stature performing a  mitzvah in my presence.  When you told me your name was Max Cohen, I didn't realize you  were the Max Cohen. Maximilian Cohen.
MAX	m	You know me?
LENNY MEYER 	m	0f course, I've  followed your research since  your Columbia days. It's  revolutionary. You've inspired  the work we do.
MAX 	m	I have?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Yes, very much  so. The only difference is,  we're not looking at stocks.  We're searching for a pattern  in Torah.
MAX 	m	What kind of pattern?
LENNY MEYER 	m	We're not really  sure. Our calculations have  shown us that there is a  number encoded in the text.
MAX 	m	What sort of number?
LENNY MEYER 	m	We don't know.  All we know is that it's two hundred and sixteen digits long.
LENNY MEYER	m	Don't worry. This one just  goes over your head.
MAX 	m	Two sixteen?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Yes. Now we have to say a  small prayer, repeat  after me.
LENNY MEYER 	m	That's it. Wasn't  so bad, was it? You feel  anything?
MAX 	m	What is it?
LENNY MEYER 	m	It's a prayer about our  dedication to our one and  only God.
MAX 	m	No, I mean the number, the  two sixteen number? What is  it?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Oh. We don't know. We just  know that it's the most  common number encoded in  the text. It might be some  type of linguistic pattern.  If we could figure out what  the number is we could maybe  answer that.
MAX 	m	Tell me more.
SOL 	f	Max?
MAX 	m	What's going on, Sol!?
SOL 	f	Relax, it's early.
SOL 	f	Now, what's up?
MAX 	m	What's the two hundred  and sixteen number, Sol?
SOL 	f	Excuse me?
MAX 	m	You asked me if I had  seen a two hundred and  sixteen digit number, right?
SOL 	f	Oh, you mean the bug. I  found it working on Pi.
MAX 	m	What do you mean by "found it"?
SOL 	f	What's this all about,  Max?
MAX 	m	Well, there's these  religious Jews who have...
SOL 	f	Religious Jews?
MAX 	m	Well, you know,  Hassidim. I met one in the  coffee shop. The guy's a  number theorist. The Torah is  their data set. The thing is,  they're searching for a two  hundred and sixteen digit  number in the Torah.
SOL 	f	Really? What's it mean to  them?
MAX 	m	They say they don't  know, but that's crazy. I  mean what are the odds...
SOL 	f	It's just a coincidence.
MAX 	m	But hold on, there's  something else. You remember  those strange picks I got.
SOL 	f	Yesterday's stock picks?
MAX 	m	Right. Well, it turns out  that they were correct. I hit  two picks on the nose. Smack  on the nose.
SOL 	f	Hmmm.
MAX 	m	Something's going on, and  it has to do with that  number. The answer is there.
SOL 	f	Max, it's a bug.
MAX 	m	No. it's a pattern. A  pattern is in that number
SOL 	f	Come with me.
SOL 	f	Listen to me. The Ancient  Japanese considered the Go  board to be a microcosm of  the universe. Although when  it is empty it appears to be  simple and ordered, in fact,  the possibilities of game play  are endless. They say that no  two Go games have ever been  alike. Just like snowflakes.  So, the Go board actually  represents an extremely complex  and chaotic universe. That is  the truth of our world, Max.  It can't be easily summed up  with math. There is no simple  pattern.
MAX 	m	But as a Go game  progresses, the possibilities  become smaller and smaller.  The board does take on order.  Soon, all moves are  predictable.
SOL	f	So?
MAX	m	So, maybe, even though we're not  sophisticated enough to be aware  of it, there is an underlying  order...a pattern, beneath every  Go game. Maybe that pattern is  like the pattern in the market,  in the Torah. The two sixteen  number.
SOL 	f	That is insanity, Max.
MAX 	m	Or maybe it's genius. I  have to get that number.
SOL 	f	Hold on, you have to slow  down. You're losing it, you have to take a breath. Listen  to yourself. You're connecting  a computer bug I had, a  computer bug you might have  had, and some religious  hogwash. If you want to find  the number two sixteen in the  world, you'll be able to pull  it out of anywhere. Two  hundred and sixteen steps  from your street comer to  your front door. Two hundred  and sixteen seconds you spend  riding on the elevator. When  your mind becomes obsessed  with anything, it will filter  everything else out and find  examples of that thing  everywhere. Three hundred and  twenty, four hundred and  fifty, twenty-three.  Whatever! You've chosen two  sixteen and you'll find it  everywhere in nature. But  Max, as soon as you discard  scientific rigor, you are no  longer a mathematician. You  become a numerologist. What  you need to do is take a  break from your research. You  need it. You deserve it  Here's a hundred dollars, I  want you to take it. If ,you  won't take it, borrow it.  Either way, take a break. Spend it however you like as  long as it falls in the  category of vacation. Real  world stuff, okay. No math.
SOL 	f	Just try it. In a week  you'll laugh about this.  C'mon, Max. Think about it!
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Mr. Cohen? Mr.  Cohen? Please stop for a  second Mr. Cohen?
MAX 	m	Damn it already! Stop  following me. I'm not  interested in your money. I'm  searching for a way to  understand our world. I'm  searching for perfection. I  don't deal with mediocre  materialistic people like  you!
MARCY DAWSON 	f	I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.  I admit I've been a bit too  aggressive. But all I ask is  for five minutes of your time.  Here...
MARCY DAWSON	f	...a stopwatch.  Already ticking. Allow me the  four and a half minutes left  Let me tell you what I want.  Let me tell you what I can  offer you. Afterwards, if you  don't want to talk to me, then  fine, we part as friends and  I promise that you will never  see me again. That's fair,  isn't it?
MAX 	m	Go.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Good. It's funny,  even though we have different  aims and different goals  we're actually incredibly  alike. We both seek the same  thing�perfection. I know... clearly we're seeking  different types of  perfection, but that is what  makes us perfect candidates  for a fruitful partnership.  If you let me, I can be your  greatest ally. Take the  acacia tree...in East  Africa. It is the most  prevalent plant in all of  Kenya because it has managed  to secure its niche by  defeating its major predator,  the giraffe. To accomplish  this, the tree has made a contract  with a highly specialized red ant.  The tree has evolved giant spores which  act as housing for the ants  In return for shelter, the  ants supply defense. When a  giraffe starts to eat the  tree's leaves, the shaking  branch acts like an alarm. The  ants charge out and secrete an  acid onto the giraffe's  tongue. The giraffe learns its  lesson and never returns.  Without each other, the tree  would be picked dry and the  ants would have no shade from  the brutal African sun Both  would die. But with each  other, they succeed, they survive,  they surpass. They have  different aims, different  goals but they work together. Max, we would like to establish  a mutually benefiting alliance  with you.
MAX	m	I'm not interested.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Allow me to dose.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	As a sign of good faith we  wish to offer you this.
MAX 	m	I told you I don't want money.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	The suitcase isn't filled with  fifties or gold or diamonds. Just  silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.
MAX 	m	Ming Mecca. They're not declassified.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	You're right. They're not. But  Lancet-Percy has many friends.  Come here, take a look.
MAX 	m	What do...do...
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Beautiful, isn't it? You know  how rare...are you okay?
MAX 	m	Yeah, I got to go.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	But what about...
MAX 	m	Let me think about it...
MARCY DAWSON 	f	What? Mr. Cohen!?
MAX 	m	Hey!
TRANSIT COP 	m	Up, buddy Coney Island, last stop.
TRANSIT COP 	m	Your nose.
JENNA 	f	Max, Max, can we do one.
MAX 	m	Jenna. I can't now, Jenna.
JENNA 	f	Please, Max.
MAX 	m	I'm working now, later okay?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Hello, this is Lenny?
MAX 	m	Lenny, it's Max Cohen.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Max! How are you?  You want to come down?
MAX 	m	I've been thinking about  our conversation earlier.
LENNY MEYER 	m	That's good...
MAX 	m	I want to help.
LENNY MEYER 	m	Excellent.
MAX 	m	Do you have the Torah in  digital form?
MAX	m	Thursday, September  fourth, sixteen forty-five.  The alchemist awakes. All of  my ideas, work and dreams are  spinning together It all has  to do with spirals. It began  with spirals and the answers  are thee.
MAX	m	The most I can  remember about their  significance is from  Schneider's class. That  bullshit core for majors.  Schneider's fascination with  mystical geometry made him a  bit of a quack...but...then again,  look at Kepler. He was really into  Pythagoras. The leader of an  ancient sect which believed  the entire universe could be  represented by numbers.  Pythagoras' greatest contribution  was the golden ratio, which ended up  influencing art and science  for thousands of years,  arguably all the way up to  today.
MAX	m	The golden ratio,  if I recall, is this unique  relationship between the length  and width of a special  rectangle called the golden  rectangle.
MAX	m	If you take the  width of this rectangle and  use it to form a square within  the rectangle, the part left  over is a rectangle that has  the same ratio as the  original rectangle. au can  continue squaring the  rectangle, over and over  again, making the  rectangles smaller and smaller  to infinity.
MAX	m	Then, if you  connect a curve through these  rectangles you get the golden  spiral. The Pythagoreans  loved this shape because  they found it everywhere  in nature.
MAX	m	It really is amazing. In the sea,  on land, in air, our basic building  block DNA and even our home.
MAX	m	If we're built from  spirals, while living within  a giant spiral, is it  possible that all of human  behavior, if it could be  quantified, is in the form of  a spiral. Then, maybe, extensions of our behavior  like the stock market. maybe  even the writing of The  Torah, is infused with the  spiral pattern.
MAX	m	Friday, September  fifth. Seven twelve. It's  fair to say, I'm stepping out onto a  limb. But I'm on the edge and  that's where it happens.
MAN'S VOICE 	m	Three, eight, two.
MAX 	m	Marcy Dawson.
MAN'S VOICE	m	Who's calling?
MAX 	m	Max Cohen.
MAN'S VOICE	m	Hold on.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Mr. Cohen? I'm so  Happy...
MAX 	m	Look what do you want for the chip?
MARCY DAWSON 	f	You tech guys. I think you  know what we want.
MAX 	m	No, I don't.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	C'mon, Mr. Cohen. We can work  together We can both profit  from this information. We both  need each other to get it, so why  not work with us?
MAX 	m	I don't know if I'll find  anything useful.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	We're willing to take the risk.
MAX 	m	Okay. First, I want you  to call off the surveillance.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Done. Anything else?
MAX 	m	Yeah, I'm a very private  person. Knock on my door and  leave the suitcase outside.  I don't want to talk to Anyone.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	How do I know you're home?
MAX 	m	I'll knock back.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Fair enough.
LENNY MEYER 	m	The Torah.
MAX 	m	What is it?
LENNY MEYER 	m	In Hebrew characters and numbers.
MAX 	m	No, what is it? The two  hundred and sixteen digits.
LENNY MEYER	m	I don't know.  If you get it, maybe  we can figure it out.  Can you really find it?
MAX 	m	If the number's in there,  I'll find it.
MAX 	m	Wha...
FARROUHK	?	You want to fuck her, don't you?
MAX 	m	No, no..
FARROUHK	?	You calling my girlfriend  ugly!? Why don't you want  to fuck her? You think she's  ugly?
MAX 	m	No, no, I just. It's that  she's your girl...
FARROUHK 	?	So you do want to  fuck her. You think about  fucking her in the mouth,  don't you?
MAX 	m	No, no, sir, please. I've  never touched Devi...I  never will.
FARROUHK 	?	Give the fucking  genius a Mars bar. Stay away,  or I'll slice off your balls.
FARROUHK	?	Damn dork.
DEVI	f	He's just a bit unique.
FARROUHK 	?	Unique?! Unique?! He's a dork!
MAX 	m	Okay.
MAX	m	Friday, September  fifth? Lots of work to be  done. But I'm close, so  close. Today is the day Might  have cost me my soul, but  down the line I'll work it  out. Just keep them in the  dark, let them beg. A damn  Ming Mecca chip. It's like  giving a desperate junkie a  syringe filled with junk.  Defense uses them to nun  nuclear sub reactors. Me? I'm  going to dissect the market.
MAX 	m	Happy birthday, Euclid.
MAX	m	Eighteen thirty. Press return... Max darts over and smacks  the RETURN. Moments later we  see what Max sees
MAX 	m	Oh God. Damn religious  freaks.  The holy Torah...
MAX 	m	Ah God...
MAX 	m	Too much...too soon.
MAX 	m	Ohh...
MAX 	m	Stop, please, stop.
MAX 	m	What the?
MAX 	m	What is it!? What is it!?
MAX	m	Two...two hundred. That's it! That's it!
MAX 	m	Oh...
MRS. OVADIA 	f	He's alive. His eyes are moving.
DEVI 	f	Yes, hello?
DEVI 	f	He's busy right now I'm sorry. Max is sprawled out in front  of Euclid. A large amount of  blood, from his nose, is  semi-dried on his chin and  chest. Devi hangs up the phone.
MAX 	m	What happened?
DEVI 	f	You were screaming...
MRS. OVADIA 	f	Who told you you can put extra  locks on the door.
FARROUHK 	?	Shhh!
MAX 	m	The number, the number.
MRS. OVADIA 	f	You're out, you hear me, you're out.  I've had enough of you. Look at all  this junk.
MAX 	m	Four...zero... seven...It's in my head,  it's in my head. Somehow I  memorized it. I got it up  here!
MAX 	m	But what is it?
DEVI 	f	Are you okay?
MRS. OVADIA 	f	What is this stuff? What does it do?
MAX 	m	0ut, out, you have to get  out. Get out, get out it's my  room!
FARROUHK 	?	Let's go.
MRS. OVADIA 	f	That's it, no way. You're  the one out of here, mister.
MAX 	m	Out! 0utt
DEVI 	f	Are you okay?
MAX 	m	Out! Get out!
MAX	m	Saturday? Dark outside. There  was a moment there...when, I don't  know...when I didn't exist. What? What?
MARCY DAWSON	f	Max, is that you? Max?  Max, just talk to me. Things  are a bit out of hand down  here. People are getting  desperate.  We had a deal, Max. A deal.  Talk to us, Max.
MAX	m	Must be an explanation, must be a  reason. Must.
MAX 	m	Bastard.
MAX 	m	Two and a quarter, twelve  and an eighth, six and two  eighths.
MAX 	m	I know these...Seven  and a quarter. Two and a half  ...oh...oh...
MAX 	m	My God. It's gonna  crash, it's gonna fucking  crash.
SOL 	f	You're early. I was just  studying our... What did you do to yourself?
MAX 	m	You lied to me.
SOL 	f	I thought you were going  to take a break.
MAX 	m	You found the two sixteen  number in Pi, didn't you? You  saw it.
MAX 	m	I saw it, Sol. I don't  know what happened, but I  know things. The market is  going to crash. It's going to  crash. It hasn't yet, but I  know it will. I saw it, Sol.  What is it, Sol? What's the  number?
SOL 	f	You have it?
MAX 	m	It's in my head!
SOL 	f	Okay, sit down.
SOL 	f	I gave up before I  pinpointed it. But my guess  is that certain problems  cause computers to get stuck  in a particular loop. The loop  leads to meltdown, but  right before they crash they... they become "aware" of  their own structure. The  computer has a sense of its  own silicon nature and it  prints out its ingredients.
MAX 	m	The computer becomes conscious?
SOL 	f	In some ways...I guess...
MAX 	m	Studying the pattern made Euclid  conscious of itself. Before it died it  spit out the number That consciousness  is the number.
SOL 	f	No, Max, it's only a  nasty bug.
SOL 	f	A door in front of a cliff.  You're driving yourself over  the edge. You need to stop.
MAX 	m	Stop? How can I stop? I'm  this close.
SOL 	f	The bug doesn't only  destroy computers.
MAX 	m	What are you saying?
SOL 	f	Look what it did to your  computer. Look what it's doing  to you.
SOL 	f	It's killing you. Leave it  unknown.
MAX 	m	You were afraid of  it. That's why you quit.
SOL 	f	Max, I got burnt.
MAX 	m	C'mon, Sol.
SOL 	f	It caused my stroke.
MAX 	m	That's bullshit. It's  math, numbers, ideas.  Mathematicians are suppose to  be out on the edge. You  taught me that!
SOL 	f	Max, there's more than  math! There's a whole world...
MAX 	m	That's where discoveries  happen. We have to go out  there alone, all alone, no  one can accompany us. We have  to search the edge. We have  to risk it all. But you ran  from it. You're a coward.
SOL 	f	Max, it's death!
MAX 	m	You can't tell me what it  is. You don't know You've  retreated to your goldfish,  to your books, to your Go,  but you're not satisfied.
SOL 	f	Get out! Max, get out!
MAX 	m	I want to understand it.  I want to know!
SOL 	f	Out!
MAX 	m	Who are you working for?
PHOTOGRAPHER 	m	Here, here.
MAX	m	I don't want your wallet. Who sent you?
MAX	m	Who the hell sent you!?
PHOTOGRAPHER 	m	Wha...I'm sorry...
MAX 	m	Who are you?!
PHOTOGRAPHER 	m	I'm...a...student I've got  an assignment for class.
MAX 	m	Leave me alone, damn it.  Leave me alone.
MAX 	m	Marcy? What's up?
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Let's take a ride, Max.
MAX 	m	I can't, I got work...
MARCY DAWSON 	f	We had a deal! NOW get in the limo!
MAX 	m	Don't ever hit...
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Enough, Max, c'mon out.
MAX 	m	Leave me alone. I don't  know anything.
MAX 	m	Hey! Hey! Hey!
MARCY DAWSON 	f	You're responsible for this.
MAX 	m	I didn't do anything. I  didn't play the market.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	But we did.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	You have to be careful  where you throw out your trash.
MAX 	m	How could you do that?
MARCY DAWSON 	f	You gave us faulty information.  You gave us the carrot, the right  picks, but then you only gave us  part of the code.
MAX 	m	You selfish, irresponsible  cretins. How could you be so  stupid!?
MARCY DAWSON 	f	C'mon, Max. This isn't a  game anymore. We're playing  on a global scale. We used  your code. Foolish...I admit.  But we can fix things if we  make some careful picks. Give  us the rest of the code so  we can set things right.
MAX	m	C'mon! I know who you are.  You're not gonna save the world.
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Look, Max...
MAX 	m	My God, what are you doing?
MARCY DAWSON 	f	Information is  the private language of Capital. We tried to  establish a symbiotic  relationship but if you choose to compete and  enter our niche we are forced  to comply with the laws of  nature.
MAX 	m	You can't kill me!
MARCY DAWSON 	f	C'mon, Max. You  don't get it. I don't give a shit about you. I only  care about what's in your  fucking head. If you won't help  us help yourself, then I'll  have only one choice. Destroy the  competition. I'll take you  out of the game. Survival of the  fittest, Max. And we've got  the gun.
MAX 	m	You bastards! You stupid  bastards!
MAX 	m	Farrouhk!
FARROUHK 	?	He's sick! He's sick!
LENNY MEYER 	m	Max!
MAX 	m	C'mon...
MAX 	m	Farrouhk what about Farrouhk!?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Stay down!
MAX 	m	Go back!
LENNY MEYER 	m	He's okay, he got  in his cab. We've been looking for you.
MAX 	m	What's going on?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Do you have the number?
MAX 	m	What's going on?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Do you have the number?
MAX 	m	Yeah, I have it!
LENNY MEYER 	m	You have it. Where is it?  You have it written down?
MAX 	m	What is it?
MAX 	m	What are you doing!? What  the hell are you doing!?
LENNY MEYER 	m	We're not joking  around, Max? Where's the number?
MAX 	m	It's not on me. It's in my head.
LENNY MEYER 	m	You memorized it?  Did you give it to them?
MAX 	m	Who?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Who!? Those  Wall Street bastards.
MAX 	m	Why do you care?
LENNY MEYER	m	Just answer me!
MAX 	m	Screw you!
LENNY MEYER 	m	Hit him!
LENNY MEYER 	m	You're dealing with something  really big now, Max. I don't  want to hurt you, so answer  me. Did you give it to them?
MAX 	m	They've got part of it  Now get off me!
LENNY MEYER 	m	Damn it! Damn it!  They're using it.
MAX 	m	Using what?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Shut up!
MAX 	m	Let go!
LENNY MEYER 	m	No, don't!
RAV COHEN 	m	Max, Max. You're  okay I'm Rabbi Cohen. Cohen  like you. I'm sorry for what  Lenny did, he's been  reprimanded. It is not our way  Are you okay?
MAX 	m	Yeah, yeah
RAV COHEN 	m	Everything will be  fine, Max. You need to give  us the number. Do you have  it?
MAX 	m	What is it?
LENNY MEYER 	m	I told you we don't know
MAX 	m	You wouldn't be so  flipped out if you didn't  know. What's happening to me?
LENNY MEYER 	m	Give us the number!
MAX 	m	Screw you!
RAV COHEN 	m	Okay, okay! Lenny,  easy! Max, I'll tell you  what's going on. Just calm  down.  The Talmud tells us it began two  thousand years ago, when the  Romans destroyed the second  temple.
MAX 	m	What are you...
RAV COHEN 	m	Just give me a chance.  You'll understand everything  if you listen.
RAV COHEN 	m	The Romans also  murdered all of our priest- hood�the Cohanim�the Cohens,  and with their deaths they  destroyed our greatest  secret. In the center of the  great temple was the holy of  holies which was the heart of  Jewish life. This was the  earthly residence for our  God. The one God. It  contained the ark of the  Tabernacle which stored the  original Ten Commandments  that God gave to Moses. Only  one man could enter this  space once a year on the  holiest day of the year, Yom  Kippur On the Day of  Atonement, all of Israel  would descend upon Jerusalem  to witness the High Cohen's  trip into the holy of holies.  If the holy man was pure he  would reemerge a few moments  later and Israel was secured  a prosperous year. It meant  that we were one yea r closer  to the messianic age. Closer  to the return of the Garden  of Eden. But if he was  impure, he would die  instantly and it meant that  we were doomed. The High  Cohen had a single ritual to perform in the holy of holies.  He had to intone a single  word.
MAX	m	So?
RAV COHEN	m	That word was the true name of God.
MAX	m	Yeah...
RAV COHEN	m	The true name, which only  the Cohanim knew, was two  hundred and sixteen letters  long.
MAX 	m	You're telling me that the number in  my head is the name of God!?
RAV COHEN 	m	Yes...it's The key into  the messianic age. As the  Romans burned the temple, the  Talmud says, the High Cohen  walked into the flames. He  took his secret to the top of  the burning building. The  heavens opened up and took  the key from the priest's  outstretched hand. We've been  searching for the key ever  since. And you may have found  it. Now let us find out.
MAX 	m	That's what happened. I  saw God.
RAV COHEN 	m	No, no, Max.  You're not pure. You can't  see God unless you're pure.
MAX 	m	It's more than God... it s everything. It's math  and science and nature... the universe. I saw the  Universe's DNA
RAV COHEN 	m	You saw nothing.
MAX 	m	I saw everything.
RAV COHEN 	m	There's much more.  We can unlock the door with  the key. It will show God  that we are pure again. He  will return us to The Garden.
MAX 	m	Garden? You're not pure.  I'm the one who has the  number
RAV COHEN 	m	Who do you think  you are? You are a vessel  from our God. You are  carrying a delivery that  needs to be made to us.
MAX 	m	It was given to me. It's  part of me. It's changing me.
RAV COHEN 	m	It's killing you.  Because you are impure.
LENNY MEYER 	m	It will kill you!
MAX 	m	And what will it do to  you?
LENNY MEYER 	m	We're pure. Give  us the number!
MAX 	m	The number is nothing.  You know that!
RAV COHEN 	m	We can use it. We  can wield it.
MAX 	m	It's just a number. I'm  sure you've written down  every two hundred sixteen number.  You've translated all of  them. You've intoned them  all. Haven't you? But what's  it gotten you? It's not the  number! It's the meaning.  It's the syntax. It's what's  between the numbers. If you  could understand you would.  But it's not for you! I've  got it. I understand it. I'm  going to see it!  Rabbi...I was chosen.
MAX	m	Suddenly, it's all there.  It all makes sense. I  can crack it. I can know it.  I know what it is. Sol knows,  too. I need to tell him. I  need to show him. I need to  bring him with me.
JENNY ROBESON 	f	Can I help you?
MAX 	m	Sol?
JENNY ROBESON 	f	Were you a friend?
MAX 	m	What do you mean?
JENNY ROBESON 	f	He had a second stroke.
MAX 	m	Where is he?
MAX 	m	No.
MAX	m	Stop it, please!
MAX 	m	No. No. I'm ready. I'm  ready! Show me!
MAX 	m	Three, seven, two...
DEVI	f	Max. Max! Are you  okay!? Oh my God, Max!
DEVI 	f	Max! Breathe, Max. Breathe!
DEVI	f	Yes, Max. Listen to me...
DEVI 	f	Breathe, Max! Breathe.  Focus.
DEVI	f	No, Max. No.  Stay with me Max. Stay with  me.
MAX 	m	Where am I? What is  this? This is wrong, Sol.  Sol!
MAX 	m	Sol! You were right Sol!  He was right.
DEVI 	f	That's right Max. That's  Right. Breathe. Breathe.
MAX 	m	He was right. I want to  breathe. Breathe.
DEVI 	f	Yes, breathe, Max.  Breathe...
JEHNA 	f	Max, Max!
JENNA 	f	Can we do one, Max, can  we?
JENNA 	f	How about two hundred  and fifty-five times a  hundred and eighty-three.
JENNA 	f	I got it! I got it!  What's the answer?
MAX 	m	I don't know. I really don't  know. What is it, Jenna?
JENNA 	f	Forty-six thousand six  hundred and sixty-five.
MAX 	m	Oh.
