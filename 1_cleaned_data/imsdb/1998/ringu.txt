MASAMI	?	They say that some elementary school  kid spent the night with his parents  at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid wanted to go out and play with everybody,  right, but he didn�t want to miss the  program he always used to watch back in  Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in  their room.  But of course the stations  in Izu are different from the ones in  Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty  channel, so he should�ve recorded nothing but static.  But when the kid  gets back to his house and watches the  tape, all of a sudden this woman comes  on the screen and says-- �One week from now, you will die.� Of course the kid�s completely  freaked, and he stops the video.   Just then the phone rings, and when he  picks it up a voice says-- �You watched it, didn�t you?�  That  same time, exactly one week later...  he�s dead!
MASAMI	?	What is it, Tomoko?
TOMOKO	f	Who did you hear that story from?
MASAMI	?	Who?  It�s just a rumor.  Everybody  knows it.
TOMOKO	f	Youko told you?
MASAMI	?	No, it wasn�t Youko...
MASAMI	?	What�s up with you?
TOMOKO	f	The other day, I... I watched this  strange video.
MASAMI	?	Where?
TOMOKO	f	With Youko and them.
MASAMI	?	So that�s what I�ve been hearing  about you doing some double-date/ sleepover thing!  So, you and that  guy Iwata, huh?
TOMOKO	f	No, it�s not like that.  Nothing  happened!
TOMOKO	f	Iwata... he found this weird video.   Everyone was like, �What�s that?� so  he put it on and we all watched it.
MASAMI	?	And?  What kind of video was it?
TOMOKO	f	Just... weird, I can�t really explain  it.  Anyway, right after we finished  watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever it was didn�t say anything, but still...
MASAMI	?	Jesus.
TOMOKO	f	rumors. That was one week ago today.
MASAMI  	?	Waaait a minute.  Are you faking me  out?
TOMOKO	f	Busted, huh?
MASAMI	?	Oh, my... I can�t believe you!   You�re terrible!
TOMOKO	f	Gotcha!
MASAMI	?	But hang on... you really stayed the night with Youko and Iwata,  right?
MASAMI	?	So, how far did you and he get?
TOMOKO 	f	Oh... I can�t remember.
MASAMI	?	You can�t remember, huh?
MASAMI	?	Man, you had me freaked me out.
MASAMI	?	Was it true?
TOMOKO	f	Masami!
TOMOKO	f	Masami!
MASAMI	?	I�ll put her on.
TOMOKO	f	Yes?
TOMOKO	f	Oh, man!
TOMOKO	f	Yeah, I�ve got a friend over now.   Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.
TOMOKO	f	The game�s gone into overtime, so  they�re gonna be a little late.
TOMOKO	f	Jeeezus, my parents...
MASAMI	?	Oh man, I�m tellin� everybody about  this tomorrow!
MASAMI	?	I�m gonna use your bathroom.  Don�t  go anywhere.
TOMOKO	f	�K.
ASAKAWA	m	There seems to be a popular rumor  going around about a �cursed�  videotape.
YOUNG GIRL	f	Uh-huh.
ASAKAWA 	m	Have you heard what kind of video  it might be?
YOUNG GIRL	f	Uh-huh.
KOMIYA	f	Uh, don�t look right at the camera,
YOUNG GIRL	f	Sorry.
ASAKAWA	m	Let�s do it again.
ASAKAWA	m	Have you heard what kind of video  it might be?
YOUNG GIRL	f	What I heard was, all of a sudden  this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, �In one week, you will die.�
GIRL #2	f	I heard that if you�re watching TV  late at night it�ll come on, and then your phone�ll ring.
ASAKAWA	m	Watching TV late at night... do you
GIRL #2	f	Mmmm... I heard some local station,  around Izu.
ASAKAWA	m	Izu?
GIRL #2	f	Mmm-hmm.
ASAKAWA	m	And, do you know if anyone�s really  died from watching it?
YOUNG GIRL	f	Well, no one that we know, right?
ASAKAWA	m	What is it?
GIRL #3	f	I heard this from a friend of mine  in high school.  She said that there  was this one girl who watched the  video, and then died a week later.   She was out on a drive with her  boyfriend.
ASAKAWA	m	They were in a wreck?
GIRL #3	f	No, their car was parked, but they  were both dead inside.  Her  boyfriend died because he�d watched  the video, too.  That�s what my  friend said. It�s true!  It was in the paper two  or three days ago.
ASAKAWA	m	Do you know the name of the high  school this girl went to?
GIRL #3	f	No... I heard this from my friend,  and it didn�t happen at her school.   She heard it from a friend at a  different school, she said.
KOMIYA	f	Mrs. Asakawa?
ASAKAWA	m	Hm?
KOMIYA	f	Here you are.
ASAKAWA	m	Thanks.
KOMIYA	f	This same kind of thing happened  about ten years ago too, didn�t it?   Some popular young singer committed  suicide, and then suddenly there was  all this talk about her ghost showing up on some music show.
ASAKAWA	m	But I wonder what this rumor�s all  about. Everyone you ask always  mentions �Izu.�
KOMIYA	f	Maybe that�s where it all started.   Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake Onna * story from again?
ASAKAWA	m	Gifu, but there was some big  accident out there, and that ended up being what started the rumor.
KOMIYA	f	A big accident?
ASAKAWA	m	Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like  that is going to stay in people�s  minds.  Sometimes the story of what  happened gets twisted around, and  ends up coming back as a rumor like  this one. That�s what they say, at  least.
KOMIYA	f	D�you think something like that  happened out at Izu?
ASAKAWA	m	Maybe. Well, anyway, I�m off.  See you tomorrow.
KOMIYA	f	See you.
GUY IN SUIT	m	OK, Okazaki, I�m counting on you.
OKAZAKI	m	Yessir.
OKAZAKI	m	Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were  going home early today.
ASAKAWA	m	Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?
OKAZAKI	m	Sure.
ASAKAWA	m	Could you check out this article  for me?  Get me some more info.?
OKAZAKI	m	I guess...
ASAKAWA	m	Good.  Call me as soon as you know  more, OK?
OKAZAKI	m	Ma�am.
ASAKAWA 	m	Yoichi!
ASAKAWA	m	Sorry I�m late.  Oh, you�ve already  changed.
YOICHI	m	Yup.  I got your clothes out for you.
ASAKAWA	m	Aargh, we�ve gotta hurry!
ASAKAWA	m	Did grandpa call?
YOICHI 	m	Nope.
YOICHI	m	Why did Tomo-chan die? *
ASAKAWA	m	Well... it looks like she was really,  really sick.
ASAKAWA	m	Will you do me up?
YOICHI	m	You can die even if you�re young?
ASAKAWA	m	If it�s something serious... well, yes.
ASAKAWA	m	As hard as it is for us, what your  auntie and uncle are going through  right now is even harder, so let�s  not talk about this over there, OK?
ASAKAWA	m	You and her used to play a lot  together, didn�t you?
ASAKAWA	m	Dad.
KOUICHI	m	Ah!
ASAKAWA	m	How is sis holding up?
KOUICHI	m	She�s resting inside right now.   She�s shaken up pretty badly, you  know.  It�s best she just take  things easy for a while.
ASAKAWA	m	I�ll go check on auntie and them,  then.
KOUICHI	m	OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why don�t you sit  here for a little while?
AUNT	?	Have you heard anything more about  Tomo-chan�s death?
ASAKAWA	m	No, I...
AUNT	?	But the police have already finished  their autopsy!
ASAKAWA	m	Well, they said there was no sign of  foul play.
AUNT	?	That was no normal death.  They haven�t  once opened the casket to let us see the body.  Don�t you think that�s  strange?
ASAKWAWA 	?	Yoichi?
ASAKAWA	m	What are you doing up here?  You shouldn�t just walk into other  people�s rooms.
ASAKAWA	m	You go on downstairs, OK?
YOICHI	m	OK.
ASAKAWA	m	You go on ahead.
YOICHI	m	�K.
ASAKAWA	m	Hello?
OKAZAKI	m	Uh... this is Okazaki.  I�ve got  some more info on that article for you.  The girl was a student of  the uh, Seikei School for Women in  Yokahama City.
ASAKAWA	m	Thanks.
ASAKAWA	m	Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a strange question, but by any chance  were you friends of that young girl that died in the car as well?
ASAKAWA	m	Please.  If you know anything...
GIRL RIGHT	f	They all died the same day.  Youko.   Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a motorcycle accident.
GIRL LEFT	f	Because they watched the video.
ASAKAWA	m	Video?
GIRL LEFT	f	That�s what Youko said.  They all watched some weird video, and  after that their phone rang.
ASAKAWA	m	Tomoko-chan watched it, too?   Where?
GIRL LEFT	f	She just said they all stayed  somewhere.
GIRL RIGHT	f	There was a girl with Tomoko when  she died.  She�s had to be  hospitalized for shock.
GIRL MIDDLE	f	They say she won�t go anywhere  near a television.
YOSHINO	f	The bodies of those found were  Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of  the Seikei School for Women, and  Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory  school student.  Both their doors  were securely locked.
YOSHINO	f	This is the first time I�ve -ever-  seen something like this.
ASAKAWA	m	Cause of death?
YOSHINO	f	Couldn�t say, aside from sudden  heart failure.
ASAKAWA	m	Drugs?
YOSHINO	f	The autopsy came up negative.
YOSHINO	f	These two, about to go at it,  suddenly up and die for no  apparent reason.  Do -you- get it?
RYOMI 	f	They tell me that Yoichi came to  the funeral, too.
ASAKAWA	m	Mmm-hmm.
RYOMI	f	They used to play a lot together, didn�t they?  Upstairs.
ASAKAWA	m	Yeah...
RYOMI	f	This... this is where Tomoko died.
RYOMI	f	Tomoko!
ASAKAWA	m	Izu...
ASAKAWA	m	Look, I�m probably going to be late coming home tonight, so just stick  your dinner in the microwave when  you�re ready to eat, OK?
YOICHI	m	�K... Mom?
ASAKAWA	m	Hmm?
YOICHI	m	Tomo-chan watched some cursed video!
ASAKAWA	m	What did you say?  You are not to  speak of this at school, do you  hear me?
YOICHI	m	I won�t.  I�m going to school now.
ASAKAWA	m	There�s no way...
ASAKAWA	m	"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.   That�s why I�m fat, too."
CLERK	m	Room for one?
ASAKAWA	m	Um, actually I�m here on business.
ASAKAWA	m	They would have stayed here on  August 29th, all four of them.   If there�s any information you  might have...
CLERK	m	Uh, hang on just a minute.
CLERK	m	August 29th...
ASAKAWA	m	That...
CLERK	m	Hmm?
ASAKAWA	m	That!  What tape is that?
CLERK	m	This?  Hmm...
CLERK	m	Maybe one of the guests left it behind�
ASAKAWA	m	One week�
RYUJI	m	Yoichi�s in elementary school  already, is he?
ASAKAWA	m	His first year.  What about you,  Ryuji?  How have you been  recently?
RYUJI	m	Same as always.
ASAKAWA	m	And money is...?
RYUJI	m	I�m teaching at university.
RYUJI	m	Anyway.  You said that the phone rang?
ASAKAWA	m	That�s right.
RYUJI	m	So if I watch it too, that phone over  there-- --should ring.
ASAKAWA	m	Ryuji, four people have already  died.  On the same day!
RYUJI	m	Well, why don�t you try calling  an exorcist?
ASAKAWA	m	Take my picture.
RYUJI	m	Turn this way.
ASAKAWA	m	Hurry up and take it.
RYUJI	m	It�s over.
RYUJI	m	Well, it looks like your phone�s not  ringing.
RYUJI	m	Make me a copy of this, will you?   I�d like to do a little research of my own. There�s no reason to  write us off as dead just yet.  If there�s a video, that means that  somebody had to make it.
ASAKAWA	m	There�s the guest list from the  cottage to look into... and the  possibility of someone hacking  into the local station�s broadcast  signals.
OKAZAKI	m	Here�s that guest list you wanted.
ASAKAWA	m	Oh, thanks.
OKAZAKI	m	What are you gonna do with this?
ASAKAWA	m	Uh... sorry, I�m working on  something personal.
RYUJI	m	Hey.
RYUJI	m	Nothing.
RYUJI	m	So, what�d you come up with?
ASAKAWA	m	I don�t think any of the guests on  the list brought the tape with them.   I couldn�t confirm it face-to-face  of course, but even over the phone I  got the feeling they were all being  upfront with me.
ASAKAWA	m	There�re no traces of any illegal  television signals being broadcast  around Izu.
ASAKAWA	m	Here�s that copy of the videotape  you wanted.
RYUJI	m	Asakawa.
RYUJI	m	Have you ever seen this woman?
ASAKAWA	m	There�s something strange about  this shot.
ASAKAWA	m	From this angle, the mirror should  be reflecting whoever�s filming.
RYUJI	m	So, what does that mean?
ASAKAWA	m	Well, if the person who made this  is a pro, there�d be a way around  that, I guess, but still...
RYUJI	m	Volcanic eruption... Eruption where?
ASAKAWA	m	This is gonna be impossible to figure  out on just a regular TV screen,  don�t you think?
RYUJI	m	Come on in.
RYUJI	m	Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai. This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.
MAI	f	Nice to meet you.  I�m Takano.
ASAKAWA	m	Asakawa. *
MAI	f	Sensei, the people from the  publishing company called about  the deadline on your thesis again.
RYUJI	m	What�re they talkin� to you  about it for?
MAI	f	Because they can never get a  hold of you.
RYUJI	m	Ask them to wait another week.
MAI	f	Sensei, ask them yourself,  please.
RYUJI	m	OK, OK.
RYUJI	m	This is impossible.
RYUJI	m	Sada...
RYUJI	m	Is Yoichi gonna be all right?
ASAKAWA	m	He�s used to it...
RYUJI	m	Whoever made this had to have left  some kind of clue behind.  They�re  probably waiting for us to find it.
RYUJI	m	Wait a minute.
TAPE	m	Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...   boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...
RYUJI	m	Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru  zo.  Did you hear that, too?
ASAKAWA	m	What does that mean?
RYUJI	m	I�m gonna check it out.
ASAKAWA	m	Hello?
RYUJI	m	I�ve got it.  It�s a dialect, just  like I thought.  SHOUMON means  �playing in the water� and BOUKON
ASAKAWA	m	But, dialect from where?
RYUJI	m	Oshima.  And the site of our  �eruption� is Mt. Mihara.
ASAKAWA	m	Yoichi?  I�m gonna be a little  late tonight, honey.
ASAKAWA	m	You can do it yourself, right?  OK.   Sorry.  Bye.
ASAKAWA	m	I�ve got it!  This old article...
ASAKAWA	m	What are you doing?
RYUJI	m	Has your newspaper got someone out  there at Oshima?
ASAKAWA	m	I think so.  There should be a  correspondent out there.
RYUJI	m	I need you to find out, and let me  know how to get hold of him. Tonight.
ASAKAWA	m	What do you think you�re--?
RYUJI	m	You�ve only got four days left,  Asakawa!  Your newspaper contact  and I can handle this from here  on out.  You just stay with Yoichi.
YOICHI	m	Grandpa!
KOUICHI	m	Whoa, there!  So, you made it, huh?
ASAKAWA	m	Yoichi says he�s looking forward to  doing some fishing with you.
KOUICHI	m	Is that so?
YOICHI	m	C�mon grandpa, let�s go!
KOUICHI	m	OK, OK.  We�ll get our things  together and then we can go.
KOUICHI	m	There he is!  C�mon, there he is,  don�t let him go!
KOUICHI	m	Oh, oh!  Ah... guess he got away,  huh?
YOICHI	m	That was your fault, grandpa.
KOUICHI	m	Well, whaddya say we try again?
KOUICHI	m	We�ll get �im this time.
YOICHI	m	How was work, mommy?
ASAKAWA	m	Hello?
RYUJI	m	Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came  through.  It looks like the woman  who predicted the Mihara eruption  is the same woman from the video.
RYUJI	m	Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She  committed suicide forty years ago  by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.
ASAKAWA	m	Have you got anything else?
RYUJI 	m	I�m gonna have to check it for  myself.  I�ll be leaving for  Oshima tomorrow morning.
ASAKAWA	m	Oshima?  I�ve only got three days  left!
RYUJI	m	I know.  And I�ve got four.
RYUJI	m	I�ll be in touch.
KOUJI	m	What�s happened?
ASAKAWA	m	Nothing.  I just had some things  left over from work.
TOMOKO 	f	Auntie?
ASAKAWA	m	Yoichi?
ASAKAWA	m	Yoichi!  You brought this with you,  didn�t you?  Why?!?
YOICHI	m	Tomo-chan...
YOICHI	m	Tomo-chan told me to watch it.
RYUJI	m	I should�ve been more careful.   When I was at your place that  day, I could feel something  there.  I thought it was just  because of the video...
ASAKAWA	m	You mean that Tomoko�
RYUJI	m	That�s not Tomoko.  Not anymore.
ASAKAWA	m	Yoichi... he can see them too,  can�t he?
ASAKAWA	m	It�s all my fault.  First Tomoko  died, then those three others.  It  should have stopped there, but it  didn�t.  Because of me.
RYUJI	m	I wonder...
ASAKAWA	m	How did the rumors about the  video even start in the first  place?
RYUJI	m	This kind of thing... it doesn�t  start by one person telling a  story.  It�s more like everyone�s  fear just takes on a life of its  own.
ASAKAWA	m	Fear...
RYUJI	m	Or maybe it�s not fear at all.   Maybe it�s what we were  secretly hoping for all along.
ASAKAWA	m	Mr. Hayatsu?
HAYATSU	f	Aah, welcome!  You must be tired  after your long trip.  Please,  this way.
HAYATSU	f	Back in the old days, the Yamamuras used to head fishing boats out in  Sashikiji, though they don�t much  anymore.  You know, one of Shizuko�s  cousins is still alive. He�s just an  old man now.  His son and his  daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned  inn.  I went ahead and booked  reservations for y�all, hope that�s  alright...
ASAKAWA	m	Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit  suicide?
RYUJI	m	She was taking a real beating  in the press, being called a  fraud and all sorts of names.   After a while she just lost it.
RYUJI	m	Shizuko was getting a lot of  attention around the island after predicting the eruption of Mt.  Mihara.  Seems that for some time  she�d had a rather unique ability: precognition. It was around then that she attracted the attention  of a certain scholar whom you may  have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.
ASAKAWA	m	He was driven out of the university,  wasn�t he?
RYUJI	m	This Professor Ikuma convinces  Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him,  where he uses her in a series of  demonstrations meant to prove the  existence of ESP.  At first she�s  the darling of the press, but the  next thing you know they�re  knocking her down, calling her a  fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later, the media still hasn�t changed that much.
ASAKAWA	m	I�ve heard this story.  But... I�m  sure I remember hearing that somebody  died at one of those demonstrations.
RYUJI	m	After getting kicked out of  university, Ikuma just vanished,  and no one�s been able to get hold  of him since.  He�s probably not  even alive anymore.
ASAKAWA	m	But, why even try looking for him?
RYUJI	m	Because he�s supposed to have had a  child with Shizuko.  A daughter.
HAYATSU	f	Hello?
KAZUE	f	Thank you. Welcome.
HAYATSU	f	Well, I�ll be off then.
KAZUE	f	Please.
KAZUE	f	And for your rooms, how shall we...?
RYUJI	m	Separate, please.
KAZUE	f	�Sir.
KAZUE	f	This way.
KAZUE	f	Sir!
KAZUE	f	Please, this way.
ASAKAWA	m	Please!  If you could just answer  a few questions, about Shizuko...
YAMAMURA	?	I got nuthin� to say.
ASAKAWA	m	It�s about Shizuko�s daughter.
ASAKAWA	m	She did have a daughter, didn�t she?
RYUJI	m	Aren�t you gonna eat?
ASAKAWA	m	Umm...
RYUJI	m	Hm?
ASAKAWA	m	You�ll stay with me won�t you?   When it�s time for me to die.
RYUJI	m	Oh, stop it.
ASAKAWA	m	You�ll stay, won�t you?  If you  stayed, maybe you�d learn something that could help Yoichi--
RYUJI	m	I said stop it!  Have you forgotten  There was a girl with Tomoko when  she died?  That girl�s now in a  mental institution.  Who knows what  could happen.
ASAKAWA	m	But you could stay with me, Ryuji.   You�d be OK.
RYUJI	m	Why, because I�m already not  right in the head?
RYUJI	m	If that�s the case, why not just let things run its course, get rid of father -and- son?  Yoichi was a mistake, anyway.
ASAKAWA	m	Stop it!
RYUJI	m	We still have two days left...
KAZUE 	f	Excuse me?
RYUJI	m	Come in.
KAZUE	f	It�s about Miss Shizuko.
KAZUE	f	This is all that there is...
RYUJI	m	Is this Professor Ikuma?
KAZUE	f	...yes.  This picture is from before  I�d entered the household.   I should go now.
VOICE	m	Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...
YAMAMURA	?	Y�all�d do best to be off soon.   Sea�s probably gonna be rough  tonight.
RYUJI	m	What kind of a child was Shizuko?
YAMAMURA 	?	Shizuko was... different.  She�d come  out here by herself ever�day an� just stare out at the ocean.  The fishermen  all took a dislikin� to her.  Ocean�s  an unlucky place for us, y�see: every  year it swallows up more of our own.  You keep starin� out at somethin�  ike that...
RYUJI	m	kuru zo.  �If you keep playing in the  water, the monster will come for you.�
RYUJI	m	Shizuko could see �inside� people,  couldn�t she?  Down to the places  they�d most like to keep hidden.  It  must have been difficult for her...
RYUJI	m	I�ve got a little of that ability  myself.  It was you who spread the  word about Shizuko, wasn�t it?   And you who first contacted  Professor Ikuma?
YAMAMURA	?	What�re you--?
RYUJI	m	You thought you�d be able to make  some money off her.  You even got  some, from one of the newspapers.
YAMAMURA	?	Leave me the hell alone!
RYUJI	m	Tell us about Shizuko�s daughter.   Who was she?
YAMAMURA	?	I don�t know!
RYUJI	m	She was there, with Shizuko. She  had to be.
RYUJI	m	You were there!
RYUJI 	m	You stood there and watched the  demonstration.
JUDGE	m	Match.
JUDGE	m	Match.
REPORTER	m	Faker!  This is nothing but trickery,  and the lowest form of trickery at  that.
REPORTER	m	What are you trying to pull, woman?
REPORTER #2	m	That�s right!  Professor Ikuma,  you�re being fooled!
REPORTER #3	m	What�s happened?
REPORTER #4	m	He�s dead!
REPORTER #5	m	Witch!
SHIZUKO	f	Sadako?  Was it you?
RYUJI	m	Sadako?!
RYUJI	m	Sadako killed him?  She can kill  just with a thought?
YAMAMURA	?	She�s... a devil spawn.
ASAKAWA	m	That�s right. After Yamamura Shizuko  committed suicide, Professor Ikuma took the daughter and ran.  No, no one knows where they went.  That�s why I  need -you- to find out where they are.   Even if the professor�s dead, Sadako  should still be in her forties.  I�ll  explain it all later, but right now  just hurry!
RYUJI	m	Sadako�s probably already dead.  She could kill people with just a thought,  remember?  Her mother wasn�t even  close to that.
ASAKAWA	m	Well, what about that video?  If  Sadako�s dead then who made it?
RYUJI	m	Nobody made it. It wasn�t made at  all. That video... is the pure,  physical manifestation of Sadako�s  hatred.
RYUJI	m	We�ve been cursed.
HAYATSU	f	It�s no good.  With the typhoon  coming in, all ships are  temporarily staying docked.
RYUJI	m	What about the fishing boats?   Tell their captains I�ll pay.
HAYATSU	f	Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing  whether this typhoon is going to hit  us or not, I think it�d be better to  wait and see how things turn--
RYUJI	m	Fine!  I�ll try searching myself!
HAYATSU	f	Mr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...
ASAKAWA	m	Hello?
OKAZAKI 	m	Mrs. Asakawa?  I�m sorry.  I tried,  but I couldn�t come up with any  leads at all.
OKAZAKI 	m	Hello?
ASAKAWA	m	Thank you...
ASAKAWA	m	Yoichi...
ASAKAWA 	m	Izu...
ASAKAWA	m	Ryuji!
ASAKAWA	m	Ryuji!  The phone in my apartment  never rang!  It only ever rang at the rental cottage!  Professor  Ikuma must�ve...
RYUJI	m	And we�ve got no way of going back.
HAYATSU	f	It�s too dangerous!  The thought of  anybody going out in this weather...
YAMAMURA 	?	I�ll take you out.
YAMAMURA	?	Sadako is callin� y�all, reckon.   Mayhap to drag you down under the  water.
RYUJI	m	Please.  Take us out.
ASAKAWA	m	It�s funny.  I�m not afraid at all.
RYUJI	m	Sadako probably died back out there at Izu, before the rental cottages  were ever built.
ASAKAWA	m	So, Sadako was Professor Ikuma�s  daughter?
RYUJI	m	Ikuma smuggled her out in secret.   His relationship with Shizuko was  already a scandal, and one of the  reasons he got drummed out of the  university... We�ve gotta find  Sadako�s body.
ASAKAWA	m	Is that going to break the curse?   Will Yoichi be all right?
RYUJI	m	It�s all we�ve got left to try.
ASAKAWA	m	Just one more day...
RYUJI	m	We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesn�t  have it out for us after all.
YAMAMURA	?	Shizuko... she used to -speak- to  the ocean, just ramble away.  One  time I hid, listenin� to one of her  conversations. And it weren�t in no human language.
YOICHI 	m	Hello?
ASAKAWA	m	Yoichi?  It�s mommy.  I just called  to say I�ll be coming home tomorrow.
YOICHI 	m	I�m tired of it here, mom!  I wanna go back to school.
ASAKAWA	m	Yoichi, it�s rude to your grandpa  to talk like that.
YOICHI 	m	He�s laughing.  You wanna talk to him?
ASAKAWA	m	No, that�s...
ASAKAWA	m	I�m sorry, Yoichi.  I�ll... I�ll  see you tomorrow.
YOICHI	m	What�s wrong?
ASAKAWA	m	Mommy�s got something she has to do.   Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?
RYUJI	m	What time was it when you first  watched the video?
ASAKAWA	m	Seven or eight minutes past  seven.  PM.  No more than ten  minutes past.
RYUJI	m	If the rumors are true, that  time is gonna be our deadline.
RYUJI	m	-Here-.
RYUJI	m	I knew it!  The well.
ASAKAWA	m	The well...
ASAKAWA	m	Her own father!
RYUJI	m	It was Ikuma who put this lid on.   And Sadako�s still inside.
RYUJI	m	I�ll go.
RYUJI	m	climb her way out.
RYUJI	m	Lower the buckets!
RYUJI	m	Take it up!
RYUJI	m	Take it up!
ASAKAWA	m	It�s already six!
RYUJI	m	I know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!
RYUJI	m	Asakawa!
RYUJI	m	What the hell are you doing?  Trying  to get me killed?
RYUJI 	m	Hey!
RYUJI	m	Asakawa!
RYUJI	m	We�ll change.  You�re in no condition  to keep this up.
ASAKAWA:	?	No!
RYUJI	m	Who do you expect to pull up these  buckets, then?
ASAKAWA	m	But, we don�t even know if it�s doing  any good...
RYUJI	m	And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his mother not coming to pick him up  after all?
RYUJI	m	Don�t look down!
ASAKAWA	m	Where are you?  Please, come out.
ASAKAWA	m	Please.  Where are you?
ASAKAWA	m	It�s you...
RYUJI	m	Hey!  Asakawa!  It�s already 10  minutes past seven!  We did it!
ASAKAWA	m	Why would Ikuma have killed her?   His own daughter...
RYUJI	m	Maybe she wasn�t his daughter at all.
ASAKAWA	m	What?
RYUJI	m	Maybe her father... wasn�t even human.
RYUJI	m	It�s gone...
RYUJI	m	Enough, already.  It�s over.  C�mon.   I�ll take you home.
RYUJI	m	Get some rest.   I still have a thesis to finish.
ASAKAWA	m	...thank you.
RYUJI	m	That girl...
RYUJI	m	Why?!
RYUJI	m	That�s it!  Asakawa...
RYUJI	m	Aaargh!
GUARD	m	Are you a resident here, ma�am?
ASAKAWA	m	I�m Takayama Ryuji�s wife!
GUARD	m	I�m sorry ma�am, but they�ve already  taken the body away.
ASAKAWA	m	What happened?
MAI	f	When I got here he was just  lying there...
ASAKAWA	m	Did he say anything to you?  About  a videotape?
MAI	f	His face...
ASAKAWA	m	Ryuji... why?  Does this mean that Yoichi will die, too?  Is the curse  not broken yet?
ASAKAWA	m	I was the only one to break  Sadako�s curse.  Ryuji... why...?   Something I did that you didn�t...   Something I did that you didn�t...
ASAKAWA	m	Ryuji?!
ASAKAWA	m	Something I did that you didn�t...
ASAKAWA	m	What broke the curse was that I copied  the tape and showed it to someone else!
ASAKAWA	m	It�s for Yoichi...
GIRL A 	f	They say there�s a way you can stay  alive after you watch the video.   You�ve gotta make a copy of it, and  show it to somebody else inside a week.
GIRL B 	f	But what about the person you show it  to?
GIRL A 	f	Well, then they make a copy and show it  to somebody else.  Again, inside a week.
GIRL C 	f	Then there�s no end to it.
GIRL A 	f	That�s just it.  There -is- no end.  But  if it meant not dying... you�d do it,  wouldn�t you?
