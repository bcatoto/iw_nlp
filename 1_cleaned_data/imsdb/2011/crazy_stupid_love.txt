CAL	m	Well, I'm full. You were right, hon. I shouldn't have eaten all that bread. Want to just share a dessert? Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu.
CAL	m	You okay, babe? You seem out of it.
TRACY	f	Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want.
CAL	m	Me too. Okay, let's say it at the same time. One. Two. Three...
TRACY CAL	f	I want a divorce. Creme Brulee.
JESSICA	f	I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna  getcha! She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with  delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the nearby console. Jessica picks it up:
JESSICA	f	It's okay, my fault. Alright, kiddo, it's getting late, let's get you to bed before your parents get home. Don't give me the puppy eyes, you little maniac. Go brush your teeth! Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately.
HANNAH	f	I don't care. I love him and given the opportunity, I'd have his babies. Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS.
LIZ	f	Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd do Conan O'Brien?
HANNAH	f	I'm just saying, Richard's a lot  of things: successful, smart...
LIZ	f	Boring, workaholic, sexually  repressed...
HANNAH	f	But he's not very funny, that's  all.
LIZ	f	Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a good lay, go get yourself some of... that. She motions off to the side.
HANNAH	f	What?
LIZ	f	The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour. THE CROWD PARTS, revealing: JACOB PALMER (32). The  smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen. He tilts his glass at them, toasting.
TRACY	f	Aren't you going to say anything? Nothing.
TRACY	f	Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say? She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward. It's silent. Devastating.
JESSICA	f	Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive -- She SCREAMS as --
ANOTHER ANGLE	m	ROBBIE WEAVER (13), quickly covers himself up. He was  masturbating.
ROBBIE	m	Close the door!
JESSICA	f	I'm sorry, Robbie! I didn't see  anything, I swear.
LIZ	f	I don't know, Hannah. Your life is just so... PG-13.  Hannah's mouth drops open.
HANNAH	f	My life is not PG-13!
LIZ	f	It so is. You've never left LA.  You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard. I just worry about you is all. Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger-  Dick' O'Brien.
HANNAH	f	He's funny.
LIZ	f	He looks like a carrot, honey. Hannah LAUGHS.
LIZ	f	Hi.
JACOB	m	Hi. Who looks like a carrot?
LIZ	f	Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy.
JACOB	m	I think your friend Hannah is sexy. Hannah LAUGHS.
HANNAH	f	You didn't really just say that.
JACOB	m	Pretty sure I did.
HANNAH	f	How old are you?
JACOB	m	Thirty-three next month.
HANNAH	f	Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work. Jacob sits down at their table, uninvited.
JACOB	m	I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line.
JACOB	m	There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and I've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you, for the past two hours. Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact. Answer this quickly, without thinking about your answer: do you find me attractive? Hannah doesn't flinch.
HANNAH	f	I don't.
JACOB	m	Yes you do.
LIZ	f	Yes, she does.
JACOB	m	I'm an accomplished lover. If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied.  Multiple times.
HANNAH	f	You've got to be kiddi--
JACOB	m	We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again.
HANNAH	f	Is that so?
JACOB	m	It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you.
LIZ	f	Multiple times.
JACOB	m	That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink? Hannah and Liz share a look.
HANNAH	f	What do you expect me to say to that?
JACOB	m	Margarita, rocks, salt.
HANNAH	f	Wow. She STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand.
HANNAH	f	Okay, time to go. Liz doesn't move.
LIZ	f	I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a
HANNAH	f	Liz!
LIZ	f	(whispering to him) Another time, maybe. GIGGLING, the girls leave the bar.
TRACY	f	I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know? He keeps staring straight ahead.
TRACY	f	Okay, you're not talking and you  know that only makes me talk more.  Maybe that's good, maybe that's  good. Okay...
	?	There's this person.  No response.
TRACY	f	We've been spending time together.  Lunches, meetings, that kind of  stuff...  Silence. She closes her eyes tightly.
TRACY	f	I slept with him. Kind of.  Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek. Nothing.
TRACY	f	No, no kind of. I can't believe I  said kind of. That's just not  something you do in a kind of way.  I slept with someone. There. I  said it. I slept with someone.  Oh God. It's the worst thing I've  ever done but it feels so good to  say out loud. I slept with  someone. I SLEPT with someone. I  slept with SOMEONE. I slept with  ... please stop me, please say  something.  No reaction.
TRACY	f	David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party.  You remember that party? They had  the giant paper-machï¿½ wreath? I  kept asking the decorator how he  made it? You wore that sweater --  Finally, Cal speaks --
CAL	m	Please stop.
TRACY	f	The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal --
CAL	m	If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car.
TRACY	f	But the fact that I did, that it  could happen at all, I think it  just shows how broken we are and --
CAL	m	Okay. Just like that, Cal OPENS THE DOOR to the moving car and, simply, steps out. Tracy SCREAMS as Cal goes flying. She screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror.
TRACY	f	Are you out of your mind!? He looks up at her, pleading.
CAL	m	I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it. She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's still something here.
TRACY	f	Okay.
CAL	m	Okay. He stands, limps back to the car.
ROBBIE	m	I'm sorry that you had to see that. She keeps staring straight ahead.
JESSICA	f	I should have knocked.
ROBBIE	m	For the record: I think about you while I do it --
JESSICA	f	Robbie!
ROBBIE	m	I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time --
JESSICA	f	Stop it!
ROBBIE	m	I love you, Jessica. And I know you're seventeen, and I know I just turned thirteen, which is the  same age as your little brother,  and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because...
ROBBIE	m	I'm pretty sure you're my soulmate. She stops, looks at him and smiles gently.
JESSICA	f	Listen, Robbie --
ROBBIE	m	Shit. Jessica jumps off the couch.
JESSICA	f	Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was dinner... Oh my God, Mr. Weaver, you're bleeding. Why are you bleeding?
CAL	m	Mrs. Weaver told me she wants a divorce so I jumped out of the car. Hope the kids behaved. Come on, I'll drive you home. Robbie steps INTO FRAME.
ROBBIE	m	Dad?
CAL	m	Oh. I didn't know you were here.
ROBBIE	m	You're getting divorced?
CAL	m	Yes.
TRACY	f	Cal!
ROBBIE	m	And you jumped out of a car?
CAL	m	A moving car, yes.
TRACY	f	Cal!
CAL	m	I'm sorry you found out this way.
ROBBIE	m	I'm sorry you jumped out of a car.
CAL	m	Thanks. Jessica, you got your coat?
JESSICA	f	Uh-huh.
CAL	m	We'll talk to the kids tomorrow. Tell them we're separating. Just separating. We'll do it together. He thinks.
CAL	m	I'll have to tell Nanna. Uch, she's gonna be crushed. But not right now. She's got enough to worry about... He trails off. Another long beat of silence, then he remembers his company and turns toward Jessica.
CAL	m	So, I hear Stanford early  admission, huh. I know your dad is so proud.
JESSICA	f	Yeah. You're bleeding real bad, Mr. Weaver. She goes to touch his eye. Out of nowhere... he starts BANGING THE SHIT out of his steering wheel.
CAL	m	David Jacobowitz! Are you kidding me!? DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ!
CAL	m	Sorry about that.
JESSICA	f	It's okay. Jessica reaches for the door, but stops. She takes a deep breath, adorable.
JESSICA	f	Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile.
JESSICA	f	You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy. Cal smiles, distracted but grateful.
JESSICA	f	In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a
CAL	m	Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents? It's probably better they hear it from us. Okay?
JESSICA	f	Uh-huh.
CAL	m	That's my girl. Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car.
CAL	m	Hey, Jessica? Thanks for listening. She smiles, turns back. She freezes when she sees... He's holding CASH out the window to pay her.
CAL	m	You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford.  And with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer.
BARTENDER	m	Another vodka cranberry?
CAL	m	Yes. Just... yes. A GIRL (30s) approaches the bar. Cal taps her shoulder, a drunken train-wreck waiting to happen.
CAL	m	Guess what?
GIRL	f	What?
CAL	m	My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.
GIRL	f	I'm sorry to hear that.
CAL	m	That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore. The Girl has turned back to a group of friends.
CAL	m	I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz. (to no one)  She screws him.  Something catches Cal's eye across the bar. We PAN TO...
JACOB PALMER	m	wearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got TWO  BEAUTIFUL WOMEN fawning over him at his table.  Cal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the  bartender, and decides:
	?	Gay.
WOMAN	f	So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2  is a lot like unit 1 except you're  downstairs so... the ground is  closer. Which is nice.
CAL	m	I guess the price is right.
WOMAN	f	Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys  here. You'll fit right in.  Cal SIGHS, un-enthused.
CAL	m	I'll take it.
WOMAN	f	Ooh, the gym has an elliptical  machine... I assume you want to  get back in shape?  Cal looks down, embarrassed.
CAL	m	I guess.
WOMAN	f	Great! I'll let you know when  they fix it.
BOSS	m	Cal, I just got the weekly sales  report, good good good! You  really killed this quarter!
BOSS	m	Keep it up you're going to be  sitting in my seat by year's end.  Really great, Cal. Seriously.
CAL	m	Who told you Tracy and I were  getting a divorce?
	?	Divorce! That's it. Amy heard  you crying in the bathroom. We  all thought it was cancer. Thank  God.
CAL	m	I have to go buy furniture now.  Cal stands, EXITS.
BOSS	m	Go for it!  (then, calling after)  It could have been cancer, buddy!
SALESMAN	m	Can I help you, sir?
CAL	m	My wife is sleeping with David  Jacobowitz. I need a couch.
SALESMAN	m	Ooh, I understand. Can I give you  a word of advice, one divorced man  to another? If you don't mind?
CAL	m	Sure.
SALESMAN	m	Get the matching chaise, killer  deal.  He pats the adjacent piece. Cal processes this.
CAL	m	I want it in beige.
SALESMAN	m	I'll write you up.
CAL	m	Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for  a friend.
GUY	m	You've been holding the seat for  an hour.
	?	Yeah, well, my wife is screwing  David Jacobowitz so eat me.  The guy shrugs, walks away. Cal looks at his watch, puts  a napkin on his drink, and stands.
CAL	m	Can't help but notice that you're  always surrounded by women.  Multiple women.  Jacob doesn't even turn.
CAL	m	I'm getting divorced. Or, in the  process. Gonna be single again.  Nothing.
CAL	m	Any advice?
JACOB	m	Yeah.
JACOB	m	Don't start conversations with  people while they're pissing.  He walks away, washes his hands, EXITS. A beat, then:
	?	So gay.
BERNIE	m	Sorry I'm late, I had to pick  something up from Macy's.
CAL	m	Don't worry about it, here, sit,  I've been guarding this stool with  my life.  Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable.
CAL	m	It's good to see you, man. I've  called you a few times. It's been  a rough couple of days, obviously.  Nothing I could use more than my  old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey,  we should play racquetball, when's  the last time we played  racquetball?
BERNIE	m	Claire won't let me be friends  with you anymore.  Cal takes this in.
CAL	m	I'm sorry, what?
BERNIE	m	She said we had to choose between  you and Tracy. I chose you. She  said no.
BERNIE	m	It's cologne.
CAL	m	Are you breaking up with me?
BERNIE	m	Claire's waiting in the car.  Um... there's a gift receipt in  there. Sorry.  Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder,  lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS.  Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender.
CAL	m	Do you have anything with a worm  in it? Because I'd like a gallon  of that now.
ON JACOB	m	Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get  dumped this whole time.  He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting, untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair. Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something  to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods,  gets up and walks away.
CAL	m	This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite things. A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob. Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob makes is practiced, perfectly cool.
JACOB	m	Jacob Palmer.
JACOB	m	I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.
CAL	m	I already have a drink.
JACOB	m	Let me buy you a drink, Cal.
CAL	m	Okay. Jacob motions to the Bartender who NODS. Cal SITS.
CAL	m	My wife is cheating on me with --
JACOB	m	David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you  batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story. Cal takes this in. He STANDS.
CAL	m	You know what, I don't need this
JACOB	m	Sit down, Cal.
CAL	m	Okay. Cal sits. Jacob's that powerful. Cal's that drunk.
JACOB	m	Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you understand? Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues:
JACOB	m	As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say,  without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal.  Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw.
JACOB	m	You asked me for advice before,  Cal, so I'm going to help you. I  don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it?  Cal shakes "no."
JACOB	m	Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say? Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.
CAL	m	Yeah, okay.
JACOB	m	Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock.
CAL	m	I'm sorry, what? Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby).
JACOB	m	You ready to go?  She nods, subservient, and follows him out. Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.
HIS BACKYARD	m	A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can  tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball  equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son  catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house.  You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this  backyard. You like this family a lot from seeing this  backyard.
TRACY	f	I just wanted to say that...  Her voice cracks. She turns away.
TRACY	f	Shit.  She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells  him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops  himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and  complicated about the reality of it all.  Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to  lighten things.
TRACY	f	Do you want me to back that thing  out of the driveway for you?
CAL	m	I'll be fine.
TRACY	f	You have trouble in reverse is  all.
CAL	m	It was two times --
TRACY	f	Three if you count my father's  foot.
CAL	m	I did that on purpose.
TRACY	f	I knew it.  They smile, in rhythm for a moment. Then they realize,  stop smiling. Cal turns awkwardly.
CAL	m	Once I'm settled, I'll get the  kids so they can see the place.  He walks to the truck. Tracy's voice stops him.
TRACY	f	I think I'm have a mid-life crisis  maybe. Can women have mid-life  crisis?
	?	Make sure the lawn gets enough  water.
TRACY	f	In the movies it's always men  having them and buying ridiculous  yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man  and I really don't want a yellow
CAL	m	You have to fertilize once a  month. Not twice a month, not  once every two months.  She takes a deep breath, finding her balance.
TRACY	f	We got married so young, Cal. And  I'm forty-one. And that's so much  older than I thought I'd be.
CAL	m	The sprinklers turn off behind  you.
TRACY	f	And I got really upset with an  umpire at Molly's t-ball game last  month -- like really upset, like I  screamed at him and wished he  would die -- and I started feeling  like the person I promised I  wouldn't turn into, you know?
CAL	m	If it rains a lot, you need to  shut off the automatic setting.
TRACY	f	And we haven't been us, not for a  long time. And I don't know when  you and I stopped being `us'  but... I mean, do you?  Cal finally turns and looks at her.
CAL	m	I think it was when you screwed  David Jacobowitz.  Ouch. Tracy's face registers the blow, but she nods:  she also understands it.
CAL	m	Make sure my azaleas get enough  sun.  Cal turns, gets in the U-HAUL, and backs out...  And immediately crashes into the neighboring FENCE.
CAL	m	Okay, well, this is it. What do you think? Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but... They look around his depressing, beige apartment. A  pathetic TV plays the Disney Channel in the corner.
CAL	m	There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want! Anytime!
ROBBIE	m	So... you're like, actually going  to live here? Molly looks like she's going to cry.
CAL	m	Hey, hey. Come on now, you'll visit all the time. Every weekend. It won't be that bad.
MOLLY	f	Don't you love us anymore? Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up.
CAL	m	Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I... it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned.
CAL	m	But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron--
MOLLY	f	TROY!
ROBBIE	m	Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her. Cal NODS.
ROBBIE	m	You okay?
CAL	m	You? Robbie shrugs.
ROBBIE	m	Can I say something with a curse? One time?
CAL	m	Yeah. Why not? Robbie NODS, takes a deep breath.
ROBBIE	m	Love is fucked.  Cal LAUGHS, a bit of tension relieved.
CAL	m	Is that so? You in love, buddy?
ROBBIE	m	Well, if you must know --
ROBBIE	m	What is she doing here?
CAL	m	Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for
CAL	m	(back to Robbie) I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking --
ROBBIE	m	What?
CAL	m	Huh?
JESSICA	f	The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver.
CAL	m	Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you. Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few.
ROBBIE	m	But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that!
CAL	m	I know, buddy. Cal musses Robbie's hair.
CAL	m	My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it? Uch. Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying.
CAL	m	Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy?  No response, she's glued to the television.
ROBBIE	m	Wait, where are you going?
CAL	m	I'm, uh... I decided to take a class.
JESSICA	f	That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a  difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before... Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder. It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off.
CAL	m	Okay, well... Molly, last chance!?  But Molly is still locked on Efron.
CAL	m	That's my angel. Back in a few.
ROBBIE	m	But, Dad --
CAL	m	Nope. The door slams. Robbie stands there with Jessica, awkward. Tries to maintain some semblance of cool.
ROBBIE	m	I don't need a baby-sitter.
JESSICA	f	I know, Robbie. An awkward beat, then.
ROBBIE	m	I love you so much --
JESSICA	f	Jesus Christ.
CAL	m	What am I doing?
CAL	m	What the hell am I doing? He walks past a CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Inside is...  Hannah (girl from the bar who Jacob tried picking up).
RICHARD	m	I think you're wrong. I think that's Tucker.
WHITE MAN	m	No, no, no. Chris Rock is the stand-up comedian. Chris Tucker is the actor.
WHITE WOMAN	f	Is it racist that I can't tell them apart? Liz nods her head "yes" at Hannah. Hannah stifles a LAUGH. Liz stands.
LIZ	f	Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party. The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in  time. Before I go, a toast. She holds up her glass, toasting.
LIZ	f	Sweetie: go into your hole and  study your cute little ass off for that bar exam. We'll see you when you emerge.
RICHARD	m	She's gonna kick that bar's butt! All the dorks CHEER. Liz SHRUGS.
LIZ	f	Yeah, okay.
HANNAH	f	I'll walk you out. Before they clear...
RICHARD	m	Hey, Liz? When my girl passes, we're gonna have another little celebration, right here. Hope you can make it. It's going to be a special night.
LIZ	f	Richard, you just give me a heads- up so I can get really drunk before-hand, okay?
RICHARD	m	You know it! Hannah leads Liz out of the restaurant, WHISPERS:
HANNAH	f	Did you hear that? `It's going to be a special night.' You think he's going to propose?
LIZ	f	At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh God, I hope not. Why? Do you really want him to? Hannah SHRUGS.
HANNAH	f	He's nice.
LIZ	f	Yeah, well... Jesus. Really?  (with a shrug) Okay. Not my life, I love you, call me if you need anything.  Liz KISSES her goodbye, EXITS. Hannah looks at her  table. Everyone is typing on their BLACKBERRIES.  She SIGHS, heads to rejoin them.
JACOB	m	You're late. (then, offering) Sbarro's?
CAL	m	No thanks. So what exactly are
JACOB	m	How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?
CAL	m	I dunno. Five hundred?
JACOB	m	Three thousand.
CAL	m	Okay.
JACOB	m	We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing. Cal holds up his foot.
JACOB	m	Take them off. Cal bends down, takes one off.
JACOB	m	Other one too, please? Cal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes. Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing.
CAL	m	What the hell!?
JACOB	m	Are you in a fraternity, Cal?
CAL	m	Those were my favorite shoes.
JACOB	m	ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!?
CAL	m	No.
JACOB	m	Are you Steve Jobs?
CAL	m	What?
JACOB	m	ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF
CAL	m	No. I'm not Steve Jobs.
JACOB	m	Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go.
CAL	m	I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea. Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES.
JACOB	m	Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items.
CAL	m	Ha! I think I read that in GQ.
JACOB	m	You did. I wrote it.
CAL	m	Really? Jacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes.
JACOB	m	Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers.
CAL	m	I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ? Jacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away.
JACOB	m	Your credit card please?
JACOB	m	Take it in there... and there.
CAL	m	These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap? He looks up. Jacob is gone.
CAL	m	I'm sorry! Don't leave!
JACOB	m	No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap.
CAL	m	What's wrong with the Gap?
JACOB	m	In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal.
CAL	m	I'm very warm.
JACOB	m	You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning.
CAL	m	What does it do?
JACOB	m	It gives you x-ray vision, Cal. It tightens things up. The skin around your eyes looks like Milton Berle's ballsack. Cal stops, examines his eyes in a mirror.
CAL	m	Oh my God, it does.
CAL	m	I like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top.
JACOB	m	Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor  cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about... He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.
CAL	m	Eww.
JACOB	m	... inch off the top.
TIFFANY	f	Yes, sir.
BUT --	m	Tiffany starts chopping.
JACOB	m	What are you putting on?
JACOB	m	Perfect. (then, to Tiffany) You smell great by the way.
TIFFANY	f	Thanks.
JACOB	m	What are you doing tonight?
TIFFANY	f	I don't know.
JACOB	m	That's okay, I do. She GIGGLES. Cal calls out.
JACOB	m	Yes, Cal, just like that.
JACOB TIFFANY	m	Yes. Yes. Okay, I feel kind of stupid but... The DRESSING ROOM DOOR opens. We TILT UP... FROM expensive shoes, TO pants, TO fitted sweater over a fitted shirt and bright tie. The new haircut... A new man. He looks... unbelievable.
TIFFANY	f	Wow.
JACOB	m	Yep.
CAL	m	Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.
JACOB	m	Shut up, Cal. You'd fuck him, right?
CAL	m	Jesus!
TIFFANY	f	Yeah, probably.
CAL	m	Tiffany! (then, realizing) You would!? Tiffany SHRUGS.
JACOB	m	You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link. Cal takes this in.
CAL	m	Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me.
JACOB	m	No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover. Cal's lower lip begins to quiver.
CAL	m	Yeah, okay, that was meaner.
CAL	m	I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right?
JACOB	m	No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be  calling women over to our table shortly. Cal rubs his hands together, nervous.
CAL	m	We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are --
JACOB	m	Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing  I need to know: how many women have you been with?
CAL	m	Sexually?
JACOB	m	Yes.
CAL	m	In my entire life?
JACOB	m	No, synchronized swimming. Yes,  Cal. Sexually.  Cal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on one hand.
CAL	m	One. Jacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly.
JACOB	m	Wow, okay... wow. (then, checking)  Not at a time? Total?
CAL	m	What? I married young. We met in high school. He smiles, remembering.
CAL	m	Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it. Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it --
JACOB	m	Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.
CAL	m	(a bit emotional) I miss my wife.
JACOB	m	Shut up, Cal. A YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Hi.
JACOB	m	Hi. Jacob Palmer.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Amy Johnson. Cal extends his hand.
JACOB	m	Don't. He pulls it back.
CAL	m	-- Weaver.
JACOB	m	Can I get you a drink, Amy?
JACOB	m	Tell me about yourself. What do you do?
NEW GIRL	f	Does it really matter?
JACOB	m	It does to me. She looks up. He looks completely earnest, repeats:
JACOB	m	It does to me. She smiles. PAN TO CAL: just sitting there watching, horrified.
NEWER GIRL	f	And that's when I started writing the column for LA Weekly. God,  how long have I been talking? Jacob takes her hand.
JACOB	m	Listen, I'm going to be honest: it's getting late and I think you're interesting. I also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once.
ON CAL	m	Mouth agape. That was his line!
JACOB	m	Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just... I think we should get out of here. She thinks, then NODS.
NEWER GIRL	f	Okay.
JACOB	m	I think we should get out of here.
NEW GIRL	f	Okay.
JACOB	m	I think we should get out of here.
FIRST GIRL	f	Okay.
ROBBIE	m	You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to  read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	You have a second?
TRACY	f	Oh, David. I'm just a little  swamped right now so...  He closes the door behind him.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	You've been avoiding me.
TRACY	f	No, I haven't.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	You ran away in the other  direction when you saw me coming  down the hall yesterday.
	?	You're very fast by the way.  She SIGHS, gives up.
TRACY	f	I ran track in high school.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	That must be it.  He turns serious.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	I'm sorry about you and Cal.
TRACY	f	Thank you.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	I'm also not sorry, if I'm being  completely honest.
	?	I want to make sure you know how  much I like you.
TRACY	f	No, I do --
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	A lot. Just to clarify. I like  you a lot. I had no intention of  falling for a married woman. I  just wanted someone to go to lunch  with who didn't make me want to  shoot myself in the face. But we  started having lunch, and talking,  and suddenly I was an accountant  who was popping out of bed in the  morning, excited to get to work.  That doesn't happen to  accountants. Ever. I've checked  with other accountants.  She smiles.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	So when the time is right for you  to get back out there again,  officially, I just... I'd like to  throw my hat in the ring.  Officially. That sounded weird.  Tracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward.
TRACY	f	David, you've been a great friend  to me. And you were the first man  in a very long time to make me  feel... noticed, I guess? What  happened between us that night...  it meant something to me. You  weren't the only one excited to  come to work lately.  David smiles.
TRACY	f	But now, when I see you, all I see  is his face. All I see when I  look at you is what I did to my  marriage.  She's losing it, wipes her eyes.
TRACY	f	You see this? I'm saving you from  disaster, David, `cause you're  asking to pre-board the Titanic.  Honestly, do you really want any  part of this?  Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone.
	?	Right, okay. No, I understand.  Of course, right away.  She HANGS UP, looks at the Post-It. It reads, simply:  "Yes." Tracy looks up, but David is gone.
TRACY	f	(calling back in) Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again. She closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie.
TRACY	f	Seriously?
ROBBIE	m	Sorry. She SIGHS.
TRACY	f	It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work. They walk out together.
TRACY	f	They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh? Robbie NODS.
TRACY	f	You'd really think someone would have written something better by now. Robbie LAUGHS, the tension broken a bit.
TRACY	f	Guess I should take it down, huh?
ROBBIE	m	I guess.
TRACY	f	How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but... how is he, really? Robbie hesitates.
TRACY	f	Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here. She turns back to her work. After a beat:
ROBBIE	m	He's dressing a lot better. Going out a lot.
TRACY	f	Oh. Well, good. That's... really good. (then, covering) We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay? Think about what you're in the mood for. Robbie hesitates, then adds:
ROBBIE	m	He's sad. He looks better, but... sadder, too, I think. You know?
TRACY	f	Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, too.
ROBBIE	m	I know.
TRACY	f	You do?
ROBBIE	m	I heard you crying the other night  and... I didn't know what to do.  I'm thirteen years old and... can  you just tell me what I'm supposed  to do in that situation? I didn't  want to Google it.  She smiles, shakes her head.
TRACY	f	Oh God, baby, you're so much like  me it's scary. You wound up with  all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so  sorry.
ROBBIE	m	I'm okay with being like you, Mom.  I like you.  She puts down her pen. Smiles sadly at Robbie.
TRACY	f	It's my fault, what happened with  your father. It's grown-up stuff  that I can't talk about but... it's my fault. Not his. So just... be good to him, okay?
ROBBIE	m	It'll be okay, Mom.
TRACY	f	You promise? He NODS, the most soulful thirteen-year-old ever.
TRACY	f	David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David. We work together. Robbie takes him in, shakes his hand.
TRACY	f	I'll be right back, okay, honey?
ROBBIE DAVID	m	Okay. Okay. Awkward. Really awkward. Tracy starts to say something, thinks better of it, and EXITS. David moves into the room, sits down opposite Robbie.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	So, Robbie... I hear you're quite the soccer player.
ROBBIE	m	So, David... I hear you broke up my parents' marriage. He LAUGHS awkwardly, shocked.
ROBBIE	m	You are David Jacobowitz, right? From accounting?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	Um, yes I am --
ROBBIE	m	Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's better than you, in every category except probably  math. And she still loves him.  Robbie props the PHOTO of Tracy and Cal back up.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	Listen, Robbie --
ROBBIE	m	Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now,  but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that. Tracy RE-ENTERS.
TRACY	f	You ready to go?
	?	Mommy, can we do Chinese for  dinner tonight?
ON CAL	m	Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back  in order. As he takes it all in...  A LIGHT pops on.  Cal DIVES into a SHRUB.
JACOB	m	I think you're ready, Cal.
CAL	m	For what?
JACOB	m	To talk to a woman, take a woman home.
CAL	m	Oh, no. No, I'm not.
JACOB	m	You've been watching me do it for two weeks.
CAL	m	Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball.
JACOB	m	Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the  kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually  building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?
CAL	m	Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone? Jacob stretches his neck, trying his patience:
JACOB	m	Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down?
CAL	m	You ask if you can buy her a drink.
JACOB	m	And what if she says no?
CAL	m	You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there.
JACOB	m	When she asks me a question about myself?
CAL	m	You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about yourself.
JACOB	m	And what happens?
CAL	m	They talk about themselves. A lot.
JACOB	m	And what do I do?
CAL	m	You act really interested. You nod a lot.
JACOB	m	And at the end of the night?
CAL	m	You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place.
JACOB	m	Do I ask?
CAL	m	No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place. Holy shit! You Mr. Miagi'd me! Jacob BOWS to Cal, Japanese style. A PRETTY WOMAN stands near their table. Jacob stands, smiles.
JACOB	m	Oh, and no talking about your job,  your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go...
CAL	m	What, no, I'm not ready for -- (then, to woman) Hi! Jacob has pulled her over. She's attractive, mid-  thirties.
JACOB	m	Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal. Jacob NODS at Cal ("you've got this") and leaves them.  Kate SITS. Cal smiles at Kate, nervous. She smiles back. Cal MOTIONS for a waitress in the distance.
CAL	m	Can I buy you a drink, Kate?
CAL	m	I'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want.
KATE	f	Really, thank you but it's okay.
CAL	m	I'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am I right? Yeah? A nice dirty martini? No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime? C'mon,  one drink! Picture those ice cubes clinking together. Mmmm. Can't you taste it? She smiles.
KATE	f	Yes, I can but... I'm, uh, five years sober so... Cal's face drops. The WAITRESS approaches.
WAITRESS	?	What can I get --
CAL	m	Nothing. We don't want anything. Don't come back here ever. The Waitress leaves, confused. Kate looks around, uncomfortable. She tries small-talk.
KATE	f	So... what do you do, Cal?
CAL	m	What do you do, Kate?
KATE	f	I asked you first.
CAL	m	I asked you second. She LAUGHS lightly, thinks he's being funny.
KATE	f	Seriously, what do you do?
CAL	m	Seriously, what do you do? Now it's getting a little weird.
KATE	f	I'm a teacher. Now, c'mon: what do you do? Cal NODS, exaggerated.
CAL	m	Teacher. Interesting. I'm very interested in teaching.
KATE	f	I'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do? He's still nodding, as if fascinated.
CAL	m	A teacher with an alcohol dependency no less, I bet that's actually more common than people realize...
KATE	f	I should get back to my friends --  Kate STANDS. Cal puts his face in his hands.
CAL	m	I'm sorry! I'm supposed to deflect your questions... oh screw it: I'm in corporate insurance. And I have children. Plural. More than one. The only thing I have ONE of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman I recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed to tell you about either.
KATE	f	What were you supposed to tell me?
CAL	m	I don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute -- it was something I said about my wife that's since been corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy.
KATE	f	You think I'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute? Cal looks up.
CAL	m	That's what you took away from that? She smiles, sits back down.
KATE	f	Wow, an actual honest man. I don't know what to do with that. It's kind of... rare around here. It's nice, actually.
CAL	m	It is?
KATE	f	You have no idea. I'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs. They charm me, and I fall for it, and at some point they just... never call me again.
CAL	m	I don't understand. Look at you. Who wouldn't call you again? She looks up. It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment. She smiles warmly. Holy shit, Cal is in!
KATE	f	So... what were you `supposed' to do next?
CAL	m	Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here. Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me.
KATE	f	Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? Cal looks up, surprised. He clears his throat, then:
CAL	m	You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me.
KATE	f	Ask me again. Cal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident.
CAL	m	I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me. Kate looks up, genuinely turned-on. CUE MUSIC: "SEXYBACK" by Justin Timberlake.
CAL	m	(gasping for breath) This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife.
	?	I love that you're being so honest. It's so different, so hot.
CAL	m	I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.
KATE	f	More, tell me more.
CAL	m	I'm worried you have AIDS. She stops.
CAL	m	Only a little. She pushes him down on the couch, takes her sweater off. She's wearing just a bra. She looks amazing.
KATE	f	What do you want to do with me?
CAL	m	Show you off to my wife to make her jealous. She GROWLS and dives on top of him as we launch:
MEANWHILE --	m	1) HANNAH studies late into the night for the bar. 2) JESSICA reads magazine articles on "How to Make Him Notice You." 3) TRACY eats ice cream in bed, alone. 4) ROBBIE drags mysterious wood planks into his backyard. But we're mainly with CAL...
JACOB	m	... it would work!
CAL	m	You're out of your mind.
JACOB	m	What do college guys hate? Doing  laundry. What do they love?  Strippers. It's a strip club  where they can do their laundry.
CAL	m	It's ridiculous.
JACOB	m	And yours isn't? A candy store  that only sells red candy.
CAL	m	Everyone loves the cherry. Look,  I'm not rejecting the psuedo-  cherry flavors like raspberry or  strawberry, anything in the -erry  family is allowed. But let's be  real here: no one wants the  lemon. No one likes the grape.
JACOB	m	I like grape.
CAL	m	Well then you can't come to my  store.
CLAIRE	f	Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon.
BERNIE	m	For God's sake, Claire.
CLAIRE	f	It's about Cal.
BERNIE	m	Leave the poor bastard alone, would you? I gave him the cologne  like you told me to. We don't  have to dance on his grave.
CLAIRE	f	Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become quite a man-about-town if you get my drift.
JESSICA	f	What?
CLAIRE	f	Lots of young women coming in and  out of his apartment lately.
BERNIE	m	Claire, would you cut it out?
CLAIRE	f	It's good for Jess to know. She still baby-sits for him after all.
BERNIE	m	Oh, c'mon! Enough.
CLAIRE	f	Well, it's good gossip at the least. Ooh, guess what else I heard... As she CONTINUES CHATTERING in the b.g., we HOLD ON Jessica. Thinking.
JESSICA	f	Madison! Madison, wait! Madison stops walking, but not texting.
JESSICA	f	Hey, I had a question -- Madison holds up a finger ("one second") and continues texting. Finally, she stops. Looks up. Smiles.
MADISON	f	Hey, Jessica, whassup?
JESSICA	f	I had a question for you, Madison. It's kind of on the personal side so...
MADISON	f	My lips are... Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making WEIRD NOISES. Jessica stares at her blankly.
MADISON	f	Seals. My lips are seals.
JESSICA	f	Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the thing... I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right?
MADISON	f	Always.
JESSICA	f	Lots of college guys, I've heard.
MADISON	f	Lots of them.
JESSICA	f	Even rumors about a few teachers.
MADISON	f	Totally.
JESSICA	f	So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as... well, a kid in high school?
MADISON	f	Oh, well first off, I have a huge  rack.
JESSICA	f	You do, yes.
MADISON	f	So that helps.
JESSICA	f	Yes, I'm sure it does.
MADISON	f	You don't have a huge rack.
JESSICA	f	No, I don't unfortunately.
MADISON	f	So that's not gonna work.
JESSICA	f	Nope. Madison SIGHS.
MADISON	f	Okay, here's what you do. Wait, how old is he?
JESSICA	f	Old.
MADISON	f	Like really old?
JESSICA	f	Like parent old.
MADISON	f	Nasty. Rock on, Jessica.
JESSICA	f	Thank you, Madison.
MADISON	f	Alright, you have to hook him. Force his hand. Make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong.
JESSICA	f	How?
MADISON	f	Do what I do. Send him a postcard  from downtown.
JESSICA	f	Huh?
MADISON	f	Go TMZ on his ass.
JESSICA	f	I'm not following you, Madis--
MADISON	f	The full gyno.  Off Jessica's blank look.
MADISON	f	A crotch shot? A nip slip?
	?	A dirty picture! You can even  Annie Leibowitz it. Tasteful but  with nipple. Yeah, that's what  you should do: make it artistic.  Black and white. Make this face.  She makes a raw sexual face.
JESSICA	f	Jesus, Madison!
MADISON	f	Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice. You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. Madison walks off, calls back.
MADISON	f	Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And  then your brother sees it, tells  your mom, and suddenly you're not  allowed to use Facebook for a  month. Thanks, Kevin!  She leaves Jessica there, processing the advice.
ROBBIE	m	There she is!
ON JESSICA	m	Oh shit.
ROBBIE	m	Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.' Robbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers.
ROBBIE	m	I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the  one! I know it to be true, and so  now do the multitude.
	?	Multitudes? (then, deciding) No, multitude.
JESSICA	f	Robbie, get down!
ROBBIE	m	I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me.
JESSICA	f	Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET
JESSICA	f	What the hell are you thinking?
ROBBIE	m	You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build it. Oh, those are my friends, they helped me wheel it down. Wave hello.
JESSICA	f	This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously.
ROBBIE	m	You'll learn to love me. I promise.
JESSICA	f	I won't.
ROBBIE	m	Just because I'm four years younger than you?
JESSICA	f	BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!!
JESSICA	f	I've been spending time with him for a while. Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual.
ROBBIE	m	No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal last
JESSICA	f	He's older. I don't want my parents to know. And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen.
ROBBIE	m	Who is he?
JESSICA	f	It doesn't matter.
ROBBIE	m	Do I know him? Is he from town?
JESSICA	f	I don't know. Yes, kind of.
ROBBIE	m	I'll kill him if he hurts you. Jessica tries not to smile.
JESSICA	f	I know. But this all has to stop now, Robbie. The speeches, the texts, all of it. It's very sweet, but it has to stop. He just sits there, lost.
JESSICA	f	I'll see you around, okay? She EXITS. Robbie remains seated on the grass. Devastated. His three friends approach.
ROBBIE'S FRIEND	m	We should probably get the scaffold back on the road before dark.
ROBBIE	m	Yeah.
CAL	m	Hey, Nanna! I know, it's been forever. Have you been getting out at all? I'll bring you some of that deli you like one night, okay? The kids? They're fine. (to other room) Kids, say hi to Nanna.
CAL	m	Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made  a new buddy, I've been spending time with him. Yeah, I'm going to  see her tomorrow night. Of course  I miss her. You don't know how much I miss...
ROBBIE	m	So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh? At my parent-teacher thing?
CAL	m	Yeah.
ROBBIE	m	First time in a while.
CAL	m	Yeah, but no biggie. Cal tosses him back the ball.
CAL	m	Hey, what's with the moping?
ROBBIE	m	Nothing. It's just... there's  this girl. Cal smiles.
CAL	m	Oh yeah? You like her?
ROBBIE	m	I like Pringles. This girl's my  soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid,  in love with her. And she wants  someone else.
CAL	m	But she's your soulmate?
ROBBIE	m	Yeah.
CAL	m	Well you can't just give up.
ROBBIE	m	Why not? (then, quietly) You did. Cal freezes.
ROBBIE	m	Mom was yours, right?
CAL	m	I didn't give up.
ROBBIE	m	Listen, Dad. I love you. I have your back, always. But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car.
CAL	m	It was slightly more complicated than that. And I'm a different guy now.
ROBBIE	m	You're the same guy. You just have different clothes. Do you  still love her?
CAL	m	How old ARE you?
ROBBIE	m	Do you still love Mom? Cal doesn't say anything. His silence speaks volumes.
CAL	m	Weren't we talking about you?
ROBBIE	m	We are. Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration. So set an example for your boy.  Don't give up. It's complicated? Uncomplicate it. She says no? Change her mind. Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad. Get her back. Get back my mom.
TRACY	f	You look great, Cal.
CAL	m	Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so...
TRACY	f	Well you look great. Really. Cal smiles.
CAL	m	Thank you. You always look great, so... Awkward. Neither knows what to say now. Tracy takes the  seat next to him.
CAL	m	I talked to Nanna yesterday.
TRACY	f	Me, too. She sound okay to you?
CAL	m	She sounded like... Nanna. She  worries about us.
CAL	m	I feel like I'm about to get detention. Tracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit.
CAL	m	Which teacher is this?
TRACY	f	Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on. Cal smiles.
CAL	m	He's a really weird kid, isn't he?
TRACY	f	Yeah. I kind of like him, though.
CAL	m	I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital.
TRACY	f	Me, too. They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away. An awkward beat, then:
CAL	m	So, how are things with... (a beat, then) How's it going with David?  She looks down.
TRACY	f	Oh... it's not.
	?	It wasn't about him, if that means  anything.
CAL	m	No, I know.
TRACY	f	You seeing anyone?
CAL	m	Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really.
TRACY	f	Oh. Because you hear things, you know.
CAL	m	Yeah, well... Another long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy.
CAL	m	I miss you, T. Tracy looks up surprised.
CAL	m	I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high  school... you've got the game  sewed up in the first quarter, you know? She smiles.
CAL	m	I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer.
TRACY	f	I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. He smiles, emboldened.
CAL	m	All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess... I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense?
CAL	m	I shouldn't have jumped out of the car. I should have fought for you. You fight for your soulmate. At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me. Tracy's eyes well up with tears.
TRACY	f	He's a very strange boy, isn't he?
CAL	m	I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me. She LAUGHS through her tears.
TRACY	f	I missed you, too. Cal takes her hand, kisses it.
AT DOORWAY	m	It's Robbie's English teacher, Mrs. Thompson... better known to us as: KATE (the teacher from the bar who Cal slept with). Cal freezes, his lips on Tracy's hand.
CAL	m	Oh God.
KATE	f	Cal? What are you doing here?
CAL	m	(looking to the sky) Really?
TRACY	f	You two know each other?
CAL	m	Um, yes... we've met before.
KATE	f	We've met before? Seriously?
CAL	m	Mrs. Thompson? This is my wife. Tracy.
KATE	f	Oh, so now she's your WIFE again?
CAL	m	Why don't we head inside?
KATE	f	YES, WHY DON'T WE!?
TRACY	f	I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other?
KATE	f	Maybe your husband should tell you. Cal hesitates.
CAL	m	We have a mutual friend.
KATE	f	Ha!
CAL	m	You know, maybe we should focus on Robbie?
KATE	f	Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie. Kate goes to her blackboard.
KATE	f	As you know, Robbie's shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade English class. She writes on the board: ASSHOLE. She underlines it.
KATE	f	Asshole. Are you familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver?
CAL	m	She's heard it, yes. So in terms of Robbie's progress --
KATE	f	Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never does.
CAL	m	We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book
KATE	f	Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them.
CAL	m	Because usually he's a very strong public speaker --
KATE	f	Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous' --
CAL	m	OKAY! ENOUGH!!!
CAL	m	I can explain. Tracy rushes out of the room. Cal calls after her.
CAL	m	She's an alcoholic! You can't trust what she says!
CAL	m	Tracy, wait!
TRACY	f	Leave me alone, Cal!
KATE	f	I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you
ON SPECTATORS	m	TEACHERS and PARENTS (including Jessica's parents), stepping out into the hallway and following them outside.
CAL	m	Tracy, c'mon! We were separated.
TRACY	f	(fumbling for keys) I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you.
CAL	m	Okay, so --
TRACY	f	I can't do this now, Cal.
CAL	m	Tracy, I love you.
KATE	f	Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute,
CAL	m	It's a funny story, actually --
TRACY	f	I'm going home. She opens the car door.
CAL	m	Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher! GASPS from the crowd. Claire (Jessica's Mom) takes a picture with her cell phone.
CAL	m	But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!
CAL	m	Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're
CAL	m	... the only woman I want to be with.
TRACY	f	I don't even know who you are. Tracy gets in her car and speeds off.
CAL	m	(weakly, to himself) I'm your soulmate. Cal turns around to the crowd, only to be met...  By a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate. She STORMS OFF.
CAL	m	HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK
CAL	m	REALLY!!!???
RICHARD	m	Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!? The room goes quiet.
RICHARD	m	Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here... I forget what she looks like, anyone remember?  POLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink, and walks over to Richard. Is this it?
RICHARD	m	I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course... More CHEESY LAUGHTER.
RICHARD	m	Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie... More HECKLING from the crowd. Liz desperately orders another drink, barely able to take it.
RICHARD	m	So, Hannah, I'd like to formally ask you, in front of all our friends and colleagues...
RICHARD	m	... if you'd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt!? CHEERS. Hannah steps back, breathless. Richard reacts.
RICHARD	m	You don't have a better offer already, do you? Everyone LAUGHS.
HANNAH	f	No, that's great. I just... (then, privately) I'm sorry, I thought... I thought you were about to propose. The room goes quiet, trying to hear.
RICHARD	m	What?
HANNAH	f	No, I just... it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all. Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.
RICHARD	m	Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize.
HANNAH	f	No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
RICHARD	m	It's definitely a possibility, down the road. I think I just need a little more time. I'm still figuring out how I feel about us, you know: long-term.
HANNAH	f	No, I know... Wait -- you're figuring out how you feel about us? She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited.
RICHARD	m	Honey? She's really laughing now.
HANNAH	f	You know what the best part is: I would have said yes! To YOU! And I didn't even want you to propose! Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose. And I still would have said YES! That's how pathetic I am! She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT. She grabs Richard's cheeks.
HANNAH	f	I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard. Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes, Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five.
WOMAN	f	And you know what she said?
ON JACOB	m	Standing there, in all his glory. He flashes his coolest smile. They melt. We've seen this before. SLAM! The door to the bar busts open, revealing:
HANNAH	f	Do you remember me?
JACOB	m	Yes.
HANNAH	f	Do you still think I'm attractive?
JACOB	m	Yes.
HANNAH	f	Do you still want to take me home?
JACOB	m	Yes. Hannah NODS, takes his hand.
HANNAH	f	Let's go. She leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to.
WOMAN #1	f	Slut.
HANNAH	f	This place looks like something out of a men's magazine.
JACOB	m	Is that a compliment?
HANNAH	f	I'm not sure. Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones.
HANNAH	f	I like this song.
JACOB	m	I thought you would. Drink?
HANNAH	f	Yes, please. Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings them (and the bottle) over towards the couch. He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down.
JACOB	m	Cheers.
HANNAH	f	Cheers. They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She  holds out her glass for a refill. Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes choking...
HANNAH	f	So is this how it normally works?
JACOB	m	What?
HANNAH	f	How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink?
JACOB	m	Yes. That's how it normally works. Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.
HANNAH	f	And then you sleep with them?
JACOB	m	Yes.
HANNAH	f	So that's what happens next? We sleep together?
JACOB	m	At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. She takes a deep breath, admits:
HANNAH	f	I'm very nervous.
JACOB	m	I'm getting that.
HANNAH	f	I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS.
JACOB	m	You're adorable. Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.
HANNAH	f	No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here! I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me.
JACOB	m	I don't think people say `bang' anymore.
HANNAH	f	I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up.
HANNAH	f	Okay, okay, this is happening. Take off your shirt.
JACOB	m	What?
HANNAH	f	I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped.
HANNAH	f	Holy crap. She pokes a finger at his abs.
HANNAH	f	It's like you're photo-shopped.
JACOB	m	Now take off yours.
HANNAH	f	No way! Not with all that happening... She motions casually at his abs.
HANNAH	f	So... do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom?
JACOB	m	In the bedroom is preferable. Hannah stands, a girl on a mission.
HANNAH	f	Good. Let's go there.
HANNAH	f	This pillow is amazing. It forms perfectly to the shape of my head.
JACOB	m	I'm glad you like it. They resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again.
HANNAH	f	Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone? Off his look...
HANNAH	f	They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course! She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself.
HANNAH	f	Sorry, let's proceed. Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again.
HANNAH	f	You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you?
JACOB	m	No.
HANNAH	f	Oh. My. God! You totally do!
JACOB	m	I do. She STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. It's infectious.
HANNAH	f	How much did it cost?
JACOB	m	Five thousand doll--  That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing with her... really laughing. We can tell: this is different for him. He likes her. We watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it. We watch him look at Hannah.
ON HANNAH	m	Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing. And then... Jacob does the most unexpected thing:
JACOB	m	Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself.
HANNAH	f	What? No! I don't want to know anything about you.
JACOB	m	C'mon, one question.
HANNAH	f	Okay, fine, but then we bang.
JACOB	m	Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past
HANNAH	f	What's your mom like?
JACOB	m	Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold.
HANNAH	f	And your father?
JACOB	m	He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have... He motions at his PILLOW.
JACOB	m	Stuff like this. She motions at his abs.
HANNAH	f	And time for stuff like that? He LAUGHS.
JACOB	m	My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually... We PULL BACK as they continue chatting. TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then another. Body language shifts. -- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on their sides, face-to-face, talking some more. -- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on the forehead, and begins falling in love with him. CUE MUSIC as we begin a...
JACOB	m	staring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's. He looks  terrified.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I  was wondering if --
TRACY	f	David, stop. Look, I had a nice  time, which is a substantial  upgrade from the rest of the...  times I've been having lately.  So, I don't think I'm ready to  start dating but my ex clearly is  and there's a yogurt shop where  they make this eight calorie ice  cream that tastes like a laxative,  so if you'd like to take me there  sometime I guess I wouldn't say  no.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	Wow. You know, that's exactly  what I was thinking. It's almost  uncanny.  They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry.  Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then...  THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there.
JESSICA	f	Hello.
TRACY	f	Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry.  Jessica, this is my work-friend.
TRACY	f	He's an accountant named David.  David, this is my baby-sitter,  Jessica. Okay, David, well  everything sounds great.  Spreadsheets.  David smiles knowingly.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	I'll see you at work.  He EXITS. Tracy stands there with Jessica, awkward.
JESSICA	f	So... How was dinner?
TRACY	f	It was just for work.
	?	It's a pretty dress.
TRACY	f	Oh, thanks.  Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly.
TRACY	f	So how much do I owe yo--
JESSICA	f	Did you know your kids are the  only ones I baby-sit for who  always want to stay awake so they  can see their dad when he gets  home. I mean, they fight with  everything they have to keep their  eyes open so they can hear what  Dad had for dinner, or how he  liked the movie. Lot of kids want  to stay awake for Mom -- and your  kids always want to see you, don't  get me wrong -- but not a lot wait  up for Dad. Maybe it's because  he's good, and he's kind, and he's  decent.
TRACY	f	What are you talking abo--
JESSICA	f	Batshit crazy.  She walks out the door. Tracy looks confused.
TRACY	f	Jessica?  Jessica turns, explodes?
JESSICA	f	I DON'T WANT YOUR SLUTTY MONEY!
TRACY	f	Jessica!  But she's gone. Tracy SIGHS ("what the hell was that")  and CLOSES the door.
ON ROBBIE	m	at top of the stairs, regarding the flowers.
ENVELOPE READING:	m	"Cal Weaver." With a heart. She stares at the envelope  for a beat.  Just then: HER DOORBELL RINGS.  Jessica jumps, started. She quickly puts the envelope in  a drawer and heads for the door.
CAL	m	Hello?
TRACY	f	Hi, Cal.  Silence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea.
TRACY	f	So... I'm in the basement. I'm  trying to get the water heater  working `cause the pilot's out and  I don't know how to relight it.  Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement.
TRACY	f	I'm sorry to bother you, I just...  what do I do?  Cal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates. Then:
CAL	m	It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad  you called. Here: I'll walk you  through it.
	?	Do you see the little grey door?
TRACY	f	Yeah.
CAL	m	Pull it down.  She pantomimes this in the kitchen.
TRACY	f	Okay, it's down.
CAL	m	Now, you see the red button? I  wrote `push' on it?
TRACY	f	I got it.
CAL	m	Push. Now turn that to the right  and stick the match in.
TRACY	f	Oh, there it goes!
CAL	m	Good. Now just close the door and  you're good to go.  Silence. The charade is over. Now what?
TRACY	f	Well, thanks, Cal. I...  appreciate your help.
CAL	m	No, anytime. Call anytime with  stuff like that.
	?	Talk to you later?
TRACY	f	Yeah. And... thanks again.  Cal HANGS up. He takes one final look back at his wife  as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him.
CAL	m	Nanna's coming over tonight. You guys haven't seen her in a while. Wanna stay for dinner?
ROBBIE	m	Sure.
CAL	m	Your mom's working till five,  we'll have to tell her. (off their silence)  What do you guys want to do today?
MOLLY	f	(not looking up) High School Musical.
CAL	m	Well, there's a shocker. She goes back into her trance.
ROBBIE	m	She still won't talk to you?
CAL	m	Not if that show's on.
ROBBIE	m	No, I mean, Mom.
CAL	m	Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off.
ROBBIE	m	What happened?
CAL	m	Beyond your pay-grade, buddy. Cal looks pained.
CAL	m	I will say this though: I got close. We were laughing. Talking about old times, all the things we used to do... His eyes drift to the TV. It's the timeless GOLF SCENE  from High School Musical II. A LIGHT BULB goes on.
	?	Hey. Get your coat. Robbie smiles, runs off. Cal turns to Molly, REMOTE in hand.
CAL	m	Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off the show.
MOLLY	f	No!
CAL	m	I have to --
MOLLY	f	NOOOO!
CAL	m	I'm turning it off --
MOLLY	f	NOOOOOOOOOOO!
MOLLY	f	(free at last) Thank you. Cal KISSES her, jumps up from the couch.
BERNIE	m	Oh, hey, Cal.
CAL	m	Bernie.
BERNIE	m	So how've you --
CAL	m	Bernie: I'd love to catch up, but  I'm doing something at the old  house tonight and I'm in a bit of  a rush so... yeah. Thanks again  for the cologne.  Cal takes off.
CAL	m	Hello?
JACOB	m	Hey, Cal.
CAL	m	Oh. My. God. It's alive.
JACOB	m	I'm sorry. I know I've been out  of circulation.
CAL	m	You abandoned me at my time of  need.
JACOB	m	I've been a little... things have  gotten a bit... I met a woman.
CAL	m	I bet you did.
JACOB	m	No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her. This woman. One woman.
CAL	m	Okay, whatever.
JACOB	m	Actually, tonight... I'm going to  meet her mother.
CAL	m	Whoa!!!! Look at you! You do realize you might actually have to answer a question or two about yourself?
JACOB	m	Yes, I realize that, asshole. Hannah comes out of the wine store, hops over the car. Jacob can't help but smile: wow, he's REALLY into her.
JACOB	m	Gotta go. Grab a beer next week?
CAL	m	You've got my number. Hey. Good for you, by the way.
JACOB	m	Thanks.  Cal HANGS up, LAUGHS to himself, and gets back to work.
JESSICA	f	No!!!! She jumps, but it's too late.
ON BERNIE	m	Staring at the picture. We don't see it, but we get the point: it's a father's worst nightmare. Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the envelope. He looks at the envelope again.
ON ENVELOPE	m	Cal's name. A heart.
JESSICA	f	Daddy? Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY.
ON JESSICA	m	Realizing. She grabs a second set of keys.
TRACY	f	Baby! What are you wearing!?
ROBBIE	m	Dad's here.  Tracy's face drops.
ROBBIE	m	I have to blindfold you.
TRACY	f	What is this? What is he doing?
ROBBIE	m	Relax, Mom. He's your husband, not Al Queda. You'll make it out alive. She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind. He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER!
ROBBIE	m	Okay, we're good, let's do this.
CAL	m	Hi, T.
TRACY	f	Can I take these off, please?
CAL	m	Almost. Kids?
	?	Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver  saw Tracy Boyle for the first  time, walking the halls of  Woodside Middle School --
TRACY	f	Cal: are you seriously doing this  in front of the kids?
	?	If it goes bad I'm supposed to  take Molly upstairs and put the TV  on loud.  Tracy SIGHS, giving up.
TRACY	f	Well, might as well wait for your  daughter.
CAL	m	She's right next to you, T.
TRACY	f	No, your other daughter.  Huh? Just then:
CAL	m	Nanna!
HANNAH	f	Hi, Daddy. WTF! And right behind her... JACOB. Holding a bottle of  wine and smiling like an idiot. Everyone freezes.
JACOB	m	Cal?
CAL	m	What the hell are you doing here?
JACOB	m	What the hell are you doing here?
HANNAH	f	Wait, you two know each other?
TRACY	f	Hi, Nanna.
CAL	m	Wait, what's going on?
ROBBIE	m	Hey, Nanna.
HANNAH	f	Hey, Robbie.
MOLLY	f	Hey, Nanna.
HANNAH	f	Hey, cutie.
JACOB	m	WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!?
HANNAH	f	It's me, I couldn't pronounce Hannah when I was little -- wait, so how do you know my dad?
JACOB	m	Oh, God.
CAL	m	I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING
HANNAH	f	Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob.
CAL	m	No. No. No. No.
TRACY	f	I want to see the boyfriend!
SCARVES)	?	Can someone please take this off?
JACOB	m	HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR-
CAL	m	I WAS SEVENTEEN! SHE WAS OUR
JACOB	m	WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT?
CAL	m	YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY
HANNAH	f	So you two, like, really know each other?
CAL	m	No way -- you and her... no way. End it, now.
HANNAH	f	Daddy!!!
JACOB	m	Well, that's not going to happen.
CAL	m	Well, then I'm going to murder you.
HANNAH	f	DAD!
TRACY	f	(down to two scarves) Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me!
CAL	m	Robbie, take the goddamn thing off your mother! (then, looking up)  Bernie?
JESSICA	f	Daddy, no!
ROBBIE	m	Is that Jessica? BAM! Bernie lands a solid right into Cal's jaw.
HANNAH	f	Daddy!
JESSICA	f	Daddy!
BLINDFOLD)	?	What's happening? Bernie is pummeling Cal.
BERNIE	m	I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU
HANNAH	f	Jacob!
CAL	m	Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
JESSICA	f	Daddy, stop! This breaks Bernie's trance. He hesitates.
JESSICA	f	He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know.
ROBBIE	m	Know what?
CAL	m	Know what?
TRACY	f	Robbie, please get this off me!
ROBBIE	m	(struggling with it) I'm TRYING!
JESSICA	f	He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him! Robbie stops, turns.
ROBBIE	m	With who?
JESSICA	f	(pointing at Cal) With him.
CAL	m	Are you pointing at me?
ROBBIE	m	Are you pointing at him?
TRACY	f	Who is she pointing at!?
ROBBIE	m	Wait: my dad is the older guy you've been seeing?
BERNIE	m	I knew it. He gets ready to pummel some more. Jessica grabs him.
JESSICA	f	He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him.
ROBBIE	m	You made him dirty pictures? Oh God.
	?	You're the one? You're the one  she...  (then, furious)  You stole my soulmate.
CAL	m	Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	You left your sweater in my car  the other night.
HANNAH	f	Who are you?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	David Jacobowitz.
JACOB	m	David Jacobowitz!
CAL	m	David Jacobowitz!?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	m	Is this a bad time --  WHACK!!! Jacob LEVELS David Jacobowitz with a right  hook.
HANNAH	f	Jacob!
JACOB	m	You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!? Before Jacob can finish, Cal LEVELS Jacob.
CAL	m	Stay the hell away from my daughter.
POLICE OFFICER #1	m	Well, okay. That should about do it. (to his partner)  What do you think?  The other cop SHRUGS. The first cop, thinks, then:
POLICE OFFICER #1	m	Look, I'm just gonna write domestic disturbance reported but all clear, okay? `Cause honestly, I don't even know what to put down here.
TRACY	f	Thank you, Officer.  He nods, walks to the door. Stops there.
POLICE OFFICER #1	m	Just... simmer down, okay? We all have arguments, but if you're gonna fight -- just do it inside.  Keep it in the family, okay? Jacob SNARFS down a laugh. Cal glares at him.
CAL	m	I'll kill you. The cops look at Cal, at each other, SHRUG, and EXIT.
BERNIE	m	Let's go. Now.  She NODS. Looks back at Cal.
JESSICA	f	I'm so sorry --
BERNIE	m	NOW!
CAL	m	Don't.
CAL --	m	Cal turns to Hannah.
CAL	m	This man is a lowlife and a
TRACY	f	(under her breath)  Oh, that's ironic.  Cal whips around.
CAL	m	I'm sorry, what?  Tracy doesn't push it. Cal turns back to Hannah.
CAL	m	You may not be able to see it, but  I have. Over and over again. You are not to see him any more.
HANNAH	f	Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop seeing him. Cal turns away.
CAL	m	Well then I don't have anything  else to say to you.
CAL	m	GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!
ON HANNAH	m	shocked.
TRACY	f	Cal, stop being unreasona--
CAL	m	I said: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY
TRACY	f	IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE, CAL!
CAL	m	AND YOU MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT
JACOB	m	(one last try) Cal, c'mon -- But Cal won't even look at him.
MOLLY	f	Goodbye, Nanna.
HANNAH	f	Goodbye, cutie. They EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things.
CAL	m	She's all yours, David.  Ouch.
TRACY	f	Nice.  Before he goes, Cal stops in front of Robbie.
CAL	m	Go big or go home, right, buddy?  Robbie looks up at him, cold.
ROBBIE	m	Go home, Dad.  Cal NODS, EXITS.
WAITRESS	?	Can I get you another?
CAL	m	What time is it?
WAITRESS	?	2:30. In the afternoon.
CAL	m	2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress. Yes, another drink would be grand. She EXITS. Cal feels bad for that one. As she re-approaches:
CAL	m	That was uncalled for. Sorry for being a dick.
ON JACOB	m	Standing there. As always, he looks perfectly put together. He takes in Cal.
JACOB	m	It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal.
CAL	m	What do you want?
JACOB	m	Can I sit?
CAL	m	I don't know, can you?
JACOB	m	Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children?
	?	`Are we going to be mature or act like children?'
JACOB	m	Okay, so like children then. Move over. Jacob SLIDES in.
JACOB	m	I'd like to talk.
CAL	m	You still seeing my daughter?
JACOB	m	Yes.
CAL	m	Then I have nothing to say to you.
JACOB	m	Cal. Cal, look at me. Cal looks. Jacob still has that power over him.
JACOB	m	You been hanging out here a lot?
CAL	m	Sometimes.
JACOB	m	Must be missing a lot of work.
CAL	m	I have a lot of vacation days.
JACOB	m	Some vacation.
CAL	m	I hate the beach... you've got a  lot of nerve coming here -- Just then, the WAITRESS re-approaches. Delivers Cal's drink. They wait her out. She EXITS.
JACOB	m	You want a sip?
CAL	m	No, she probably spit in it. Jacob NODS as Cal pushes the drink away.
JACOB	m	Your kids miss you.
CAL	m	You're hanging out with my kids, fantastic! You can teach Robbie how to objectify women, he'll love that.
JACOB	m	His eighth grade graduation is  next week. You coming?
CAL	m	Of course I'm coming.
JACOB	m	Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal.
CAL	m	He's not my biggest fan right now.
JACOB	m	Oh, that's a good excuse --
CAL	m	Alright, man-whore, if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done --
JACOB	m	I love her, Cal.  Cal looks up.
JACOB	m	I've never been in love before.  Honestly, I've never even been in  `like' before.
	?	I never got it. I saw people in  love -- I saw weakness. I heard them say the things they said, and do the things they do, it all just seemed so... so pathetic.
JACOB	m	She's my perfect combination of everything, Cal. Cal looks up at Jacob. He smiles, gently.
CAL	m	I know you. I know what you are.  You are not good enough for my  daughter. And you will never have  my permission nor my approval.  Jacob stands.
JACOB	m	I'll see you at graduation.  He EXITS. Once more, Cal is alone. Just as he wants it.
ON STAGE	m	We WATCH the ceremony for a moment. The PRINCIPAL labors  through her introduction...
KATE	f	Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most... Spirited... young men, I've ever had the pleasure of teaching. Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie Weaver. Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE. This is not the same  kid we've come to love. There's something different in  his face. He's been broken. He spots JESSICA.
ROBBIE	m	(a bit monotone)  Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.  Welcome, Class of 2011.
	?	I wasn't really sure what I wanted  to talk about today. Mrs.  Thompson said it might be good to  talk about growing up and getting  older and stuff. So I guess I'll  talk about that.  Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son?
ROBBIE	m	I grew up a lot this year, I  think. I used to think that  growing up meant really growing.  Like getting taller and bigger.  But now I think that growing up  just makes you smaller. Your  dreams get smaller, and what you  want gets smaller...  (beat, then)  I grew an inch and a half this  year, but I feel a lot smaller.  Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned.
ROBBIE	m	I was in love. And I know that  makes parents laugh because I'm  only thirteen but whatever, I was.
ROBBIE	m	I believed that there was one true  love for everyone, and if you  fought for that person, your one  true love would always work out.  But that's not how it works. It  sounded good when I was younger,  but... it's just not how it works.  There's no such thing as one true  love for everyo--
ROBBIE	m	Dad?
CAL	m	Hi.  (awkward, to crowd)  Hi, everyone.  Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly  really uncomfortable.
CAL	m	May I have a word with my son?  It'll just take a second.  Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps  over people, squeezes by people, almost trips.  Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his  dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family.  Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.
	?	What are you doing?
CAL	m	I don't know. What are you doing?  Robbie's eyes well up with tears.
ROBBIE	m	I was wrong, Dad. There's no such  thing as --  Cal turns toward the crowd, announces:
CAL	m	My son's graduation speech sucks.  GASPS from the crowd.
ON CAL	m	Now standing, alone, front and center in front of an  entire eighth grade graduation ceremony.  He looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS. MRS.  THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger.
CAL	m	In fairness, I don't know where he  was going but I think we can all  agree it was heading in a pretty  depressing direction. And I  basically wrote it for him. I  mean, I didn't literally write it  but I sure as hell influenced it,  and the kid's already a spitting  image of his mother and I'll be  damned if this is what he's going  to get from me.  People squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck.
CAL	m	My son -- not him, my actual son --  he believes in grand romantic  gestures. He believes that people  have soulmates. And we always  want to tell our thirteen-year-  olds that they're wrong, that `one  day you'll understand, young man.'  But maybe it should be the other  way around.  He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd.
CAL	m	I met my soulmate when I was  fifteen years old. Our first  date, we went for ice cream.  After, my dad started teasing me  about my `first date' the way dads  do. And I told him: `stop making  a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go  on lots of dates with plenty of  girls.' That was the first time I  ever lied to my father.
CAL	m	I met my soulmate when I was  fifteen years old. And I have  loved her with everything I have  for every minute, of every day,  ever since she let me buy her that  first mint chip ice cream. I have  loved her through the birth of our  three perfect children, and I have  loved her even as I've hated her --  only married couples can truly  understand that one. And I don't  know what will wind up happening  with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm  sorry I can't give you that -- but  I promise you this: I will never  stop trying. When you find `the  one' you never give up trying...  and I love you, my amazing boy,  for reminding me of that.  Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses  his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone.  Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces:
ROBBIE	m	I still love you, Jessica! I've  loved you since the first time you  changed my sister's diaper! I've  loved you since...  The crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie  continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back.
CAL	m	Hi, Nanna.
HANNAH	f	Daddy.  He smiles at her, adoring.
CAL	m	My perfect girl.  He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob.
CAL	m	I already ordered a gun. I'm not  kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on  a shady internet site, I can show  you the receipt. If you hurt her,  I am prepared to shoot you in the  face.
JACOB	m	Cal, I'm not going to --
CAL	m	Shut up, Jacob.  Jacob shuts up.
CAL	m	Wow. I like that.  Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices:
CAL	m	Is that a new shirt?
JACOB	m	Hannah took me to the Gap. It's  actually not as bad as I thought.
CAL	m	Seriously?
JACOB	m	Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap.  I got this at Nordstrom's.  And like that... order is restored in the universe.
ROBBIE	m	It was nice of you to come.
JESSICA	f	I wouldn't have missed it. Awkward.
ROBBIE	m	So, how are things with your dad?
JESSICA	f	Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna  head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while.
ROBBIE	m	Yeah, probably a good idea. You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. He holds out his hand, to shake, formally.
JESSICA	f	Wait: I thought you weren't  giving up.
ROBBIE	m	I'm not. But I figure: you like  my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then. Jessica smiles.
JESSICA	f	It's a good plan. She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse.
JESSICA	f	Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school. She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of envelope she once used for... Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek.
JESSICA	f	You take care, Robbie. Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps  up next to his son.
CAL	m	You okay, buddy?
	?	I am now, Dad. I am now.  Robbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles.
CAL	m	We might have to lock him up.  Tracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her.
TRACY	f	You gave a good eighth grade  graduation speech.
CAL	m	I've been working on it for thirty  years, so...  She LAUGHS, then... quiet.
TRACY	f	Do you think we can ever come back  from all this, Cal?
CAL	m	I don't know. I'd like to try  though. I know I'd like to try.  She nods, thinking.
TRACY	f	Things are just so messed up. And  it's been such a strange year.  I've been in such a strange place.  And we have all these problems, so  many problems I've lost count, but  at the end of the day, I mean, the  only thing I know --  She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply:
TRACY	f	I am just so glad you took me for  that ice cream.  Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then:
TRACY	f	It was rocky road by the way.
CAL	m	No!  As they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream  was, we PULL BACK.  Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and  watches them enjoy one another's company.  He smiles.
