REVERSE	m	A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He is staring raptly at the actress.
SLOW-MOTION	?	We are CLOSE on an extremely handsome YOUNG MAN staring past us with a dazzling smile.
SIDNEY	m	Those people all around me - they're all famous. They're my friends. Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - SOPHIE MAES (20's).
SIDNEY	m	My life didn't used to be like this. We PUSH THROUGH the EXIT DOORS and find ourselves impossibly looking at...
SIDNEY	m	I used to pretend it was different for me because I was getting paid by a magazine or newspaper, whatever. But that's, you know...I just loved watching Them. I'd stand outside looking in through the window and think what it would be like to somehow get inside. But there was only one way to get past the thin red line that separates the celebrities from the civilians. You had to be famous.
PR WOMAN	f	Babe?
SIDNEY	m	Babe Three. Yeah. She looks doubtfully at the pig.
PR WOMAN	f	Babe was a cute little piglet.
SIDNEY	m	Harry Potter used to be a cute little piglet too. What do you want? Tempus Fugits...
PR WOMAN	f	He hasn't got any ID.
SIDNEY	m	How many pigs are coming tonight? Look, I was told to bring him, hand him over to the producer, Bob Milton, inside. You want me  to leave him here with you, that's fine...
PR WOMAN	f	No, you can't leave him with me. I've got...Hold on, I'll... She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement. Well, well, Sidney Young.
SIDNEY	m	Well, well...clipboard Nazi-type woman. She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them.
SIDNEY	m	What about me?
SIDNEY	m	How much? I only want to stay for one night!
SIDNEY	m	I want you in bed by ten. And no porn. He tosses the pig one of the canap�s.
LATER	m	...as Sidney emerges from the washrooms, now dressed only in the white shirt and black trousers. He scoops up a passing glass of champagne, checks his moustache and surveys the courtyard - a room full of glamour: tanned skin, diamonds, beautiful dresses, beautiful suits, champagne. He stands surveying the crowd of A-list celebrities in front of him, dazed.
SIDNEY	m	You can do this. You belong here. You're a star. You're a big, bright shining star...
SIDNEY	m	No, when I'm in L.A. I stay at the Sunset Marquis, when I'm here I always stay at the Sanderson. It's, you know, I don't feel at home these days unless I'm in a hotel.
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS	m	So what do you do?
SIDNEY	m	Oh, I'm a writer. Movie writer.
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS	m	Oh great.
SIDNEY	m	Yeah. Got one in pre-production now. You know it's really weird running into you like this because just the other day I was telling the producer I thought you'd be perfect for the lead. She starts to laugh.
SIDNEY	m	No, seriously, you would, because, you know, you have this mixture of intelligence and beauty and fragility that we're looking for and, uh...
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS	m	What's the film?
SIDNEY	m	Tits of Fury. She laughs.
SIDNEY	m	I'm joking, I'm just...It's a bio- pic. About Greta Garbo. That's why I thought of you. You have those amazing cheek-bones and...are they real? Have you had plastic surgery?
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS	m	No. Have you?
SIDNEY	m	Me? No, hardly anything. A penis reduction as a child, that's pretty much... She laughs again, snorting into her drink. Sidney can't believe this - she likes him!
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS	m	Oh god, I'm drunk.
SIDNEY	m	Are you?
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS	m	I'm so drunk. I haven't eaten and...
SIDNEY	m	You feel okay? Because my room's just upstairs if you want to lie down or, or loosen any, you know, morals or...
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS	m	What is your name again?
SIDNEY	m	Clark. Clark Baxter.
SIDNEY	m	How'd you do?
SIDNEY	m	Oh, shit... Sarah, get security! Code Red. Sidney Young got in!
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS	m	Who's Sidney Young?
SIDNEY	m	Oh, shit!
SIDNEY	m	Will you get that? (Beat) Will you get the phone? Sighing he gets up and scratching himself, stumbles through to...
JOURNALIST	m	Look, we don't hate celebrities at the Post-Modern Review, okay? We just don't think they should be taking themselves so seriously. For us a celebrity is a text to be deconstructed. Apart from Costner obviously.
THIN MAN	m	I wouldn't do this the honour of calling it a review. It's a puerile, personal attack in, in alcoholic prose, in which incidentally you manage to misquote both Derrida and Lyotard. I am a...
LARGE WOMAN	f	Girl.
THIN MAN	m	...an internationally respected academic and...
LARGE WOMAN	f	Prick.
THIN MAN	m	...author of a very well received book on the history of culture and a...
LARGE WOMAN	f	Fuckwit.
SIDNEY	m	(threading his way past) Couldn't one of you answer the phone?
SIDNEY	m	Will you answer that? What do I pay you for?
YOUNG MAN	m	You don't pay me.
SIDNEY	m	Just get the phone!
YOUNG MAN	m	Post-Modern Review.
THIN MAN	m	Sidney, if she doesn't apologise I'm quitting.
SIDNEY	m	(to the Large Woman) George can't leave. You'll have to apologise.
LARGE WOMAN	f	Why can't George leave?
SIDNEY	m	He owns the fax machine.
SIDNEY	m	What?
YOUNG MAN	m	It's Sharps Magazine.
SIDNEY	m	We're not finished.
YOUNG MAN	m	They sue, we're finished.
SIDNEY	m	Shut up. (To the others) Will you be quiet!
SIDNEY	m	Sidney Young.
VOICED)	?	This is Clayton Harding. I'm the editor of Sharps Magazine.
SIDNEY	m	Ah, Lord Vader.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	I saw you at my party, just before you ruined it with your little pig stunt. You liked that?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Sure. On his desk we see a few copies the Post-Modern Review - glimpses of stars on the covers - Catherine Zeta-Jones, Orlando Bloom... Clayton's hand sifts one copy from the others and holds it up - the cover depicts CLAYTON HIMSELF - patrician handsome, stern, photo-shopped so that he appears to be NAKED. A headline reads "Clayton Harding - The Editor's New Clothes? Clayton's shoulder's heave with a snort of repressed laughter.
SIDNEY	m	We're not scared of you, Harding. You want to sue, go ahead and sue. It's like Jimmy Stewart said, (a poor Stewart impersonation:)"You sit up there and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr... Mr...
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Potter. "Mr. Potter..."You go ahead and sue if you want, but I warn you, if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. An ASSISTANT walks in. Clayton looks up.
ASSISTANT	m	Miss Taylor is here sir. Clayton nods and quickly throws the magazines into a BOTTOM DRAWER of the desk. Sidney is still talking over the phone, beginning to enjoy himself.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	I want you to come and work for me at Sharps Magazine in New York.
STAFF	m	Fight, fight, fight...
SIDNEY	m	Um...could you say that again please? We hear the sound of an aeroplane engine build as we...
MRS KOWALSKI	f	This magazine you are working for? It is good?
SIDNEY	m	It's Sharps Magazine. You know Sharps? It's sort of society, fashion, crime, finance, Hollywood celebrities...
MRS KOWALSKI	f	Hollywood. Sodom and Gomorrah. Now everybody is celebrity. You take out your breasts, you are celebrity.
SIDNEY	m	(eyeing her chest
DOUBTFULLY)	?	Well, I think it depends on the breasts but...
MRS KOWALSKI	f	In Poland, someone was famous because they had done something...Marie Curie...Pope John Paul...
SIDNEY	m	Yeah, they don't make entertainers like that any more... Mrs Kowalski cuffs the back of his head. Sidney is somewhat surprised by this familiarity, having only just met the lady. She opens an apartment door.
MRS KOWALSKI	f	They brought your things yesterday.
SIDNEY	m	Yup, this is good. This is...I can put my drum kit just over there and, uh... She stares at him.
SIDNEY	m	That's a...that's just a joke. They're just little...congas.
MRS KOWALSKI	f	When do you start work?
SIDNEY	m	Tomorrow morning.
MRS KOWALSKI	f	Well, you need to be fresh, make a good impression.(Leaving) Go to bed.
SIDNEY	m	Just what I'm going to do...
SEXY WOMAN	f	A Kona please.
SIDNEY	m	(raising his glass) Hi, my name's Clark. Clark Baxter.
SIDNEY	m	What the hell's that?
BARMAN	m	That's a water sir.
SIDNEY	m	Well that's...that's not right, is it? That's not...put a dash of beer in that.
ALISON	f	I'm sorry, my boyfriend's sitting there.
SIDNEY	m	Is he? He's fucking small isn't he?
ALISON	f	That's his White Russian. He'll be here in a second.
SIDNEY	m	Can you reserve these seats?
BARMAN	m	Nope.
SIDNEY	m	I'm a journalist. Work for a little periodical you might have heard of called Sharps Magazine?
SIDNEY	m	I'm the Cultural Editor.
ALISON	f	(to Sexy Woman) This is a library card. (Reading it) From Glow-cester...
SIDNEY	m	(snatching it back) That's...not that one... (Searching wallet) I've got it somewhere...I just...
SIDNEY	m	Happy now?
ALISON	f	Just doing my bit for the gene pool.
SIDNEY	m	Who's that there with Clint Eastwood?
ALISON	f	Morgan Freeman?
SIDNEY	m	No, in the headlock.
ALISON	f	You had this laminated?
SIDNEY	m	Oh just give it...
ALISON	f	Shit!
SIDNEY	m	It's okay. It's okay. I've got it.
ALISON	f	Just...just leave it!
SIDNEY	m	Sorry.
SIDNEY	m	It's pronounced Gloucester by the way.
ALISON	f	Are you going to get off that seat?
SIDNEY	m	No.
ALISON	f	Do you know the meaning of Karma?
SIDNEY	m	The curry?
ALISON	f	(inscribing a circle in
THE AIR )	m	What goes around, comes around. The moment is approaching when you will pay the price for being an asshole. When my boyfriend gets here I'm going to put my pacifist leanings to one side and encourage him to take you outside and...
ALISON	f	Hello? Hi, honey.(Beat) Oh. (Beat) no, no, it's...don't worry about it. I'll see you then.
SIDNEY	m	Boyfriend not coming?
SIDNEY	m	Listen, I'm sorry. Do you think...? She turns to him.
SIDNEY	m	Do you think I could have his drink? Alison gives him a cold smile, controlling her temper. She spots a heavily made-up WOMAN walking past.
ALISON	f	Bobbie?
WOMAN	f	Hey!
ALISON	f	You want a seat? I'm just leaving.
WOMAN	f	Thanks. The Woman takes Alison's place at the bar.
SIDNEY	m	(to the newcomer) Hello. He slides the PHOTOGRAPH over to her.
SIDNEY	m	Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood. Alison gives a small smile and leaves.
WOMAN	f	I'm gonna powder my nose. Why don't you put on something a little more romantic? She staggers off down the hall. Sidney, giddy with excitement, searches through some LPs and puts one on his old turntable. It's Ace of Spades by Motorhead. He staggers around, playing air-guitar for a moment.
SIDNEY	m	Mrs Lebowski...
MRS KOWALSKI	f	Kowalski. You know what time it is? The music blaring, your door open...
SIDNEY	m	(trying to seem sober) Was it? Fuck. I mean, shit. Sorry. I just...met an old friend and brought them back... The Woman staggers back into the room, her back to us. She is NAKED. She is also surprisingly muscular.
SIDNEY	m	...for a little... He notices the woman. His gaze drops to below the waist.
SIDNEY	m	...penis. Mrs Kowalski turns and takes in the view. Nobody moves.
SIDNEY	m	You can do this! You can do this! He hums the fanfare from the Rocky theme.
SIDNEY	m	Quick coffee Bob and then you've got to go.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	What the fuck are you wearing?
SIDNEY	m	You like it? I brought you one.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Thanks.
SIDNEY	m	Good. Thanks for the business class tickets, Clay.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	That was a mistake. And don't call me Clay.
SIDNEY	m	Oh. Well, if it's any consolation I got downgraded anyway.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	That is some consolation.
SIDNEY	m	Ha! That was just a little, uh... as it happens I'm a big fan of your earlier, funnier work. Snipe Magazine that was...that was really good.
SIDNEY	m	Yeah, you've...you've actually been a big influence on me and I really think together we can inject a bit of that Snipe spirit into this magazine. Now I've got a few ideas that I'd like to...
CLAYTON HARDING	m	You think you've arrived, doncha? Well I hate to break it to you, but you're only in the first room. It's not nothing, don't get me wrong, but there are plenty of people in this town who never made it past the first room. After a year or so, maybe longer, you'll discover a secret doorway at the back of the first room that leads to the second. Eventually, if you're lucky, you'll discover another doorway back of the second room that leads to the third.
SIDNEY	m	So...if I make it to the Seventh Room - will I become a true Jedi Knight?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Which brings us to the subject of your sense of humour. I had a look through your "magazine" here.
SIDNEY	m	What'd you think?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Oh, I thought it was...kinda snarky. And bitter. And... witless.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	(glancing at Sidney's
CLOTHES)	?	Well, Sidney. We've only just met but already I perceive I am in the presence of a rare comic sensibility.
SIDNEY	m	Thanks.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	I know your Hi-jinx gave you a certain notoriety back in Olde England but things are going to be a bit different here. Harding wants me to be your Rabbi, show you the ropes. Are you aware of what we do at I Spy?
SIDNEY	m	You photograph famous people when they're drunk?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	I Spy is the nation's window onto High Society. The Looky-Loos read us because...well, They Weren't There. The Glitterati read us because we tell them They Were There. For this system to work we have to know where There is.
SIDNEY	m	So...when we go out to clubs and things...would that, would that be on expenses or...?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	This isn't a vacation. It's a vocation.
SIDNEY	m	Okay. What do you mean by suitable?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Something that covers all of this up.
SIDNEY	m	Is that Mussolini?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	(Beat.) ) No, Sidney, that's Richard Heywood. The owner of this magazine.
SIDNEY	m	Oh. Looks a little like, uh...(pointing to the child in the photograph, smiling) Who's this funny looking kid? Is that his son?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	That's his daughter, Elizabeth; now my wife.
SIDNEY	m	Really? Well, she's very...isn't she? Really, very...
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Miss Olsen here takes care of the gallery openings, book launches and other intellectual fare. Can you find our new rookie something to do?
ALISON	f	I hear the Cultural Editor's job is up for grabs?
SIDNEY	m	Listen, seeing as how I'm going to be sitting just over there, don't you think we should try and put last night behind us?
ALISON	f	No. Get off my desk.
SIDNEY	m	I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing. (Beat) Are you going to help me out?
ALISON	f	Okay. Which way did you come in? Sidney stares at her. Alison takes some contact sheets from her desk and shoves them at him.
ALISON	f	Chris Blick exhibition opening. Caption it. Now get off my desk. One of the magazines gorgeous Fashionistas - INGRID - walks past.
INGRID	f	Hi!
ALISON	f	Hi, Ingrid. Ingrid stares at Sidney's outfit, thrown.
SIDNEY	m	(a wolfish smile) You going to introduce me?
ALISON	f	This is Clark Baxter. (Noticing Ingrid's gaze) He's English.
INGRID	f	(That explains it) Ohh...right.
SIDNEY	m	Actually it's Sidney. Sidney Young. Clark Baxter is my alias.
INGRID	f	Why do you have an alias?
ALISON	f	He uses it when he's trying to pick up transsexuals.
INGRID	f	Nice to meet you. She walks on.
SIDNEY	m	I take it you knew about Bob and didn't tell me? Alison inscribes a circle in the air with her finger without looking up.
SIDNEY	m	Hello, is that the Parsons Gallery?
SIDNEY	m	This is Sidney Young from Sharps Magazine? We're running some photographs from your opening of the Chris Blick exhibition, and I just need to caption them. I was wondering if you could help me identify some of the people?
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	All right.
SIDNEY	m	Thanks. So...Chris Blick. Man or woman?
SIDNEY	m	Is Chris Blick a man or woman? Are you sure you're calling from Sharps magazine?
SIDNEY	m	Yes, I am. Tell me Stanley, why have they given you this assignment if you don't know who one of the most famous artists in America is?
SIDNEY	m	I...I don't really know. He's a man.
SIDNEY	m	Okay. Is he an old man? He's an older man, yes.
SIDNEY	m	(staring at a
PHOTOGRAPH)	?	Okay, I've got two old men here - so is he the fat one? You do realize that Clayton Harding is a personal friend of mine?
SIDNEY	m	What's that got to do with anything?
SIDNEY	m	Is he the one with the wonky eye?
SIDNEY	m	It's fashion sensitive. If you're not wearing Prada it'll take your arm clean off. Anna stares at this strange man with the burger, baffled.
ANNA	f	But I am wearing Prada. The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees Sidney and winces. She takes out a book and pretends to read. The lift begins to rise again. Through it's glass doors we see the different floors passing, different publications - each a hive of sober, hard work. Sidney stares at them.
SIDNEY	m	This isn't what I expected. Alison recoils slightly.
ALISON	f	What did you expect?
SIDNEY	m	I don't know. The Algonquin circle. Dorothy Parker. Martinis. Quips. Look at them. Not one of them is drunk.
ALISON	f	It's called being a professional. You should try it some time.
SIDNEY	m	There's something you should understand. I'm not really one of you.
ALISON	f	By "you" do you mean "human?"
SIDNEY	m	I mean the glossy posse. Bunch of Zombies, writing about "Pets of the Stars" but acting like they're working for the UN. I'm here to shake things up a bit. Where are you from?
ALISON	f	Not that it's any of your business, but I'm from Port Huron, Michigan.
SIDNEY	m	Right. Small town girl. (Hannibal Lector impersonation) I bet you could only dream of getting out. Getting anywhere - yes, Clarice? Getting all the way - to the N...Y...C. (Dropping the impersonation) Take my advice, don't go taking this celebrity fluff seriously. For a moment Alison is speechless with anger.
ALISON	f	You...you...arrogant... The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of granite and an air of superhuman froideur. Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to the plunge in temperature. For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a moment, gagging. The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her. Alison closes her eyes. Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket. Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the offending item away. Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a vice-like grip.
ALISON	f	Are you insane? That was Lawrence's wife, Elizabeth! Her father owns Sharps!
SIDNEY	m	That was her? The Mussolini baby?
SIDNEY	m	I could go back and tell her I'm...
ALISON	f	No! Listen to me - you do NOT approach Elizabeth Maddox, you do NOT talk to her! Don't even make eye-contact with her? Do you understand?
SIDNEY	m	Am I supposed to be afraid?
ALISON	f	Yes.
SIDNEY	m	I don't know the meaning of the word fear.
ALISON	f	I'm sure there are many words you don't know the meaning of!
ALISON	f	When I think of all the people who would kill to be where you are. And you lumber in here, spitting food, haven't got the brains God gave a mollusc...why  did Clayton hire you?
SIDNEY	m	Snipe Magazine.
ALISON	f	What?
SIDNEY	m	When Clayton left college he started this little magazine called Snipe. Fantastic. Took aim at every self-important celebrity in town. Completely fearless. It was like my magazine but twenty years earlier.
SIDNEY	m	That's why he's hired me. I am the young Clayton Harding. He looks at me and sees his glory days.
ALISON	f	His glory days? Sharps has won fourteen National Magazine awards and increased its advertising pages by more than 60 percent since he took over. He's paid millions of dollars a year. He  lives in a Bank Street townhouse, and weekends in the Hamptons. Clayton Harding is one of the lynchpins of the media-industrial complex. Sidney stops to examine his reflection in a window.
SIDNEY	m	Yeah, but don't worry. I think I might still be in time to save him.
SIDNEY	m	There's a couple of hundred grands worth of food here and I swear I'm the only person eating it. You want some? Alison recoils. Sidney does a little nerdy dance to the music as he eats.
SIDNEY	m	This place is amazing. It's wall to wall totty.
ALISON	f	Wall to wall what?
SIDNEY	m	Totty. Babes. Sexually attractive women.
ALISON	f	Do you mind?
SIDNEY	m	What? Maddox joins them. A man passes, nods respectfully at Maddox.
SIDNEY	m	Look at that. All night people have been treating us like we're royalty. In London, the journalist's motto is "Everybody hates us and we don't care."
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Well, now you're one of the High Priests of what's Hot and what's Not. So what were you two talking about?
ALISON	f	Sidney was just marvelling at the abundance of "Totty" here.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Uh-oh. I don't think Miss Olsen approves of you, Sidney.
SIDNEY	m	I shouldn't be here. I get thrown out of places like this.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	This? This is a McDonald's. I hate disease parties. (Off Sidney's puzzled look) Fund- raisers.
WOMAN	f	Lawrence Maddox? Oh my goodness... Long time.
WOMAN	f	Rachel!
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Rachel. How are you?
RACHEL	f	Well, I'm just wonderful. Wonderful. How are you?
RACHEL	f	Funny I should run into you. I've just done this great little film called Five Boroughs and it's you know, low-budget, first-time director but very, uh, moving and... Hey, maybe you could do a little...?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Angelo, good to see you. Rachel hovers for a moment, embarrassed by her abrupt dismissal then slips away. Sidney watches her go, feeling for her.
SIDNEY	m	You know that was Rachel Petkoff?  She's a fantastic actress. Hasn't done anything for years, but, in her day...
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	I'm sure.
SIDNEY	m	Seriously, I've heard about that film. I think she's going to make a come back. We should get there first, do a profile or something before everyone else... Maddox isn't listening. Instead he greets a fat, angry- looking VERY YOUNG MAN. This is VINCENT LEPAK, wearing his customary SHADES.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Vincent! Great to see you. Children, I'd like to introduce you to Vincent Lepak, enfant  terrible and in, my opinion, the  most exciting new director in  American cinema.  Vincent nods, frowning, looks around.
VINCENT	m	I think this is the worst fundraiser I've been to in my whole life.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	It's a rat fuck, isn't it? Sidney walks away.
SIDNEY	m	Excuse me? Aren't you Rachel  Petkoff?
SIDNEY	m	This is sort of embarrassing but...
SIDNEY	m	Could I have your autograph?
SIDNEY	m	I'm a big fan.
RACHEL	f	Is that so?
SIDNEY	m	Absolutely. I must have seen everything you've been in. Those episodes of The Love Boat and the Bionic Woman? The Song Birds, In The Night...I've even seen your first ever TV appearance. The Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors. Right?
RACHEL	f	Right...
SIDNEY	m	My all time favorite? A Day Too Long. (He means it) You were really great in that.
RACHEL	f	What's your name, honey?
SIDNEY	m	Sidney Young.
RACHEL	f	Sidney Young. I'll remember that.
VINCENT	m	You look around and it's all shit. No-one is making movies that are fucking worthwhile.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	I'd have to disagree with you, Vincent. Vincent looks at him, displeased.
VINCENT	m	This is what I'm saying. You have to inspire yourself. I am my role- model. I want to be me... He stares angrily around, handing his empty glass to his waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full one from a passing tray. Sidney watches him with dislike.
SIDNEY	m	Greatest film ever made?
VINCENT	m	Excuse me?
SIDNEY	m	What's the greatest film ever made? (To Alison) Go on. Have a guess.
ALISON	f	Well, that's...I don't think there is one single film that...
SIDNEY	m	Have a guess.
VINCENT	m	Yeah, have a guess - what is the greatest film ever made?
ALISON	f	I don't, uh...well personally I love La Dolce Vita but...
SIDNEY	m	Incorrect. Con Air.
ALISON	f	I beg your pardon?
SIDNEY	m	Uhuh, Con Air. It's got everything. Malkovich for your acting chops, Nicky Cage for action, Buscemi for comedy, John Cusack for the Gays. It's a smorgasbord.
WOMAN	f	I don't think we've been introduced?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Mister Young, this is Eleanor Johnson, Queen of New York. Eleanor this is Sidney Young. He's from England and he's our very own Idiot Savant. Without the Savant.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Well, it's always nice to have fresh blood at these things. (To Maddox) Which reminds me, I'm here with Sophie Maes, I want you to meet her. New film, The Suffragette coming out, the buzz is A-mazing. The release is tied in with the roll-out of the Reebok campaign, and now Louis Vuitton's on the line. This train is leaving the station Lawrence.
SIDNEY	m	So, you're a publicist?
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	I don't really like that word, Sidney.
SIDNEY	m	What should I call you?
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	You can call me Eleanor. She stares past him, across the pool.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Oh, this one will go far.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	(on cell phone) Where's the car? What's it doing at the back? Forget what I said. I want the car at the front. Now. Sidney finds himself walking alongside Sophie and Maddox, trying not to stare at Sophie's breasts.
SOPHIE MAES	f	...I just think it's terrible the way we're still exploiting animals. That's why, you know, I won't wear fur or leather, I won't wear make-up, I'm vegetarian.
SIDNEY	m	I'm with you...
SIDNEY	m	I won't eat anything with, you know, eyebrows.
SIDNEY	m	Or if it can chuckle. I won't eat animals that can chuckle.
SOPHIE	f	I'm sorry, I can't understand your accent?
SIDNEY	m	Nothing, just, uh...So you're an actress? Have I seen you in anything?
SOPHIE MAES	f	I don't know. Have you?
SIDNEY	m	No. (Trying again) So you haven't won any Oscars yet?
SOPHIE MAES	f	No.
SIDNEY	m	Because I would certainly vote for you for best supporting dress! Huh, huh, huh....
UNDERSTAND HIM)	m	I haven't been nominated for anything.
SIDNEY	m	No, I'm just...I'm saying you look...
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Are you ready dear?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	We're going on to the Circle Club. I'll see you tomorrow.
ALISON	f	Okay. Good night. Maddox slips his jacket around Sophie's shoulders.
SOPHIE	f	Aren't you cold?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	I'm from Canada, land of ice and snow. They get into the car. Sidney tries to follow them.
SIDNEY	m	Budge up.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Where are you going?
SIDNEY	m	I'm coming to the club.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Sorry, you're not on the list. A small CHIHUAHUA - CUBA - on Sophie's lap snarls at Sidney.
SIDNEY	m	That's... that turns my stomach. Pawing her like that. He's old enough to be her father.
ALISON	f	No he isn't.
SIDNEY	m	Yes he is. I started producing sperm when I was thirteen, so you know, technically...
ALISON	f	For your information he wasn't pawing her! He was just doing his job! In case you haven't noticed Sharps has to have a star on the cover every month. And most of those stars are clients of Eleanor's. So do not piss her off.
SIDNEY	m	She's a flak. Hacks don't take orders from flaks. And I don't think you can call that "doing his job." The man had no blood left in his upper body...
ALISON	f	Will you...? Oh, and next time you want to do the hilariously ironic I love Con Air skit would you mind...?
SIDNEY	m	I wasn't being ironic...
ALISON	f	...would you mind not involving me, especially in the presence of Vincent Lepak who happens to be very important.
SIDNEY	m	Yeah, I could tell by the way he was allowed to stay up past his bed time.
SIDNEY	m	Do you think she'd go out with me?
ALISON	f	Who?
SIDNEY	m	Sophie Maes. You think she'll go out with me?
ALISON	f	No. Girls like Sophie don't date journalists. As far as she's concerned, you're the help.
SIDNEY	m	What do you know? A lot of these starlets are lonely. They spend their time looking for a man. Alison starts to walk away.
ALISON	f	This is New York, Sidney. Women only date men who are successful...
SIDNEY	m	I'm going to be successful.
ALISON	f	(as she goes) ...and tall.
SIDNEY	m	Have you seen this? She's everywhere. An ASSISTANT walks over with a MUFFIN BASKET for Maddox.
ASSISTANT	m	From Sophie Maes.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	(reading the card) "Thanks for a great night." What a sweet kid. Oh, Sidney, about last night - word of advice. Don't talk to the celebrities, okay? Sophie said you made her feel uncomfortable. He walks off with a slight smirk. Sidney glowers after him.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	...so Brad's people finally got back to me and they've agreed. We've got the whole afternoon, before the shoot. People clap. Harding nods approvingly.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Good work Lawrence. Okay, well, if that's it for... He starts to get up.
SIDNEY	m	So, I was thinking, Clay... Clayton, pauses, frowning. Sidney turns to the room, cocksure.
SIDNEY	m	Paris Hilton. I do a profile on her as if she's this complete recluse, this hermit...(laughing) I try and track her down and, you know, "Who is the elusive Paris Hilton and why is she so publicity shy?" He laughs for a moment. No one joins in.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	That's first room stuff, Sidney. And call me Clay one more time and see what happens. Harding stalks out of the room. Blushing, Sidney stares after him, nodding vaguely. As he gathers his notebook he becomes aware of the smirks on the faces of Maddox and the others as they leave.
VICKY	f	No, I'd love these but I'm so fat I couldn't...
INGRID	f	Get out of here!
ANNA	f	You look totally rexy.
INGRID	f	Alice? Alison hides her irritation with a smile.
ALISON	f	Alison.
INGRID	f	Tell Vicky she looks rexy.
ALISON	f	Rexy?
INGRID	f	Anorexic.
ALISON	f	Well...you do look like you could do with a few more pounds.
VICKY	f	Oh god, that's so sweet.
INGRID	f	By the way, post-shoot clear out. Got some Gucci pants here that are way too big for us. You wanna try?
ALISON	f	(another tight smile) No, thanks.
ALISON	f	I don't mean to be rude Sidney but...what the fuck do you want?
SIDNEY	m	Listen, you know how things work around here. How am I going to get something in the magazine?
ALISON	f	I thought all this "fluff" was beneath you?
SIDNEY	m	It is but...things have changed.
ALISON	f	What's changed?
SIDNEY	m	Look, I know people think I'm a bit of an idiot and maybe I haven't started off too well here, but I want...I want...
SIDNEY	m	...I want to have sex with Sophie Maes. (Beat) Before Maddox does.
ALISON	f	You're loathsome, you know that?
SIDNEY	m	I know he's got a head start on me but I'm going to win her back. Once I get my hooks into a girl, they never get free.
ALISON	f	Like ring-worm.
SIDNEY	m	The gloves are coming off. We hear the opening of Brigitte Bardot's Moi Je Joue as we...
SIDNEY	m	Okay. Celebrity Trash Cans. The contents of celebrity trash cans are revealed and readers have gotta guess who the trash belongs to... Five bottles of Jack Daniels, a court order, and a copy of Mein Kampf? Mel Gibson!
CLAYTON HARDING	m	(getting out the lift) First Room, Sidney. First room.
SIDNEY	m	(pointing at the snap) Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood?
MODEL	?	Morgan Freeman?
SIDNEY	m	No, not...why's everyone say...? There! In the head-lock!
SIDNEY	m	It's a Shag Tree. It illustrates all of the sexual pairings of Hollywood's top stars and how they interconnect... From under the door slides a piece of paper on which is written First Room. We hear a TOILET FLUSH.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	If I give you an interview will ya leave me the fuck alone? Sidney smiles. The song ends.
NATHAN LANE	m	Nathan Lane. Nice to meet you.
SIDNEY	m	Great to meet you Nathan. I'm a big fan. I love that rat thing you played in The Lion King.
NATHAN LANE	m	Actually he's a meer cat.
SIDNEY	m	(absently, checking his
NOTES)	?	Uhuh... Now, I've been doing some research and I think you're probably quite a private man. Am I right?
NATHAN LANE	m	Well...
SIDNEY	m	Which is fine, but today, I think it would be great to get behind the mask.
NATHAN LANE	m	Uh, I don't think there really is a mask as such, and I don't wanna be a pain, but what I really wanna talk about is the new play, keep it about the work, you know? Is that okay?
SIDNEY	m	Absolutely. Of course. So, first question - are you Jewish? Nathan stares at Sidney.
NATHAN LANE	m	I don't see what the relevance of that is.
SIDNEY	m	Okay. Next question. The rat thing - that's gotta be Disney's first gay animal, right? So, I was wondering - are you a homosexual? Beat. Nathan looks like he might hit Sidney.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	What did I say to you?
SIDNEY	m	What...?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	What did I say to you?
SIDNEY	m	I just...
CLAYTON HARDING	m	What did I say to you?
SIDNEY	m	Don't upset anyone.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Don't upset anyone.
SIDNEY	m	I was just trying to...probe.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	You wanna probe become a proctologist, okay? You can't ask musical comedy stars whether they're Jewish or gay. From now on just assume they're all Jewish and all gay, okay?
SIDNEY	m	I'd like to apply for an American Express card please? (Beat) Hon. Sidney Young. (Beat) As in Honourable. H-O-N. (Beat)It's a British title. Across the desk Alison watches him with contempt.
SIDNEY	m	The Queen? Yeah, I know the Queen. Just fill in the form will you? Sidney suddenly notices Sophie Maes and Eleanor Johnson walking towards them. Sophie looks more STYLED than before. She is holding her Chihuahua, Cuba, which is dressed in a tiny coat. Sidney DISAPPEARS UNDER THE DESK. We hear a RIP as he yanks the tape off his face.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Hey! Cuba! He pets the dog, who greets him enthusiastically.
SOPHIE MAES	f	He likes you.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Well, I'm one of the Friends Of Cuba.
SOPHIE	f	No, don't! It's so embarrassing! That picture's everywhere now. And I had no idea the dress was so see-through! And people are talking like it was some kind of stunt.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Such a cynical age. Hello Sidney. Embarrassed, Sidney gets up from under his desk.
SIDNEY	m	Hello! Didn't, didn't know you were coming in...?
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Lawrence is taking us to lunch at Cipriani.
SIDNEY	m	Oh great. That's great.
SOPHIE MAES	f	Lawrence? Could I leave Cuba here? He doesn't like Italian food.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Of course you can. He can stay in my office. Sidney? Fetch Cuba a bowl of water, will you? Sidney stares at him.
SIDNEY	m	(forcing a smile) Of course.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	That is a lovely ring. Where is that from?
SIDNEY	m	It was my mother's. She gave it to me.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Oh, you Sweetie. That is very, very...(dismissing the topic) So, listen...You've met Vincent Lepak haven't you, Sidney?
SIDNEY	m	Uhuh.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	He has a new movie coming out soon and Lawrence is over- stretched as it is. How would you like to write a story on him?
SIDNEY	m	A story? Absolutely. That would...I'd love to...
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Well, great. Maybe we could get together and discuss the angle?
SIDNEY	m	Okay. (Beat) What do you mean?
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Well, I'd need to know how we're going to present Vincent, check the story, so on.
SIDNEY	m	You want copy approval?
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Any stories written about my clients need to be in their best interest, that's all. If things work out with Vincent we could maybe talk about a follow up story on Sophie? What do you think?
SIDNEY	m	I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't...I don't work that way. Alison stares with surprise at Sidney. He just went up in her estimation.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Sidney dear, think of it like this: you write about one of my clients, you are borrowing some of their "star-light" to help sell your magazine. All I'm saying is quid pro quo. Sidney is unable to hold back a snicker.
SIDNEY	m	Their star-light? Eleanor's face hardens.
SIDNEY	m	Hello Cuba. I'm Uncle Sidney, come to see how you are. You wanna play? You wanna little play? He takes a RUBBER BALL out of his pocket and holds it up for the dog to see.
SIDNEY	m	Fetch! He tosses the ball in the air. Cuba runs after it and trots back, stumpy tail wagging, the ball in its teeth.
SIDNEY	m	That's it! That's it!
SIDNEY	m	We're gonna be best pals aren't we? You're going to like me more than that prick Maddox, aren't you? Fetch! He tosses the ball again which promptly bounces off the wall straight out of the half open window.
SIDNEY	m	No! Cuba is already running towards the window... Sidney's yell slows and distorts as we move to SLOW
SIDNEY	m	Cuba?
SIDNEY	m	(waiting for the lift) C'mon...C'mon... Alison walks past, sees him and does a double-take.
SIDNEY	m	(seeing her coming) Shit, shit, shit...
ALISON	f	That's my bag.
SIDNEY	m	I'm just...just borrowing it. I'll bring it straight back.
ALEX	m	What are you talking about? Give it back. She reaches out to take the bag. Sidney holds on desperately.
ALISON	f	Stop it! Give me the... She tugs violently, pulling the bag open. A small PAW lolls out. Alison freezes staring at it. Silence.
ALISON	f	Oh my God.
SIDNEY	m	It was an accident.
ALISON	f	Oh my God.
SIDNEY	m	I was just trying to make friends. Please don't tell her. Please don't tell her. Cuba? Cuba? Startled, Sidney darts into Maddox's office.
ALISON	f	What are you doing? You can't...!  He jerks the window open and empties Cuba out of it,  slamming it shut just as Sophie, Eleanor and Lawrence walk  in.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Alison, have you seen Cuba?
ALISON	f	W-What? She darts a glance over to where Sidney stands with his back to the window, gazing at her pleadingly. From behind him comes a faint creaking sound.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Sophie's dog! Have you seen him? Sidney hangs his head, awaiting the coup de grace.
ALISON	f	Uh...no. No idea. Sidney stares at her in amazement. Behind him Cuba's body appears at the window, rising into view on a WINDOW WASHING PLATFORM. A Window Washer, stands at the other end of the cradle, bobbing his head to the music in his headphones. Alison stares at the dog in horror while the others talk, oblivious.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Don't worry, he couldn't have got  very far.
SOPHIE MAES	f	Cuba? Cuba! Cuba trundles on up to the sky.
SIDNEY	m	Clayton? Have you got a minute? Clayton lights a cigarette, stares out of the window. Sidney comes in.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Did they find that rat yet?
SIDNEY	m	No...Not yet. I think maybe he got out the building? Sidney hovers.
SIDNEY	m	Congratulations on the Man of the Year thing. How was the lunch?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	I don't know. Thousand dollars a plate, all I could taste was ass. I'm kissing their ass, they're kissing my ass. (Beat) I get this dream sometimes. Someone's set fire to the building - Heywoods - Sharps magazine - the whole thing, it's going up in flames. My analyst thinks it's an anxiety dream. I never tell him how happy I am watching the fucker burn.
SIDNEY	m	I want to do a story on Vincent Lepak. Not a puff-piece. Something funny, but with teeth. The kind of thing Snipe would have done. Everyone's treating him like he's a genius and he's an idiot.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Look at these things. How'd I get a closet full of blue fucking shirts?
SIDNEY	m	Um...I don't know.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	I don't know either. This is an office for Christ's sake! Why've I even got a fucking closet?
SIDNEY	m	(he can't believe it) Do it?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Fuck it. Yeah. Do it. He's an annoying little prick. Go take him down. This is your shot.
SIDNEY	m	Thanks Clayton!
CLAYTON HARDING	m	You're my little Hit Man.
SIDNEY	m	I'm your little Hit Man!
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Go do it!
SIDNEY	m	Okay! He scuttles out. He ducks back around the door.
SIDNEY	m	You could call me The Jackal!
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Out.
SIDNEY	m	Okay! He ducks back out again.
ASSISTANT	m	Mister Young?
SIDNEY	m	Yes?
ASSISTANT	m	I'm Sophie Maes' assistant. I'm afraid Sophie isn't here right now.
SIDNEY	m	(looking past her) Look I know she's in. I'm not a stalker. I just know she's upset about losing her dog and...
ASSISTANT	m	She isn't here.
SIDNEY	m	Well, can I at least check that she got my present?
ASSISTANT	m	Okay. Did you send the flowers?
SIDNEY	m	Flowers? Yeah,'cos she doesn't get enough flowers, does she? No, I sent her the fish. The Young Woman looks suddenly nervous.
ASSISTANT	m	Oh.
SIDNEY	m	Gold-fish. In a bowl. Did she get them?
ASSISTANT	m	Yes, but...they were dead.
SIDNEY	m	All of them?
ASSISTANT	m	Yeah. It was kinda shocking. Were they dead when you sent them? Sidney stares at her.
SIDNEY	m	What? No, they were... Who sends people dead fish?
ASSISTANT	m	The Mafia?
ALISON	f	My God, you're like a serial killer.
SIDNEY	m	This wasn't me. (Beat) I...I laid him to rest. Cuba I mean. I took him over to...
ALISON	f	I don't want to know.
SIDNEY	m	Okay. (Beat) Well, I just...I just wanted to say...about not telling them...I really appreciated it. It was good of you and, and...you know...not many people would, uh...
ALISON	f	It's okay.
SIDNEY	m	Why didn't you?
ALISON	f	You don't need my help to screw up here, Sidney. I mean, the only things you make are mistakes and stains.
BARMAN	m	Can I help you?
SIDNEY	m	(following his gaze) Just a couple of straws please.
SIDNEY	m	Can I ask you something? How come you've always got the notebook? Is it a diary or something? Am I in it?
ALISON	f	It's...it's a novel I'm working on, alright?
SIDNEY	m	Wow.
ALISON	f	Go ahead. I know. I'm a walking clich�.
SIDNEY	m	No - a novel, that's...that's pretty impressive. You're writing it by hand?
ALISON	f	Yeah, it...I don't know. It keeps it separate from the magazine work. Makes it seem special.
SIDNEY	m	You're full of surprises, Sister.
SIDNEY	m	So...you waiting for your boyfriend?
ALISON	f	Uh, yeah, so...
SIDNEY	m	What's he do, the mystery guy? Is he a hack too?
ALISON	f	Actually he's a poet.
SIDNEY	m	Really? What's he look like?
ALISON	f	What?
SIDNEY	m	Just most poets you see aren't really good-looking, are they? Spend their time stuck in a room, end up looking like Golem. Is he...?
ALISON	f	He's very handsome, thank you.
SIDNEY	m	Right.
ALISON	f	You know what I don't understand? You're desperate to get a story in the magazine - so why wouldn't you play ball with Eleanor, write the puff-piece?
SIDNEY	m	I resent being bribed to gush sycophantically about a star, okay? I choose to gush sycophantically. Alison stares at Sidney trying to figure him out.
SIDNEY	m	It's okay anyway. Clayton's given me a story. I'm on my way.
ALISON	f	Well, that's good. Sidney smiles back at her. They look at each other...it's almost the start of a MOMENT... Then suddenly on the TV above the bar, a MOVIE TRAILER begins. Distracted Sidney turns to watch - it's Sophie Maes' new film - The Suffragette - Sophie, a glamorous Emily Pankhurst... Sidney looks back to Alison but she has turned away, suddenly awkward.
SIDNEY	m	Okay, well...better get going.(Leaving) You take my advice, you'll get yourself a boyfriend who's going to show up once in a while. He leaves. Beat. Alison stares at the empty stool beside her.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Which makes it...a half page left. Lawrence? Any ideas?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Yeah. Rachel Petkoff, fabulous  sixties actress, one of my all time favourites. Just made a wonderful movie called Five Boroughs. I think she's poised for a come-back and I think we should get there first, do a profile. Sidney stares at him in disbelief. He looks over to Alison who avoids his gaze.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Sounds good. Let's do it. Okay that's it people.
SIDNEY	m	Uh...Clayton?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	What?
SIDNEY	m	Did you read my story on Vincent Lepak? Clayton frowns down at some papers, feigning distraction.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	What? Oh, yeah. That's...that's not going to work. Sidney can't believe it. Clayton gets up to leave.
SIDNEY	m	Rachel Petkoff? One of your  favourite actresses? You'd never fucking heard of her! That was my idea! Lawrence stops and turns back.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	So it was. You have any more good ideas don't forget to bring them to my new office. He is about to walk on but remembers something.
SIDNEY	m	What? You spend half your life chatting up the staff!
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	When I do it it's called flirting. When you do it it's called sexual harassment. Consider this an official warning. I won't tolerate sexist behaviour. He walks off. Sidney glowers after him.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	I know that wasn't Greg's way of  working but Greg isn't deputy  editor any more. I am, and I'm making changes. There is a knock at the door and Sidney walks in with an attractive BLONDE WOMAN in a long coat and dark glasses.
SIDNEY	m	Uh, Lawrence? This lady's been looking for you?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	(to the woman) Can I help you?
WOMAN	f	Are you Lawrence Maddox? The new deputy editor?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Yes?
WOMAN	f	Well, I've just come to say congratulations on your promotion.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Thank you. I'm sorry, you are...?
WOMAN	f	I'm your present. The Woman produces a Beat-Box from behind her back and switches it on. She drops her coat to reveal underwear and stockings underneath. Maddox stares in frozen horror as the STRIPPER dances over to him, removing her bra.
INGRID	f	Hey Mrs Harding. Two Impeccably-Dressed Little Girls follow Mrs Harding into the room.
INGRID	f	Oh my God! So adorable!
MRS HARDING	f	(to the Little Girls) And this is the Fashion Department. [To Ingrid] Where's Mr Maddox now?
INGRID	f	Oh he's down the hall. Room 217.
SIDNEY	m	(with mock horror) Uh, Lawrence? This is...this is sort of inappropriate isn't it?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Will you please...
SIDNEY	m	Oh God, this is...this is awful...
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Hello, Mrs Harding. Girls...
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Get in.
SIDNEY	m	I didn't know it was Take Our Daughters To Work Day. I didn't even know there was a Take Our daughters To Work Day.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Shut up. (Beat) You know, when I told my wife I'd hired another Brit, she was excited. She still thinks you're all like something from Pride and Prejudice. But you Sidney ...you're like a British person born in New Jersey. (Shaking his head) Why did I hire you?
SIDNEY	m	I don't know - why did you hire me?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	I had an attack of nostalgia. It's passed. Like gas.
SIDNEY	m	What was wrong with my story?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	What?
SIDNEY	m	Why did you kill my Vincent Lepak story?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	It wasn't good enough. Plain and simple.
SIDNEY	m	It wasn't good enough?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	We don't do hatchet jobs here.
SIDNEY	m	It isn't a hatchet job!
CLAYTON HARDING	m	This opening quotation - "It's only too easy to catch people's attention by doing something worse than anyone else has dared do it before..." Who are you thinking of here? Vincent or yourself?
SIDNEY	m	He's a talentless, pretentious little twat who thinks cinema began with Tarantino and someone needs to say it. And you told me to do something with teeth! You said...
CLAYTON HARDING	m	I'm trying to run a fucking magazine here! Sidney stares at him, angry and disappointed.
SIDNEY	m	"A free press is the last defence against the Tyranny of Stupidity."
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Save me your tin-pot philosophy, okay?
SIDNEY	m	It isn't mine. It's yours. First issue of Snipe.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Oh, grow the fuck up, will ya! You're not Robin Hood and you never were. You bitch about famous people for the same reason I bitched about them. Because they got invited to the Party and you didn't. Well you're at the Party now so quit bitching and do your job! You're on your last life here, you understand? One more fuck up like today and you're gone.
SIDNEY	m	Won't you have to run a decision like that past Eleanor first? For a second Clayton looks like he might throw his ashtray at Sidney. Then he controls himself.
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Get out. Sidney crosses to the door.
SIDNEY	m	(he can't help himself) Looks like I was too late to save you after all. He walks out.
ALISON	f	You hired a stripper?
SIDNEY	m	I didn't "hire" him. Bob did it for a favour.
ALISON	f	I thought you wanted to be a success here?
SIDNEY	m	I do! It's just...(ruefully) It wasn't me. It was Clark. Alison laughs.
ALISON	f	The famous alter-ego? How long's he been hanging around?
SIDNEY	m	Since I was a kid. Anytime something got broken, or the bathroom got accidentally set on fire - it wasn't me. It was Clark. (Beat.) The weird thing is, he kind of took over.
ALISON	f	How old were you?
SIDNEY	m	I don't know, twenty, twenty one... Alison laughs.
ALISON'D)	?	Well, let me tell you, if only you could get rid of that Clark, you could be a real winner.
SIDNEY	m	Clayton's not going to print anything I write. I've been on salary for six-months and I've written precisely one hundred and seventy five words. On a dollar- per-word basis, I'm the highest paid writer in the history of this magazine.(Beat) He's not going to renew my contract.
ALISON	f	What did you expect, Sidney? Vincent's one of Eleanor's clients. I told you. They're Untouchables.
SIDNEY	m	I thought Clayton was different. I really did. (Beat) The only thing I'm good at is pissing people off, and he won't let me do it. (Beat) "My glory walks hand in hand with my doom." (Off her look) Troy
ALISON	f	Troy who?
SIDNEY	m	Troy, the movie.
SIDNEY	m	Everybody hates me here. You're the only one who'll talk to me.
ALISON	f	You cornered me.
SIDNEY	m	(a little embarrassed) No, I mean it. You're the person who's been most, you know... uh...abusive to me.
SIDNEY	m	You want another drink?
ALISON	f	(beat, smiling) Alright. I'll have a beer. Sidney walks off.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Sophie, my darling. Looking ravishing as always. Whilst the two are engaged in kissing cheeks, Sidney takes a credit card from his wallet and drops it surreptitiously by Sophie's feet.
JOURNALIST	m	You know what I read the other day? Your collection of poems - The Hollow Heart? Man, they're great. Sidney reacts to this, feeling troubled for some reason.
SOPHIE MAES	f	You write poems?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	In another life. The BARMAN is handing out drinks.
BARMAN	m	And a White Russian?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Right here. Sidney stares at the drink, feeling like he's just been punched in the stomach. Maddox notices him.
SIDNEY	m	That's...that's mine.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	But your name's not "Hon".
SIDNEY	m	(reaching for it) It's short for "Honourable".
LAWRENCE	m	(whisking it away) As in, "the Honourable Sidney Young"?
SIDNEY	m	Can I please...?
LAWRENCE	m	(holding it out of
SIDNEY'S REACH)	?	So how come it says "Hon Young"? They made you sound like some Korean medical student.
SIDNEY	m	They screwed it up. Please.
LAWRENCE	m	Sidney baby, you don't wanna go faking a British title to impress Sophie. It's the Fourth of July. (Handing back the card): We're celebrating the fact that we threw a bunch of British aristocrats out.
SIDNEY	m	Why don't you shut up, Maddox?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Careful Sidney. Remember - if it wasn't for us you'd all be speaking German.
SIDNEY	m	You're Canadian. If it wasn't for us you'd be speaking French.
SIDNEY	m	(muttering to himself) Choke. Choke. He puts his fingers to his temples as if to channel telekinetic powers.
SIDNEY	m	Choke...choke... Sidney realizes Harding's wife is passing with her two daughters.
SIDNEY	m	Hello, Mrs Harding. Lovely party. With a look of alarm she shepherds the girls away. A tall older man dressed in white with a long white beard appears next to Sidney.
OLDER MAN	m	How are you? Sidney nods gloomily.
SIDNEY	m	Yup.
OLDER MAN	m	You should walk with bare feet as much as possible, ground all that  negative energy. Sidney examines him.
SIDNEY	m	So...you're a wizard or...?
OLDER MAN	m	I'm a spiritual healer.
SIDNEY	m	You can make a living doing that?
OLDER MAN	m	Oh God no. I'm a dentist.  They stare at the party for a moment.
SIDNEY	m	Um...no, thanks.
SIDNEY	m	Hey! Hello again? Rachel smiles at him distantly, clearly not remembering him.
RACHEL	f	Hello. (Turning back to the others) No, Lawrence is a wonderful writer. I really felt like he got to the heart of me. Sidney snorts. Rachel turns back to him, faintly irritated.
RACHEL	f	I'm sorry, have we...?
SIDNEY	m	Sidney. Sidney Young. We met at... Another GUEST walks past Sidney and kisses Rachel.
GUEST	m	I saw Five Boroughs the other day and wept!
SIDNEY	m	In-ger-lernd! In-ger-lerrrrrrnd! He spots HUGH GRANT amongst the crowd, watching him, puzzled.
SIDNEY	m	You! Grant! Come on! In-ger- lerrrr... With that he slips from the balustrade and crashes into the shrubbery below.
ALISON	f	You okay?
SIDNEY	m	What?
ALISON	f	I said are you okay?
SIDNEY	m	I'm fine. Yup. Fine. (Beat) You?
ALISON	f	Yup. (Beat) No, actually. I hate my life so, you know, I'm gonna get drunk. Sidney nods, vaguely. They stand in awkward silence for a moment. Then...
SIDNEY	m	Right...See you... He walks off. Beat. He walks back into frame suddenly.
ALISON	f	What?
SIDNEY	m	How the...You...having an affair with Maddox! I mean...Maddox for Christ's sake! The Man With Hidden Shallows! Jesus! I mean, I used to think you were...I was starting to...I mean, at first I thought you were a pain but then I started to think...but I mean...Maddox? How can you live with yourself? Alison stares at him, pale, blinking back tears.
ALISON	f	I couldn't. That's why I've broken up with him.
SIDNEY	m	Well, that's no...that's, you know...(Beat) You broke up with him? Alison walks off. Beat. She walks back.
ALISON	f	Which leg did you hurt?
SIDNEY	m	This one. Alison kicks the leg.
SOPHIE MAES	f	You know what? There's something very damaged about you.
SIDNEY	m	Huh...
SOPHIE MAES	f	Like an animal that's been hit by a car or something. Like a deer or...like a pig maybe? When they walk funny and the other animals keep away from them. Little limpy pig. I'm drawn to sick animals. That's why I picked Cuba - because he had like psychological problems? (Her eyes well with tears) Poor little Cuba. Where is he now?
SIDNEY	m	Huh...
SOPHIE MAES	f	Jesus, I'm wasted. Are you wasted? I'm wasted.
SIDNEY	m	Congratulations on becoming incredibly famous by the way.
SOPHIE MAES	f	Thanks.
SIDNEY	m	What's it like?
SOPHIE MAES	f	What's what like?
SIDNEY	m	Everything.
SOPHIE MAES	f	Weird. It's happening so fast and...it's like it's got nothing to do with me. It's like I'm not even really here. She laughs softly.
SIDNEY	m	You're here. She turns back to look at the stars.
SOPHIE MAES	f	I'm so hungry.
SIDNEY	m	Would you...would you like me to get you some food?
SOPHIE MAES	f	Are you crazy? There might still be a photographer around. They lie in silence for a moment. You know what would be nice though? Some coke. She rubs her face, close to falling asleep.
SIDNEY	m	(out of breath) Wizard! Wizard Dentist Man! Need Wizard Dentist Man!
SIDNEY	m	I will never, never, never forget this. Thank you! He starts to hurry away.
SIDNEY	m	What are you doing?
ALISON	f	None of your business...
SIDNEY	m	You can't drive. You need to go and sleep this off somewhere.
ALISON	f	Firstly, you are a stupid asshole and I hate you and Secondly... Secondly... She muses on what she was going to say next. Sidney looks over his shoulder, imagining Sophie waiting for him.
ALISON	f	Secondly...
SIDNEY	m	Yeah, okay. Listen, you try driving in this state you're gonna kill yourself.
ALISON	f	Who'd care if I did? Beat. Suddenly she bursts into tears. Surprised, Sidney stands, uncertain what to do.
ALISON	f	I've got to go. Got to go. Sidney holds her to stop her falling. He stares back at the pool and then down at Alison.
ALISON	f	I thought I had it all figured out. A - get the hell out of Port Huron, come to New York. B - do the serious journalism thing to pay the bills while I, you know, write the novel. C- Win a Pulitzer. E...
ALISON	f	D - I don't know what D was. Then I took the internship at Sharps and I met Maddox and he was...he was so...and before I know it I'm writing, you know, Ten Tips for the fucking Metrosexual and pretending this is what I wanted but this ISN'T what I wanted! And that's...that's why I hated you...
SIDNEY	m	I didn't know you hated me.
ALISON	f	...because you were right about me. I'm a ghoul, writing fluff!
SIDNEY	m	You're not a Ghoul. You're a Zombie. Alison leans her head against the window.
ALISON	f	But he isn't the person you think he is, okay? Maddox. That's just a front. He thinks he's let himself down by giving up the poetry and he's unhappy. And the marriage is a sham, I mean... I just...I couldn't end it. I just couldn't and...
SIDNEY	m	(can't take anymore) Look, I don't need to hear this.
ALISON	f	Fine.
ALISON	f	Need a cigarette. Where are my fucking cigarettes?
SIDNEY	m	You don't smoke.
ALISON	f	Oh yeah.
ALISON	f	Do you think I have low self- esteem? Am I afraid of a real relationship? Do I think an affair is all I deserve? I mean, okay, he's handsome and successful and he's great in bed...
SIDNEY	m	Could you just be quiet?
ALISON	f	When I told him I couldn't see him any more...I don't know if he cared. I love him and, and I don't know if he cares!
SIDNEY	m	Well, I'm...I'm sure he does. He's probably just not very good at expressing his emotions.
ALISON	f	I'm so fucking sophisticated! I mean there's not even a little bit of Port Huron left, right? I've got the haircut and the job and I've got the parties and I've even, I've even got the affair because that's what sophisticated fucking people do!
SIDNEY	m	Alright. Alright. Don't, you know, get snot everywhere...
ALISON	f	Oh G-God...
SIDNEY	m	What? Alison lurches down out of sight and is sick on Sidney's shorts.
SIDNEY	m	Alison? What's your address? (Beat. Shaking her) Alison? Alison snores loudly. Sidney sighs.
SIDNEY	m	Shut up will you? You'll wake the old witch up. He stops suddenly and turns. Mrs Kowalski glowers at him from the doorway. Sidney freezes - a sickly smile on his face.
SIDNEY	m	Did...Did we wake you?
SIDNEY	m	Hello Dad.
ALISON	f	(as she goes by) Love this song...
SIDNEY	m	She, uh, she isn't actually a prostitute.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	Oh good.
ALISON	f	Sooo, Sidney's dad. Good to meet you. I'm Alison. I'm from Port Huron. (To Mrs Kowalski) And you must be Sidney's mom?
MRS KOWALSKI	f	No I am not!
ALISON	f	Oh, okay. My dad married again too, so that's cool. (To Richard) You wanna dance?
RICHARD YOUNG	m	No thank you.
ALISON	f	Okay. Where are my cigarettes? (feeling in the pocket of the jacket) What is that?
ALISON	f	Oh, hey, is that....?
RICHARD YOUNG	m	I think it is probably cocaine.
SIDNEY	m	It wasn't actually for me. I was going to give it to this young actress...
ALISON	f	So, hey, visiting your boy. That's nice. You must be pretty proud of him, huh?
SIDNEY	m	I think you should lie down Alison.
ALISON	f	He's doing just great at the magazine.
ALISON	f	First we all thought he was kinda creepy because he was always hanging around the water-cooler, hitting on women...
SIDNEY	m	Really Alison, I think...
ALISON	f	But I think that was pretty much an act. So, Mister Sidney, whatcha doing here?
RICHARD YOUNG	m	Please, call me Richard. I've written a little book so I'm doing a few talks.
ALISON	f	A book! Hey - I'm writing a book. What's yours about? Don't tell me - it's a thriller, right?
RICHARD YOUNG	m	No, nothing so interesting I'm afraid. I'm a philosopher.
ALISON	f	Philosophy? Really? Have you written any...
ALISON	f	Oh my God...Richard? R.C. Young? You're R.C Young? (To Sidney) You...you didn't say...
RICHARD YOUNG	m	I'd love to hear what you think of the book if you have time to read it. Alison snorts with laughter.
ALISON	f	What would Sidney know about philosophy?
RICHARD YOUNG	m	Well, he does have a Masters in the subject. Alison stares at Sidney. She breaks into a snorting laugh again.
ALISON	f	You're shitting me! Sidney? He...he likes Con Air! She stops laughing, hit by a sudden wave of nausea.
ALISON	f	I...I don't feel very well. Mrs Kowalski stands up.
MRS KOWALSKI	f	Come on. It is time you went to bed. (To Sidney) You can sleep on the couch.
ALISON	f	Okay. Better go before I find out something else I don't know about Sidney. Mrs Kowalski turns to Richard.
MRS KOWALSKI	f	It was a pleasure to meet you Lord Young. Alison stares at Sidney who smiles weakly.
SIDNEY	m	You should have said you were coming.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	That would have required you answering one of my calls.
SIDNEY	m	I've been pretty busy.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	Which reminds me, I was talking to a publisher friend of mine the other day. He mentioned that they were planning a series of introductory texts on philosophers. I wondered if you would be interested?
SIDNEY	m	I have a job, dad.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	Of course, of course. I picked up a copy of your magazine at the airport.
SIDNEY	m	Why've you always got to do this? It's...it's...
RICHARD YOUNG	m	It was just a joke Sidney...
SIDNEY	m	Actually it's not. Because you're saying that what I do for a living is worthless and...
RICHARD YOUNG	m	I don't think it's worthless. I just think, in your heart, you know you could do more with your life than...
SIDNEY	m	More? Sharps is one of the most respected magazines in the world. There's a million hacks who would kill to be where I am now.
SIDNEY	m	You know who I interviewed recently? Nathan Lane.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	I don't know who...
SIDNEY	m	I KNOW you don't know who that is! You don't know who anyone is! You thought Brad Pitt was a cave in Yorkshire! But most people do know who they are, okay? And most people wouldn't think that a journalist who gets to mix with stars like that was a, a disappointment!
RICHARD YOUNG	m	I don't think you're a disappointment Sidney. I've never thought that. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
SIDNEY	m	Things haven't really been that great. I don't know what it is. (Beat) I'm not... getting ahead.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	If you're not happy...
SIDNEY	m	No. I'm fine. I know I can make it.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	Einstein said "Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value."
SIDNEY	m	What? No. We're just friends.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	I saw the way you looked at her. Sidney considers this, knowing it's true.
SIDNEY	m	She doesn't feel that way about me. New York women don't date losers.
RICHARD YOUNG	m	I suppose not. But Alison is from Port Huron, isn't she? Sidney stares at him.
ALISON	f	I don't remember very much but I'm so, so sorry. I'll get myself together and get going...
SIDNEY	m	Why? No, you're all right. It's...it's nice to have the company.
ALISON	f	Oh God...your father. And that woman.
SIDNEY	m	Mrs Kowalski? Don't worry about it. The last woman she caught me with had a penis, so you know...you're a big step up.
ALISON	f	Thanks.
ALISON	f	Who's that?
SIDNEY	m	That's my mother.
ALISON	f	No way!
SIDNEY	m	Yeah, I don't take after her...
ALISON	f	Was she a model?
SIDNEY	m	Actress.
ALISON	f	Wow. Movies?
SIDNEY	m	Some. British, small parts...
ALISON	f	Is she...
SIDNEY	m	No, she died when I was young.
ALISON	f	Must have been pretty cool having your mom in the movies.
SIDNEY	m	Yeah, I suppose. I used to see her on the TV every now and then when I was growing up. Sort of weird.
SIDNEY	m	Here we go! English fry-up. Perfect hangover cure.
SIDNEY	m	Sorry, I was just...uh...(He can't think of an excuse) ...rooting through your private possessions... Alison sits on the couch, feeling too ill to be annoyed.
SIDNEY	m	I like the opening.
ALISON	f	You do?
SIDNEY	m	I do. Can I read the rest of it? Believe it or not, I'm a pretty good editor.
ALISON	f	I don't know. I don't even know if I'm going to bother finishing it.
SIDNEY	m	"Keep true to the dreams of thy youth." Alison examines him through narrowed eyes.
ALISON	f	Is that from Troy again?
SIDNEY	m	Schiller. She puts her things back in her bag.
ALISON	f	I'll jump in the shower and then I really will get out of your hair. Sidney watches, not wanting her to go.
SIDNEY	m	Oh, I forgot...I got you a present.
SIDNEY	m	I was just walking past this music shop on the corner and I saw it. I thought it might cheer you up. Alison is deeply touched.
ALISON	f	That's...I don't know what to say. (Beat) I haven't got a turntable.
SIDNEY	m	Oh. (Beat) Well, you can always come here to listen to it. Sidney takes the record and puts it on the turntable in the corner of the room. He selects the finale music - it's funny and sad, glamorous and romantic... They listen to it for a moment. Sidney starts to dance a little. He cha-cha's over to her and holds out his hand.
ALISON	f	Are you kidding? I could throw up on you again.
SIDNEY	m	C'mon... Alison reluctantly gets up. They dance ironically. Alison laughs a little. Gradually they get more into it, enjoying the music - a man in shorts and a woman in pyjamas, cha-cha-chaing, a summer breeze wafting in the through the open windows behind him...
INGRID	f	Hey, Alice? Versace. You like?
ALISON	f	I'm good, thanks.
INGRID	f	Honey, everyone needs to change their look every now and then. Especially if they have a new man in their life.
ALISON	f	What are you talking about?
ANNA	f	Tell me it isn't so.
ALISON	f	Of course not.
ANNA	f	Thank God. Can you imagine? He's such a creep.
ANNA	f	These are gorgeous, but I'm just too fat.
INGRID	f	Oh don't be crazy! Alice? Is Anna fat?
ALISON	f	Not at all. Why, she's so thin I could just take her little spindly body and snap it over my knee like a dry fucking twig.
ANNA	f	Thanks.
ALISON	f	Oh, and for your information Sidney Young has got more going for him than most of the men in this town. She gets up to leave, the others gawping after her.
SIDNEY	m	Hey Alison, I was wondering if you wanted to...(Beat. Starting again) Hello there. Listen I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie or...a meal...or...(Beat, starting again.) Alison. You wanna go on a date? We see he is staring at his reflection in a mirror. He slips in a pair of PLASTIC FANGS and smiles toothily.
SIDNEY	m	I like your costume Vincent.
VINCENT	m	I'm not wearing a costume.
SIDNEY	m	Oh. They walk on.
VINCENT	m	Idiot.
SIDNEY	m	Wanker. Sidney continues through the crowd to Alison. He puts his Dracula TEETH in.
SIDNEY	m	Haven't we met somewhere before?
ALISON	f	That's why I don't go there any more. They smile, but Alison seems a little nervous.
ALISON	f	I've been looking for you actually. There's, uh, there's something I need to...
SIDNEY	m	(Mumbling through his
TEETH)	?	Me first. Listen I was wondering if you want to go to the movies or maybe for a, uh....
ALISON	f	What? I can't understand what you're saying.
SIDNEY	m	Sorry. I was just saying... Maddox appears and gives Alison a glass of champagne. He kisses her.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Back in a minute. He walks off again. Sidney stares dumbly after him.
ALISON	f	I wanted to tell you. Lawrence has left his wife. We're going to be together. Officially. She watches for Sidney's reaction.
SIDNEY	m	Well...that's...that's brilliant.
ALISON	f	Yeah, so...maybe he does care after all, right?
SIDNEY	m	Yup. They stand in an awkward silence, watching the party.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Hello Sidney. Someone said you'd come as a Count but I thought I'd misheard. Sidney doesn't answer, turns to leave.
SIDNEY	m	Yeah.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Yeah. Should have done it long ago but, you know me - just not very good at expressing my emotions. Right? Oh Sidalee...I thought as much. Did you really think you and Alison...? Things really haven't worked out too well for you here, have they? Ah, well. You gave it your best shot. He walks out. Sidney stares after him, burning.
SIDNEY	m	Wait! Eleanor wait! The window glides down.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Yes?
SIDNEY	m	Let me do the profile on Vincent.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	I don't think so. The window begins to slide up. Sidney hangs onto it.
SIDNEY	m	You get full copy approval. It'll be like you've written it! The window stops. Eleanor stares at him, considering. Sidney looks past her to Vincent.
SIDNEY	m	Vincent - think about it, think how humiliating it will be for me. I'm begging you. Vincent leans over, stares over his shades at Sidney.
VINCENT	m	(Beat, enjoying this) You don't look like you're begging. Beat. Sidney kneels down on the side-walk beside the limousine. The rain pours down on him. The limousine drives away. Sidney stares dumbly up at something across the street.
REVERSE	m	On the building across the street is an ENORMOUS ANIMATED BILLBOARD L'OREAL ADVERTISEMENT - SOPHIE MAES, in a gold ball-gown and make-up, hair coiffured in classic forties Hollywood style. As we watch she BLOWS US A KISS. Underneath is the slogan - I'm Here...
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Lawrence Maddox is no longer working for Sharps. Seems Elizabeth got sick of him screwing around and kicked him out.
SIDNEY	m	She kicked him out?
CLAYTON HARDING	m	Richard Heywood doesn't seem to like the idea of employing an ex- son-in-law. So he's gone. So's Alison Olsen. Sidney stares at him.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	(noticing the magazine) Well, well...little Sidalee. I feel like a proud Papa.
ALISON	f	Right. (Beat) How hot is she?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Who?
ALISON	f	The new talent?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Do you think you could drop the little wife routine? It's kind of in bad taste. Alison stares at him sadly
ALISON	f	I guess you're right.(Quietly) What goes around comes around. Maddox is about to say something but changes his mind.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	I'll see you back home. He is about to leave when he notices Alison's notebook on the table. And will you stop carrying that thing around with you? It's kind of embarrassing. He walks off.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Sophie's going to get a Golden Globe nomination for best actress.
SIDNEY	m	Wow. That's fantastic.(Beat) But...the nominations haven't been announced yet?
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	That is correct so we have absolutely no way of knowing whether or not she will be nominated. (Beat) So, if she is nominated we want Sharps to do a feature. Someone to cover the whole lead up, unrestricted access, the trajectory, the building of this unique brand.
SOPHIE MAES	f	I'm going to have a logo.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Here's the deal. Sophie wants you to do it. Sidney stares at her and then at Sophie, stunned.
SOPHIE MAES	f	You can be my bitch.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	Merry Christmas, Sidney. This is a cover story. I think a little celebration is in order.
KEVIN BACON	m	Okay, uh...Clark Gable. Go!
SIDNEY	m	Clark Gable to Vivien Leigh (Gone With The Wind), Vivien Leigh to Marlon Brando (Street Car Named Desire), Marlon Brando to Robert DeNiro (The Score) Robert De Niro to Kevin Bacon (Sleepers)! The crowd cheers.
ACTRESS	f	Sexiest philosopher?
SIDNEY	m	Uh, tricky, but I'm gonna say Nietzsche. Huge moustache. The Tom Selleck of Nihilism.
ACTRESS	f	Um...most evil philosopher.
SIDNEY	m	Okay. Good. Evil genius philosopher...Hobbes, proto-Nazi, Heidegger - actual Nazi, Hegel - twat. Basically your H's...
ACTRESS	f	Most Hollywood philosopher?
SIDNEY	m	Uh...Bishop Berkely.
ACTRESS	f	What'd he say?
SIDNEY	m	Esse est percipi.
FIRST ACTRESS	m	What does that mean?
SIDNEY	m	If they `aint looking at you, you don't really exist.
ACTRESS	f	Oh honey, tell me something I don't know... Sidney stoops and snorts a line of coke.
ALISON	f	Hey.
SIDNEY	m	Hey.
ALISON	f	Nice robe.
SIDNEY	m	Thanks. It was a gift. Ralph Lauren.
ALISON	f	Who from?
SIDNEY	m	Ralph Lauren. I did a piece. Beat. He still hasn't invited her in.
ALISON	f	I just wanted to say I heard about you getting the promotion. Congratulations. I'm happy for you.
SIDNEY	m	Thanks. How's things with you and...
ALISON	f	Good. Fine. Everything's ...uh...I'm working for this little literary magazine. It's not the New Yorker but... (awkward) So, I've left you a bunch of messages...
SIDNEY	m	Yeah. I've been pretty busy.
ALISON	f	I thought so.
ALISON	f	Okay, well...
SIDNEY	m	How's the novel coming along?
ALISON	f	Oh, well...still working on it.
SIDNEY	m	Well...keep at it. I believe in you.
SIDNEY	m	I never gave you these.
ALISON	f	You know...
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	Sidney?
INGRID	f	(a little wave) Hey, Alice.
SIDNEY	m	(half joking, half
MEANING IT)	?	How did it all go so wrong?
SOPHIE MAES	f	You didn't do it!
SIDNEY	m	High.
SOPHIE MAES	f	You let me down!
SIDNEY	m	Too high! You couldn't do it. Too high. Sophie calmly unzips her dress and steps out of it, standing in her underwear. There is applause from the on- lookers. Calmly she steps out of the window onto the ledge and disappears from sight. The on-lookers crane out of the window, yelling encouragement. After a moment Sophie appears at another window further along the wall and climbs back into the room to ecstatic applause. She stares imperiously at Sidney.
SOPHIE MAES	f	What are you?
SIDNEY	m	Your limpy pig.
SOPHIE MAES	f	What?
SIDNEY	m	I'm your limpy pig!
SOPHIE MAES	f	That's right! Okay, limpy pig. You need to pay a forfeit. Whatcha got?
SIDNEY	m	I've got my little limpy dance. Sidney dances a little, jiggling up and down.
SOPHIE MAES	f	Give me your ring. Sidney stops dancing, his smile fading a little.
SIDNEY	m	I...I can't...
SOPHIE MAES	f	Give me the ring. I want it.
SIDNEY	m	I can't. Sophie stares at him through narrowed eyes.
SOPHIE MAES	f	Okay, give me the ring and if I win tomorrow, I'll let you have sex with me. The on-lookers shriek with delight. Sidney stares at her. He looks past her to his reflection in the window - a drunk man in his underwear, swaying from side to side...
SIDNEY	m	(muttering to himself) You're a star. You're a big, bright shining star... He snorts a line and, leaning back, flicks blankly through TV channels - a sports programme, a news station, a sit-com re-run... He snorts another line, flicks stations - more sports, a music video, a black and white movie... Sidney stops, staring at the screen... TV SCREEN - we're watching the fifties British movie we saw at the beginning of the film. Sidney's MOTHER is typing at the desk in the background. She gets up from the desk and walks into another office. Sidney stares, frozen. Sidney's mother passes the LEAD ACTRESS who is staring out of the window, smoking. She stares at her sympathetically.
SIDNEY'S MOTHER	f	(Celia Johnson accent) Don't worry Mary...you'll meet him one day.
LEAD ACTRESS	m	How will I know when I do?
SIDNEY'S MOTHER	f	Oh, when you meet the One, you'll know... She walks on. Sidney stares at the screen.
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Well, well... Look at you...
SIDNEY	m	Is Alison here?
LAWRENCE MADDOX	m	Alison? No, we went our separate ways. Actually she left me. Tells me she's in love with someone else. Sidney stares at him.
SIDNEY	m	(taking her arm) I need my ring back. Sophie turns back to him, her smile fixed.
SIDNEY	m	I need my ring back. As if puzzled by her inability to make it to the stage, Sophie, still smiling, tries to pull her arm free. Eleanor is instantly beside them, trying to disengage Sidney's hand.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	(smiling, hissing) What are you doing? Let her go!
SIDNEY	m	She isn't the One. My mother gave me that ring and told me I had to give it to the One. She isn't the One. The applause is still going strong. TV Cameras move in on Sophie as she starts to struggle, her smile slipping. Sidney tries to pull the ring free from her finger. Officials move in.
ELEANOR JOHNSON	f	What the fuck are you doing?
SIDNEY	m	Just...Will you...I don't want to be on the inside. I don't want to be at the Party. I don't want to have have sex with you. (Beat) I
MRS KOWLASKI	f	Soddom and Gomarrah.
ON TV	m	Sophie kicks out at Sidney, ripping her dress in the process.
INGRID	f	Oh God no...not the Versace... Security pile on Sidney...
TICKET CLERK	m	The next available flight is ten am sir. Gets you into New York six thirty PM. Sidney sighs.
SIDNEY	m	Stop the car!
SIDNEY	m	How's the novel?
ALISON	f	Finished.
