JULIAN	m	Good morning.
ABEL	m	Ready?
ANNA	f	Yes.
ABEL	m	You look very nice.
ANNA	f	Thank you.
ABEL	m	You sure?
ANNA	f	Yes.
ANNA	f	Don't do anything stupid.
ABEL	m	We don't have any more money so what else could I do.
ANDREW WALSH	m	So how are we this morning?
ABEL	m	(gives a smile and nod)
ANDREW WALSH	m	Well I woke up feeling very good about this.
ABEL	m	Really?
ABEL	m	You've been telling me not to do this for a year.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Well we are going all in... so now I love it.
JOSEPH	m	So why is it you want this land?
ABEL	m	I'm sorry?
JOSEPH	m	It has been difficult for you to get me here, no? Over a year?
ABEL	m	Almost two.
JOSEPH	m	There are many like it around? And thanks to all these tests you paid for, we now know it is as much of a mess below the ground as it is above. My people have looked at your books, I know this is a lot of money for you, so why have you kept on us so... just for this ugly and polluted little piece of the earth.
ABEL	m	I have been looking over my fence at this property for a very long time.
JOSEPH	m	So it is just proximity?
ABEL	m	No... I imagine I want it for the same reason you did.
JOSEPH	m	And what's that?
ABEL	m	To grow.
JOSEPH	m	Well, I am in the garment business so I appreciate that sentiment. But I inherited this land from my uncle. Sadly he had no children of his own. He was the one that let them build these tanks here. So this place can do little for me... in fact thanks to all those tests you've done it may be a liability. As you know I offered to lease the site to you at a fair price, but you were not interested?
ABEL	m	No.
JOSEPH	m	Why not?
ABEL	m	I like to own the things I use.
JOSEPH	m	I can see that.
ABEL	m	So.
JOSEPH	m	Yes. This contract here, your lawyers have fully reviewed it?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Of course.
JOSEPH	m	And you have brought the money? (ABEL nodes yes) So you realize you have only thirty days to close this transaction?
JOSEPH	m	No extensions, no... contingencies whatsoever.
ABEL	m	I understand.
JOSEPH	m	I want you to know this up front. I am a very fair man but I believe in honoring contracts. You will fulfill your end of this contract and the property is yours. If you can't we will keep your money and will sell it to your competitor who has been chasing us almost as badly as you have. I like you, but know that the only reason I am choosing you is because of the favorable terms of this contract. So this is business... and when you sign this....
ABEL	m	I understand.
JOSEPH	m	Well then, let's see this money, and then I will sign these papers.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Congratulations.
ABEL	m	It's not ours yet.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Well, it was a hell of a job just getting them to this point. It's a good day for us. Take a walk around. Enjoy it for a second.
CONTRACTOR	m	Hello?
ABEL	m	There he is.
ABEL	m	You have done a beautiful job here.
CONTRACTOR	m	Thank you.
ABEL	m	I mean it. You and your men should be very proud.
CONTRACTOR	m	We are.
ABEL	m	Most people don't have anything beautiful like this to show for their day's work. You are a lucky man.
CONTRACTOR	m	I am.
ABEL	m	Well I thank you... my family will be very happy here.
CONTRACTOR	m	I hope so.
ABEL	m	Now I think I owe you some money.
CONTRACTOR	m	That may be true.
ABEL	m	It is.
ABEL	m	This is the seventeen outstanding. But we are arriving here in four days. It must be done.
CONTRACTOR	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	Well, I'll let you go.
ABEL	m	And the tile in the master bath...
CONTRACTOR	m	It's being replaced, as I mentioned to your wife, that was an error on our part. Congratulations on your home.
ABEL	m	Thank you.
ANNA	f	They broke his jaw.
ABEL	m	Have they found the truck?
ANNA	f	Yes.
ABEL	m	Are you alright?
ABEL	m	Have the police been here yet?
ANNA	f	He was left in the middle of the highway without a truck, they brought him in.
ABEL	m	Can you speak?
ANNA	f	Not for a couple days... Can I speak with you outside?
ANNA	f	Did they sign the contract?
ABEL	m	Yes.
ANNA	f	And took the deposit?
ABEL	m	Yes.
ANNA	f	So it's a go?
ABEL	m	(he gives a nice nod yes)
ANNA	f	Congratulations.
ABEL	m	To you as well.
ANNA	f	We have thirty days?
ABEL	m	These fucking guys. This poor kid has been working his ass off.
ANNA	f	Do you want me to speak to my Brother about this?
ABEL	m	No...don't talk to him or your father.
ANNA	f	This can't continue.
ABEL	m	It won't.
ANNA	f	It will if we don't do something.
ABEL	m	I'm meeting with the D.A. in the morning.
ANNA	f	Oh, fuck the D.A. He's more interested in coming after us than helping us.
ANNA	f	It's not fair to them. You're at war here.
ABEL	m	No we are not.
ANNA	f	Really... because they are.
ABEL	m	Well I'm not.
ANNA	f	And you're going out to check on the new house?
ABEL	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	I have to get going.
ABEL	m	Can we get you anything?
ABEL	m	We'll pick you up when they let you out of here.
ABEL	m	These men are cowards. Too weak to make a living... or even fight with their own hands, and too stupid to think up anything else to do.
ABEL	m	May I take it?
BEAT COP	m	Excuse me?
ABEL	m	May I take it now?
BEAT COP	m	Is it yours?
ABEL	m	Yes.
BEAT COP	m	Well, I'm sorry about that. Once the owner or an owner's representative files the claim form in Corona she's yours... again.
ABEL	m	So you guys have done what you needed to?
BEAT COP	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	And what was that?
BEAT COP	m	I'm sorry?
ABEL	m	You just said you've done what you needed to... so what was it that you've done?
BEAT COP	m	(looks back dumbfounded)
ABEL	m	Did you fingerprint or anything?
BEAT COP	m	No need, these guys always wear gloves.
ABEL	m	So you've done nothing.
BEAT COP	m	I'm not exactly sure, I just got here at four. My shift is actually up.
ABEL	m	So who's coming?
BEAT COP	m	Sorry.
ABEL	m	They stole the $6,000 of fuel that was in it.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Lawrence. Thank you for seeing us on such short notice.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Yes...
ANDREW WALSH	m	We need your help.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Our trucks. They are being robbed.
ANDREW WALSH	m	We have a serious security issue.
DEPUTY LANGE	m	There have been a series of hijackings of bulk-fuel delivery vehicles.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Our drivers are being put in danger.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Of course.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I understand. But this is turning into an urgent and pressing matter for us.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	My people are at risk just driving around in this city, just trying to do their jobs. And I... I have done everything you have asked of me. It's been two years since you first started investigating my company and I have spent thousands of dollars hiring lawyers for this and that to provide you with every piece of information your office has requested. And I expect that you have been asking the same from my competitors. So with all this information that you have gained... We are just asking if you have any idea who has been doing this to us?
ABEL	m	First, please know that we respect the work you are doing to try to help our business and the city. But also know I have never taken anything I haven't earned from anyone so when you say you've...
ABEL	m	We are on the same side here.
ABEL	m	Well, it makes a difference to me.
ABEL	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	I understand.
ABEL	m	You have your job to do. But know that you are wrong and that we will take advantage of every opportunity to prove that.
ABEL	m	I'm sorry?
ABEL	m	Yes?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Like what?
ABEL	m	I am always trying to expand my business.
ABEL	m	Every new market is a difficult market.
ABEL	m	But my driver was assaulted and my truck and oil were stolen in broad daylight in front of fifteen toll collectors and six police officers yesterday. And yet no one saw anything. That is a problem... no?
ABEL	m	I'm sure you do.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Abel. Abel.
ABEL	m	Exactly.
ANDREW WALSH	m	No... let's not overreact. We don't even know what they are bringing against us. It could be total bullshit, and they are just trying to use us along the way. This isn't anything yet.
ABEL	m	I know.
ANNA	f	How'd it go?
ABEL	m	The DA... He said he's going to bring down charges on us next week.
ANNA	f	For what?
ABEL	m	We don't know yet.
ANNA	f	Who else?
ABEL	m	Right now they are just saying us.
ABEL	m	Where are we exposed?
ANNA	f	We follow standard industry practice on every front.
ABEL	m	Anna?
ANNA	f	I need to know what they are saying we did.
ABEL	m	Okay.
ABEL	m	I'm very sorry this happened. Do you need anything else? (JULIAN nods no) If you do, you call the office... Okay then.
JULIAN	m	Abel?
JULIAN	m	Do you think I am ready to move into sales?
ABEL	m	I don't.
JULIAN	m	I... I'm not sure I will be able...
ABEL	m	You will.
JULIAN	m	Did you get the truck back?
ABEL	m	Yes. They took the load.
JULIAN	m	This is the sixth one?
ABEL	m	Seventh... you get some rest.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	Well, look who it is.
ABEL	m	Arnold.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	Just a touch off the side Jimmy. Not all of us are as lucky as Mr. Morales here in terms of keeping our hair.
BARBER JIMMY	m	You're a good looking man.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	I know I am. So I hear congratulations are in order?
ABEL	m	What's that?
ARNOLD KLINE	m	You got yourself in contract over there.
ABEL	m	We are working on it.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	Thirty day close I hear, you better be.
ABEL	m	We are, thanks for your concern.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	I saw a couple of your trucks over in Rego Park the other day.
ABEL	m	Really? When was that?
ARNOLD KLINE	m	A couple times.
ABEL	m	It's possible.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	Is it?
ABEL	m	Yes.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	That's a tough market.
ABEL	m	It is.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	My father struggled for years before he broke in there.
ABEL	m	Any new market is a tough one. I'll see you.
ANNA	f	I know it has been a long road, and that not all of you wanted to do this, but thank you. For me...
ABEL	m	A toast.
ABEL	m	A toast to our new home. It's as beautiful as my wife and daughters and as strong as me...(kids laugh) May we be happy, prosperous and safe here. Cheers.
PETER FORENTE	m	So you made the move?
ABEL	m	Peter... it's official as of yesterday.
COUNTER PERSON	m	Sir.
PETER FORENTE	m	So I heard about your rig getting picked off again.
ABEL	m	Yes.
PETER FORENTE	m	We should probably get together to discuss this and go over some of the preventative measures that we've been taking. We haven't had an incident since November. It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us.
ABEL	m	That's possible.
PETER FORENTE	m	The driver looked like a member of the Hitler Youth. I haven't seen a teamster that blond and blue-eyed since I was a kid.
ABEL	m	He's from Ohio. Played football. I like my drivers to fit in with the neighborhood...
PETER FORENTE	m	That's new territory for you, no?
ABEL	m	Just picked up a few new accounts over there. Weekend houses of some old clients from in the city.
PETER FORENTE	m	Which one is yours?
ABEL	m	Right there.
PETER FORENTE	m	She's beautiful.
ABEL	m	Thank you.
PETER FORENTE	m	Welcome to the neighborhood. You should be proud.
ABEL	m	Proud?
PETER FORENTE	m	Yes.
ANNIE	f	Dad. Mr. Walsh is here.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I'm sorry for the dramatic drop in but your phone doesn't seem to be working.
ABEL	m	It's not set up yet... So I am guessing this isn't good news here on a Sunday night.
ANDREW WALSH	m	No... It looks like they are coming after us.
ABEL	m	That describes many people at this point.
ANDREW WALSH	m	The D.A.
ABEL	m	How bad?
ANDREW WALSH	m	I still haven't seen it yet. But my guy in his office just gave me a heads up an hour ago. It's not good.
ABEL	m	Where are we exposed?
ANDREW WALSH	m	I'm not sure, a couple places probably.
ABEL	m	A couple places?
ABEL	m	Anna... Anna!
ANNA	f	Andrew.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Anna... sorry you've got no phone.
ABEL	m	As of tomorrow I'll have my new radio hooked up though so you should be able to reach me wherever I am...
ANDREW WALSH	m	The D.A. is going to bring down charges on us tomorrow.
ANNA	f	For what?
ANDREW WALSH	m	We don't know yet.
ANNA	f	Who else?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Right now they are just saying us.
ABEL	m	Where are we exposed?
ANNA	f	We follow standard industry practice on every front.
ABEL	m	What does that mean?
ANNA	f	You know what that means.
ANDREW WALSH	m	It means we may have some accounting exposure where we have pushed things a little too far.
ABEL	m	How far?
ANDREW WALSH	m	You always told us to push until we couldn't push any further. Well, we may have hit that line. So we will handle it and move on.
ABEL	m	Anna?
ANNA	f	I need to know what they are saying we did.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. You have always followed standard industry practices. We aren't even sure what this is yet. I just wanted to make sure you had all the information I do. This is a badge of honor, it means we are big enough to give a shit about now. Don't worry.
ABEL	m	Okay.
ANNA	f	Thank you for coming by Andrew.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Very impressive.
ABEL	m	Thank you.
ANNA	f	It only cost him a year of the kid's tuition.
ANDREW WALSH	m	And one more thing. I got a call from the union... O'Leary.
ANNA	f	What word?
ANDREW WALSH	m	There is real concern about their safety.
ABEL	m	Who?
ANNA	f	All of them.
ANDREW WALSH	m	The drivers are feeling unprotected.
ANNA	f	Because they are.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I just think you should talk to them about it. Before it grows into something.
ABEL	m	Okay.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Good night.
ANNA	f	What's he doing?
ABEL	m	Quiet... don't worry. It's nothing.
ABEL	m	Quiet. It's nothing. Come down here.
ABEL	m	Go. Oh come on. Go.
ANNA	f	Where were you?
ABEL	m	(looking to the dog) A lot of help you were.
ANNA	f	Abel?
ANNA	f	Who was it?
ABEL	m	What do you mean, how am I supposed to know who it was?
ABEL	m	I don't know.
ABEL	m	I think it was just some punk, looking to rip us off.
ANNA	f	If you...
ABEL	m	Ouch! If they had wanted to send a message he could have... and he didn't.
ANNA	f	Seems like a message was sent loud and clear.
ABEL	m	Please. Don't get going on this. We are a big new house. He probably wanted the TV. He didn't have a gun, he had nothing. The alarm will be in on Monday. It was some kid. They aren't coming back.
ABEL	m	What you are looking for here is the opening to the burn chamber. Now at this point you have not tipped your hat in anyway. From the minute you walked in the house you should have been working to create an impression of total impartiality. But now...
ABEL	m	When this door opens you begin to close. It must always be spotless. If they see you have ever done this before it is over.
ABEL	m	Now, you do this and only this... You look down at the cloth and don't say a word... You just keep staring at the cloth and then you slowly just start shaking your head. Very very slowly and small.
ABEL	m	Don't look up at them. Just at the cloth.
INSTRUCTOR	m	Do you hear that noise... that's the noise.
ABEL	m	It means you are close... Then after sitting in silence way longer than is comfortable, you turn. And say "I'd love to run a few numbers for you. Is there somewhere more comfortable we could sit." They will almost always take you to the dining room table and will offer you something. And whatever it is you always take the fancy option.
INSTRUCTOR	m	Can I get you a coffee or tea?
ABEL	m	A tea please.
INSTRUCTOR	m	We have some homemade lemonade or a soda.
ABEL	m	I'd love a lemonade, thank you.
ABEL	m	Because, we are never going to be the cheapest option, so we have to be the best. And they want... no, need... to feel that you want the best too. That's why our trucks are the newest or cleanest, and our drivers are approachable.
ABEL	m	I gotta go, but the final point I will make is the hardest one. Once you have done the math and shown them what we can save them over the long haul through proper maintenance, you need them to sign. And the problem is by hiring you that means they are firing someone else. And that's never easy. So to get them over the line you need to close them. So when you show them the number look up at them both... and just stare at them...
ABEL	m	You stare longer than you should. Because this is not a joke. You will only keep this job if you close. And that's not funny to you. And I am only interested in this company growing, and when it isn't I don't think it's funny at all. These people work very hard for their money and these other guys are ripping them off, treating them poorly, because they don't know... so when you look them in the eye you have to believe that we are better, and we are, but you will never do anything as hard as staring a person straight in the eye and telling the truth.
ABEL	m	Well... it was great to meet you. Welcome and I wish you luck.
ABEL	m	Good morning. First off, I picked up Julian yesterday and he is back home and doing much better. And I just wanted to make sure you are all aware that we are doing everything we can to deal with this situation. We are working with law enforcement, and they seem to be closing in on these guys. But, sadly these are the times we are living in and we must rise above them. So, on that front we have these.
ABEL	m	These will be in every truck by the end of the week. Much to my wife's concern I spent some serious coin and we now have our own closed channel that shouldn't have any blackout areas. You will always be in contact with us. (a hand goes up in the
BACK)	?	Yes, Eddy.
ABEL	m	We have been in constant contact with the union and they aren't considering any new course of action at this time.
ABEL	m	Yes.
ANNA	f	Catherine... Catherine. Katie!
CATHERINE	f	Mommy.
ANNA	f	Where did you get this? Catherine where did you find this?
CATHERINE	f	Right here.
ANNA	f	Show me.
CATHERINE	f	It was just sitting right here.
ANNA	f	Did you see this?
ELIZABETH	f	Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it.
ANNA	f	Maria!
ELIZABETH	f	What is it?
ANNA	f	Maria!
ELIZABETH	f	Mom, is it real?
ABEL	m	What is that?
ANNA	f	A gun... It's a gun Abel.
ABEL	m	Where did you get it?
ANNA	f	Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door. She was playing with it.
ANNA	f	It's loaded... with the safety off.
ANNA	f	Those weren't kids looking to rip off our TV Abel, that was a fucking goon with a loaded gun looking in our windows! What the hell is going on here?
ABEL	m	Let me see that. I'll take care of this.
ANNA	f	Damn right we will. Who is this?
ABEL	m	I don't know, but I will take care of it.
ANNA	f	What does that mean you will take care of it. This isn't a brick through our car window or some other cute little warning that I've put up with in the past. This is your daughter playing with a loaded gun!
ABEL	m	I know what it is!
ABEL	m	Let me deal with this.
ANNA	f	You better. Because you won't like what's going to happen once I start getting involved.
ABEL	m	You are not to tell your father about this.
ABEL	m	Do you hear me.
ANNA	f	...I won't.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Can I talk with you both?
ANNA	f	I found a gun outside our front door. Somebody left it there last night.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Who?
ABEL	m	I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Well...
ABEL	m	That truck just went out filthy.
ANNA	f	Abel!
ANDREW WALSH	m	We are going to owe them some money.
ABEL	m	How much?
ANDREW WALSH	m	That depends on a bunch of factors. But that's an accounting question.
ABEL	m	You need to get home and start going through our set of books. How far back are they going?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Seems like all the way back to when you bought out Anna's father.
ANNA	f	I'll get into it.
ABEL	m	What is O'Leary doing here?.
ANDREW WALSH	m	He's been wanting to talk to you for days.
ABEL	m	(under his breath) Jesus.
ANNA	f	Andrew can I talk to you for a minute.
ABEL	m	How are you Bill?
BILL O'LEARY	m	I'm ok. Can't say I'm used to making house calls like this anymore though.
ABEL	m	I would have come to see you.
BILL O'LEARY	m	That's alright. You've got bigger things to worry about. (Long pause) So, I can't have this situation with your guys continuing.
ABEL	m	My guys.
BILL O'LEARY	m	Your drivers.
ABEL	m	Good. I would love you to help on this. Because I can't have it going on any longer either.
BILL O'LEARY	m	So let them protect themselves, that would stop all this very quickly.
ABEL	m	I respectfully disagree.
BILL O'LEARY	m	They are picking on your men because they are just sitting there... weak.
ABEL	m	They are taking shots at me because I am growing, expanding, getting stronger not weaker.
BILL O'LEARY	m	It's quite simple for me: I can't have my drivers getting hit like this. It looks like I can't protect them.
ABEL	m	Well, it appears that you can't.
BILL O'LEARY	m	I can. And will. Because of all my job descriptions that is the one I consider most sacred.
ABEL	m	I agree. But these are truck drivers, not soldiers, this will lead to chaos.
BILL O'LEARY	m	It will stop immediately.
ABEL	m	No, it won't.
BILL O'LEARY	m	You seem to be under pressure from many sides right now... which I understand. Trust me I understand. So let me think this through. But whatever decision I make on this, it stands. Those men show up every morning for you because I tell them to. It's important for you to realize that these are very dangerous times, and we need to adapt. It's not like when we were driving.
ABEL	m	Yes.
BILL O'LEARY	m	Sometimes the weak man is the stronger man if he has the right tools.
ABEL	m	It may seem that way... but if you are weak eventually it will show... it always does. And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me.
BILL O'LEARY	m	It's not always as simple as it appears.
ABEL	m	I'm sure that's true.
BILL O'LEARY	m	It is... well, I got to get going.
ABEL	m	Thank you for coming Bill.
ANDREW WALSH	m	How did that go?
BILL O'LEARY	m	Not well.
ANDREW WALSH	m	He feels very strongly about this.
BILL O'LEARY	m	I can see that.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I don't think he fully understands it.
BILL O'LEARY	m	What's to understand?
ANDREW WALSH	m	It's illegal.
BILL O'LEARY	m	It's not illegal if I say it isn't. My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I care about that I can't do my job. That can not and will not continue.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I understand.
BILL O'LEARY	m	So talk to him. You need to protect yourself. This is very serious. Just know that.
ANDREW WALSH	m	How would this work?
BILL O'LEARY	m	What does that mean?
ANDREW WALSH	m	I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting.
BILL O'LEARY	m	Are you kidding me with this?
ANDREW WALSH	m	No.
BILL O'LEARY	m	Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun.
ANDREW WALSH	m	And a permit?
BILL O'LEARY	m	By Friday.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Are the permits legit?
BILL O'LEARY	m	That depends what they do with it. If they kill their wife with them, then no. Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Who is it?
BILL O'LEARY	m	I don't fucking know...
ANDREW WALSH	m	I'll talk to him.
ANNA	f	He's not here.
ANNA	f	Okay. I will.
ANDREW WALSH	m	How did that go?
BILL O'LEARY	m	Not well.
ANDREW WALSH	m	He feels very strongly about this.
BILL O'LEARY	m	I can see that.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I don't think he fully understands it.
BILL O'LEARY	m	What's to understand?
ANDREW WALSH	m	It's illegal.
BILL O'LEARY	m	It's not illegal if I say it isn't.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I understand.
BILL O'LEARY	m	So talk to him. You need to protect yourself. As a company.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I will try to talk with him.
BILL O'LEARY	m	This is very serious. Just know that.
ANDREW WALSH	m	How would this work?
BILL O'LEARY	m	What does that mean?
ANDREW WALSH	m	I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting.
BILL O'LEARY	m	Are you kidding me with this?
ANDREW WALSH	m	No.
BILL O'LEARY	m	Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun.
ANDREW WALSH	m	And a permit?
BILL O'LEARY	m	By Friday.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Are the permits legit?
BILL O'LEARY	m	That depends what they do with it. If they kill their wife with them, then no. Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Who is it?
BILL O'LEARY	m	I don't fucking know...
ANDREW WALSH	m	They just got another truck.
ABEL	m	I know.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Who was driving?
ABEL	m	Leo.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Is he alright?
ABEL	m	Yes.
ANDREW WALSH	m	The drivers' security aside... this shit is starting to have a very significant financial effect on us here. It can't continue.
ABEL	m	I know.
ANDREW WALSH	m	How was your talk? (nothing) I spoke with him after. He's going to keep going `til he gets the answer he's looking for.
ABEL	m	I said I wouldn't do it.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I'm not sure we are in a position to say that.
ABEL	m	What's that?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Do you want to go for a walk?
ABEL	m	Are you really serious with this, this is what it's come to, walking around outside like fucking gangsters?
ANDREW WALSH	m	I am and it is.
ANDREW WALSH	m	It is looking like we must do this.
ABEL	m	I must?
ANDREW WALSH	m	They will shut you down.
ABEL	m	These men, they work for me. These trucks they drive, the customers they serve. They are here because we built this.
ANDREW WALSH	m	That's true, until its not. And the last person in the world right now that we need working against us is the president of the fucking teamsters. This company is out of business in a month if he gets these guys to walk. We are running out of cash.
ABEL	m	What are you even talking about here?
ANDREW WALSH	m	The union provides a handgun and a permit to every one of the drivers. And they think this whole thing is over in a week.
ABEL	m	These men are fucking truck drivers. This is insane. You know who is gonna get it in the end here, me. This comes back to me.
ANDREW WALSH	m	It does either way.
ABEL	m	I'm not doing it.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Would you put everything at risk to stand by that.
ABEL	m	It will be the end of everything I have worked for. If one of these guys shoots somebody it's me they will bring down for it...I'll talk to him... And we need to close this deal. We can't stay like this any longer. We must close on that property... We are so weak right now.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Why do you want this so badly?
ABEL	m	Because I have my entire savings at risk with this deposit. It is everything.
ANDREW WALSH	m	That's not what I mean. Why did you want it so badly in the first place? It was a risk... always.
ABEL	m	I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH	m	You don't know? Have you ever thought about it?
ABEL	m	I've thought about it every day for the last five years. This place was sitting over that fence mocking....
ANDREW WALSH	m	I didn't mean have you ever thought about that place...
ABEL	m	I don't know what you mean.
ABEL	m	I know what you are asking and no... I never ask myself why I do this. It just feels right... wanting to be bigger feels better. It feels right.
ANDREW WALSH	m	That's very simple.
ABEL	m	Yes...
ABEL	m	...It is.
ANDREW WALSH	m	You take these risks...
ABEL	m	Only when necessary.
ANDREW WALSH	m	We have to get going, we need them to show up.
ANNA	f	Arthur.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	Anna, you look amazing as always.
ANNA	f	Thank you.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	Gentlemen. Do you know Ian Thompson? One of our new VP's.
ANNA	f	Ian.
WAITER	m	So what can I get you to drink?
ABEL	m	A lot.
ABEL	m	A wine list please.
WAITER	m	I'll be right back.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	So how are you?
ABEL	m	We've been better... but we are good.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	Yes I heard about that... if you stay in business long enough it's bound to happen eventually.
ANNA	f	Well that's exactly right. And we wanted to sit down with you tonight to make sure we were being totally up-front with everything that is going on and make sure that you understand the nature of the complaints and are comfortable that it is not going to affect our business in an adverse way.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Did you have a chance to look over the outline that I sent over?
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	Yes, we did.
ANNA	f	Hopefully it made clear that even in a worst case situation we will pay off any and all fines and be able to move forward with very comfortable capital on hand.
ABEL	m	But you should know Arthur that this man has been digging through our industry for over two years looking for anything he can find. And as you know probably better than anyone, having worked with some of our competitors the thought that he would have singled us out is ridiculous. It reeks of everything that is wrong with this city right now. We run a fair and clean business and follow every standard industry practice and I will fight `til my last day to prove that...
ABEL	m	But... but...
ABEL	m	...Don't think for a moment that I am going to allow this mess to interfere with our plan to grow. We need to know you are standing by us.
ABEL	m	That's a very good question. This property gives us many things... firstly direct access to the river. So I can bring in fuel directly from any provider in the world straight to my tanks, then it has over 10 million gallons of storage capacity, so I can buy in the summers when my price is low and sell to my customers and most importantly some of my competitors when the price is high. I won't just drive trucks anymore... I will control my fate... but the real answer to your question...
ABEL	m	... is that when it feels scary to jump Ian... that is exactly when you must jump... or you risk ending up staying in the same place your whole life... and that I can't do.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	We've always been there with you and know that we will continue to be.
ANNA	f	Well, that went about as well as could be expected.
ABEL	m	Yes. Arthur is a good man.
ANNA	f	Do you think they will close?
ABEL	m	Of course.
ABEL	m	Are you okay?
ANNA	f	Yes... you need to go put it out of its misery.
ABEL	m	Jesus.
ANNA	f	I mean it. We can't just leave it here.
ANNA	f	Is it dead?
ABEL	m	No.
ANNA	f	Well you need...
ABEL	m	I know.
ANNA	f	What are you doing?
ABEL	m	Getting the tire iron!
ANNA	f	Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. They were fine?
NANNY MARIA	f	Oh yes. All is good.
ANNA	f	Great, thank you. We'll see you in the morning then.
NANNY MARIA	f	Okay.
ANNA	f	What?
ABEL	m	What?
ANNA	f	Yes... what?
ABEL	m	Are you kidding?
ANNA	f	No.
ABEL	m	Okay then... what is this gun?
ANNA	f	I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some... fucking pussy... I did something about it.
ABEL	m	Where did you get it?
ANNA	f	You know where I got it.
ABEL	m	Do you have a permit?
ANNA	f	Not yet.
ABEL	m	You must be a bigger fucking idiot than I even thought. You are trying to protect your children? Protect them? Do you have any idea what happens if you get caught using that thing?
ABEL	m	You dress yourself up in these fancy clothes, and look at you here in your mansion. I've given you everything you could possibly want but you still can't stop thinking like the Brooklyn corner-store gangster's daughter that you are.
ANNA	f	You've given me? You? Are you delusional? Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you sound?
ABEL	m	Where is this thing? Let me see it.
ANNA	f	Abel.
ABEL	m	Let me see it. Is this going to make you safe?
ABEL	m	You know who uses guns like this? Whores!
ABEL	m	It's a trap... and you are walking right into it... You need to get that thing out of our house.
ANNA	f	You need to protect us.
ABEL	m	That is what I'm doing.
GROUP	m	Happy Birthday!
ABEL	m	I understand. But as you can see this is a terrible time for us. I am having my daughter's birthday party.
POLICE OFFICER	m	I understand and I apologize, I do. But this is a warrant and we need to gain complete access to the property.
ANNA	f	What is this?
POLICE OFFICER	m	Let me go check something.
ANNA	f	Are they serious?
ABEL	m	I'm going to kill this guy.
ANNA	f	Abel.
ABEL	m	Abel.
ABEL	m	Give me five minutes.
ABEL	m	Maria. Keep the kids playing for a few minutes.
ANNA	f	Mr. Lawrence is it?
ANNA	f	Anna Morales.
ANNA	f	May I speak with you for a minute.
ANNA	f	I understand you and your men have a job to do here. But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party.
ANNA	f	That's not a problem, as we have nothing to hide from you. It's just that, we recently moved to this area, and there are twenty guests in our house... please... can you give me five minutes so we can ask everyone to leave calmly before you come into my home?
ANNA	f	Thank you.
ANNA	f	Where are you going?
ABEL	m	Bring the last few out.
ANNA	f	You've got three minutes.
ABEL	m	What's going on out there.
ANNA	f	Our guests are leaving.
ABEL	m	Do we even need to be doing this? What exactly are we hiding here?
ANNA	f	I don't want them going through all this before I've had a chance to.
ABEL	m	Is that the last one. Get back out there.
ANNA	f	Thank you for coming. Here you go. Bye, Rebecca. Thanks. I'm sorry. Bye.
ANNA	f	This is probably one that you are going to regret.
ANNA	f	My husband is a very honorable man. Coming on a Saturday? It's very aggressive.
ANNA	f	Really? I know you think you are just doing your job. But we are not what you think we are. And you have embarrassed him in front of his family and friends.
ANNA	f	Good for you. My husband is not my father. Not even close. So if I were you I would start treating us with a little more respect or he'll make it our only mission to ruin you. This was very disrespectful... and you are not going to find a fucking thing.
ABEL	m	Hey, how are you?
ABEL	m	You'll do great. Remember... When you get them there. Hold the eye contact longer than you would like... but you watch what happens.
ABEL	m	Good luck.
ABEL	m	It is good to see you back here. You look good.
JULIAN	m	Thank you.
ABEL	m	Are you ready to get back to work?
JULIAN	m	I think so.
ABEL	m	You are.
JULIAN	m	Thank you.
ABEL	m	Where are you heading?
JULIAN	m	Bulk delivery to Chase.
ABEL	m	Manhattan. That's a cakewalk.
JULIAN	m	I feel very vulnerable.
ABEL	m	Good... Because you are. We all are. Someone came to my house a couple nights ago to rob me...
ABEL	m	I tried to chase them away... but really there's nothing I can do. I am vulnerable. We all are. They can come back tonight. But to succeed and be great you must keep going back. And I know what all these guys want to be doing. But it doesn't make you any safer.
ABEL	m	And then they will come after me with everything they have... So this is what we do. And the times will get better and safer. They will. So go. You are strong just by going. Stronger in fact.
HUSBAND	m	Hey.
HUSBAND	m	Sure. I just had one question about our exhaust chimney. Would you be willing to take a look.
HUSBAND	m	It's just outside on the other side of this wall here.
HUSBAND	m	Please.
JULIAN	m	Cathy! They are coming again. Over. Help. Help. On Bridge.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there.
JULIAN	m	Get the fuck away from me!
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Okay, man.
THUG #2	m	Over here.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Where is he?
THUG #2	m	Over here.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Get the car!
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Oh, there he is. Had to be the hero eh?
JULIAN	m	Fuck you.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Couldn't just let us take the truck.
JULIAN	m	Fuck you!
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Hey man relax... calm down. Did they see you come in here?
JULIAN	m	I don't think so.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Did they or not?
JULIAN	m	No.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Alright, there's a door down here about four more flights. Don't go out there, that's the street. Go down about two more flights after that and you'll come out below the bridge. They won't be there.
JULIAN	m	Fuck you!
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	You're welcome.
PETER FORENTE	m	It's a pretty cool machine, isn't it?
ABEL	m	Peter.
PETER FORENTE	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	I need to speak with you.
PETER FORENTE	m	I see that.
ABEL	m	This has gotten out of control... There was a guy with a gun at my house.
ABEL	m	My wife and children were home at the time.
PETER FORENTE	m	Is everyone okay?
ABEL	m	Yes. I managed to chase him off.
PETER FORENTE	m	Well, I'm sorry, that must have been scary... what can I do.
ABEL	m	I need to know who is doing this.
PETER FORENTE	m	Abel...
ABEL	m	It's one thing to come after my trucks and drivers... and to steal from me... but this... it's different.
PETER FORENTE	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	Have you ever dealt with anything like this?
PETER FORENTE	m	Have you met my father?
ABEL	m	I refuse to live my life that way. I won't do it... I am going to ask for a meeting.
PETER FORENTE	m	Who?
ABEL	m	Anyone with more than 20k of storage. Can I count on you being there?
PETER FORENTE	m	Yes... When are you closing on the terminal?
ABEL	m	Monday.
PETER FORENTE	m	Congratulations.
ABEL	m	Hold that... it's not done yet... you may be hearing from me. (Trailed by an awkward laugh.)
PETER FORENTE	m	Well, good luck.
ABEL	m	Thank you for seeing me. I want more than this...
PETER FORENTE	m	I know you do. My father is in jail... as you know. And I have always wanted to conduct myself differently than he did.
ABEL	m	And you have.
PETER FORENTE	m	Almost exclusively, yes. But I know why he did what he did. Because at the time it's easier.
ABEL	m	But it's not.
PETER FORENTE	m	Yes it is. You are a good man. I will see what I can find out. This isn't good for any of us.
ABEL	m	Thank you.
ABEL	m	Joanne it's me. What are you talking about... what shots?
ABEL	m	I need to make sure you know that we had nothing to do with this. It's not the way I do business. In fact I have been warning my men against doing this sort of thing. It is terrible for me.
ABEL	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	No... but I'll find him.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	Abel.
ABEL	m	Arthur.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I wanted to come and talk to you in person... We aren't going to be able to show up for you on Monday. We can't do the loan.
ABEL	m	I...
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I wanted to let you know as soon as possible so that you could try to put something else together.
ABEL	m	Thank you for coming... This is not right.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I know.
ABEL	m	What can I do?
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	Nothing... The loan review committee met this afternoon and won't meet again for two weeks.
ABEL	m	And you are aware of the position this is putting me in?
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I am.
ABEL	m	I paid off my first loan to you eleven years ago.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I know.
ABEL	m	Do you remember the term on that loan?
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I don't.
ABEL	m	I had seven years to pay you back.
ABEL	m	Do you know how long it took me to pay you off?
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	Seven months?
ABEL	m	Six and a half.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I'm sorry.
ABEL	m	I put 40 percent down as a deposit on this. It's all we had.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	You now have three separate serious pending legal cases against you. One with sixteen counts of misconduct ranging from fraud to tax evasion. And then in the middle of our meeting today I get a report saying you had armed your entire fleet of drivers which led to a shoot-out on the 59th Street Bridge.
ABEL	m	None of it is true.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	That may be.
ABEL	m	May?
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	It doesn't matter.
ABEL	m	It does matter, that you know we didn't do this.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I do... I do. But it doesn't matter, I can't do anything. I'm sorry.
ABEL	m	I'll find it.
ARTHUR LEWIS	m	I know you will.
ANNA	f	It's horrible.
ABEL	m	Yes.
ANNA	f	Where is he?
ABEL	m	We're looking for him.
ANNA	f	And they haven't gotten the other guys?
ABEL	m	Of course not.
ANNA	f	Are you okay?
ABEL	m	No... I'm not... They're out.
ANNA	f	Who?
ABEL	m	The bank.
ANNA	f	So what does that mean?
ABEL	m	It means we need to find the money somewhere else.
ANNA	f	We have two days!
ABEL	m	I'll figure it out.
DAUGHTERS	f	Move.
ANNA	f	Quiet.
DAUGHTERS	f	You move.
ANNA	f	Stop. I've told you guys not to push it this morning, this is not the morning to be doing this... but since the second you all woke up. It's this, it's that. Just stop. The world does not revolve around you!
ANNA	f	That's it Annie we've told you...
ABEL	m	You are thirteen years old. What are you doing? Your mother asks you an hour ago to help her get out of the house smoothly and you are acting like an...
ANNIE	f	Oh fuck you!
ABEL	m	What? What? What are you talking about?
ABEL	m	I'm not sure who the hell you think you are, but you don't talk to me that way... You are in serious danger of becoming a rich little spoiled brat and I can tell you from experience there is nothing worse in the world than a rich little girl who thinks the whole world revolves around her.
ANNIE	f	The world revolves around me? Me! What about her? And what about you? You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing!
ABEL	m	First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. I lived in reality... not whatever this world is you are living in. And we help people stay warm... which isn't all that bad. (now he is yelling again) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up... So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again!
ANNA	f	Stop!!
ABEL	m	Hey.
ANNA	f	Hi.
ABEL	m	How's it coming?
ANNA	f	I've made it to 1975.
ABEL	m	That was a good year.
ABEL	m	Well it was for me...how is it?
ANNA	f	I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... Turns out I kinda knew what I was doing.
ANNA	f	How'd you do?
ABEL	m	I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. But we're still about a million short.
ANNA	f	You're going to see your little brother?
ABEL	m	First thing.
ANNA	f	And Peter?
ABEL	m	Probably.
ANNA	f	This is all worth it.
ABEL	m	Of course.
ABEL	m	You should get to bed.
ANNA	f	I'll be up.
ABEL	m	I love you.
ANNA	f	I love you too.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Is Julian here?
LUISA	f	No.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Abel would like to speak with him. To help him.
LUISA	f	I will tell him.
JULIAN	m	He's turning me in?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Of course we are turning you in. You have put everything that man has worked for for the last 20 years at risk. If it was up to me we would be dealing with this in a very different way.
JULIAN	m	But I know things...
ANDREW WALSH	m	Really?
JULIAN	m	Yes.
ANDREW WALSH	m	And what things do you know?
JULIAN	m	I'm sorry.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I am too.
JULIAN	m	I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Where's the gun?
JULIAN	m	I threw it in the river.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Good. Your background check with us says you have never been arrested, is that true?
JULIAN	m	Why is this putting everything at risk?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Have you ever been arrested?
JULIAN	m	No.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Because no bank will touch us right now. So we can't close on the new property. And he's going to lose everything on his deposit.
JULIAN	m	I'm sorry.
ABEL	m	I know.
JULIAN	m	I was scared.
ABEL	m	I know.
JULIAN	m	Aren't you scared?
ABEL	m	Sometimes.
JULIAN	m	What do you do?
ABEL	m	I have always been much more scared of failure than anything else.
JULIAN	m	I...
ABEL	m	It wasn't always like this.
JULIAN	m	Are you ruined?
ABEL	m	Not today... but by the end of the week... maybe.
JULIAN	m	I'm sorry.
ABEL	m	Good...
JULIAN	m	No... I am not strong.
ABEL	m	That does not have to be true.
JULIAN	m	Trust me... I am not... I'm sorry.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I'm late. I will meet you at four.
ABEL	m	I'm gonna try to get us a little more time.
COP 1	m	Hey.
ABEL	m	Thank you for seeing me.
JOSEPH	m	Of course.
ABEL	m	I need more time.
JOSEPH	m	Of course you do.
ABEL	m	I know our agreement doesn't allow for that. But... I need more time.
JOSEPH	m	Why?
ABEL	m	Thank you for asking. Many, many reasons.
JOSEPH	m	It's a difficult time to do business.
ABEL	m	Yes... it is.
JOSEPH	m	I'll give you three more days. Then it's over.
ABEL	m	Thank you.
ANDREW WALSH	m	We didn't think he'd react that way.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I'm sorry.
ANDREW WALSH	m	So are we... it's very sad. He was very close to Abel.
DEPUTY LANGE	m	It has been brought to our attention that it might be beneficial on your end to resolve this issue in a time sensitive way.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Possibly.
DEPUTY LANGE	m	So we have prepared an offer for you to review.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I'll show this to them. He'll never go for it, but it's a start.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I know... I will present it to him.
ANDREW WALSH	m	You need what to stop?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Starting to be? No shit.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I understand. The kid went out and got his own gun. This was not us. No matter what you think of him, Abel doesn't work this way.
ANDREW WALSH	m	He wants to talk to them. We've been trying to set up a meeting. O'Leary hasn't been able to get it done.
ABEL	m	I talked to the Hasid, I got us three days.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Is that enough?
ABEL	m	I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Well here it is. It's just a first pass.
ABEL	m	Felons can't vote.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I'm sorry?
ABEL	m	This plea has me...
ANDREW WALSH	m	I know. It's just a first offer.
ABEL	m	I would never take this.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I know.
ABEL	m	Who?
ANDREW WALSH	m	Lawrence, he's tight with O'Leary.
ABEL	m	Of course he is.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Does Julian have anything?
ABEL	m	All the drivers could have us on scales. Why?
ANDREW WALSH	m	If we are cutting deals, we can't have anything new come up at the last minute.
ABEL	m	He would never do that.
ANDREW WALSH	m	We need to find him... Lawrence needs him.
ABEL	m	Thank you for letting me in.
LUISA	f	Of course.
ABEL	m	Have you seen Julian?
LUISA	f	No.
ABEL	m	We need to find him.
LUISA	f	I know.
ABEL	m	I am worried about him.
LUISA	f	So am I.
ABEL	m	You know we were going to support him. I do not know why he ran.
LUISA	f	He was scared.
ABEL	m	I know.
LUISA	f	He has always wanted to make you proud. You know that right?
ABEL	m	Yes. Well this time that hasn't worked out.
LUISA	f	No... How did you do it?
ABEL	m	Do what?
LUISA	f	This.
LUISA	f	Success... that's all he wanted.
ABEL	m	I know. It makes me very sad, because he is a very talented young man. But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. I need to know where he is. And I need him to turn himself in. His actions are hurting me and my business. And I refuse to let other people's weaknesses hurt me. I don't know how it has come to this, but it has. If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. You and your family. When you see him. Tell him this. Please.
LUISA	f	I will.
ABEL	m	Does he have any money?
LUISA	f	I'm sorry?
ABEL	m	Money? Has he taken money out of your bank account?
LUISA	f	I don't know?
ABEL	m	You need to start looking into these things. It is very important that we find him safely.
ABEL	m	Stop! Stop running away! Andrew! He's coming your way!
ABEL	m	(in Spanish again) I understand why you lied, but it is not smart.
ABEL	m	There are other people looking for him. I am as good an option as he has. Know this.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Fuck You! You better run!
ABEL	m	Thank you both for agreeing to meet with me.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	Of course.
ABEL	m	I think we have met before but I didn't realize you were Saul's Granddaughter.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	I am.
ABEL	m	I'm sorry to ask but how old are you?
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	I'm 23.
ABEL	m	Oh.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	My Grandfather didn't trust any of his children to run the business.
ABEL	m	Yes.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	I know that you tried to buy the company from my Grandfather several times.
ABEL	m	Yes.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. Which he thankfully did.
ABEL	m	I understand. And I hope that your Grandfather was able to communicate to you how much I have always respected him. And it was only out of respect for the business he had built, and because I knew of his reservations and feelings about your uncles and your father that I made those offers.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	I understand.
ABEL	m	But, I am not here to offer to buy your company.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	Oh.
ABEL	m	As I'm sure you will soon learn some years are good... others not so. I am in contract with a significant hard deposit at risk to purchase the old Bayfront terminal.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	I see.
ABEL	m	And due to circumstances beyond my control my bank has left me at the altar.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	I'm sorry.
ABEL	m	So, I am here, hat in hand, looking for a loan. I certainly expect the terms to be in your favor as I could not be at a weaker place. But, if your Grandfather trusted you with his company, I would be willing to trust you as my lien holder.
SAUL LEFKOWITZ	m	How much?
ABEL	m	I need $500,000.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	Would you give us a minute.
ABEL	m	Of course.
LEFKOWITZ RECEPTIONIST	m	You can go back in.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	We can offer you the 500k at 20 percent for a year.
ABEL	m	Okay. Thank you.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	f	So, I guess we will see you tonight?
ABEL	m	Tonight? Oh yes, of course.
BILL O'LEARY	m	Abel. Please sit.
ABEL	m	Stop...
PETER FORENTE	m	Um... Abel... we had a chance to meet for a little bit before you got here and... of course everyone in this room is fully capable of lying to their own mothers on their deathbeds, but... the conclusion we have come to... I should say we are fairly convinced after a very frank conversation... that these guys who are doing this... that they don't actually work for anyone in this room. As you know there are many other smaller providers in the area that might be responsible who are not here tonight.
ABEL	m	Peter... thank you... That may be true.
ABEL	m	But over the last six months 110,000 gallons of fuel has been stolen from my family and I. Now the reason we asked Bill to get you all here is because the people in this room are the only people within two hundred miles of here who have the ability to purchase and store that kind of quantity. So... no matter what bullshit you have been telling each other one of you... or two... or three... has been allowing this to happen by buying this from these cowards or worse yet hiring these guys just to do it. And profiting from it. So what I am saying is... Stop! Now. Have some pride in what you do and stop.
ABEL	m	Hey.
ANNA	f	Hi.
ABEL	m	How's it coming?
ANNA	f	I've made it to 1975.
ABEL	m	That was a good year.
ABEL	m	Well it was for me...how is it?
ANNA	f	I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... I guess I knew what I was doing.
ANNA	f	How'd you do?
ABEL	m	I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. But we're still about a million short.
ANNA	f	You're going to see your little brother?
ABEL	m	First thing.
ANNA	f	And Peter?
ABEL	m	Probably.
ABEL	m	How are the girls? I feel like I haven't seen them in days.
ANNA	f	They're fine.
ANNA	f	This is all worth it.
ABEL	m	Of course.
ANNA	f	Look at us...it is.
ABEL	m	I know.
ABEL	m	We should get to bed.
ANNA	f	I'll be up.
ABEL	m	I love you.
ANNA	f	I love you too.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	Please. Please.
ABEL	m	Your friend is dead... who do you work for.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	You know I could never tell you that.
ABEL	m	Stop... just stop.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	m	This was it anyway. Okay... Okay.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	Hey.
ABEL	m	Jimmy, can you give me a minute?
ARNOLD KLINE	m	Abel, that was well said.
ABEL	m	Thank you.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	What can I do for you?
ABEL	m	I've just come to collect that check you owe me.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	What check is that?
ABEL	m	The one for $213,000.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	I'm sorry?
ABEL	m	That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	I had nothing to do with that.
ABEL	m	Your Far Rockaway facility bought a load of fuel last week off one of my stolen trucks.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	That's not possible.
ABEL	m	I was standing on top of one of my hi-jacked trucks a couple weeks ago thinking about the cowards who did this when I remembered I had bought the load of fuel off a friend's tanker straight from Texas. As I'm sure you know Texas #4 is marked. But that was just one load, so every truck that has left my lot for the last two weeks has been marked with dye that I've put in... And luckily four more of my trucks got jacked since.... My guess is there are at least 4600 gallons of marked fuel in your small tank right now.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	How much?
ABEL	m	I said...213,000.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	I'll need a day.
ABEL	m	Okay.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	I've just been buying this stuff off these guys, it was only a couple loads, I don't know who they are. I would never do that.
ABEL	m	My goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year. And if you're this fucking desperate it doesn't seem like it will even take that long.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	Abel, I wasn't the only person buying this shit.
ABEL	m	I don't care.
ARNOLD KLINE	m	It may ruin me.
ABEL	m	When you find out who else it was you can get them to pay you back the difference. Kinda makes you miss having your father around? But I need the whole lot tomorrow or the feds will be at your doorstep by noon.
ABEL	m	You look good out there.
ELIAS	m	I didn't know you were coming.
ABEL	m	I didn't either... I didn't mean to take you away.
ELIAS	m	We're done.
ELIAS	m	Thanks for coming.
ABEL	m	Of course. You've grown.
ELIAS	m	You saw me a month ago.
ABEL	m	I know... but you have.
ABEL	m	The girls at this place... they are so beautiful?
ELIAS	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	I don't know how you get anything done around here.
ELIAS	m	I don't.
ABEL	m	I'm in a bit of a rough patch.
ELIAS	m	Yes...
ABEL	m	It happens.
ELIAS	m	I know.
ABEL	m	Good...
ABEL	m	That will be your burden...
ELIAS	m	What will?
ABEL	m	Not having had one.
ABEL	m	I need your signature on this.
ELIAS	m	What is it?
ABEL	m	I need to take out a short term mortgage on our apartment building.
ELIAS	m	That thing isn't worth more than 150 grand though?
ABEL	m	210.
ELIAS	m	Since when do you need to be taking out sucker mortgages for 200 grand?
ABEL	m	I'm up against it a bit. It will be fine.
ABEL	m	Thank you... It's good to see your face.
ELIAS	m	I love you.
ABEL	m	I love you too.
PETER FORENTE	m	Well here he is. The caped crusader.
ABEL	m	Yes.
PETER FORENTE	m	Come over. Are you alright?
ABEL	m	I am.
PETER FORENTE	m	Did they catch any of them? Sit.
ABEL	m	The one guy didn't make it out of the crash, and the other guy disappeared.
PETER FORENTE	m	That was very well said last night.
ABEL	m	Thank you. And thanks for seeing me.
PETER FORENTE	m	Of course. So what is it?
ABEL	m	I need a loan.
PETER FORENTE	m	You don't want to do that.
ABEL	m	No shit... but I'm here.
PETER FORENTE	m	What are we talking about here.
ABEL	m	Six hundred thousand.
PETER FORENTE	m	Jesus. Abel, that's a problem.
ABEL	m	Yes... but if I don't get it...
PETER FORENTE	m	What's my collateral?
ABEL	m	The terminal.
PETER FORENTE	m	Yeah me and how many other people will be coming after it. No way.
ABEL	m	You'll get your money.
PETER FORENTE	m	Abel, you know I respect everything you've done. Because of it we haven't come down on you the way I should have for coming into my service area and poaching my customers. You're good at what you do, probably better than us, and I accept that. But this would be different. I don't want you to be in this position. We are not nice people to borrow three quarters of million dollars from.
ABEL	m	I know that.
PETER FORENTE	m	Let's sleep on this. Both of us.
ANNA	f	What a day.
ABEL	m	Yeah.
ANNA	f	Are you okay?
ABEL	m	Yes.
ANNA	f	Car chases?
ABEL	m	Yeah.
ANNA	f	Who knew?
ANNA	f	How was your brother?
ABEL	m	He seemed good... But the girls up at that place are...
ANNA	f	Stop.
ABEL	m	I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to school...
ANNA	f	Enough.
ABEL	m	How are we here?
ANNA	f	It was a lot of things all at once.
ABEL	m	Yeah.
ANNA	f	How did it go?
ABEL	m	We can probably pull it off. Three different parties... it'll be a mess... and the terms... Peter suddenly showed me his true colors.
ANNA	f	I'm sorry.
ABEL	m	I spent my whole life trying not to become a gangster...
ANNA	f	I know.
ABEL	m	...And now... on the biggest deal in my career they will all control me.
ABEL	m	What is this?
ANNA	f	It's a bank account.
ABEL	m	Whose?
ANNA	f	Ours.
ABEL	m	How much is in it?
ANNA	f	A lot.
ABEL	m	What does that mean?
ANNA	f	It will help. You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal.
ABEL	m	Where did it come from?
ANNA	f	Abel.
ABEL	m	Where did it come from?
ANNA	f	Since 1971 I have been skimming money out of the company. Some years a little... others a lot. In the beginning it was just in case times got tough but then it was because you were taking all these chances... I didn't know what else to do... I couldn't risk having us be left with nothing.
ANNA	f	I'm sorry.
ABEL	m	What do you expect me to do with this?
ANNA	f	Use it.... Abel...
ABEL	m	Is it clean?
ANNA	f	What does that mean?
ABEL	m	It means if you walked into the office of the people who have been trying to put us in jail right now and slapped a check from that account down on their desk would it push me further into hell or help to get me out?
ANNA	f	It's as clean as every other dollar we've ever made.
ABEL	m	That's a fucking bullshit answer.
ANNA	f	I can clear it on the books.
ABEL	m	Well it sounds like you should take this money and keep it right where it is... because I'm going to pretend that we never had this conversation. And you can use that when they drag me off to jail!
ANNA	f	So what's your plan here?
ABEL	m	I'll get it done. And it won't be as a cheat.
ANNA	f	(Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids.) Oh you are too much. You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. Mr. Fucking American Dream. Well this is America... but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years... IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about...
ABEL	m	You stole from me!
ANNA	f	Oh... You have always been very good about not letting your ego get in the way of business. Don't start now just because it's me.
ABEL	m	We'll use the money... your money. It's the smart play.
ANNA	f	It's our money.
ABEL	m	I know...
ANNA	f	These fucking guys...what's this additional $11,000?
ABEL	m	I guess there is still some fuel in two of the tanks... they gave us a fair price on it.
JOSEPH	m	Mazel Tov.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Congratulations.
ABEL	m	To you too. Did you know...about the money?
ANNA	f	Abel.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	You should have told me.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I know. I'm sorry.
ANNA	f	Abel...congratulations. Now cheer up. And can someone give me a tour of this place we just paid two million bucks for?
ANNA	f	What a hell-hole this city is.
ABEL	m	No.
ANDREW WALSH	m	I don't know why but I guess I never realized we even had this view from back here.
ABEL	m	I did.
ABEL	m	I thought you said you threw that into the river?
JULIAN	m	I didn't.
ABEL	m	I see that.
JULIAN	m	I have nowhere to go.
ABEL	m	Nowhere easy.
JULIAN	m	Fuck you. I have nothing. And somehow you've ended up with everything you wanted.
ABEL	m	It wasn't meant to be.
JULIAN	m	What is that supposed to mean?
ABEL	m	I know what you wanted. But you need to forget that. You are looking backward. Only look forward, that is what you can control.
JULIAN	m	I'm sorry. You gave me a very good chance. Right?
ABEL	m	Yes.
JULIAN	m	Probably a better chance than I deserved.
ABEL	m	No.
JULIAN	m	Please take care of my family.
ABEL	m	Julian.
JULIAN	m	Please...
ABEL	m	I will.
ANDREW WALSH	m	What... what should we do?
ABEL	m	We call the police.
ANDREW WALSH	m	Really?
ABEL	m	Yes!
ABEL	m	I did.
ABEL	m	Yeah. For a while I thought he was... it's just...
ABEL	m	You really do have to be lucky.
ABEL	m	I was right there... I couldn't help myself.
ABEL	m	Have you found the driver?
ABEL	m	You'll find him.
ABEL	m	Well, thank you for coming. I wanted to make sure this was handled correctly.
ABEL	m	I'm not sure how I got here.
ABEL	m	So... I should tell you that I won't be able to take that deal you offered. There is no way I would ever accept a felony charge for anything we've done.
ABEL	m	I am not a felon.
ABEL	m	But I also can't have you digging around my life and keeping this hanging around my neck for the next ten years. I love fighting a good battle but this... it's very bad for my business.
ABEL	m	So, we need to come to some sort of conclusion.
ABEL	m	Good.
ABEL	m	It looks that way.
ABEL	m	For a very long time.
ABEL	m	Within my business it has that potential.
ABEL	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	Yes, I have.
ABEL	m	It doesn't feel that way... But please know that I have always chosen the path that was the most right.
ABEL	m	Yes.
ABEL	m	The result is never in question for me. Just what path do I take to get there. And I have never questioned my path. There is always one that is most right. And that is what this is.
