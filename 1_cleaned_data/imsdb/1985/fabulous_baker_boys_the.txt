VOICE	m	Hey.
JACK	m	Hey.
GIRL	f	Whatcha doin' over there?
JACK	m	Gotta go.
GIRL	f	How come?
JACK	m	Job.
GIRL	f	Funny hours.
JACK	m	Funny job.
GIRL	f	Will I see you again?
JACK	m	No.
GIRL	f	You weren't wearing that, were you? Earlier.
JACK	m	Brought it.
GIRL	f	Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
JACK	m	Thanks.
GIRL	f	I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
GIRL	f	Hey. You got great hands.
DOORMAN	m	Hey, Jackie!
JACK	m	How goes it, Tommy?
TOMMY (DOORMAN)	m	Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
JACK	m	Losing his teeth.
TOMMY	m	No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
JACK	m	Yeah. Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
TOMMY	m	Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
JACK	m	Another five years, huh?
TOMMY	m	Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
JACK	m	It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
TOMMY	m	He's got blood in his eye.
FRANK	m	Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
JACK	m	How we doing?
FRANK	m	How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
JACK	m	Am I late?
FRANK	m	That's not the point.
JACK	m	What's the point?
FRANK	m	You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
JACK	m	You want me to show up late a few nights?
FRANK	m	Jack.
JACK	m	Frank.
FRANK	m	Jack.
JACK	m	Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
FRANK	m	Christ, will you look at your hair?
JACK	m	What's wrong with it?
FRANK	m	You look like you just crawled out of bed.
JACK	m	No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
JACK	m	Careful, Frank.  When you get angry your tie starts to spin.
FRANK	m	Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome to the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker and eighty-eight keys across from me is my little brother, Jack.
FRANK	m	You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
JACK	m	Twenty-eight years, Frank.
FRANK	m	That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
JACK	m	Lotta water.
FRANK	m	Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
FRANK	m	But seriously.  It's been fifteen years since Jack and I first stepped on the stage as professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities, and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later... well, believe me, we've seen our share of this crazy country of ours.  But even though we've played some of the finest venues in the world ...
FRANK	m	... There's one place that's always been, for us, a very special place, and that place is... this place, the Starfire lounge.
FRANK	m	Why?  Well, I guess you could just say it's the ... ... people.
FRANK	m	Thank you.  Remember, room service is available
FRANK	m	Don't make trouble, all right?
JACK	m	Who's gonna make trouble? Hey, amigo!
MAN	m	Jack! Frank.
FRANK	m	Yeah, hi, Hector.
HECTOR (MAN)	m	For Eddie.  I wrap.
JACK	m	Gracias.
FRANK	m	I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
JACK	m	Like an angel.
LLOYD (YOUNG MAN)	m	Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
FRANK	m	Thanks, Lloyd.
LLOYD	m	Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
FRANK	m	Uh ... thanks.
LLOYD	m	Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on State Street.  These blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some guy dripping ash all over himself while he's playing 'The Sound of Music.'
LLOYD	m	Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more
FRANK	m	Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us
LLOYD	m	I'll call you.
FRANK	m	Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I
LLOYD	m	I'll call you.
JACK	m	Count it.
FRANK	m	Huh?
JACK	m	Count it.
FRANK	m	Jack...
JACK	m	Count the fucking money, Frank.
FRANK	m	It's all here. I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.
FRANK	m	You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned?   Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
JACK	m	Fuck him.
FRANK	m	This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
JACK	m	Fuck him.
FRANK	m	Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
JACK	m	So we on tomorrow night?
FRANK	m	Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
FRANK	m	Hey.
FRANK	m	Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids.   They've grown.
JACK	m	I hate your kids, Frank.
FRANK	m	You're their uncle.
JACK	m	Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
FRANK	m	They don't.  They're always asking about you.
JACK	m	They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
FRANK	m	It was an accident.
JACK	m	It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
FRANK	m	Cindy.
JACK	m	She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.   How do you explain that?
FRANK	m	She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
JACK	m	You got weird kids, Frank.
FRANK	m	Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
FRANK	m	Just think about it, all right? Consider it a standing offer.
FRANK	m	You want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank, I'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night. Good night, Frank.
JACK	m	Hi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the apartment.
JACK	m	Take it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth around here.
FRANK	m	What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
WILLIE	m	Out.
FRANK	m	When they coming in?
WILLIE	m	Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
FRANK	m	What d'ya got?,
JACK	m	Bosen black. Flat.
FRANK	m	What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
WILLIE	m	What's the gig?
FRANK	m	Two nights.
FRANK	m	What d'ya got?
JACK	m	Yamaha white.  Nice.
FRANK	m	What do you think?
JACK	m	Try the black Knable.
FRANK	m	Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
WILLIE	m	My pleasure.
FRANK	m	You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
JACK	m	Trust me, you're not missing anything.
FRANK	m	You look awful.
JACK	m	Thanks.
FRANK	m	Really.  You sleeping?
JACK	m	Only on odd days.
FRANK	m	Seeing anyone in particular?
JACK	m	Why the interest?
FRANK	m	Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
JACK	m	I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
FRANK	m	What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
JACK	m	Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
FRANK	m	Funny. Strike a bell?
JACK	m	It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
FRANK	m	It's more than that.
FRANK	m	By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
JACK	m	No thanks.
FRANK	m	No, I mean it.
JACK	m	So do I.
FRANK	m	We gotta go, Jack.
JACK	m	No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty.   I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
FRANK	m	This time you gotta go.
JACK	m	I don't gotta go.
FRANK	m	You gotta go.
JACK	m	Says who?
FRANK	m	Your older brother.
JACK	m	You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
FRANK	m	Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
FRANK	m	So what do you say? Think the city can spare you for an afternoon?
FRANK	m	Okay.  And don't worry about a present. I got her something from both of us.
FRANK	m	Make sure you lock.
FRANK	m	Place looks good, huh?  I got a neighbor boy to mow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.   Times've changed, huh? See the tree? Remember the job Cecil did on it the day Dad planted it? You can still see the scars on the trunk.  Really. I was looking at it just the other day. Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.
JACK	m	So what'd we get her?
FRANK	m	You'll see.
MRS. BAKER	f	Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
FRANK	m	How's the birthday girl?
MRS. BAKER	f	A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
MRS. BAKER	f	John.  It's good to see you.
JACK	m	Good to see you, Ma.
FRANK	m	Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
MRS. BAKER	f	I thought maybe held gotten over that.
FRANK	m	Twenty years, Ma ...
MRS. BAKER	f	Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
FRANK	m	Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
MRS. BAKER	f	Catholics.  What do you expect?   Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
FRANK	m	Keep her busy, will ya? I have to set a few things up.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
JACK	m	Downstairs.
MRS. BAKER	f	Oh.
MRS. BAKER	f	Well, shall we cut that cake?
MRS. BAKER	f	So. How are you?
JACK	m	Fine.  You?
MRS. BAKER	f	Oh, fine.
MRS. BAKER	f	Big piece or little?
JACK	m	Huh? Oh, no.
MRS. BAKER	f	None?
JACK	m	I'm not much for sweets.
MRS. BAKER	f	How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
JACK	m	Eddie.
MRS. BAKER	f	Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
JACK	m	He's losing his teeth.
MRS. BAKER	f	Sounds like your brothers back with us.
MRS. BAKER	f	What's all this?
FRANK	m	Go on.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Why, what's this?
MRS. BAKER	f	Oh my God ...
FRANK	m	Recognize these two characters?
MRS. BAKER	f	I thought these were lost.   Where did you find ...
FRANK	m	In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff. Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
MRS. BAKER	f	Oh no!
FRANK	m	I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
MRS. BAKER	f	Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
FRANK	m	Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
MRS. BAKER	f	That man.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Oh, look how you're growing. My little boys ...
JACK	m	I made her nervous.
FRANK	m	What do you mean?
JACK	m	Her hands.  Like that.
FRANK	m	Nah.  Medication.
FRANK	m	Couple years, now. Keeps the beat steady.  Nothing serious.
FRANK	m	She was glad to see you.
NINA	f	Morning.  You want coffee?  I made coffee.
NINA	f	I did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.
NINA	f	Did you break a cup, Jack?
JACK	m	Eddie did.
NINA	f	I practiced the piano last night.  Two hours. I think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'
NINA	f	Guess they're up.
JACK	m	Sounds big.  What's he do?
NINA	f	Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
JACK	m	What happened to the donut king?
NINA	f	Married.
NINA	f	No breakfast.  Maybe they had a fight.
NINA	f	Well, gotta go.  Teach me later?
JACK	m	Hey.
FRANK	m	Uh, thank you.  That concludes our show for this evening.  Jack and I only hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did.
BELLHOP	?	Mr. Baker.
FRANK	m	Yeah, Jimmy.
JIMMY (BELLHOP)	m	Mr. Simpson asked to see you.
FRANK	m	All right, tell him I'll be right there.
FRANK	m	Tomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.'
CHARLIE	m	Frankie.
FRANK	m	You wanted to see me, Charlie?
CHARLIE	m	Yeah, come on in.
FRANK	m	Little slow tonight.
CHARLIE	m	Mondays.
FRANK	m	What's this?
CHARLIE	m	Your pay.
FRANK	m	Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
CHARLIE	m	Take it now.
FRANK	m	What about tomorrow?
CHARLIE	m	We don't need you, Frankie.
FRANK	m	I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
CHARLIE	m	It's all there.  Both nights.
FRANK	m	What're you saying, Charlie?
CHARLIE	m	Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
FRANK	m	Twelve years.
CHARLIE	m	Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
FRANK	m	So?
CHARLIE	m	So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
FRANK	m	Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
CHARLIE	m	It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor.   To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables.   It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that.   You're class.  But people today.   They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
JACK	m	What's with Charlie?
FRANK	m	Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
JACK	m	Yeah?
FRANK	m	It's me.
JACK	m	Frank?
FRANK	m	Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
JACK	m	I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
FRANK	m	It's not family.  It's business.
JACK	m	So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
FRANK	m	We don't get a gig.
JACK	m	What're you talking about?
FRANK	m	Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
FRANK (V.0)	m	So you'll come out, right?
JACK	m	Yeah, okay.
JACK	m	Hey, kids.  Dad home?
JACK	m	What d'ya say?  Wanna run and get him for me?
JACK	m	Shit.
JACK	m	Hey, kid.  Take it easy.
FRANK	m	Cindy!  What is it?
FRANK	m	Jack.
JACK	m	Your doorbell doesn't work.
FRANK	m	Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.
DONNA	f	What's the matter?  Jack?
FRANK	m	Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
DONNA	f	I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
FRANK	m	Feet!
FRANK	m	It's probably the excitement of seeing you again.
FRANK	m	Well, look at this.
DONNA	f	You bring trunks, Jack?
JACK	m	Trunks?
DONNA	f	Swimming trunks.
JACK	m	Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
DONNA	f	Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
JACK	m	Maybe next time.
DONNA	f	We have some lotion.
JACK	m	Just the same.
DONNA	f	Suit yourself.
FRANK	m	Nice, huh?
JACK	m	What?
FRANK	m	The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
JACK	m	Terrific.
FRANK	m	Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
JACK	m	You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
JACK	m	Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
FRANK	m	I don't know what you mean.
JACK	m	The hell you don't.
FRANK	m	I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
JACK	m	Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
FRANK	m	It wasn't like that.
JACK	m	No?
FRANK	m	No.
JACK	m	What was it like?
FRANK	m	Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right?   I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal.   There's no shame in it.
JACK	m	That how you see it?
FRANK	m	Yeah, that's how I see it.
FRANK	m	And don't go shaking your head, little brother. I'm not the one who walks in every night smelling like he's got a day job in a piss factory. It killed him, you know.
JACK	m	A gust of wind killed him.
FRANK	m	Yeah, and what put him up there?
JACK	m	Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
FRANK	m	Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
JACK	m	Talk.
FRANK	m	I been thinking maybe we should make some changes. I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
JACK	m	Sure, why not.
FRANK	m	It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
JACK	m	It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
FRANK	m	We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
JACK	m	That's what we agreed.
FRANK	m	If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
JACK	m	I'm not unhappy.
FRANK	m	If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
JACK	m	Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
FRANK	m	I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
JACK	m	I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
FRANK	m	I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
FRANK	m	What's that?
JACK	m	You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
FRANK	m	Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
JACK	m	It never was.
FRANK	m	Good morning, Miss...?
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Moran.  Monica Moran.
FRANK	m	All right, Miss Moran
MONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)	f	Actually, that's my stage name.
FRANK	m	I'm sorry?
MONICA	f	Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing.   It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
FRANK	m	Blanche.
MONICA	f	No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
FRANK	m	Well, that's fine --
MONICA	f	But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
FRANK	m	Right.
MONICA	f	And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
FRANK	m	Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
MONICA	f	Candy Man.' Is that all right?
FRANK	m	It's one of Jack's favorites.
MONICA	f	Oops.  I almost forgot you were there.  Here's the music.
FRANK	m	Uh... he knows it.
MONICA	f	Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
JACK	m	Small world.
FRANK	m	Well, shall we?
MONICA	f	Who can take a sunrise Sprinkle it with dew Toss it in the air and Make a groovy lemon pie The Candy Man can The Candy Man can...,
FRANK	m	Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.
FRANK	m	Miss Moran ... Miss Moran ... Blanche!
MONICA	f	Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
FRANK	m	Yes, it is.
MONICA	f	Well ... thanks. Bye.
JACK	m	Drive carefully.
WOMAN	f	Hey.  You one of the fabulous Baker Boys?
FRANK	m	Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
JACK	m	What?
FRANK	m	Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
JACK	m	It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
FRANK	m	I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
WOMAN	f	Damn!
WOMAN	f	Brand new Thursday.  You believe it?
WOMAN	f	This where the auditions are?
FRANK	m	This is where the auditions were.
WOMAN	f	What do you mean?
FRANK	m	We're finished.
WOMAN	f	What about me?
FRANK	m	You're an hour and a half late.
WOMAN	f	My watch is broken, too.
FRANK	m	Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
WOMAN	f	This is show business?
FRANK	m	Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
WOMAN	f	Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
FRANK	m	Don't take it personally.
WOMAN	f	How should I take it?
FRANK	m	Impersonally.
WOMAN	f	I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
FRANK	m	You're an hour and a half late.
WOMAN	f	So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
FRANK	m	We ran long.
WOMAN	f	So run a little longer.
FRANK	m	Miss --
WOMAN	f	You find a girl?
JACK	m	No.
WOMAN	f	So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
FRANK	m	Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
WOMAN	f	What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
JACK	m	Don't worry about it.
WOMAN	f	You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
FRANK	m	Jack.
JACK	m	Let's get it over with.
FRANK	m	All right.  What's your name?
WOMAN	f	Susie.  Susie Diamond.
FRANK	m	Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
SUSIE (WOMAN)	f	Well ... for the last four years I've been on call to Triple A Escort service.
SUSIE	f	Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
FRANK	m	Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
SUSIE	f	I sing now?
FRANK	m	That's the premise.
SUSIE	f	I Get Along Without You.' Slowly, okay?
SUSIE	f	I get along without you very well Of course I do Except when soft rains fall And drip from leaves, then I recall The thrill of being Sheltered in your arms Of course I do But I get along without you very well.'
SUSIE	f	So?
FRANK	m	Uh ... we'll let you know.
SUSIE	f	When?
FRANK	m	When we know.
SUSIE	f	Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
SUSIE	f	Yeah, well, okay.  'Bye, Bakers.
JACK	m	What are you, crazy?
FRANK	m	I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
JACK	m	What's there to talk about?  She can sing.   That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
FRANK	m	I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake.   I don't think she's right for the act.
JACK	m	You're getting cold feet about this.
FRANK	m	I was just thinking what Ma would think.
JACK	m	Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
JACK	m	How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy?   Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
FRANK	m	Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
JACK	m	What's the matter?
FRANK	m	I didn't get her number.
FRANK	m	We can always look her up in the book.
WOMAN	f	Does this mean I get the job?
SUSIE	f	Intuition.
FRANK	m	Ready?
FRANK	m	Ready?
FRANK	m	Ready?
FRANK	m	Ready?
SUSIE	f	What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
SUSIE	f	Sorry.
SUSIE	f	Fellas, fellas ...
FRANK	m	What's the problem?
SUSIE	f	The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
SUSIE	f	I mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here I'm having a little trouble getting a word in.
SUSIE	f	I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
FRANK	m	No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
SUSIE	f	What I mean is --
FRANK	m	We're a team.  We work together.
SUSIE	f	So work with me, not against me. Okay?
FRANK	m	I suppose we can bring it down a little.
JACK	m	I'll drop the eighths.
FRANK	m	Okay?
SUSIE	f	Okay.
FRANK	m	I'm telling you, Ray.  She's got a voice like an angel ... What?
FRANK	m	No, I wouldn't say she's got a body like an angel.
SUSIE	f	Hey, he's not sore, is he?
JACK	m	He'll come around.
JACK	m	You never sang before?
SUSIE	f	Not for money. With my mother.
SUSIE	f	She used to waitress downtown, nights, when I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing. You know how people whistle when they're nervous? My mother sang.  She always said you're never alone with a song 'cause thousands of people know the same song and even though you can't hear 'em, they're singing with you.  I don't know.   If they were, they were all singing safe inside their apartments. But it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since, I always wanted to sing.   I never took lessons or anything, though. I guess you guys took a lot of lessons.
JACK	m	Yeah.  We took a lot of lessons.
NINA	f	You shave like an old movie, Jack.
JACK	m	In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
NINA	f	Is that what you used to do?
JACK	m	My days are not the old days, genius.
NINA	f	What are they?
JACK	m	The recent past.
NINA	f	Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
JACK	m	How do you know?
NINA	f	I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
JACK	m	Oh?
NINA	f	I guess it's getting serious.
JACK	m	Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
NINA	f	I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
JACK	m	Ivory.
NINA	f	Looks old.
JACK	m	Older than me.
NINA	f	Wow.
JACK	m	Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
NINA	f	Why not?
JACK	m	Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
NINA	f	What's a prom?
JACK	m	Ever go to church?
JACK	m	It's like that.  Only you gotta dance.
FRANK	m	Where the hell is she?
JACK	m	It's early.
FRANK	m	I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
JACK	m	She'll get here.
FRANK	m	Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
JACK	m	Awe inspiring.
FRANK	m	Yeah, well, Your's isn't. Let me run a comb though it.
JACK	m	Get out of here.
FRANK	m	Come on, stand still.
JACK	m	Get out of here!
FRANK	m	It's not gonna hurt you.
JACK	m	I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
FRANK	m	You hit me.
JACK	m	I told you I was gonna hit you.
FRANK	m	All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
JACK	m	You're a fucking alarm clock.
FRANK	m	I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
JACK	m	She's here.
FRANK	m	Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back. Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
SUSIE	f	Where's my name?
FRANK	m	What-?
SUSIE	f	And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
FRANK	m	We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
SUSIE	f	Changed?
FRANK	m	Where's your dress?
SUSIE	f	What's he talking about?
FRANK	m	Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
SUSIE	f	Do I look like I'm naked?
FRANK	m	That!  You can't wear that!
SUSIE	f	What's wrong with it?
FRANK	m	It's orange!
SUSIE	f	Am I missing something?
FRANK	m	Come on.
SUSIE	f	Hey!
FRANK	m	Come on.  We don't have much time.
SUSIE	f	Time for what?
SUSIE	f	If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
FRANK	m	Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
SUSIE	f	A seven.
FRANK	m	My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
SUSIE	f	I wear a seven.
FRANK	m	Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
SUSIE	f	Save it for your wife.
FRANK	m	We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
JACK	m	No.
FRANK	m	Here, how's this?
FRANK	m	Close enough.  Let's go.
SUSIE	f	Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
FRANK	m	All right, but make it quick. Shoes!  What size do you wear?
SUSIE	f	Nine.
FRANK	m	Nine?
SUSIE	f	Nine!
FRANK	m	Big feet.
FRANK	m	See anything?
JACK	m	How about these?
FRANK	m	Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing. Ah, here we go.
FRANK	m	Hey!  Do these come in black?
SALESMAN	m	I'll be with you in a minute, sir.
FRANK	m	I don't have a minute, pal.  Yes or no?
SALESMAN	m	Yes.  They come in black.
FRANK	m	Okay.  Give me a pair of nines. Pronto.
SALESMAN	m	Does he want a pair, too?
FRANK	m	All right, we got your shoes.
SUSIE	f	What do you think?
FRANK	m	Uh... good.
SUSIE	f	Zip me up?
SUSIE	f	Shoes?
FRANK	m	Right.
SUSIE	f	They're tight.
FRANK	m	They're nines.
SUSIE	f	Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
FRANK	m	You can buy new ones tomorrow.
SUSIE	f	Oh, thanks.
FRANK	m	Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
SUSIE	f	You're a prince.
RAY	m	You better buy yourself a watch, Frankie.
FRANK	m	We had a little emergency.
RAY	m	Yeah, well, I've got a little emergency. You know what I'm saying? Who's this, Minnie Pearl?
FRANK	m	Jesus.
RAY	m	I want seventy-five minutes, Frankie. You hear me?
JACK	m	This is going well, isn't it?
FRANK	m	We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors? Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
SUSIE	f	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.   I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.   It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
FRANK	m	Right.
SUSIE	f	Piece of cake.
FRANK	m	Carlos, that's,a cleaver.  I need scissors.
CARLOS (MAN)	m	No scissors.
FRANK	m	Jesus Christ.  All right.  Let's go, Jack.  Fix your tie.
FRANK	m	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.   Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.   My name's Frank Baker and no, you're not seeing double, it's just my little brother, Jack.
FRANK	m	I'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight, because we've got a very special evening planned ...
WAITRESS	?	Hey!
SUSIE	f	Just a sip.  To kill the butterflies, okay?
WAITRESS	?	Okay.  But no lipstick.
SUSIE	f	There.  No one's the wiser.
WAITRESS	?	Nice dress.
SUSIE	f	Appreciate it, Ace.
FRANK	m	But seriously, folks, as I sit here tonight, looking out on all your kind faces, I can't help but feel some of us have met before.  We may not know each other's names, we might not recognize one another on the street, but we know each other just the same.  And over the years we've shared something.  A little music, a little drink, a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears.   But I guess that's what friends are for, huh?
JACK	m	Oh, brother.
FRANK	m	And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
FRANK	m	The switch.  Hit the switch.
SUSIE	f	Switch? What fucking switch?
SUSIE	f	Pardon me.
SUSIE	f	I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.
SUSIE	f	I'm all smiles, darling Through and through...'
BELLBOY	m	I thought the Bakers were on tonight.
CLERK	m	They are.
BELLBOY	m	Well, who's that?
CLERK	m	I don't know.  Frank?
FRANK	m	Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
SUSIE	f	I said I was sorry.
FRANK	m	Did you hear it?
JACK	m	Fucking.
SUSIE	f	Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
FRANK	m	Fucking.
SUSIE	f	For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it. Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
FRANK	m	Give me that.
SUSIE	f	Hey!
FRANK	m	We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
SUSIE	f	I was gonna split it with you guys.
FRANK	m	We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
SUSIE	f	Then I want my name on the poster. And my picture! And these shoes are too goddamn tight!
JACK	m	Nice girl.
LLOYD	m	Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
FRANK	m	Born and bred.
LLOYD	m	Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys.   Don't spend it all in one place.   Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
FRANK	m	We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
LLOYD	m	Say, Frankie.  Since I've got you here... How's next week look for you guys?
JACK	m	We'll call you.
SUSIE	f	Night, Bakers.
WOMAN	f	Barker. Jock Barker?
JACK	m	Baker.  Jack Baker.
WOMAN	f	Right.  Bring him back.
JACK	m	Come on, Ed.
WOMAN	f	You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
JACK	m	He doesn't bite.
WOMAN	f	They never do, Mr. Barker.
JACK	m	Baker.
WOMAN	f	Right.  In there.
JACK	m	You shoulda brushed, pal.
DR. BEASLEY (MAN)	m	Ah, labradorus retreiverus.  Good fellows.   Quiet, but able to appreciate a good joke.
DR. BEASLEY	m	Beasley.
JACK	m	Baker.
DR. BEASLEY	m	What's our friend's problem?
JACK	m	Teeth.
DR. BEASLEY	m	What's wrong with them?
JACK	m	They're falling out.
DR. BEASLEY	m	Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
DR. BEASLEY	m	They gotta go.
JACK	m	How many?
DR. BEASLEY	m	Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there. Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
JACK	m	Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
DR. BEASLEY	m	Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
JACK	m	How will he eat?
DR. BEASLEY	m	Start him out on cottage cheese.   If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
JACK	m	No bones?
DR. BEASLEY	m	No bones.
JACK	m	What do you do to him?
DR. BEASLEY	m	Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
JACK	m	I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
DR. BEASLEY	m	The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
FRANK	m	The twenty-third ... Yeah, here it is. We got the Carlton or the Plaza.  Four day turns. What do you think, Jack?
FRANK	m	Jack, you with us?
SUSIE	f	The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
FRANK	m	I guess it's,the Plaza then.   That brings us to the twenty-seventh.   We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
SUSIE	f	We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
SUSIE	f	The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
JACK	m	Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
SUSIE	f	Oh. Well, for Blackie then.
FRANK	m	By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
SUSIE	f	Hey.
JACK	m	Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
FRANK	m	That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
SUSIE	f	Maybe it's legit.
FRANK	m	Maybe.  I'll call him.
JACK	m	Make it collect.
FRANK	m	That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
JACK	m	Draw.
SUSIE	f	How'd you guys used to decide what gig to take?
FRANK	m	Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
SUSIE	f	So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
FRANK	m	Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year.   Where're your gloves?
FRANK	m	Better take care of your fingers, little brother.   Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
JACK	m	I'll take my chances.
FRANK	m	Something, huh?  All those bids.
JACK	m	Yeah.  Something.
FRANK	m	Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
JACK	m	You wanna get a drink?
FRANK	m	No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been up two nights making sure the rest of us don't get it.
FRANK	m	You all right?
JACK	m	Yeah, fine.
FRANK	m	Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
JACK	m	Right.
SUSIE	f	Where's egghead?
JACK	m	His kid's sick.
SUSIE	f	I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
JACK	m	He takes after our mother.
SUSIE	f	Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
SUSIE	f	Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again?
JACK	m	The Stratford.
SUSIE	f	Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads. Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
JACK	m	Huh?
SUSIE	f	Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. Ah, here's a lost soul.
SUSIE	f	Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
JACK	m	Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee?
SUSIE	f	You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
JACK	m	You want me to walk you?
SUSIE	f	No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
SUSIE	f	Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
SUSIE	f	I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
JACK	m	Forget it.
SUSIE	f	Nothing personal --
JACK	m	Better hurry.  You're a nickel down on your cigarette.
KID	m	Yeah?
KID	m	You want something, pal?  If you're looking for a bathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner.
JACK	m	No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
KID	m	Regular hours are eight to five.
JACK	m	Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
KID	m	You can check in on him tomorrow.   Between eight and five.
JACK	m	Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
KID	m	You want to know if he's okay. Right?
JACK	m	Yeah.
KID	m	All right.  Hold on.
JACK	m	The name's Baker --
KID	m	Save it.  What's he look like?
JACK	m	Black.  Labrador.
KID	m	All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
KID	m	Nope.  Just a couple poodles.
NINA	f	I tried Cheerios this morning.   He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
JACK	m	He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
JACK	m	Chili.
JACK	m	You're gonna knock her dead, kid.
JACK	m	Hey, Frank.
FRANK	m	You recognized me.
JACK	m	Just a lucky guess.
FRANK	m	So what do you think?
JACK	m	Very realistic.
FRANK	m	Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
JACK	m	Yeah.
FRANK	m	Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
FRANK	m	You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
JACK	m	Thanks, but I've got plans.
FRANK	m	All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
SUSIE	f	Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
FRANK	m	For the kids. Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
SUSIE	f	He do that every year?
JACK	m	Every year.
SUSIE	f	Aren't the kids asleep?
JACK	m	Every year.
SUSIE	f	So why's he do it?
JACK	m	I guess in case one year they're not.
SUSIE	f	Call me a cab, will ya?
NINA	f	How'd the show go?
JACK	m	Okay.  How'd yours go?
NINA	f	Not so good.
NINA	f	Eggnog?
NINA	f	From Hurley's?
JACK	m	Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
NINA	f	Jack.
JACK	m	Yeah?
NINA	f	Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
JACK	m	Sure. He hands Nina her glass, then takes his own.
NINA	f	Merry Christmas, Jack.
JACK	m	Merry Christmas.
NINA	f	What do you think?
JACK	m	Very cool.
NINA	f	There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
JACK	m	Sure.
NINA	f	That's what I want to do.   I want to make a snowman.
NINA	f	Now?
NINA	f	Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker.
JACK	m	Hey, Eddie.  Have some respect, will ya?
FRANK	m	So. How was everyone's Christmas?
FRANK	m	Too early, huh?  Well, there's coffee and donuts for whoever wants them.   How about a maple bar, Jack?
FRANK	m	Uh, Jack ... if you don't mind.
FRANK	m	By the way, if anyone gets bored, Donna packed some travel games. They work wonders with the kids.
FRANK	m	You two could play checkers.
SUSIE	f	Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
FRANK	m	Sorry.  It only plays static.
SUSIE	f	How long did you say it takes to get to this place?
FRANK	m	Any more coffee?
SUSIE	f	Uh-uh.  Hey, what's this?
SUSIE	f	You play all these places?
FRANK	m	Baker's unabridged.
SUSIE	f	Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
FRANK	m	Virgins.
SUSIE	f	Virgins?
FRANK	m	First times. Hey, look at this.
FRANK	m	When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
JACK	m	Two years ago.  March.
SUSIE	f	He's right.
FRANK	m	He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
FRANK	m	Go ahead.
SUSIE	f	Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
FRANK	m	Jack?
JACK	m	November.  '71.
FRANK	m	First night?
JACK	m	Day.  Wednesday.
FRANK	m	Last?
JACK	m	Sunday.
SUSIE	f	I don't believe it.
FRANK	m	I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it. Frank smiles into the rear view mirror.
FRANK	m	My brilliant little brother.
FRANK	m	Will you listen to that ocean?
FRANK	m	And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
SUSIE	f	Smells like fish.
FRANK	m	Of course it smells like fish.   We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
SUSIE	f	Smells like tuna number two to me.
FRANK	m	It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
FRANK	m	Hi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys.
CLERK	m	Glad to meet you.  I'm Terrific Tom.
FRANK	m	No. We're the entertainment.
TOM (CLERK)	m	Oh, right, gotcha.  You got bags?
FRANK	m	Outside.  Blue Chevy.
TOM	m	Cyril.  Chevy.  Blue.  Take 'em up to the Guinevere Suite.
TOM	m	Right on the ocean, Mr. Baker. You can practically dangle your toes in the water.
FRANK	m	You believe this?  I'm telling you, we're getting away with murder.  Two shows a night and the rest of the time we live like kings.  It's a crime.
SUSIE	f	Hey, we're connected.
FRANK	m	Great.
SUSIE	f	Great?
FRANK	m	Yeah.
JACK	m	I thought we had separate rooms.
FRANK	m	We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
JACK	m	I thought we all had separate rooms.
FRANK	m	Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
SUSIE	f	You're kidding me.
FRANK	m	As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
SUSIE	f	Peggy Lee?
FRANK	m	Tell her.
JACK	m	She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
FRANK	m	It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
JACK	m	We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
FRANK	m	Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
JACK	m	Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
FRANK	m	A few bars!
SUSIE	f	What'd she sing?
FRANK	m	People.' You think Streisand, right?   Hot that night.  Chills.   Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
SUSIE	f	Wow. You ever see her again?
FRANK	m	No. We got a picture, though.   One of the waitresses had a camera. God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
FRANK	m	Hey, will you look at that?
SUSIE	f	They must've bought the same map we did.
FRANK	m	What do you say we send a bottle over?
SUSIE	f	I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
JACK	m	He's drunk.
FRANK	m	Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
SUSIE	f	Oh yeah?
FRANK	m	He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
JACK	m	Have some more wine, Frank.
FRANK	m	Good idea. To Peggy Lee.
FRANK	m	I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
JACK	m	Okay.
FRANK	m	I figure that way we won't get confused.
JACK	m	Right.
FRANK	m	Unless you want the right.
JACK	m	No, you take the right.
FRANK	m	We might as well do the towels the same way.
JACK	m	Okay.
FRANK	m	I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
JACK	m	Good idea.
FRANK	m	But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
JACK	m	Right.
JACK	m	You leaving that on?
FRANK	m	Yeah.
JACK	m	All night?
FRANK	m	Yeah.
JACK	m	We're gonna be here a week?
FRANK	m	Yeah.
JACK	m	So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
FRANK	m	Yeah.  You mind?
JACK	m	Why would I mind?
FRANK	m	I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
FRANK	m	Oh. I didn't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. It was never a big deal then.  Was it?
FRANK	m	Oh. Well.  You want me to turn it off?
FRANK	m	I'll turn it off.
JACK	m	Forget it.  It's no big deal.
FRANK	m	They're beauties, huh?
FRANK	m	Reminds me of those Steinways Willie used to have.
FRANK	m	What?
MR. DANIELS (LITTLE MAN)	m	Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
FRANK	m	That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker.   This is my brother Jack.
MR. DANIELS	m	Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
FRANK	m	Yes, well, they are.
MR. DANIELS	m	Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
FRANK	m	They are in tune.  But not with each other.
MR. DANIELS	m	Is that important?
FRANK	m	Uh, well ...
JACK	m	Yes.  It's important.
MR. DANIELS	m	Tom, who're we dealing with on these?
TOM	m	A Mr. Reynolds, sir.  But he's gone on vacation. I called this morning.
MR. DANIELS	m	Well, gentlemen, I don't know what to say.   Not being a musician myself I find it difficult to grasp the magnitude of this.  I don't suppose there's any way you could just ... accommodate.
JACK	m	Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
FRANK	m	I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
JACK	m	Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
MR. DANIELS	m	I assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended. I simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?
FRANK	m	Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
JACK	m	No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
FRANK	m	What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
JACK	m	Christ, can't you hear it?
FRANK	m	No! I never hear it! Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
JACK	m	Doesn't it matter to you?
FRANK	m	What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years.   So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat.   So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
JACK	m	Because I can hear it.
FRANK	m	Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
SUSIE	f	Hey, fellas.  What's the word?
SUSIE	f	What's with you two?
FRANK	m	Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
SUSIE	f	0-kay.
FRANK	m	Thank you, thank you. You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends.   And family.  Right, Jack?
JACK	m	Right.  I love you, Frank.
FRANK	m	What?
JACK	m	I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
FRANK	m	Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack. So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
SUSIE	f	Huh?
FRANK	m	Got another song for us?
SUSIE	f	Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
FRANK	m	Well then ... shall we?
FRANK	m	What's the matter with you?
JACK	m	I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
FRANK	m	How dare you say you love me.
JACK	m	It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
SUSIE	f	What's with you guys?
FRANK	m	Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
JACK	m	Sure you will.
SUSIE	f	Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
JACK	m	It's okay. Last one.
SUSIE	f	Can't sleep?
JACK	m	In and out.
SUSIE	f	It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
JACK	m	Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
SUSIE	f	How's egghead?
JACK	m	Like a baby. You?
SUSIE	f	In and out.
SUSIE	f	If you want, I got a pack in the room.
JACK	m	No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
JACK	m	What the hell are you doing?
FRANK	m	What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
JACK	m	Really.
FRANK	m	Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
JACK	m	How's it coming?
FRANK	m	Fine.
JACK	m	How long you been at it?
FRANK	m	Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
JACK	m	They stopped serving two hours ago.
FRANK	m	Two hours ago!
JACK	m	Time flies, huh?
JACK	m	I could give you a hand.  If you want.
FRANK	m	What do you make that?  Paruchi?
FRANK	m	You haven't seen Susie, have you?
JACK	m	No. Why?
FRANK	m	Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
JACK	m	She's a big girl.
FRANK	m	Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there. Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane.   Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
JACK	m	What the hell are these?
FRANK	m	Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea. And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
WOMAN	f	Excuse me.
WOMAN	f	I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
FRANK	m	Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
FLORENCE SIMMONS (WOMAN)	f	Oh, I know, I know.  My husband and I saw you play last night and it's the most remarkable thing.
FRANK	m	Oh. Well, thank you.
FLORENCE SIMMONS	f	No, I mean you. I have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you. Exactly.  You don't happen to have a Huckleberry in your family tree, do you?
JACK	m	Afraid not.
FLORENCE SIMMONS	f	Well, it's frightening.  You could be his twin. Of course, he doesn't have your talent.  Musically, I mean.  He sharpens things for a living.  Lawn mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge. Can imagine?
FLORENCE SIMMONS	f	Well, anyway, I just had to make sure there was no relation.  You play wonderfully.  Both of you.
FRANK	m	Funny, huh?
JACK	m	What?
FRANK	m	Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere. Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
FLORENCE SIMMONS	f	I just know my sister won't believe me. Do you mind?
FLORENCE SIMMONS	f	I really hate to impose.  It's just that the resemblance is so extraordinary. I wonder if you could turn this way so your face isn't in the shadows.
FLORENCE SIMMONS	f	Say cheese.
FLORENCE SIMMONS	f	Gotcha.  Would you like a copy for yourself?  The hotel develops.
JACK	m	No.
FRANK	m	Thank you.  You know, before we came out here this evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking over your dedications and something struck us.
FRANK	m	We realized that, well, we're really not so different from one another after all.  Oh sure, we may be at different points in our journey, but we all travel pretty much the same road. And so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce you to two very special couples.  First, married for all of two days, please say hello to Helen and Bud Wilson.  Helen.  Bud.
FRANK	m	And now, our second couple.  I'm talking about Ethel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen.  Now, Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told you they'd been married for fifty years.  Why? Because, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane have been married for seventy-five years!
FRANK	m	Ethel, Bert.  Get up here and show these kids how it's done.
FRANK	m	Aren't they a sight?
SUSIE	f	Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
FRANK	m	You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
SUSIE	f	Huh?
FRANK	m	I just saw a man walk out of your room.
SUSIE	f	Uh ...
FRANK	m	In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
SUSIE	f	Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
FRANK	m	No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
JACK	m	Hey!
JACK	m	What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
FRANK	m	We were just having a little discussion about morality.
SUSIE	f	Some discussion.
FRANK	m	I just saw a man walk out of your room!
JACK	m	You saw wrong.
FRANK	m	Huh?
JACK	m	He's with the hotel.  I called him.
FRANK	m	What are you talking about?
JACK	m	We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
FRANK	m	He was wearing a suit.
JACK	m	He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
FRANK	m	How come I didn't hear anything?
JACK	m	You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper. Unlike me.
FRANK	m	I guess I ... If I jumped to...
SUSIE	f	Forget it.
FRANK	m	Well...
SUSIE	f	Boy, he comes on like a hurricane in the morning, doesn't he?
SUSIE	f	Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
JACK	m	Hey, business is business.
SUSIE	f	It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
JACK	m	Just dinner and dance, right?
SUSIE	f	Paradise.
FRANK	m	Yes, Daddy promises.  I'll bring you one of the little glasses, how's that?  Just like Grandma has.   It has a picture of the hotel on it and everything ... No, honey, they don't sell puppies here ... Who? ... Well, we'll see.  Let me talk to Mommy, okay?... Okay,sweetheart.  Happy New Year. Hi, honey.  She says Angela Secoli got a puppy for Christmas.  Explain to her why we can't ... I don't know, tell her you're allergic ... It's not lying. Well, okay, it is lying, but ... All right, then tell her I'll explain it ... He what? ... No kidding? Without the training wheels? Well, that's great.  Tell him, tell him. I can't wait to see ... No, no new bike.  Maybe for his birthday ... Okay.  Listen, honey, I have to go.We're on in ten minutes ... Yeah, Happy New Year ... I love you ...
FRANK	m	Well, let's go.  The public waits.
FRANK	m	All right, everyone.  This is it. Let's hear it.  Ten.  Nine ...
FRANK/EVERYONE	?	Eight.  Seven.  Six.  Five. Four.  Three.  Two!  ONE!
SUSIE/EVERYONE	?	Lest old acquaintances be forgot ...
FRANK	m	Ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear. Happy New Year, little brother.
JACK	m	What're you doing down here?
FRANK	m	Celebrating.  Join me?
JACK	m	The party's over.
FRANK	m	No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink.   Show your big brother how it's done.
JACK	m	Expensive hangover.
FRANK	m	A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels. We, dear brother, are a fucking smash. Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
FRANK	m	You know, I've never kissed my wife on New Year's. Not once in twelve years.
FRANK	m	The Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it? With the blue glass.
JACK	m	The Royal.
FRANK	m	Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
JACK	m	Couple years.
FRANK	m	February?
JACK	m	April.
FRANK	m	Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
JACK	m	A useless talent.
FRANK	m	Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
JACK	m	They were simple songs.
FRANK	m	Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever. So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
JACK	m	I told you.  It's a useless talent.
FRANK	m	God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
JACK	m	Yeah.
FRANK	m	I always think of him on New Year's.   How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
JACK	m	You always threw up.
FRANK	m	Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
JACK	m	He was just having fun.
FRANK	m	It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
JACK	m	It was just a can of beer, Frank.
FRANK	m	Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest.   It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
JACK	m	You could've come.
FRANK	m	I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
JACK	m	You're making things up, Frank.
FRANK	m	Maybe so. You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
JACK	m	No.
FRANK	m	Want one?
FRANK	m	Ah well, the kids'll break a couple anyway.
BUD	m	Give me the keys.
HELEN	f	You're not going to drive.
BUD	m	Give me the keys!
HELEN	f	You're not going to drive!
BUD	m	It's my goddamn car!
HELEN	f	It's our goddamn car!
BUD	m	Give me the keys.
HELEN	f	No.
FRANK	m	I think I'll warm up the car.
FRANK	m	That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
JACK	m	The tenth's out.
FRANK	m	What?
JACK	m	I can't make the tenth.
FRANK	m	What do you mean?
JACK	m	I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
FRANK	m	Be reasonable, Jack.
JACK	m	I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
FRANK	m	How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
SUSIE	f	Huh?
FRANK	m	Forget it.
SUSIE	f	Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ...
SUSIE	f	I can't sing it anymore.
FRANK	m	What?
SUSIE	f	That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
FRANK	m	What're you talking about?  They love it.
SUSIE	f	I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it.   Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
FRANK	m	Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
SUSIE	f	And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
SUSIE	f	I need some air.
JACK	m	You're gonna wear down those heels if you don't give it a rest. She stops.
JACK	m	Relax.  We'll drop the song.
SUSIE	f	Guess I got a little scattered.
JACK	m	It's a shitty  song.
SUSIE	f	How do you do it? Every night?
JACK	m	Practice. There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
SUSIE	f	Listen... Nothing.
HENRY	m	Thank you.  As most of you know, we like to shake things up here every so often just to keep you people on your toes.  So I'm gonna take a little rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit in.  He drops by about once a year just to keep his hands clean.  Ladies and gentlemen.   Jack Baker.
SUSIE	f	You were good.
JACK	m	I can keep the beat.
SUSIE	f	Better than that.
SUSIE	f	What's the matter?
JACK	m	Nothing.
SUSIE	f	What'd I say?
JACK	m	Nothing.
SUSIE	f	You're upset.
JACK	m	I'm not upset.
SUSIE	f	All I said was you were good.
JACK	m	Look. You don't know good. All right?
SUSIE	f	What's that supposed to mean?
JACK	m	It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
SUSIE	f	You were good.
JACK	m	Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
SUSIE	f	You were good.
JACK	m	How do you know?
SUSIE	f	Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
SUSIE	f	So you wanna get a drink?
JACK	m	Nina?
SUSIE	f	Who's Nina?
JACK	m	Friend.
SUSIE	f	Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
JACK	m	She's four feet tall.  Ed?
SUSIE	f	Ed? How many people live here?
JACK	m	I have to make him some chili. Okay?
SUSIE	f	Sure.
SUSIE	f	Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it.   When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
JACK	m	How come you didn't close your eyes?
SUSIE	f	I don't know.  I guess I didn't trust the night like she did.
SUSIE	f	Let me have a cigarette, will you?   All of mine are down there on the sidewalk.
SUSIE	f	Long story.
SUSIE	f	You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
JACK	m	Must've been a cheap date.
SUSIE	f	Soap convention.
JACK	m	Soap?
SUSIE	f	Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ... Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out.   But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
SUSIE	f	It wasn't so bad, though.  I'd get a nice piece of steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.  Usually whatever the guy was into.  Got a socket set once.   Believe it?  The guy looked like held just given me four dozen roses. But I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see the rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed.   Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to believe sleeping in a room like that don't change your life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie. I didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ...
SUSIE	f	Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up.
SUSIE	f	So what's this?
JACK	m	History.
SUSIE	f	Huh?
JACK	m	My father proposed to my mother in there.
SUSIE	f	No kidding?
SUSIE	f	The both of them?  In there?
JACK	m	He called her.
SUSIE	f	Oh. So what's it doing here?
JACK	m	Long story.
SUSIE	f	You sending me home?
JACK	m	They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
SUSIE	f	Nervous?
JACK	m	By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
SUSIE	f	You're kidding.
JACK	m	He had a mind that escalated things.
SUSIE	f	So, what happened?
JACK	m	He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
JACK	m	I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
SUSIE	f	Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
JACK	m	Ma didn't want it around.  After.
SUSIE	f	Oh.
SUSIE	f	Frank said you saw him die.
SUSIE	f	Frank said ---
JACK	m	Frank wasn't 'there.
JACK	m	He took me out to the docks one day.  We did that a lot.  There were other places, but he loved the ocean. He'd worked boats as a kid.  Never got rid of it. It was always in him.  He'd drink a little when we'd go.  If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig. To make me laugh. He drank a lot that day.
JACK	m	There was a lot of wind.  He was up on this cargo shelf, right over the ocean.  And he started to do the jig.  One minute he was there ... I thought it was a joke at first. He did things like that.  Games. I was laughing when it happened.
JACK	m	You got pretty eyes, you know that.
JACK	m	You gotta move 'em around if you want to play a song.
SUSIE	f	Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
JACK	m	Coffee?
SUSIE	f	Yeah... No.
JACK	m	Look, if you want to leave...
SUSIE	f	Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
SUSIE	f	Shit.  I think I started a fire.
JACK	m	If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
JACK	m	Why don't you go.  I'll see you tomorrow night at the Ambassador.
SUSIE	f	I followed you last night.  I mean, I was here.  Outside.  I was about to come up when you came out.
SUSIE	f	The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank... I'm leaving.  The act.
SUSIE	f	It's a ... I met this guy at the resort.  He liked my voice.  And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat food just by singing about it.  Can you believe it?
SUSIE	f	You can always get another girl.
JACK	m	There's always another girl.
NICK	m	Sick?  How sick?
FRANK	m	The flu.
NICK	m	So she's got a few sniffles.
FRANK	m	Doctor's orders.
NICK	m	You got no right springing this on me, Frankie.   It's unethical.
FRANK	m	Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
NICK	m	What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there? Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
JACK	m	What're you doing?
FRANK	m	Just until we find another girl.
JACK	m	Cancel, Frank.
FRANK	m	You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
JACK	m	Better give her pneumonia.
GIRL	f	Remember me?
GIRL	f	Monica.  Monica Moran.  I came in the last time you guys were looking for a singer. Perseverance.  First rule of show business.
MONICA (GIRL)	f	I bought a book.  That's what it says.
FRANK	m	We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a couple of weeks.  Larry Shelton said he'd let me know by Friday on the Ambassador.  That's it.
FRANK	m	I got some calls out.  Things that might be good for us.
FRANK	m	We'll try for a girl again next week.
FRANK	m	Okay.  Well, the Roosevelt then.
FRANK	m	You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
JACK	m	Twenty-eight years.
FRANK	m	Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little different.  We were just kids.  Just about the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must've shaved three lives off old Cecil, huh, Jack?
FRANK	m	Yeah, well, anyway.  It's nice to be back here in the Roosevelt Room, because this has always been ...
FRANK	m	a very special place for Jack and I. And tonight we'd like to open with a very special song.  It's the song my mother and father danced  to the night they were married.  This is for them.
FRANK	m	You should've told us you were coming, Ma.   We would've come and got you.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Spur of the moment.
FRANK	m	So what'd you think?
MRS.  BAKER	f	Thrilling. Both of you.
FRANK	m	The audience was a little off tonight.
MRS.  BAKER	f	A few empty tables.  It's cozier.   Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
FRANK	m	I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack?   Theo's should still be open.
MRS.  BAKER	f	No, no.  You boys are tired.
FRANK	m	No, we're not.  Jack?
JACK	m	No.
MRS.  BAKER	f	I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
FRANK	m	You sure?
MRS.  BAKER	f	Just call me a cab.
FRANK	m	A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
MRS.  BAKER	f	All right.
MRS.  BAKER	f	It's beautiful, isn't it?
JACK	m	Yeah.
MRS.  BAKER	f	This was quite,a place once.  After the war.  On Friday nights they had dances in the ballroom upstairs.  It was beautiful.  Crystal chandeliers. White tablecloths.  Orchids floating in the punch bowls... It was a wonderful place to be young.
MRS.  BAKER	f	It went well tonight.
JACK	m	Frank works hard.
MRS.  BAKER	f	And you don't?
JACK	m	He leads, I follow.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Is that the way it is?
JACK	m	Pretty much.
MRS.  BAKER	f	He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
JACK	m	For a while.  She left.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
JACK	m	I suppose.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Funny.  Watching tonight, I was remembering when you were young. How I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to the two of you practice while I did the dishes. My two little radios.  Sometimes I'd stop and go to the door and just watch.  Sometimes your father would too. He liked to listen to you play. Did you know that?
MRS.  BAKER	f	You miss him, don't you?
JACK	m	It's been a long time, Ma.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Yes. I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
MRS.  BAKER	f	His love scared me, you know.  The day he died he  left a flower on my pillow.
MRS.  BAKER	f	You look so like him.
FRANK	m	Your limo's ready, Ma.
MRS.  BAKER	f	All right.
MRS.  BAKER	f	Good night, Jack.
JACK	m	Sorry.
JACK	m	We're not getting paid then.
FRANK	m	No.
JACK	m	Nothing. We get nothing.
FRANK	m	I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
JACK	m	What's it for?
FRANK	m	I don't know. Some disease.
JACK	m	What disease?
FRANK	m	I don't know.
JACK	m	You don't know?
FRANK	m	It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
JACK	m	What channels it on?
FRANK	m	Seventy-one
JACK	m	Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
FRANK	m	A channel.   It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
JACK	m	Right.
FRANK	m	The guy said to find Studio E and turn right.  What's that say?
YOUTH	m	Fast break!
FRANK	m	I guess it's that way.
FRANK	m	This must be it.  I'll see when we're on.
EARL (MAN)	m	You the magician?
JACK	m	No.
EARL	m	Oh.  What do you do?
JACK	m	Piano.
EARL	m	Two at a time?
JACK	m	My brother and I. One each.
EARL	m	Oh.
JACK	m	What's wrong with the kid?
EARL	m	Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
JACK	m	Accident?
EARL	m	The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym. As Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS.  Frank returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.
FRANK	m	We're on after Meadowlark. What's wrong?
JACK	m	Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
FRANK	m	What?
JACK	m	We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
FRANK	m	What?
VINCE	m	Let's hear it for our own Jimmy Marshall, shall we?
VINCE	m	As most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist on that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant High this year.  Luckily, the doctors tell us Jimmy'll be able to play next season.  That is ... if there is a next season. That's where you come in.  Pick up that phone.   Make a donation.  Let's keep our kids off the streets and in the gym where they belong.
VINCE	m	All right.  Well, friends, what can I say about our next guest? He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with us two of the most respected men in the musical entertainment field.  I think you'll agree with me when I tell you we're in for a real treat when I say that we have with us ... the Fabulous Bunker Boys!  Come on out here guys.
VINCE	m	Whoops, there they are.  Hey, nice suits, fellas. Now I know a lot of you amateur musicians out there are going to want to rap with these guys and don't worry.  Right after they finish up here, they're going to be manning the phones.  Maybe we can even convince them to raffle off a few piano lessons if we're lucky.  What do you think?
VINCE	m	Well, all right then.  What are we waiting for?  Take it away, guys.
VINCE	m	Uh oh.  We know what that means, don't we?  It's time to turn the board over. I'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute.   Let's bring out the board.
FRANK	m	Jack ...
VINCE	m	What the --
JACK	m	You're a fucking creep, you know that.  I oughta kick your ass.
FRANK	m	Jack, you're on television.
JACK	m	Shut up, Frank.
EARL	m	What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
JACK	m	Get your hand off me.
EARL	m	Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you.   Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
JACK	m	Go fuck yourself.
EARL	m	You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
JACK	m	I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
FRANK	m	Hey, leave him alone.
EARL	m	Do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up.
JACK	m	You're a lousy dancer, Earl.  Don't you know the man's supposed to lead?
EARL	m	Who do you think you are, asshole? Liberace?
FRANK	m	Jack.  We just,passed the car. Jack.  This is a tuxedo.  Three hundred dollars. You gonna talk to me?  Or is this Jack's famous silent act?  Look, it was for publicity.   Do you understand?  Publicity.
JACK	m	What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
FRANK	m	Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do?   I had the pianos anyway.
JACK	m	Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
FRANK	m	I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
JACK	m	What?
FRANK	m	It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt.   A stupid-ass stunt.
JACK	m	What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.   What's happened to your dignity?
FRANK	m	Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
FRANK	m	This where you get your dignity, Jack?   This is where you get your courage?
FRANK	m	No, let's do it straight for once, shall we?
FRANK	m	Let me explain something to you, little brother.   See, I've got people who depend on me.  I've got a wife and two children who expect to wake up every morning with food on the table and heat in the house.   I got a mortgage.  I got car payments.  I got Ma's medical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.  Yeah, you.   Jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so fucking sure he's better than everyone else.  Don't you think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes and blow smoke in his face?  Goddamn right I would.   But I can't.  Because I have to be responsible, little brother.  I have to make sure the numbers balance out in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go on living their lives.  You don't win medals for it, but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I folded up shop.  So don't talk to me about dignity, little brother.  You're drawing on a weak hand.
FRANK	m	Great.  Terrific.  Walk away.  You're good at that, Jack.  Just don't forget to stop off for another bottle of courage on your way home. That's what he'd do.
FRANK	m	You've found the perfect solution to all the pain in the world, haven't you, little brother?   Eight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.   You're weak, Jack.  Just like he was.
JACK	m	Stay off it.
FRANK	m	No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god.   For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
JACK	m	You weren't there.
FRANK	m	That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
JACK	m	Fuck you.
FRANK	m	No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
FRANK	m	Hey, what're you doing?  Hey!
FRANK	m	Jack! ... Jack! ...
JACK	m	How's it feel to have your little brother beat the shit out of you?  Huh?  Huh!
FRANK	m	My hands!  My hands!
JACK	m	Your hands.  Your hands couldn't take the blue ribbon on amateur night.
FRANK	m	Jack!
JACK	m	Who's weak now, big brother?
FRANK	m	Jack!  JACK!
JACK	m	I'm through with it.  I can't do it anymore.
CINDY	f	Hello?
CINDY	f	Hello ... Hellooooo ... Daddy.  Daddy!  Someone's on the phone and they won't talk.
MAN	m	If they wanna talk about their wife, you listen.   If they wanna talk about their job, you listen.   If they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen.   That's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I send you home.  Okay?
JACK	m	That it?
MAN	m	How many you need?
JACK	m	It's out of tune.
MAN	m	Trust me, the way I fix a martini, it'll be in tune.
SUSIE	f	I thought the Bakers didn't take tips.
JACK	m	I give it all to charity.
SUSIE	f	Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
JACK	m	Yeah.  Got my own sign.
SUSIE	f	So ... ?
JACK	m	We outgrew each other.
SUSIE	f	Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
JACK	m	You don't pick your brother.
SUSIE	f	Yeah.
JACK	m	So how's the cat food business?
SUSIE	f	Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
JACK	m	What kind?
SUSIE	f	Huh?
JACK	m	Vegetables.
SUSIE	f	Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
SUSIE	f	Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ... Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
JACK	m	I've given it up.
SUSIE	f	No kidding?  Well ... I guess you can't do a reunion over tomato juice, can you? Anyway, if you're ever in the neighborhood ... I wrote it down.
SUSIE	f	Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
JACK	m	If I see him.
JACK	m	Hey. You got pretty eyes.
DONNA	f	Frank?  It's late, honey.
DONNA	f	Mrs. Lerner called after dinner.  Robbie can't make his lesson tomorrow.
FRANK	m	You know how good he is?  It's like breathing with him.  I've always envied it.  But tonight, looking at all this -- at his face -- I don't know.   Maybe it's worse.  For him. It's funny.  When I sit here and play ... nothing.   But when I was up there with him... It was like I had the gift, too.
FRANK	m	Come on, Jeremy.  Open the door.
FRANK	m	Jeremy.  You want me to call your father?   He's not going to be very happy when he hears he's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you to sit on the toilet.
DONNA	f	Honey ...
FRANK	m	You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom.   There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
DONNA	f	Honey ...
FRANK	m	Where are our kids?   Has he got one of them in there?
DONNA	f	Frank.
JACK	m	Donna.  Where is she?
DONNA	f	We tried the apartment, but after that we didn't know where to call.
DONNA	f	Frank'll be back in a moment.   He took Little Frank to the bathroom.
DONNA	f	Jack ...
SUSIE	f	Jack.
JACK	m	Hi.
SUSIE	f	Well, this is some surprise. Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
SUSIE	f	Jack?
SUSIE	f	You want to come in?
SUSIE	f	Let me get the light.
JACK	m	No.
JACK	m	Leave it dark.
SUSIE	f	I used to do that.
SUSIE	f	Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
JACK	m	I didn't want to wake you.
SUSIE	f	Yeah.
JACK	m	Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
SUSIE	f	Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over.   Like a song.
SUSIE	f	Hey.
SUSIE	f	Am I gonna see you again?
JACK	m	Yeah.  You're gonna see me again.
SUSIE	f	Okay.
JACK	m	What're you looking for?
FRANK	m	I didn't hear you come in.
JACK	m	What're you doing?
FRANK	m	Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there.   If you want to get started.
JACK	m	Later.
JACK	m	Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
FRANK	m	Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know.   She and Dad had taken care of it.
JACK	m	Right.
FRANK	m	I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today. It's okay?  Wednesday?
JACK	m	Yeah, fine.
FRANK	m	There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
JACK	m	Sure.
FRANK	m	It's funny.  Before, whenever I came here, the house seemed small.  But today ... I can't keep up with it. I keep losing my wind.
FRANK	m	God, I could use a drink.
FRANK	m	Oh. Well, great.  I'll get a couple glasses.
FRANK	m	Damn.  Donna must've packed them up this morning.
JACK	m	Go ahead.
FRANK	m	No.
JACK	m	Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
FRANK	m	No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
JACK	m	Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
FRANK	m	Oh, hey, I want to show you something.  Come on.
FRANK	m	Hit the C. Go ahead.
FRANK	m	I'm right, aren't I? They're in tune.
FRANK	m	All these years.  She kept them in tune.   Can you imagine?   Now why would she do something like that?
FRANK	m	Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all. What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada.   We got the Travelodge on Route 41.   And ... the Mallory.
JACK	m	I'll take the Mallory.
FRANK	m	Good choice.
FRANK	m	Looks like these got a few years on them.
JACK	m	This'll kill 'em.
FRANK	m	Jesus.
JACK	m	How're your hands?
FRANK	m	Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
JACK	m	You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
FRANK	m	Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
JACK	m	I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
FRANK	m	I can keep the beat.
FRANK	m	Charlie called.
JACK	m	Yeah?
FRANK	m	Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others.   Donna said even Lloyd called the other day.   Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
JACK	m	Yeah.
FRANK	m	Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
JACK	m	Five years ago. November.
FRANK	m	Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
JACK	m	Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
FRANK	m	Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
JACK	m	She asked for it.
FRANK	m	I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
JACK AND FRANK	m	What my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.
JACK	m	She got it all right.
JACK AND FRANK	m	She comes on like a dream Peaches and cream Lips like strawberry wine She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine. Ribbons and curls Ooh, what a girl Eyes that sparkle and shine You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.
FRANK	m	Well ... One more time?
JACK	m	One more time.
