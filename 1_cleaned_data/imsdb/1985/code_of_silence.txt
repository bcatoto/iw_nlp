DONATO	m	O.K. Home Team. Ready in the bullpen.
MUSIC 	m	Copy Shortstop. Double play. We're  with him now.
SPOTTER 	m	Center's in.
EDDIE	m	Where's Cragie?
DONATO 	m	Talk to me left field.
KOSALAS	?	Ready sir. Left Field in position.
CRAGIE	?	Have a shot, kid. A little nerve  tonic.
KOSALAS	?	What's the matter with you?
SPOTTER 	m	O.K., guys, runner on first base.
KOBAS	m	Just turning on Paulina.
EDDIE 	m	Double Play, you got him in sight?

SPIDER 	m	You do that real nice, Pancho. what  say we get married.
EDDIE	m	Found you a present.
DONATO	m	Shit, those things will fuck up your  mind.
CRAGIE	?	If you gotta take a leak, do it now.
KOSALAS	?	I can't go wading in with my shlong  flapping in the wind.
CRAGIE	?	Sure you can. It's called diversionary  tactics.
BRENNAN 	m	What's going on in the ballpark?
DONATO 	m	Don't get froggy. Wait for the green  light.
MUSIC	m	What the hell is this cat up to?
BRENNAN	m	Going to work asshole. What do you  think.
MUSIC	m	At this hour.
BRENNAN	m	They got a hardass for a boss. Like  us.
SPIDER	m	This be better than jukin' Seven- Elevens, huh Victor?
VICTOR	m	This one's got some balls, huh? I don't juke anybody.
DOC	m	I say, awright. The royal colors.
LUNA	f	Okay, by the numbers.
EDDIE	m	Everybody on your toes.
MUSIC 	m	Their Right Field's Clear. Those  painters are out of the way.
EDDIE	m	What the hell you talking about?
MUSIC 	m	We got a painting crew of painters  just went in the building next door.
EDDIE	m	Painters? That building's gonna be  condemned!
EDDIE	m	Play Ball! Play-fucking-ball!
DONATO	m	Home Team! We're goin in! Move it!  Move it!
KOSALAS	?	I knew it.
EDDIE	m	Police! No se mueve!
DONATO	m	They're goin out the front!
KOSALAS	?	Cragie?!
CRAGIE	?	It's O.K. I got the sonovabitch.
CRAGIE	?	Police! Stay where you are!
EDDIE	m	Take it easy, Kosalas.
CRAGIE	?	The kid didn't dust him. I did.
CRAGIE	?	Him or me, Sarge. The kid saw the whole thing.
CRAGIE	?	Tell him, Nick.
KOSALAS	?	Yeah, that's how it went down.
EDDIE	m	Stay here. Take care of your partner.
VICTOR	m	Call Luis.
KOBAS	m	Get these people back out of here,  wouldja.
CRAGIE	?	Look, it's no big thing, Kid. A  friggin' dog and pony show. Some  dumb ass questions by dumb ass  bureaucrats. "When's the last time  you were at the range?" Crap like  that.
KOSALAS	?	Look. It was a fuckin' accident. Why  can't you just be --
CRAGIE	?	You born yesterday?! These ain't  cops. They'll roast our ass just  cause we carry a badge. Both of us. We stick together on this, kid. We're  partners, right?
DONATO	m	Aw man, don't do that. You know how  much these things cost?
DONATO	m	Eddie. Scam this. A bait shop. Worms,  minnows. Don't even need real worms.  Storage problem. Got those rubber  ones, you know?
EDDIE	m	Yeah, what about the winter?
DONATO	m	We winter in Florida. Rubber neck  the beach bunnies. Aw, look at that.  Ruined my brand new fence climbers.  Hand made in Italy.
DONATO	m	Oh, fuck, Partida. I'm gonna tell  her you shot me.
PARTIDA	f	Cusack. You were in charge here?
EDDIE	m	Does it look like it?
PARTIDA	f	And you were a principal in one of  the shootings?
DONATO	m	OW! A goddamn Dr. Jekyll!
PARTIDA	f	Where's the officer who was involved  in the other shooting?
EDDIE	m	Third floor rear.
EDDIE	m	Catch you later, Hopalong.
MUSIC	m	You know that, Efren. When your big  bad brother Luis gets the word, your  ass is freeze dried and fried.
BRENNAN	m	Talk you hemorrhoid!
POMPAS	m	Your mother fucks dogs in the street.
BRENNAN	m	You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you  know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball?  Cause the harder you hit 'em, the  better their English gets.
EDDIE	m	We're jerking off here.
SANCHEZ	m	Let's cut the shit, Cusack.
SANCHEZ	m	Option 1: you can send em downtown.  If Judge Collins didn't get laid  last night, you can probably get him  to arraign my clients for loitering  in their own hallway. He'll set bail.  I'll take care of it. Option 2:  release them here and now and we'll  call it a day. Up to you.
EDDIE	m	I like to see you earn your money.
CRAGIE	?	We come up the back stairs. We start  cleanin' the hallway when the deceased  pops out of a doorway with a 25  automatic. I tell him to drop it,  but he's comin. We had no choice.  Kosalas here saw the whole thing.
KATES	f	Did you?
KOSALAS	?	I was on another doorway...
KATES	f	But you saw the action?
KOSALAS	?	I saw him fall.
KATES	f	And the kid was armed?
KOSALAS	?	That's the way it went down.
KATES	f	And you saw the weapon?
KOSALAS	?	Yes sir. I saw it in his hand.
KATES	f	O.K.
CRAGIE	?	Hearing? Who called for a hearing?  The little fuck tried to shoot me in  the back!
KATES	f	Ms. Partida --
CRAGIE	?	That piece of shit!
KATES	f	Shut-up, Cragie. Partida has demanded a formal hearing.  You will be under oath so the  department will provide you with a  lawyer unless you've got your own. An OPS Review Board member is waiting  to talk to you. Doesn't sound like  you got anything to worry about.
KATES	f	Kosalas, you work with Cusack until  this is over.
KOSALAS	?	Yes sir.
EDDIE	m	I ain't got no time to nursmaid a  rookie. I don't need a partner.
KATES	f	Your right! You don't need a partner!  You need a goddamn keeper! Jesus Christ! How do I explain this  one upstairs? We gave you 600 man-hours, you took  a month planning the damn thing, and  what have you got to show for it?  Nine bodies? A dead informant? One  of my best men shot! For Christ's  sake! You're going to have me back on a  beat busting perverts in the park.
EDDIE	m	We got a bigger problem. These  Comachos aren't gonna take this lying  down. The animals are out of the  cages.
KATES	f	Just what I need. A goddman war.
KATES	f	Keep track of this business with  Cragie?
EDDIE	m	Yeah.
KATES	f	I'll deal with upstairs.
KATES	f	Just get me some answers, huh.
EDDIE	m	That's my job.
PARTIDA	f	...you have the right to remain  silent. You have the right to have  an attorney present at all times.  Anything you say may be used against  you in a court of law...
EDDIE	m	I'm going to have to fix that.
EDDIE	m	You know, it's kind of interesting.  That 16 year old in the hallway with  the gun? Partida told me he doesn't  have a record. The kid's never been  arrested.
KOSALAS	?	Yeah, well, you know, if you read  the papers, cops only shoot honor  students. Sole support of the family  and all that.
TOWER 	m	...Lear 9 Lima Kilo number 2 for  landing -- wind south 20, altimeter  two-niner-niner-two...
KOSALAS	?	Nice fellow this Luis Comacho. Donato  says they call him the Angel-of-Death.
EDDIE	m	Real sweetheart.
MOLLY LUNA 	f	Now?
DIANA	f	No!
MOLLY 	f	Now?
DIANA	f	Mama!
DIANA	f	Daddy, would you get that!
THERESA	f	Bella.
DIANA	f	Keep 'em closed now.
DIANA	f	O.K., open 'em.
DIANA	f	Happy birthday, momma.
THERESA	f	Happy birthday, Molly.
TONY LUNA	m	Molly! Pack me a bag! Quick! Ok?  C'mon I'm in a hurry!
MOLLY	f	But Tony, why...?
TONY LUNA	m	Business! C'mon, move. Do what I  tell you!
DIANA	f	Don't do it, momma! Make him pack  his own bag.
TONY LUNA	m	I ain't got time to put up with your  bullshit today.
DIANA	f	Listen goddammit! It's momma's  birthday! She deserves better'n this!
GAMIANI	m	Hey, Tony. What's shaking? Sorry I'm  late. I got stuck on Wacker. Some  spook...
TONY LUNA	m	Victor Comacho is alive.
GAMIANI	m	Oh sweet Jesus.
DIANA	f	You can't go now.
TONY LUNA	m	Shut up!
TONY LUNA	m	Put someone on the house. And you  keep an eye on her.
GAMIANI	m	You got it, Tony. What about your  uncle?
TONY LUNA	m	What Felix don't know doesn't hurt  him.
TONY LUNA	m	Here. Happy birthday.
ODELL	m	Bow to your master!
EDDIE	m	Later, Odell. It's been a rough one.
ODELL	m	Y' tellin me! We all seen it on the
WOMAN'S VOICE 	f	Odell!
EDDIE	m	Bow to your master.
EDDIE	m	Hey, Odell. Here, make yourself crazy.
PIRELLI	m	You look like shit.
EDDIE	m	Thanks, pal.
PIRELLI	m	They had a shot on the tube of you  guys comin' out in front of the  building. How's Donato?
EDDIE	m	Pissed cause he lost a shoe. Luis Comacho is in town.
PIRELLI	m	He'll collect himself some scalps  before this one's over. Your answering  machine is on the fritz again. Some  woman with a fantastic voice was  callin' about comin' over this weekend  ta help you with somthin', and then  the tape went nuts.
EDDIE	m	Want somthin' to drink?
PIRELLI	m	Does the Pope shit in the woods? Is  a bear Catholic?
ODELL	m	Me too.
EDDIE	m	I hate smart ass kids.
PIRELLI	m	Gonna get down in the 30's tonight.  Your pilot light is out.
EDDIE	m	I've been told that more than once.
PIRELLI	m	So, who you figure pulled out the  rug? Gypsies? Mob?
EDDIE	m	Somebody knew what they were doin'.  They blew the top off an anthill.
PIRELLI	m	I'd figure the Mob but Scalese ain't  that stupid. Hah! Sombody put the valve in  backwards.
WOMAN'S VOICE 	f	Odell! I ain't calling you again!
ODELL	m	Later, fellas.
PIRELLI	m	There. Heat.
EDDIE	m	What was the Cubs final score?
PIRELLI	m	8 to 1.
PIRELLI	m	Machines just don't like you.
EDDIE	m	Maybe I don't like machines.
VOICE	m	Arretez! Halten Zie! Stop! Do not  move! No se mueve!...
ENGINEER	m	...After the gyros are locked, any  movement of the hand controller is  duplicated by the 'Prowler.'
ENGINEER	m	This simple control system means  that even semi-skilled employees can  operate the unit with a minimum of  training. As they say, "Even a child  can operate it."
KATES	f	He's talking about you, Cusack. Pay  attention. You're all gonna have to  be qualified on this. It's the future.
EDDIE	m	Just what the world needs, another  gun without a brain.
KATES	f	You're looking at the perfect cop.  The damn thing follows orders.
EDDIE	m	I got better things to do than play  with toys.
ENGINEER	m	If the Commander will pick someone  to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can  show how our various target  acquisition systems function.
MACHINE	m	Bang. You're dead.
EDDIE	m	Drop it.
SANCHEZ	m	A war does no good for any of us. It  can only make what is bad worse.
LUIS	m	Get them out of here. Fix them up. I  want them to be beautiful for their  mother.
LUIS	m	I promise you, my brothers, there  will be blood for blood.
VICTOR	m	This is the cop.
LUIS	m	How much did they pay you to set up  my brothers, Pig.
EDDIE	m	Stay off my streets, asshole. Or  I'll bite your head off, and shit in  your neck.
LUIS	m	You're meat cop! Dead meat!
FLANNIGAN	m	Eenie Verona is the gentleman's name. You did a hell of a job on him.
EDDIE	m	I was motivated.
FLANNIGAN	m	Know him?
EDDIE	m	He's a punk. Punk thief. Booster.
FLANNIGAN	m	Looks like he graduated.
EDDIE	m	He had a brother-in-law. They were  tight. Served time together.  Ganelli..., Gagleone...
KOSALAS	?	Gamiani.
FLANNIGAN	m	If I was you, I'd sit on him.
KOSALAS	?	You figure he's connected?
FLANNIGAN	m	Looks like you're gonna be busy,  Cusack. Uh, you gonna be using those  Cubs' tickets?
KOSALAS	?	This Ganiani's a swinger, huh?
EDDIE	m	He's just makin' up for the time he  spent in the joint.
KOSALAS	?	Now what? They selling protection to  the bears?
EDDIE	m	Relax kid.
KOSALAS 	?	What's this? Kinda young for that  old fart ain't she?
EDDIE 	m	Just watch, kid. Learn.
DIANA	f	Be back in a minute.
DIANA	f	What do you want?
LOU	f	Your Papa worries about you.
DIANA	f	Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone.
EDDIE	m	Hold here a second.
EDDIE	m	Keep with Gamiani.
KOSALAS	?	Bang a few for me.
EDDIE	m	Wanna play ball?
DIANA	f	Are you pitching?
EDDIE	m	Some people say I've got a pretty  good inside curve.
DIANA	f	I don't know. You look strictly minor  league.
EDDIE	m	I'm Eddie.
DIANA	f	I make it Eddie-The-Cop.
EDDIE	m	You've had a lot of experience with  cops?
DIANA	f	All bad.
EDDIE	m	You'll get slivers.
DIANA	f	Hey, what the hell do you think you're  doing?
EDDIE	m	I thought you knew all about cops.  You don't put anything up your nose  do you?
EDDIE	m	Diana Luna? You're Tony Luna's daughter?
DIANA	f	I don't know where he is, and I don't  really give a shit. When are you people going to realize  I don't have anything to do with my  father.
EDDIE	m	For when you need a friend.
DIANA	f	I've got all the friends I want.
EDDIE	m	But do you have all the friends you  need?
EDDIE	m	This is Sergeant Cusack. I want a  team to cover a house on the southwest  side. L-U-N-A, Anthony. Yeah. Crazy Tony Luna. I don't think  he's around, but if he shows up bring  him in.
EDDIE	m	Catch you later.
OFFICER	m	Police! Open up!
KOBAS 	m	Awright awright hold it.
KOBAS	m	For Christ's sake! You tryin to get  your partner killed, Jackson?
BRENNAN	m	Hey, Mahoney. I want you to help me  get some signatures on this letter  for Cragie.
CRAGIE	?	Way to go, partner.
HOWARD	m	Let's try the mitts for awhile.
DONATO	m	Say, partner.
EDDIE	m	How ya doing, Richie?
DONATO	m	Swinging. How's this? Two G's, we  get a sausage and beef stand stand  outside Wrigley Field. You pass the  beef, I take the cash. Free games. I  got a contact downtown.
EDDIE	m	How you gonna watch the game if you're  hawking sandwiches?
DONATO	m	Never thought of that. TV? Hey, I  tell you about this nurse I met?  Talk about physical therapy.
DONATO	m	She's got this friend just dying to  meet you. Intensive care.
DONATO	m	Later, partner.
BRENNAN	m	Hey, Cusack. How about taking the  gloves off long enough to sign this  for Cragie.
EDDIE	m	This about the hearing?
BRENNAN	m	You bet.
EDDIE	m	I pass.
BRENNAN	m	What the fuck's the matter with you?
EDDIE	m	He's burnt, Brennan, and you know  it. He was a good cop, but he ain't  now.
BRENNAN	m	Get off your high horse, Cusack. He  made a couple of mistakes, OK. The  guy was a hero. What the fuck does a  bunch of civilians know about comin'  up some shithouse stairway day after  day, scared outta your shorts.
EDDIE	m	We're all scared, Brennan. Cragie  should have been off the street a  long time ago. He's gonna hurt  somebody else with his bullshit.  Maybe even you.
MUSIC	m	The funeral director says they plan  on cruisin right past luna's house.
KOSALAS	?	They're wastin' the show. Tony's not  even in town.
EDDIE	m	He'll get the word.
LUNA	f	What the fuck are you talkin about?  Nobody's gonna touch nothin. Just  stay put. I give a shit about their fuckin  parade?
LUNA	f	They wanna throw flowers we can fix  it so they're pushing up daisys.
KOSALAS	?	I can back you up.
EDDIE	m	Stay by the radio.
ROCCO	m	What the hell you doin' here? Off,  asshole.
SCALESE	m	The modern age's answer to the crystal  ball. Marvelous. If you know how to  read it. Listen. If you have some extra cash,  buy oranges. The price is low, and I  can promise you the threatened  trucking strike will be avoided.
EDDIE	m	We talking about a bribe, Scalese?
SCALESE	m	It's a prediction.
SCALESE	m	No. I wouldn't try to bribe Eddie  Cusack.
SCALESE	m	You're incorruptible. Untarnished. I  hear they call you stainless steel  on the street. Me, I think you're a  fuckin' pain in the ass.
EDDIE	m	Thanks.
SCALESE	m	It's not a compliment.
EDDIE	m	I'm looking for your nephew.
SCALESE	m	Tony? Forget it. Tony Luna's none of  your business.
EDDIE	m	Wrong. Tony just made himself my  business.
SCALESE	m	No he didn't. We take care of our  own. Just like the cops. Just like  the Comachos. You understand.
EDDIE	m	He shit on my turf, old man. And I'm  going to nail him and anybody else  tied to him. You understand, Felix?
SCALESE	m	Nobody threatens Felix Scalese.
EDDIE	m	It's not a threat. It's a prediction.
EDDIE	m	There's a shitstorm coming. You better  get yourself a good umbrella.
MUSIC	m	Tony Luna's bagman.
MUSIC	m	They call that a Columbian necktie.
MUSIC	m	They found the manager of Tony's  restaurant hanging from a hook in  his kitchen. Looked like someone  tried to carve a canoe out of him.  Tony's used car lot on Ashland is  burning as we speak. The head salesman  is a fried zuccini.
KOSALAS	?	Oh Jesus. It's starting.
EDDIE	m	Let's go.
KOSALAS	?	Music's at the scene.
EDDIE	m	Was there a girl? Late teens. Reddish  hair.
MUSIC 	m	Two male caucasians, two female. One  mid-to-late forties. The other a  grandmother.
POMPAS	m	Come on, Chika. We gonna have some  fun. You gonna take us to your father.
EDDIE	m	Pompas, you're getting to be a fucking  pain in the ass.
EDDIE	m	Let her go, pooch.
ANGEL	m	Another step, and I take her head  off.
EDDIE	m	You don't have the balls.
DIANA	f	Where are you taking me?
EDDIE	m	Downtown first. Then I'm gonna place  you in protective custody.
DIANA	f	The hell you are!
EDDIE	m	You'll be safe --
DIANA	f	I'll take my chances.
PIRELLI	m	Keep your goddamn pants on!
PIRELLI	m	This your idea of a social call?
EDDIE	m	Fred Pirelli, this is Diana. Diana  Luna.
PIRELLI	m	C'mon, kid. Let's get you off your  feet.
EDDIE	m	Can you put her up till I find her  old man?
PIRELLI	m	Does a bear...?
EDDIE	m	Am I putting you on the spot?
PIRELLI	m	I spent 30 years on the spot. What  ever you need.
DIANA	f	Eddie?
EDDIE	m	I'll be right across the hall. I'm  just gonna clean up.
KOSALAS	?	Say, Eddie. Why don' you come by and  tip a few? Cause I gotta talk to you. Yeah, I know. But we gotta talk. Please. Yeah, at Mike's.
MUSIC	m	You oughta crash, man. You had a  helluva day.
FIRST HOOD	m	Love it, Flash. Gonna be a slide.  Easy in, easy out.
SECOND HOOD	m	Just a quick and dirty?
FIRST HOOD	m	Yeah, yeah, nothin to it. You know  the drill.
DONATO	m	He picks her up on Forty-third, and  he's takin' in. She says, "Say, baby.  Ain't no need for goin' downtown."  An' she pulls back her skirt. So the  dumb shit climbs in the back an'  takes a piece... ...an' leaves the keys in the front  and locks the two of 'em in the squad.  And he hasta kick out the window  see, an' she starts screamin', "Rape!  Rape!" An' they charge him with rape  an' every other fuckin' thing in the  book. Internal Affairs is gonna give  him a kayak and a lantern an' put  him out in the lake.
SECOND HOOD	m	Bartender. Gimme a black russian and  a Courvoisier.
FIRST HOOD	m	Yo! Get your hands up motherfuckers.  This is a ho --
SECOND HOOD	m	You stupid motherfucker.
SECOND HOOD	m	My old lady tol' me you was fucked  up in the head. Do I listen? Piece o  cake, you say. Snap, you say. Nothin  to it, you say.
COP	m	Shut up over there.
DONATO	m	Eddie! Partner! Meet Ruthie. Dental  Hygienist. She's oral.
DONATO	m	And this is... Marlene. She works  for a proctologist.
DONATO	m	Siddown, partner. I got a proposition  for you.
EDDIE	m	Not now, Donato.
DONATO	m	O.K. O.K. But just let me plant two  words in your brain. Alligator  farming.
KOSALAS	?	Beer?
KOSALAS	?	Looks like I'm caught between the  rock and the hard place, Sarge.
KOSALAS	?	You know I really wanted to be a  good cop, but... shit. It's hard  enough sometimes just to stay alive.  Comes so easy to you. You got all  the fuckin' answers. Me, I'm still  tryin' to find the questions.
KOSALAS	?	Cragie planted the gun on the kid.  Just wasted him, and then I... I  don't know what to do about the  hearing tomorrow...
EDDIE	m	Tell the truth.
KOSALAS	?	See. It's all so nothin' for you. If  I talk straight every cop on the  force will shit on me. If I don't...  Cragie gets away with murder.
EDDIE	m	And the chance to do it again. Next  time he might take away a cop. That  make any difference?
KOSALAS	?	He's my partner.
EDDIE	m	Your partner's selling you out,  Kosalas. He kills an unarmed kid,  and now he's risking your ass to  save his own.
KOSALAS	?	It was a mistake.
EDDIE	m	It cost an innocent kid his life.
KOSALAS	?	I know that! I KNOW THAT!
KOSALAS	?	Jesus. I see that kid's face every  time I close my eyes.
EDDIE	m	Tell 'em like it is, Nick. I'll back  you up.
CRAGIE	?	Nice to see you out with the boys  for a change, Sarge.
EDDIE	m	Hello, Cragie.
CRAGIE	?	They tell me my Sergeant wouldn't  sign for me. You want to tell me  why?
EDDIE	m	You know why.
CRAGIE	?	No. Tell me.
EDDIE	m	You were a good cop for a lot of  years. You've passed your limit now  Cragie.
CRAGIE	?	Fuck you. Where do you get off?
EDDIE	m	Right about here.
PIRELLI	m	She's havin' a bad night. Gave her a  shot of brandy. Maybe she'll sleep.
EDDIE	m	Giving liquor to a minor, Pirelli?
EDDIE	m	I'll be back right after the hearing  tomorrow, and you can get some sleep  then.
DIANA	f	What do you do when you don't have  anyone?
EDDIE	m	You find someone.
DIANA	f	Could you... Hold me for a while?
MALE PANEL MEMBER	m	How far were you standing from where  your grandson was shot, Mrs. Murillio?
CLERK	m	In the next doorway. Four meters.
DONATO	m	How you doin', Sarge?
EDDIE	m	What's the score?
DONATO	m	Kid's grandmother says Cragie threw  down the pistola.
PARTIDA	f	Officer Cragie has already been sworn. Officer Cragie, you have heard Mrs.  Murillio's testimony --
CRAGIE	?	Yes, sir.
PARTIDA	f	You have heard her tell this panel  that she saw you lay the gun in her  grandson's hand.
CRAGIE	?	I'm not saying the woman would make  this up. But there's no way she could  have seen anything from where she  was standing in a hallway that dark. Like you said, she's the boy's  grandmother.
PARTIDA	f	If it was dark, Officer, how were  you sure Vega had a gun?
CRAGIE	?	We were lucky. There was a glint of  light, a reflection comin off the  barrel of the weapon.
DONATO	m	You think he'll get a pass?
EDDIE	m	You heard it all. What do you think?
DONATO	m	If the hearing was over I'd have to  put my money on the old lady. But Kosalas's next. My bet's on  Cragie.
EDDIE	m	The kid may surprise you.
PARTIDA	f	And right after you heard Officer  Cragie's gun discharge, what did you  do then?
KOSALAS	?	I immediately advanced down the hall.
PARTIDA	f	And what did you see?
KOSALAS	?	The deceased, Vega, lying on the  floor. Officer Cragie was checking  his vital signs.
PARTIDA	f	What happened then?
KOSALAS	?	We recovered a .25 calibre automatic  from the teenager's right hand.
PARTIDA	f	Did you see that weapon in Vega's  hand before Officer Cragie fired?
KOSALAS	?	Yes, sir.
PARTIDA	f	No more questions.
PARTIDA	f	I'd like to now call Sergeant Cusack.
DIANA	f	You made that uniform look good.
PIRELLI	m	That good looking gorilla next to me  is Eddie's father. Better than good  cop. Killed in the line of duty.
EDDIE	m	I can't comment on that. It was over  before I got there.
PARTIDA	f	You are his superior officer, are  you not?
EDDIE	m	Cragie's in my unit, yes.
PARTIDA	f	Did you give the men their various  assignments?
EDDIE	m	I did.
PARTIDA	f	Did you request that officer Cragie  be on your TAC team?
EDDIE	m	No, I didn't.
PARTIDA	f	Sergeant... I have here a department  document dated 24 September, of last  year. It is a request by you, to  your superiors, to have Officer Cragie  transferred to another unit. Are you  familiar with this document?
EDDIE	m	Yes.
PARTIDA	f	Why did you request his transfer?
EDDIE	m	Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone  to look at the city's guts, Mr.  Partida.
PARTIDA	f	What happened to this request?
EDDIE	m	It was denied.
PARTIDA	f	This is a letter of support for  Officer Cragie. Everyone in his unit signed it but  you. Why?
EDDIE	m	I don't agree with what it says.
PARTIDA	f	Are you saying you do not believe  Officer Cragie is fit to work the  streets of Chicago?
EDDIE	m	That's what I'm saying.
EDDIE	m	I just dialed 348-6610, and I get  this funny buzz. Check the line for  me? Thanks.
BRENNAN	m	Seems to me the man's got his tongue  stuck to his asshole, Cragie.
CRAGIE	?	Hey, that don't bother him. He's the  fuckin White Knight. You wanna take on the whole world by  yourself? Now you're gonna get your  chance, Sarge.
OPERATOR 	m	Sorry, sir, that number seems to be  out of service. I've reported it.
COP	m	He was a friend of yours wasn't he?
EDDIE	m	Yeah.
EDDIE	m	Squad, this is 1462. I need a backup.  Have 64 and 63 from TAC 4 meet me at  the billiard parlor on 18th near  Halsted. Questioning suspects.
DISPATCH 	?	1463 and 1464, Unit 1462 requesting  assistance at the poolroom on 18th  Street near Halsted. Questioning a  suspect.
BRENNAN	m	Ten-four, Dispatch. Unit 1463  responding.
BRENNAN	m	I could use a cup of coffee.
HEAVY	m	Hey, you ain't got no business back  there.
EDDIE	m	I want your opinion I'll beat it out  of you.
EDDIE	m	Where is Luis?
DEGAS	m	Get the hell out of here.
EDDIE	m	Talk to me, Degas, or I'll hit you  with so many lefts you're gonna beg  for a right.
DEGAS	m	He's coming here. He's on his way.
DISPATCHER	m	We need a verification on a back-up  for Unit 1462...
SECOND DISPATCHER	m	1462. That's Cusack, right?
SECOND DISPATCHER	m	Good luck finding a backup for that  character.
LUIS	m	Take him apart.
DISPATCHER 	m	...request verification for backup  for unit 1462. Patrol 47, are you in  the area.
OFFICER 	m	Squad. 47. We're having vehicular  problems. Not able to respond.
DISPATCHER 	m	...need backup at 18th and Halstead...
COP	m	Fuck him.
LUIS	m	The sun comes up. You give me Luna,  or the girl dies -- slow.
DONATO	m	I would have been here, Sarge. They  kept it from me.
EDDIE	m	You're Ok, Hopalong.
DONATO	m	Listen, I'm havin' a drink with this  friend of mine, name of Mickie. She  works on a computer over in the  Federal Building, FBI. I got here as  soon as I heard.
EDDIE	m	They got Diana Luna.
DONATO	m	That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya.  Mickie told me she read on the wire  Tony Luna's comin' into Union Station  at ten tonight.
TONY LUNA	m	Hello, Felix.
SCALESE	m	Hello, Tony.
SCALESE	m	You see, Tony. You make no sense.  You start a war... Waste people...  Money... You're like a kid, Tony.  You're a bad boy.
SCALESE	m	This sonovabitch is crazy!
EDDIE	m	You tell Luis I got Tony Luna for  him. Get me a time and place.
LUIS	m	Your cop friend is smart. Too smart  and he dies. Then I take care of you  personally.
KATES	f	What the hell is goin on?
BRENNAN	m	Cusack made off with a truckload of  armour.
MUSIC	m	He's a fucking one man army now.
CRAGIE	?	What'd I tell ya. The sonofabitch is  crazy.
KATES	f	OK, everybody. No more games. Where's  Cusack.
KOSALAS	?	I can't swallow this shit! Eddie  Cusack's out there takin' on the  world by himself. And you fuckin'  heros are gonna sit on your goddamn  asses!
CRAGIE	?	Cool it kid.
KOSALAS	?	Don't you fuckin' tell me to cool  it. I won't cool it. I'm not going  to fuckin' lie for you any more. I lied, Commander. He laid a gun on  that kid. I saw the whole thing.
CRAGIE	?	You little fuckin' bastard!
KOSALAS	?	What's this for partner? Your next  fuck up?
KATES	f	Get someone in the air. We're gonna  find Cusack.
LUIS	m	Take off the gag. I want them to  hear her.
EDDIE	m	Here we go partner.
LUIS	m	Now! Do it now! Kill her!
DISPATCHER 	m	...Harbor Patrol reports gunfire and  explosions in the vicinity of Calumet  Harbor...
KATES	f	That's Cusack.
KATES	f	Hey, Cusack!
KATES	f	I'm glad you don't follow orders.
