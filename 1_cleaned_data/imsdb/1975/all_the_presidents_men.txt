WOODWARD	m	No, no trouble, Harry, be right down. Son of a bitch.
ROSENFELD	m	Where's that cheery face we've come  to know and love?
WOODWARD	m	You call me in on my day off because  some idiots have broken into local  Democratic Headquarters--tell me,  Harry, why should I be smiling?
ROSENFELD	m	As usual, that keen mind of yours  has pegged the situation perfectly. Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic  Headquarters, it was National  Democratic Headquarters-- --and (b) these weren't just any  idiots, these were special idiots,  seeing as when they were arrested at  2:30 this morning, they were all  wearing business suits and Playtex  gloves and were carrying-- --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of  film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized  tear gas guns, plus various bugging  devices. Not to mention over two thousand  dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred  dollar bills.
WOODWARD	m	Preliminary hearing at Superior  Courthouse?
ROSENFELD	m	Two o'clock, work the phones 'til  you go.
CLERK	m	These two were appointed-- --only now it turns out the burglars  got their own counsel.
FIRST ANGRY LAWYER	m	When you gonna stop thinking it's so  funny.
SECOND ANGRY LAWYER	m	We wouldda done a terrific job  protecting those guys.
FIRST ANGRY LAWYER	m	You think we're not as good as some  hotshot fancy lawyer?--
WOODWARD	m	Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward,  I'm from the Post and I wanted to  ask about how you happened to come  on this case--
CADDY	m	--I'm not here.
WOODWARD	m	Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record,  when questioned about his presence  in the courtroom, denied he was in  the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr.  Caddy said.
CADDY	m	Clearly, I am here, but only as an  individual, I'm not the attorney of  record. Mr. Rafferty has that position.  Whatever you want, you'll have to  get from him, I have nothing more to  say.
WOODWARD	m	Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four  Cuban-Americans and this other man,  James McCord.
CADDY	m	Look, I told you inside--
WOODWARD	m	--you have nothing more to say, I  understand that.
WOODWARD	m	What I don't understand is how you  got here.
CADDY	m	I assure you, there's nothing  mysterious involved.
WOODWARD	m	Probably you're right, but a little  while ago, I was talking to a couple  of lawyers who'd been assigned to  represent the burglars.
CADDY	m	So?
WOODWARD	m	Well, they never would have been  assigned if anyone had known the  burglars had arranged for their own  counsel. And that could only mean  the burglars didn't arrange for their  own counsel--they never even made a  phone call. So if they didn't ask for you to be  here, how did you know to come?
WOODWARD	m	Did you know to come because one of  the other men involved in the break- in called you?
CADDY	m	There is no reason to assume other  people were involved.
WOODWARD	m	Your clients were arrested with a  walkie-talkie; they didn't need that  to talk among themselves.
CADDY	m	They are not my clients.
WOODWARD	m	You're a lawyer and you're here--
CADDY	m	--I met one of the defendants, Mr.  Barker, at a social occasion once-- --I have nothing more to say.
WOODWARD	m	A Miami social occasion? Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were  from Miami.
CADDY	m	Barker's wife called me at three  this morning; her husband apparently  had told her to call if he hadn't  called her by then.
WOODWARD	m	It was really nice of you to come,  since you'd only met him once.
CADDY	m	Are you implying you don't believe  me?
WOODWARD	m	I have nothing more to say.
CADDY	m	You don't mind getting on people's  nerves, do you?
WOODWARD	m	Nope.
JUDGE	m	Will you please state your  professions.
BARKER	m	Anti-Communists.
JUDGE	m	Anti-Communists? That, sir, is not your average  occupation.
JUDGE	m	Your name, please.
MCCORD	m	James McCord.
JUDGE	m	Will you step forward, sir.
JUDGE	m	And what is your occupation, Mr.  McCord?
MCCORD	m	Security consultant.
JUDGE	m	Where?
MCCORD	m	Government. Recently retired.
JUDGE	m	Where in government?
MCCORD	m	...Central... Intelligence...  Agency...
JUDGE	m	Where?
MCCORD	m	The C.I.A.
WOODWARD	m	Holy shit.
UNION POST EMPLOYEE	m	"Five men, one of whom said he is a  former employee..." Schmucks.
FIRST VOICE	m	Hurry it, huh, Bachinski?
BACHINSKI	?	You said I could look at it--
COP	m	--I said look, not memorize--
BACHINSKI	?	--almost done, give it a rest, all  right...
COP	m	What'd you find?
BACHINSKI	?	Beats me. These notebooks belonged  to Cuban guys?
COP	m	S'right.
BACHINSKI	?	It's gotta mean either White House  or whore house, one or the other.
WOODWARD	m	Bachinski? What?--hold it-- --OK, go on, go on...
ROSENFELD	m	...go on, go on...
WOODWARD	m	That's everything Bachinski had, I  think it's worth following up.
ROSENFELD	m	Don't know; who the hell's Howard  Hunt? It's probably nothing but check it  out. Just go easy, it could be crazy  Cubans.
SIMONS	m	Anything?
ROSENFELD	m	Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with  the break-in thing--absolute page  one stuff--
SIMONS	m	--in other words, you got nothing,  you're thumbsucking.
ROSENFELD	m	Could develop.
SIMONS	m	Let me see what you get, but don't  jump--The New York Times thinks it's  crazy Cubans.
ROSENFELD	m	OK, get on this W.House guy and do a  better job then you did on McCord.
WOODWARD	m	I did all right on McCord.
ROSENFELD	m	Then how come the Associated Press  were the ones found out that Mr.  McCord is security coordinator for  the Committee to Re-elect the  President, otherwise known as CREEP?
WOODWARD	m	The head of security for the  reelection of a Republican President  got caught bugging the national  offices of the Democrats? What the  hell does that mean?
ROSENFELD	m	Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP,  says it means nothing. "...This man and the other people  involved were not operating on either  our behalf or with our consent. These  is no place in our campaign or in  the electoral process for this type  of activity, and we will not forget  it or condone it."
WOODWARD	m	You can't believe that.
ROSENFELD	m	As a rough rule of thumb, as far as  I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's  how much I trust John Mitchell...
ROSENFELD	m	What'd you get on W.House?
WOODWARD	m	Lotsa hints--
ROSENFELD	m	I can't sell hints to Simons-- --you called everyone you know? Call someone you don't know.
WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR	m	White House.
WOODWARD	m	Howard Hunt, please.
WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR	m	Mr. Hunt does not answer.
WOODWARD	m	Thanks, anyway--
WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR	m	I'll bet he's in Mr. Colson's office.  Let me connect you.
SECRETARY	f	Charles Colson's wire.
WOODWARD	m	Howard Hunt, please.
SECRETARY	f	Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.
WOODWARD	m	Thanks, anyway.
SECRETARY	f	Have you tried Mullen and Company  Public Relations? He works at Mullen  and Company Public Relations as a  writer. The number is 555-1313. I'm  sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
WOODWARD	m	Listen, forget it.
WOODWARD	m	Who's Charles Colson?
ROSENFELD	m	I would liken your query to being in  Russia half a century ago and asking  someone, "I understand who Lenin is  and Trotsky I got too, but who's  this yokel Stalin?"
WOODWARD	m	Who's Colson, Harry?
ROSENFELD	m	The most powerful man in America is  President Nixon, probably you've  heard his name.
ROSENFELD	m	The second most powerful man is Robert  Haldeman. Just below him are a trio:  Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend,  and they protect the President from  everybody which is why they are  referred to as either The German  Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr.  Mitchell we've already discussed.  Mr. Colson is the President's special  counsel.
WOODWARD	m	Thanks, Harry. Know anything about Colson?
ROSENFELD	m	Just that on his office wall there's  a cartoon with a caption reading,  "When you've got them by the balls,  their hearts and minds will follow."
WOODWARD	m	Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing  Post and... Mullen and Company Public Relations?  Could you tell me when you expect  Mr. Hunt? He is?
HUNT	m	Howard Hunt here.
WOODWARD	m	Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
HUNT	m	--yes, yes, what is it?
WOODWARD	m	I was just kind of wondering why  your name and phone number were in  the address books of two of the men  arrested at Watergate?
HUNT	m	Good God!
WOODWARD	m	I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett,  but we're doing some investigating  of one of your employees, Howard  Hunt.
BENNETT	m	Well, if you've been doing some  investigating then obviously it's no  secret to you that Howard was with  the C.I.A.
WOODWARD	m	No secret at all.
WOODWARD	m	Hello, C.I.A. This is R.W. Woodward,  of the Washington Post--get me  Personnel--
WOODWARD	m	Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington  Post--and--what's that?--you've never  heard of me?--I can't help that--you  don't believe I'm with the Post?-- what do you want me to do, Madam,  shout "extra--extra"?
ROSENFELD	m	Whaddya got, whaddya got?
WOODWARD	m	Hunt is Colson's man-- --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's  special counsel-- --they both went to Brown University-- --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till  '70, and this is on deep background,  the FBI thinks he's involved with  the break-in.
SIMONS	m	What else have you got?
WOODWARD	m	According to White House personnel,  Hunt definitely works there as a  consultant for Colson. But when I  called the White House Press office,  they said he hadn't worked there for  three months. Then the P.R. guy said  the weirdest thing to me. "I am convinced that neither Mr.  Colson nor anyone else at the White  House had any knowledge of, or  participation in, this deplorable  incident at the Democratic National  Committee."
SIMONS	m	Isn't that what you'd expect them to  say?
WOODWARD	m	Absolutely.
ROSENFELD	m	So?
WOODWARD	m	I never asked them about Watergate.  I only said what were Hunt's duties  at the White House. They volunteered  that he was innocent when nobody  asked was he guilty.
ROSENFELD	m	I think we got a White House  consultant linked to the bugging.
SIMONS	m	Just be careful how you write it.
WOODWARD	m	Here's the first take--
WOODWARD	m	This is all of it, Harry.
WOODWARD	m	We have to talk.
WOODWARD	m	What the hell were you doing rewriting  my story--
BERNSTEIN	m	--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
WOODWARD	m	--it was fine the way it was--
BERNSTEIN	m	--it was bullshit the way it was--
WOODWARD	m	--I have to stand here and listen to  the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
BERNSTEIN	m	--what have you been here, nine  months?--I been in this business  since I was sixteen--
WOODWARD	m	--and you've had some fucking meteoric  rise, that's for sure--by the time  you turn forty you might be the head  of the Montana bureau--
BERNSTEIN	m	--you only got the job because both  you and Bradlee went to Yale--
WOODWARD	m	--Bradlee went to Harvard--
BERNSTEIN	m	--they're all the same, all those  Ivy League places--they teach you  about striped ties and suddenly you're  smart--
WOODWARD	m	--I'm smart enough to know my story  was solid--
BERNSTEIN	m	--mine's better--
WOODWARD	m	--no way--
BERNSTEIN	m	--read 'em both and you'll see--
WOODWARD	m	...crap...
BERNSTEIN	m	Is mine better?
WOODWARD	m	What is it about my writing that's  so rotten?
BERNSTEIN	m	Mainly it has to do with your choice  of words.
WOODWARD	m	Carl?
BERNSTEIN	m	Yeah?
WOODWARD	m	Fuck you, Carl.
BERNSTEIN	m	You heard? They put us both on the break-in  thing. Simons liked the way we worked  together. Listen, I'm sorry I said your story  was bullshit.
WOODWARD	m	It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a  failure.
BERNSTEIN	m	Forget it, the main thing-- --did you call me a failure?
WOODWARD	m	I was sure trying.
WOODWARD	m	All right, what do we know?
BERNSTEIN	m	Let me lay a little theory on you--
WOODWARD	m	--I'm not interested in theory. What  do we know? For example, Hunt's  disappeared.
BERNSTEIN	m	Well, Barker tried to get blueprints  of the Miami Convention Center and  the air-conditioning system.
WOODWARD	m	And McCord was carrying an application  for college press credentials for  the Democratic convention. The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
BERNSTEIN	m	What, though? It can't be the Republicans--he'd  never allow something as stupid as  this, not when he's gonna slaughter  McGovern anyway.
WOODWARD	m	Right. Nixon didn't get where he got  by being dumb-- --listen, that was a Watergate  question--
NIXON	m	The White House has had no involvement  whatever in this particular incident.
WOODWARD	m	Hey?
BERNSTEIN	m	Hmm.
WOODWARD	m	What do you think he meant, this  particular incident? Were there  others? How would we find out? You  know anyone important?
BERNSTEIN	m	I lived here all my life, I got a  million contacts, but they're all  bus boys and bellhops.
RINGLE	?	What do you need?
BERNSTEIN	m	Someone inside the White House would  be nice.
RINGLE	?	Call her. She worked for Colson, if  that's any help.
GIRL	f	Kenny's crazy, I never worked for  Colson, I worked for an assistant.  Colson was big on secrets anyway.  Even if I had worked for him, I  wouldn't have known anything.
BERNSTEIN	m	Nothing at all you can remember?
SECRETARY	f	Sorry. Now if it was Hunt you were interested  in--
BERNSTEIN	m	--Howard Hunt?
SECRETARY	f	Sure. Him I liked, he was a very  nice person. Secretive too, traveled  all over, but a decent man.
BERNSTEIN	m	Any idea what he did?
SECRETARY	f	Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was  he was investigating Kennedy--
BERNSTEIN	m	--Teddy Kennedy?
SECRETARY	f	Sure. I remember seeing a book about  Chappaquiddick on his desk and he  was always getting material out of  the White House Library and the  Library of Congress and--
BERNSTEIN	m	White House Library, please.
OPERATOR	m	One moment.
LIBRARIAN	m	Library.
BERNSTEIN	m	Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington  Post. I was just wondering if you  remember the names of any of the  books that Howard Hunt checked out  on Senator Kennedy.
LIBRARIAN	m	I think I do remember, he took out a  whole bunch of material. Let me just  go see.
BERNSTEIN	m	--what do you think?--
WOODWARD	m	--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary  consultant.
BERNSTEIN	m	Maybe a political operative of some  sort--
WOODWARD	m	--a spy, you mean?
BERNSTEIN	m	It makes sense; Hunt worked for the  C.I.A. and the White House was  paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
LIBRARIAN	m	Mr. Bernstein?
BERNSTEIN	m	Yes, ma'am.
LIBRARIAN	m	What I said before? I was wrong. The  truth is, I don't have a card that  Mr. Hunt took out any Kennedy  material. I remember getting that material out  for somebody, but it wasn't Mr. Hunt.  The truth is, I've never had any  requests at all from Mr. Hunt. The truth is, I don't know Mr. Hunt.
LIBRARIAN	m	You want all the material requested  by the White House?
LIBRARIAN	m	All White House transactions are  confidential.
WOODWARD	m	You think they are confidential? I  don't know anything about how this  town works, I haven't lived here a  year yet.
BERNSTEIN	m	We need a sympathetic face.
YOUNG CLERK	m	You want every request since when?
BERNSTEIN	m	When did Hunt start at the White  House?
WOODWARD	m	July of '71.
BERNSTEIN	m	About the past year.
CLERK	m	I'm not sure you want 'em, but I got  'em.
CLERK	m	I can't believe you guys are actually  doing this.
WOODWARD	m	You do a lot of things when you're  on a story. Can you believe we're actually doing  this?
BERNSTEIN	m	That was fun. What now?
WOODWARD	m	I met a Presidential aide once at a  social occasion.
BERNSTEIN	m	And you haven't called him?--
ROSENFELD	m	You got accurate notes on the White  House librarian? OK, we'll leave space for the White  House denial and we should be set.
ROSENFELD	m	Benjy, we got a present for you.  Above the fold on page one for sure.  It may not change our lives one way  or the other. Just a good, solid  piece of American Journalism-- --that The New York Times doesn't  have.
BRADLEE	m	You haven't got it. A librarian and a secretary say Hunt  looked at a book. Not good enough.
WOODWARD	m	I was told by this guy at the White  House that Hunt was investigating  Teddy Kennedy.
BRADLEE	m	How senior?
WOODWARD	m	You asking me to disclose my source?
BRADLEE	m	Just tell me his title.
WOODWARD	m	I don't know titles.
BRADLEE	m	Is he on the level of Assistant to  the President or not?
BRADLEE	m	Get some harder information next  time.
DEEP THROAT	m	I saw the flag signal--what's up?
WOODWARD	m	Nothing, that's the problem--the  story's gone underground.
DEEP THROAT	m	You thought I'd help out on specifics? I'll confirm what you get, try to  keep you on the right track, but  that's all. Are you guys really working? How much?
WOODWARD	m	I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen  hours a day--we've got sources at  Justice, the FBI, but it's still  drying up.
DEEP THROAT	m	Then there must be something, mustn't  there. Look, forget the myths the  media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very  bright guys, and things got out of  hand.
WOODWARD	m	If you don't like them, why won't  you be more concrete with me?
DEEP THROAT	m	Because the press stinks too--history  on the run, that's all you're  interested in. You come up with anything?
WOODWARD	m	John Mitchell resigned as head of  CREEP to spend more time with his  family. That doesn't exactly have  the ring of truth. Howard Hunt's been found--there was  talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand  in cash in a paper bag.
DEEP THROAT	m	Follow the money. Always follow the  money.
WOODWARD	m	To where?
DEEP THROAT	m	Go on.
WOODWARD	m	This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to  be tried along with Hunt and the  five burglars--we know he knows a  lot, we just don't know what.
DEEP THROAT	m	You changed cabs? You're sure no one  followed you?
WOODWARD	m	I did everything you said, but it  all seemed--
DEEP THROAT	m	--melodramatic? Things are past that--remember, these  are men with switchblade mentalities  who run the world as if it were Dodge  City.
WOODWARD	m	What's the whole thing about--do you  know?
DEEP THROAT	m	What I know, you'll have to find out  on your own.
WOODWARD	m	Liddy--you think there's a chance  he'll talk?
DEEP THROAT	m	Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put  his hand over a candle. And he kept  it there. He kept it right in the  flame until his flesh seared. A woman  who was watching asked, "What's the  trick?" And he replied. "The trick  is not minding."
BERNSTEIN	m	What's that?
WOODWARD	m	The fucking New York Times.
BERNSTEIN	m	Goddamnit--
WOODWARD	m	--see?--
BERNSTEIN	m	--I'm trying--
WOODWARD	m	--fifteen phone calls--
BERNSTEIN	m	---fifteen or more phone calls from  the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy  at CREEP--
WOODWARD	m	Why didn't we get that?
BERNSTEIN	m	Christ, and I even know somebody at  the phone company--
WOODWARD	m	--you do?--with access to records?
BERNSTEIN	m	Why couldn't you have just dialed me  from the office, Irwin?
IRWIN	m	'Cause I'm not calling out from the  phone company anymore-- --I think the place is bugged.
BERNSTEIN	m	So tell me about the Times article.
IRWIN	m	What do you want to know?
BERNSTEIN	m	No games, Irwin; give.
IRWIN	m	My big civil rights buddy-- --boy, if John Mitchell was after  your phone records, would you be  screaming. What're you onto?
BERNSTEIN	m	Something maybe big.
IRWIN	m	And that makes anything you do OK,  is that it?
BERNSTEIN	m	Just tell me about the goddamn  article.
IRWIN	m	It was accurate, but I can't get a  fuller listing for you--all Barker's  phone records have been subpoenaed.
BERNSTEIN	m	Who by?
IRWIN	m	A Miami D.A. The guy doing the  investigating is named Martin Dardis.
BERNSTEIN	m	Irwin? I really feel bad, doing  something like this--you know that,  don't you?
IRWIN	m	Don't give me any more of your liberal  shit, OK, Carl?
BERNSTEIN	m	Harry, I just talked to a Miami  investigator about Barker--
ROSENFELD	m	--so?
BERNSTEIN	m	I think it might be helpful if you'd  send me to Miami.
ROSENFELD	m	I'm the one sent you to Toronto,  Bernstein--
BERNSTEIN	m	--that was awhile ago--
ROSENFELD	m	--"I think it might be helpful if  you'd send me to Toronto." That was  your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of  Deserters." I'm still waiting for it.
BERNSTEIN	m	Down to Miami and back--how much  damage can I do?
ROSENFELD	m	You're the fella who forgot he rented  a Hertz car, do I have to tell you  they didn't forget to send us the  bill?
ROSENFELD	m	I can predict the next words you're  gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein." I want to send a reporter to Miami.
SIMONS	m	Anyone but Bernstein.
ROSENFELD	m	Howard--
SIMONS	m	--remember Toronto, Harry.
ROSENFELD	m	That was awhile ago.
SIMONS	m	I don't get it--you were the one who  wanted to fire him.
ROSENFELD	m	I know, I did, but damnit Howard-- For the first time since I've known  him, I think he's really humping...
BERNSTEIN	m	Yeah? Yes, this is Carl Bernstein. You're repossessing my bicycle? Listen, I'm sure I paid this month's  installment, so why don't you check  your records before you go around  hassling people? Oh...
BERNSTEIN	m	Hannah, I never would have bothered  you but I'm off to Miami and they're  gonna take away my ten speed unless  I get it straightened out fast.
HANNAH	f	Where are your bills, Carl?
BERNSTEIN	m	Oh, they're here. I'm keeping much better records now,  Hannah. See?
HANNAH	f	Carl, it's a jungle. I suggest you either pay this  immediately or lay in a large supply  of candles. You'd give a stranger the shirt off  your back--except it wouldn't be  paid for.
BERNSTEIN	m	Hey... very tense.
HANNAH	f	Lot of pressure at the Star. Carl, when we got married, you were  four thousand dollars in debt; when  we split, you were solvent. That may  prove to be the outstanding single  achievement of my life, and now look  at this. How much did the damn bike cost?
BERNSTEIN	m	Five hundred; six maybe.
HANNAH	f	You're two months behind--you got  enough to cover?
BERNSTEIN	m	I think.
HANNAH	f	Give me your checkbook then.
BERNSTEIN	m	It's right under that pile.
HANNAH	f	I thought you had to get to Miami.
BERNSTEIN	m	There's always a later plane.
HANNAH	f	You're a sex junkie, you know that,  Carl?
BERNSTEIN	m	Nobody's perfect. I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I  turned you into a bookkeeper.
HANNAH	f	Aw baby, you can get it up... I just  wonder if you'll ever be able to get  it together.
BERNSTEIN	m	Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
SECRETARY	f	I'm so glad.
BERNSTEIN	m	I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
SECRETARY	f	And you will. But not now.
BERNSTEIN	m	I called him from Washington. He's  the one who asked me to be here at  eleven in the morning.
SECRETARY	f	I told you, he had to go out on a  case.
UNIFORMED COP	m	Is it OK to go on back?
BERNSTEIN	m	Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car  radio?
SECRETARY	f	He is not in the car. Sorry.
SECOND COP	m	Hey, babe.
BERNSTEIN	m	Mr. Dardis does call in every so  often?
SECRETARY	f	Well of course.
BERNSTEIN	m	Good. Just tell him I was here, that  I'm sorry I missed him--
BERNSTEIN	m	Mr. Dardis' office, please.
SECRETARY	f	Mr. Dardis' office.
BERNSTEIN	m	This is Mr. Tomlinson in the clerk's  office. Could you come across the  hall for a moment? We've got some  documents your boss probably should  see.
VOICE	m	Dardis.
BERNSTEIN	m	Carl Bernstein's here to see you--I  don't know why, but he seems angry--
BERNSTEIN	m	Look, you've been jerking my chain  all day. If there's some reason you  can't talk to me--like the fact that  you've already leaked everything to  The New York Times--just say so.
DARDIS	m	Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we  do this tomorrow?
BERNSTEIN	m	I'm on deadline.
DARDIS	m	You want Barker's phone stuff or his  money stuff?
BERNSTEIN	m	Whatever.
DARDIS	m	I'll never get out of here in time.
BERNSTEIN	m	The telephone calls... we know about  that.
DARDIS	m	The rest is Barker's bank records.  It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand  in Mexican cashier's checks--
BERNSTEIN	m	--yeah, that was in The Times this  morning.
BERNSTEIN	m	What's this Dahlberg check?
DARDIS' VOICE	m	That the twenty-five grand one?-- Don't know--
DARDIS	m	I never could figure just who this  Dahlberg was. Think it might be anything?
BERNSTEIN	m	This? Naw...
BERNSTEIN	m	--Woodward--Woodward, listen, I don't  know what I got-- --and I think the Times has it too-- --but somewhere there's a Kenneth H.  Dahlberg in this world and we've  gotta find him--
RESEARCHER	m	Were you after the Dahlberg articles  from the files? There aren't any, sorry.
WOODWARD	m	Whazzis?
RESEARCHER	m	Our Dahlberg file.
BERNSTEIN'S VOICE	m	Harry--I know how to get Dahlberg--
ROSENFELD	m	--Woodward's talking to him know.
WOODWARD	m	--this should take only a minute,  Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in-- --and I was kind of curious about  your check.
DAHLBERG	f	...check...?
WOODWARD	m	The twenty-five thousand dollar one. The one with your name on it. In Bernard Barker's Florida account. Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
DAHLBERG	f	...you're definitely doing a story...?
WOODWARD	m	Yes, sir.
DAHLBERG	f	I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent  man, I don't do anything that isn't  decent or proper. I know I shouldn't tell you this...
DAHLBERG	f	That twenty-five thousand dollars is  money I collected for Nixon in this  year's campaign.
WOODWARD	m	I see. And how do you think it reached  Miami?
DAHLBERG	f	I don't know; I really don't. The  last time I saw it was when I was in  Washington. I gave it to the Finance  department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to  that burglar, your guess is as good  as mine.
WOODWARD	m	That checks out with our finding,  thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
ROSENFELD	m	CREEP financed the Watergate break- in, Jesus Christ.
WOODWARD	m	One sec'--
SIMONS	m	--OK, last go-round. Foreign, anything  else?
SIMONS	m	National?
NATIONAL EDITOR	m	I'll stand with the Eagleton follow- ups and McGovern not being able to  get a replacement--that's your page  one stuff right there, Howard--
SIMONS	m	--Metropolitan?--
ROSENFELD	m	--you are ignoring the importance of  the Dahlberg repercussions--
NATIONAL EDITOR	m	--nobody gives a shit about the  Dahlberg repercussions--
ROSENFELD	m	--quit equivocating, say what you  mean-- --our story got Government Accounting  to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
BRADLEE	m	--and we printed that, didn't we,  Harry? And when the frigging audit's  done, we'll print that too--
NATIONAL EDITOR	m	--let me tell what happened when I  was having lunch today at the Sans  Souci--
ROSENFELD	m	--correction--when you were drinking  your lunch at the bar of the Sans  Souci--
NATIONAL EDITOR	m	--this White House guy, a good one,  a pro, came up and asked what is  this Watergate compulsion with you  guys and I said, well, we think it's  important and he said, if it's so  goddamn important, who the hell are  Woodward and Bernstein?
ROSENFELD	m	Ask him what he's really saying--he  means take the story away from  Woodstein and give it to his people  at the National Desk--
NATIONAL EDITOR	m	--well, I've got some pretty  experienced fellas sitting around,  wouldn't you say so?--
ROSENFELD	m	--absolutely--and that's all they  do, sit sit sit--every once in a  while, they call up a Senator, some  reporting--
NATIONAL EDITOR	m	--well, what if your boys get it  wrong--
BRADLEE	m	Then it's our asses, isn't it?
SIMONS	m	And we'll all have to go to work for  a living.
FOREIGN EDITOR	m	I don't think either Metropolitan or  National should cover the story. I don't think we should cover the  story, period.
BRADLEE	m	Go on.
FOREIGN EDITOR	m	It's not that we're using unnamed  sources that bothers me, or that  everything we print the White House  denies, or that almost no other papers  are reprinting our stuff.
SIMONS	m	What then?
FOREIGN EDITOR	m	I don't believe the goddamn story,  Howard, it doesn't make sense.
BRADLEE	m	It will, it just hasn't bottomed out  yet, give it time.
FOREIGN EDITOR	m	Ben, Jesus, there are over two  thousand reporters in this town, are  there five on Watergate? Where did  we suddenly get all this wisdom?
FOREIGN EDITOR	m	Look--why would the Republicans do  it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just  like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch  of 'em. Why would the burglars have put the  tape around the door instead of up  and down unless they wanted to get  caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless  they wanted to get caught? Why would  they use McCord--the only direct  contact to the Republicans?
BRADLEE	m	You saying the Democrats bugged  themselves?
FOREIGN EDITOR	m	The FBI thinks it's possible--the  Democrats need a campaign issue,  corruption's always a good one. Get off the story, Ben--or put some  people on McGovern's finances; fair  is fair, even in our business.
UNION GUY	m	What'd'ya think?
SECOND UNION GUY	m	Politics as usual, someone just got  caught with his hand in the cookie  jar, that's all.
UNION GUY	m	Big fuckin' cookie jar.
BERNSTEIN	m	This is practically a high school  reunion for us, Jane--I would have  sprung for a classier place.
JANE	f	Anyplace really public, they'd know  about it--they know everything at  the Committee, Carl--
BERNSTEIN	m	--you don't really think you're being  followed?
JANE	f	This girlfriend of mine at the  Committee, the other day she went  back to the D.A. to tell the things  the FBI didn't ask her. That night,  her boss, he knew what she'd done.  They control everything; that's how  they know it all.
BERNSTEIN	m	FBI too?
JANE	f	You don't believe me? Well, I was  working the weekend of the break-in  and my God, all the executives were  running around like crazy--you had  to practically wait in line to use  the shredding machine--and when the  FBI came to investigate, they never  even asked me about it.
BERNSTEIN	m	If you don't like it down there, why  don't you quit?
JANE	f	I don't know what they'd do to me.
BERNSTEIN	m	Hey, easy...
JANE	f	We're a long way from high school,  Carl... ...and I'm scared.
JANE'S VOICE	f	They found out I saw you-- --they wanted to know everything. Don't call me again.
BERNSTEIN	m	I can help if you'll--
JANE	f	--stay away from me, Carl!
CLERK	m	We have no one by the name of Mitchell  registered.
WOODWARD	m	My mistake, sorry.
WOODWARD	m	Get me John Mitchell, it's urgent.
OPERATOR	m	That would be room 710, I'll connect  you.
MAN'S VOICE	m	The Mitchells.
WOODWARD	m	Can I speak to Martha Mitchell,  please.
MAN'S VOICE	m	Who is this?
WOODWARD	m	I've met Mrs. Mitchell in Washington,  I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and  tell her--
FIRST MAID	m	We'll be back after lunch.
BLACK MAN	m	We'll be here.
SECOND MAID	m	I think they went out.
WOODWARD	m	I don't mind waiting.
BERNSTEIN	m	See her? Get anything?
WOODWARD	m	For the paper, no; for us, plenty. I waited a long time and finally  this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she  remembered me, we talked awhile.
BERNSTEIN	m	And?--And?--
WOODWARD	m	--she was panicked, Carl--every time  I mentioned Watergate, you could  tell.
BERNSTEIN	m	Were you eyebrow reading?
WOODWARD	m	It was there. I just don't get it; a  CREEP secretary being scared, that's  one thing. But what does the wife of  one of the most powerful men in  America have to be afraid of...?
BERNSTEIN	m	Left up ahead.
WOODWARD	m	Who's first?
BERNSTEIN	m	Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone  list, Miss Helen Abbott of South  George Street.
BERNSTEIN	m	Now hang your second right-- --this was my turf when I was a kid.
BERNSTEIN	m	I brought you over one street too  many--go back and hang a left again.
BERNSTEIN	m	I don't get it... this really was my  turf...
WOODWARD	m	You're not a kid anymore.
BERNSTEIN	m	My first day as a copy boy I was  sixteen and wearing my only grown-up  suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30  the head copy boy comes running up  to me and says, "My God, haven't you  washed the carbon paper yet? If it's  not washed by three, it'll never by  dry for tomorrow." And I said, "Am I supposed to do  that?" and he said, "Absolutely,  it's crucial." So I run around and  grab all the carbon paper from all  the desks and take it to the men's  room. I'm standing there washing it  and it's splashing all over me and  the editor comes in to take a leak,  and he says, "What the fuck do you  think you're doing?" And I said,  "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon  paper."
WOODWARD	m	Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington  Post and I hate to bother you at  home--
SWEET OLD LADY	f	--I already get the Post. I don't  need another subscription.
WOODWARD	m	No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk  to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
SWEET OLD LADY	f	The what to what?
WOODWARD	m	You work there, Miss Abbott.
SWEET OLD LADY	f	I'm not Miss Abbott.
WOODWARD	m	Miss Abbott?
MISS ABBOTT	f	Yes?
WOODWARD	m	We're from the Washington Post and  we wanted to ask you some questions  about the Committee.
MISS ABBOTT	f	I'm sorry--
MIDDLE-AGED MAN	m	God, it's just so awful--
A YOUNG GIRL	f	--I can't--I'd like to but--
OLD MAN	m	--go--you've got to go before they  see you--please--
OLD WOMAN	f	--no... good...
BERNSTEIN	m	You had the Mighty Mo and the fries  without gravy, right?
WOODWARD	m	This is terrific work, if you like  rejection.
BERNSTEIN	m	I never scared anyone before.
WOODWARD	m	It's not us, they were scared before  we got there. What do we know?
BERNSTEIN	m	Facts or theory?
WOODWARD	m	Anything you've got.
BERNSTEIN	m	We know there's got to be something  or they wouldn't be so panicked.
WOODWARD	m	And that something's got to be more  than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five  burglars--those indictments are gonna  be bullshit when they come down.  What else do we know?
BERNSTEIN	m	I just wish we knew when someone  would talk to us, that's all.
WOODWARD	m	A friend at the Committee told us to  contact you--
WOMAN	f	--who was it?
BERNSTEIN	m	We never reveal our sources, which  is why you can talk to us.
WOODWARD	m	It's safe, try it, you'll see.
BERNSTEIN	m	We understand your problem--
WOODWARD	m	--you believe in the President, you  wouldn't ever want to do anything  disloyal.
BERNSTEIN	m	We appreciate your position--really.
WOMAN	f	You people--you think that you can  come into someone's life, squeeze  what you want, then get out. You don't appreciate a goddamn thing,  mister. And you don't understand nothing. But the Committee's briefed us on  you--so get the hell out of here-- --do you like scaring the life out  of decent people?--'cause if you  don't, in the name of God--stop it!
WOODWARD	m	At Yale once, they held an auction.  There was this woman and her name  was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came  up for sale. She had 1400 postcards  written to her and I'd never heard  of her before but I knew I had to  have those cards, I had to know why  anyone would get so many messages. I  paid sixty-five dollars for them...  I got all crazy trying to work it  out and first it was just a maze but  then I found that her husband killed  himself in Dayton, and once I had  that, it all began to open, an  evangelist had come to Dayton and  his horses hit Lulu Landis at the  corner of 13th and Vermillion and  she was paralyzed. Permanently, and  her favorite thing til then had been  traveling and all her friends,  whenever they went anyplace, they  wrote her. Those cards, they were  her eyes...
MIDDLE-AGED MAN	m	I know who you are and I'm not afraid  but that don't mean I'll talk to you  either--you're just a couple Democrats  out to stop Nixon getting re-elected.
WOODWARD	m	Democrats?
MIDDLE-AGED MAN	m	That's right.
BERNSTEIN	m	I hate both parties.
WOODWARD	m	And I'm a Republican.
WOODWARD	m	Sure.
BERNSTEIN	m	Who'd you vote for?
WOODWARD	m	When?
BERNSTEIN	m	'68.
WOODWARD	m	Nixon.
MIDDLE-AGED MAN	m	Mitchell never left the Committee-- he resigned, sure, but he was there  as much as before--
YOUNGER MAN	m	--oh, don't worry, Gordon Liddy will  be happy to take the fall for everyone  because, well, it's not that Gordon's  crazy, he's... ...weird. I'll give you some Committee  people who know about him--only don't  tell it was me--
YOUNGER WOMAN	f	--of course we were briefed on what  to say--and never to volunteer  anything--
OLD WOMAN	f	--oh, we were never alone with the  FBI, there was always someone from  the Committee right there--
NIXON	m	...No one in this administration,  presently employed, was involved in  this very bizarre incident...
NIXON	m	...What really hurts in matters of  this sort is not the fact that they  occur, because overzealous people in  campaigns do things that are wrong.  What really hurts is if you try to  cover it up.
WOODWARD	m	Did he just say what I think he said?
BERNSTEIN	m	You voted for him.
BERNSTEIN	m	Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the  Washington Post and--
WOMAN	f	--oh, you don't want me, you want my  sister. For you.
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	f	This here is Carl Bernstein--
BOOKKEEPER	?	--omigod, you're from that place,  you've got to go.
BERNSTEIN	m	Could I bum one of your cigarettes?--
BERNSTEIN	m	--don't bother, I'll get it.
BOOKKEEPER	?	You've really got to go.
BERNSTEIN	m	Just let me get a match.
BERNSTEIN	m	But I want you to know that I  understand why you're afraid--a lot  of good people down there at the  Committee are afraid. I'm really  sorry for what you're being put  through.
BOOKKEEPER	?	All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
BERNSTEIN	m	We don't tell anyone that. Which is  why you can talk to us. And if we  can't verify what you say someplace  else, we don't print it. That's  another reason you can relax.
BOOKKEEPER	?	I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
BERNSTEIN	m	You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper  when he worked for Maurice Stans at  Finance, and we were sort of  wondering, did you go work for Stans  immediately after Sloan quit or was  there a time lapse?
BOOKKEEPER	?	I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
BERNSTEIN	m	Please, yes, thank you.
BOOKKEEPER	?	One minute but then--
BERNSTEIN	m	--right, right, I've got to go. Why did you lie just then?
BERNSTEIN	m	I was just curious--you don't do it  well, so I wondered. Have you been  threatened, if you told the truth,  is that it?
BOOKKEEPER	?	...No... never in so many words...
BERNSTEIN	m	It's obvious you want to talk to  someone--well, I'm someone.
BERNSTEIN	m	I'm not even going to put your name  down. It's just so I can keep things  straight. Start with the money, why don't you?
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	f	How do you like it?
BERNSTEIN	m	Everything, please.
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	f	I won't be a minute.
BERNSTEIN	m	The General Accounting report said  there was a 350 thousand cash slush  fund in Stans' safe. Did you know  about that from the beginning?
BOOKKEEPER	?	There are too many people watching  me--they know I know a lot--
BERNSTEIN	m	--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
BOOKKEEPER	?	A lot of it was. I just thought it  was sort of an all-purpose political  fund--you know, for taking fat cats  to dinner, things like that.
BERNSTEIN	m	Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000  dollars.
BOOKKEEPER	?	I can't be positive that it was used  for the break-in but people sure are  worried.
BERNSTEIN	m	Which people?
BOOKKEEPER	?	The ones who could disburse the money.
BERNSTEIN	m	Who were they?
BOOKKEEPER	?	There were a group of them--I think  five, I don't know their names.
BERNSTEIN	m	Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	f	Here we are.
BOOKKEEPER	?	I don't want to say anymore.
BERNSTEIN	m	It's awfully hot-- --and you haven't finished telling  me about the money--
BOOKKEEPER	?	--omigod, there was so much of it,  six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find  enough places to put it. I thought  it was all legal, I guess I did, til  after the break-in, when I remembered  Gordon got so much of it.
BERNSTEIN	m	Gordon Liddy, you mean?
BOOKKEEPER	?	It was all so crazy--the day after  the break-in he gave us a speech,  bouncing up and down on his heels in  that loony way of his--Gordon told  us not to let Jim McCord ruin  everything--don't let one bad apple  spoil the barrel, he said. You just  know that when Gordon Liddy's calling  someone a bad apple, something's  wrong somewhere. ...It's all so rotten... and getting  worse... and all I care about is  Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to  leave him if he didn't stand up and  do what was right. And he quit. He  quit because he saw it and didn't  want any part of it.
BERNSTEIN	m	Think Sloan's being set up as a fall  guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it  looks that way.
BOOKKEEPER	?	If you guys... if you guys could  just get John Mitchell... that would  be beautiful...
BERNSTEIN	m	I  couldn't believe what she told  me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
WOODWARD	m	Go on, go on--
BERNSTEIN	m	--we've got to find out who the five  guys are--the five with access to  the slush fund--they were aware of  the break-in.
WOODWARD	m	Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments  will just be bullshit.
BERNSTEIN	m	It goes very high--we've got to find  out where--
WOODWARD	m	--we will--
BERNSTEIN	m	--she was really paranoid, the  bookkeeper.
WOODWARD	m	That happens to people. OK, go on.
BERNSTEIN	m	How do you want to handle Sloan?
WOODWARD	m	You mean, who's going to play the  mean M.P. and who's going to be the  nice one? Whichever.
BERNSTEIN	m	He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll  probably expect you to be  understanding--might surprise him if  you're not.
WOODWARD	m	You want me to be the bastard.
BERNSTEIN	m	And I'll just shitkick in my usual  way.
WOODWARD	m	To see Mr. Sloan.
MRS. SLOAN	f	He's out. You're those two from the Post, aren't  you. I'll tell him.
BERNSTEIN	m	This must be a difficult time for  the both of you.
MRS. SLOAN	f	This is an honest house.
WOODWARD	m	That's why we wanted to see your  husband.
MRS. SLOAN	f	That decision is up to him.
BERNSTEIN	m	Maybe you could put in a good word.
WOODWARD	m	We've got another appointment tonight  in this area--we'll just stop back  later, all right?
MRS. SLOAN	f	It's a free country-- --in theory.
MRS. SLOAN	f	Be careful--
MRS. SLOAN	f	--you can destroy lives.
WOODWARD	m	Think Sloan's back? What's wrong?
BERNSTEIN	m	Nothing--I just found out that Jeb  Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike  freak than I am. I never like it when the other guy's  human...
WOODWARD	m	Mr. Sloan?
SLOAN	m	My wife told me to expect you. As you know, I haven't talked to the  press.
BERNSTEIN	m	We were hoping that maybe now you  could. We know why you left the  Committee. We know you're not guilty  of anything. But we know you know  who is--
SLOAN	m	--look, come in. We'll have to be  quiet--my wife's asleep.
SLOAN	m	I'd like to talk to you, I really  would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't  until after the Watergate trial.
WOODWARD	m	You handed out the money. Maybe  there's a legitimate explanation for  the way it was done--
BERNSTEIN	m	--then again, maybe things are even  worse than we've written--
SLOAN	m	--they're worse. That's why I quit.
SLOAN	m	Try and understand this. I'm a decent  Republican. I believe in Richard  Nixon. I worked in the White House  four years--so did my wife. What  happened on June 17 I don't think  the President knew anything about.  Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
BERNSTEIN	m	Do you think the truth will come out  at the trial?
SLOAN	m	That's another of the things I'm not  so sure of.
BERNSTEIN	m	Because people at the Committee were  told to lie to the prosecutors?
SLOAN	m	We were never told flat out "Don't  talk." But the message was clear.
BERNSTEIN	m	To cover up?
SLOAN	m	Well, they sure didn't ask us to  come forward and tell the truth.
WOODWARD	m	Does "they" mean the White House?
SLOAN	m	As opposed to the Committee? The  Committee's not an independent  operation. Everything is cleared  with the White House. I don't think  that the FBI or the prosecutors  understand that.
WOODWARD	m	The report on the cash in Maurice  Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty  thousand, that's true?
SLOAN	m	No. It was closer to seven hundred  thousand.
WOODWARD	m	And as treasurer, you could release  those funds?
SLOAN	m	When so ordered.
WOODWARD	m	We're not sure we've got all the  guys who could order you, but we  know there were five.
BERNSTEIN	m	Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're  obvious--
WOODWARD	m	--there had to be a White House  overseer--
BERNSTEIN	m	--Colson.
SLOAN	m	Colson's too smart to get directly  involved with something like that.
WOODWARD	m	Haldeman. Right?
SLOAN	m	I won't talk about the other two.
BERNSTEIN	m	But they both worked at the White  House?
SLOAN	m	I will not talk about the other two.
BERNSTEIN	m	Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
SLOAN	m	I can't say anything, I'm sorry.
WOODWARD	m	One thing I'm not completely clear  on--when you gave out the money to  Liddy, how did that work?
SLOAN	m	Badly. You don't realize how close all this  came to staying undiscovered--I gave  Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave  it to Barker who took it to Miami  and deposited it.
BERNSTEIN	m	Right.
SLOAN	m	Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand  in hundred dollar bills and gave it  back to Liddy who gave it back to me  and I put it in the office safe which  was crammed.
WOODWARD	m	Go on.
SLOAN	m	Well, when Liddy came and asked for  money for what turned out to be the  break-in funds, I went to the safe  and gave him--out of this whole  fortune--I happened to give him the  same hundreds he gave me--banks have  to keep track of hundreds. If the  money had been in fifties, or if I'd  grabbed a different stack, there  probably wouldn't have been any  Watergate story.
BERNSTEIN	m	Ordinarily, though, what was the  procedure?
SLOAN	m	Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell  over at the Justice Department and  he'd say "go ahead, give out the  money."
BERNSTEIN	m	What happens when the baby comes?
SLOAN	m	We're moving. I've been looking for a job but it's  been... hard. My name's been in the  papers too much. Sometimes I wonder  if reporters understand how much  pain they can inflict in just one  sentence. I'm not thinking of myself.  But my wife, my parents, it's been  very rough on them.
SLOAN	m	I wish I could put down on paper  what it's like--you come to Washington  because you believe in something,  and then you get inside and you see  how things actually work and you  watch your ideals disintegrate. The people inside, the people in the  White House, they start to believe  they can suspend the rules because  they're fulfilling a mission. That  becomes the only important thing-- the mission. It's so easy to lose  perspective. We want to get out before  we lose ours altogether.
BERNSTEIN	m	Look--five men controlled that slush  fund as CREEP--three of them we've  got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and  we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
WOODWARD	m	We'd like to wait til we have all  five before we print it.
BRADLEE	m	This is a daily paper, we'll explain  it tomorrow. You're certain on Mitchell?
WOODWARD	m	He approved the payments to Liddy  while he was still Attorney General--
ROSENFELD	m	--you got more than one source?--
BERNSTEIN	m	--yes--
SIMONS	m	--has any of them got an ax?--
ROSENFELD	m	--political, personal, sexual,  anything at all against Mitchell?--
WOODWARD	m	--no--
SIMONS	m	--can we use their names?--
BERNSTEIN	m	--no--
BRADLEE	m	--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna  go on the record on this story--
ROSENFELD	m	--who you got?--
WOODWARD	m	--well, Sloan--
BERNSTEIN	m	--and we got a guy in Justice--
BRADLEE	m	--Deep Throat?--
WOODWARD	m	--I saw him. He verifies.
BRADLEE	m	OK.
BRADLEE	m	Leave plenty of room for his denial.
OPERATOR'S VOICE	m	Essex House, can I help you?
BERNSTEIN	m	John Mitchell, please.
JOHN MITCHELL'S VOICE	m	Yes?
BERNSTEIN	m	Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the  Washington Post, and I'm sorry to  bother you but we're running a story  in tomorrow's paper that we thought  you should have a chance to comment  on.
MITCHELL	m	What does it say?
BERNSTEIN	m	John N. Mitchell, while serving as  US Attorney General, personally  controlled a secret cash fund that--
MITCHELL	m	--jeeeeeeesus--
BERNSTEIN	m	--fund that was used to gather  information against the Democrats--
MITCHELL	m	--jeeeeeeesus--
BERNSTEIN	m	--according to sources involved in  the Watergate investigation. Beginning  in the spring of 1971--
MITCHELL	m	--jeeeeeeesus--
BERNSTEIN	m	--almost a year before he left the  Justice Department--
MITCHELL	m	--jeeeeeeeeesus--
BERNSTEIN	m	--to become President Nixon's campaign  manager on March 1, Mitchell  personally approved withdrawals from  the fund--
MITCHELL	m	--all that crap, you're putting it  in the paper? It's all been denied.  You tell your publisher--tell Katie  Graham she's gonna get her tit caught  in a big fat wringer if that's  published. Good Christ! That's the  most sickening thing I ever heard.
BERNSTEIN	m	Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
MITCHELL	m	--what time is it?
BERNSTEIN	m	11:30.
MITCHELL	m	Morning or night?
BERNSTEIN	m	Night.
MITCHELL	m	Oh.
BRADLEE	m	He really made that remark about  Mrs. Graham? This is a family newspaper--cut the  words "her tit" and run it.
BRADLEE	m	Once when I was reporting, Lyndon  Johnson's top guy gave me the word  they were looking for a successor to  J. Edgar Hoover. I wrote it and the  day it appeared Johnson called a  press conference and appointed Hoover  head of the FBI for life... And when  he was done, he turned to his top  guy and the President said, "Call  Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you." I took a lot of static for that-- everyone said, "You did it, Bradlee,  you screwed up--you stuck us with  Hoover forever--" --I screwed up but I wasn't wrong.
BRADLEE	m	You guys haven't been wrong yet, is  that why you're scared shitless? You should be...
SENATOR	m	Although I am a Republican, I would  like to state in a pure bipartisan  spirit that I feel only sadness that  a once fine journal of record like  the Post would have become merely  the hysterical spokesman for the  equally hysterical left wing of the  Democratic Party--
CREEP P.R. MAN	m	--hearsay, innuendo, and character  assassination. I can only conclude  that the so-called sources of the  Washington Post are a fountain of  misinformation--
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN	m	--the White House has long since  stopped being surprised at this type  of reporting by certain elements of  the Eastern liberal press--
SIMONS	m	Same kind of crap--
BRADLEE	m	--all non-denial denials--we're dirty  guys and they doubt we were ever  virgins but they don't say the story  is inaccurate.
BERNSTEIN	m	What's a real denial?
BRADLEE	m	If they ever start calling us goddamn  liars-- --it's time to start circling the  wagons.
FIRST UNION GUY	m	You think they know what they're  doing on the fifth floor?
SECOND UNION GUY	m	I got eight kids to support--they  better.
WOODWARD	m	What do you think Mrs. Graham wants  to see me for?
SIMONS	m	Maybe to fire you--since you two  started on this story, the Post stock  has dropped, what, 50 percent? And the word is some Nixon people  are challenging her TV licenses. I'm  not saying she's going on relief,  but I don't think it's unreasonable  for her to want to meet you.
WOODWARD	m	You think she wants us to ease up on  the story?
SIMONS	m	I don't know, but I don't think that's  unreasonable either, do you?
MRS. GRAHAM	f	I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
WOODWARD	m	--I'm Woodward.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	You know, the paper was my father's  and my husband's when they were alive  and I was thinking back a year or  two ago when Ben called me and said  he wanted to publish the Pentagon  Papers the next day. The Times had  already been stopped from publishing  anymore of them and all my legal  counsel said "don't, don't" and I  was frightened but I knew if I said  no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor.  So we published, and that night,  after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I  woke up in the darkness and I thought,  "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this  newspaper?" I woke up again last night with that  same question. Are we right on this story?
WOODWARD	m	I think so.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	Are you sure?
WOODWARD	m	No.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
WOODWARD	m	It may never come out.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	Never? Please don't tell me never. Ben says you've found some wonderful  sources.
WOODWARD	m	Some Justice Department lawyers and  an FBI man, and some people from the  Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	And the underground garage one. Would I know him?
WOODWARD	m	I couldn't say.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	But it's possible.
WOODWARD	m	It is.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	You've never told anyone who he is? But you'd have to tell me if I asked  you. Tell me.
WOODWARD	m	I would, if you really ever wanted  to know.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	I really want to know.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	I wasn't serious. I have plenty of  burdens to carry around, I don't  need another.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	We're going to need lots of good  luck, aren't we?
WOODWARD	m	Nobody ever had too much.
MRS. GRAHAM	f	Do better.
WOODWARD	m	What?
BRADLEE	m	I thought you guys were supposed to  be working on this story-- --you think I like being aced out?
BERNSTEIN	m	--what?--
WOODWARD	m	--The L.A. Times has a huge interview  with Baldwin--
BERNSTEIN	m	--the lookout in the Motor Inn?-- --he say anything we don't know?--
WOODWARD	m	--just that a lot of reports were  sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name  who, not here anyway--
BRADLEE	m	--it would have been nice to have  had this, I sure would have liked to  have had this--
BERNSTEIN	m	--there's nothing new in it--
BRADLEE	m	--it makes the break-in real--it's a  major goddamn story-- --I'm not going to kick ass over  this, but I'd like you to know I  hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
BERNSTEIN	m	Goddamnit--
WOODWARD	m	--shit--
BERNSTEIN	m	--we gotta top the Times--
WOODWARD	m	--I know, I know--
BERNSTEIN	m	--if we could name the guys got the  reports, we'd be ahead again--
WOODWARD	m	--shit, who do we know?--
BERNSTEIN	m	--I know a lawyer at Justice--
WOODWARD	m	--has he got an ax?--
BERNSTEIN	m	--almost every source we've used has  been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
WOODWARD	m	Then he's got an ax. Call him anyway.
FIRST UNION GUY	m	Who is this Woodstein? Two stories on the front page.
SECOND UNION GUY	m	If he can't pick a winner at Pimlico,  to hell with him.
BERNSTEIN	m	--I want you to shut up and listen  to me--
WOODWARD	m	--I haven't said anything--
BERNSTEIN	m	--for the first time I'm beginning  to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called  me up with a tip-- --someone named Donald Segretti  contacted a bunch of lawyers and  asked them if they'd like to go to  work with him screwing up the  Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like  that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone  calls to him--they interrogated him,  but on account of Segretti wasn't  involved with the break-in, they  didn't follow through. But Segretti  did a lot of traveling--he called  these lawyers from different places,  and he told them the Republicans  knew what he was doing.
WOODWARD	m	How high up, which Republicans?
BERNSTEIN	m	That's what we've got to find out,  but Segretti went to Southern Cal.  and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
WOODWARD	m	--Haldeman I know, who else?
BERNSTEIN	m	Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments  chief--he knew Segretti in school.  Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the  first time any of this starts to  make sense. What were the three  theories?
WOODWARD	m	The burglary was done by Cubans or  Democrats or Republicans.
BERNSTEIN	m	Now the reason no one believed the  Republicans is because there wasn't  any reason, they were so far ahead.  But Segretti was talking to these  other lawyers a year before the break- in.
WOODWARD	m	So maybe Watergate wasn't really  about Watergate--maybe that was just  a piece--
BERNSTEIN	m	--because a year before, the  Republicans weren't ahead, not in  the polls, Muskie was running ahead  of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
WOODWARD	m	If he self-destructed.
WOODWARD	m	Segretti criss-crossed the country  over ten times in six months--and  never stayed anyplace over a night  or two. Switch to another station, huh? You're  driving me crazy with that.
BERNSTEIN	m	Segovia begged me for me secret but  I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to  try and make it without me."
WOODWARD	m	California, Illinois, Florida, New  Hampshire--all the major Democratic  primary states. Why does everything you play sound  the same?
BERNSTEIN	m	--'cause I only know four chords--
BERNSTEIN	m	Donald Segretti?
SEGRETTI	?	That's right.
BERNSTEIN	m	I'm Carl Bernstein. My paper sent me out to see if I  couldn't persuade you to go on the  record.
SEGRETTI	?	You can't.
BERNSTEIN	m	Mind if I try?
BERNSTEIN	m	According to what we've been able to  verify, you've been busy.
SEGRETTI	?	I've got a lot of energy.
BERNSTEIN	m	Listen--we know you're involved in  this--we're going to get the story,  why not help?
SEGRETTI	?	They never told me anything except  my own role--I had to find out the  rest in the papers.
BERNSTEIN	m	By "they" you mean...?
BERNSTEIN	m	By "they" you mean the White House,  don't you? Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
SEGRETTI	?	I know where Dwight works.
BERNSTEIN	m	When did he hire you?
BERNSTEIN	m	Do you feel much about the things  you did?
SEGRETTI	?	I didn't do anything wrong.
BERNSTEIN	m	Tell that to Muskie.
SEGRETTI	?	Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
BERNSTEIN	m	During the Florida primary, you wrote  a letter on Muskie stationery saying  Scoop Jackson had a bastard child.  You wrote another that said Hubert  Humphrey was out with call girls.
SEGRETTI	?	Sometimes it got up to a quarter  maybe-- --off the record.
BERNSTEIN	m	You wrote the Canuck letter--the one  where you claimed Muskie slurred the  Canadians.
SEGRETTI	?	I didn't.
BERNSTEIN	m	But you know who did.
SEGRETTI	?	When you guys print it in the paper,  then I'll know. I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go  to jail, and be disbarred, and what  did I do that was so awful?
SEGRETTI	?	None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't  go looking for the job.
BERNSTEIN	m	Chapin did contact you then?
SEGRETTI	?	Sure--off the record.
BERNSTEIN	m	On the orders of Haldeman?
SEGRETTI	?	I don't know anything about Haldeman,  except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ,  I wish I'd never gotten messed around  with this--all I wanna do is sit in  the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
BERNSTEIN	m	It gets interesting if it was  Haldeman, because our word is that  when Chapin says something, he's  gotten the OK from Haldeman, and  when Haldeman says something, he's  gotten the OK from the President.
SEGRETTI	?	Can't help you.
BERNSTEIN	m	At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all  did it at college and called it  ratfucking. Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out  to be the biggest ratfucker of them  all?
SEGRETTI	?	What would you have done if you were  just getting out of the Army, if  you'd been away from the real world  for four years, if you weren't sure  what kind of law you wanted to  practice, and then one day you got a  call from an old friend asking you  to go to work for the President of  the United States...?
BERNSTEIN	m	What would you have done?
WOODWARD	m	You asking would I have been one of  the President's men? I would have been.
DEEP THROAT	m	My turn to keep you waiting. What's the topic for tonight?
WOODWARD	m	Ratfucking.
DEEP THROAT	m	In my day, it was simply called the  double cross. I believe the CIA refers  to it as Mindfuck. In our context,  it simply means infiltration of the  Democrats.
WOODWARD	m	I know what it means--Segretti  wouldn't go on the record, but if he  would, we know he'd implicate Chapin.  And that would put us inside the  White House.
DEEP THROAT	m	Yes, the little ratfuckers are now  running our government.
WOODWARD	m	Who?--be specific. How high up?
DEEP THROAT	m	You'll have to find that out, won't  you.
WOODWARD	m	The slush fund at CREEP financed the  ratfucking, we've almost got that  nailed down, so--
WOODWARD	m	What?
DEEP THROAT	m	Did you change cabs? It didn't work, something moved there--
WOODWARD	m	Who are you?
WOODWARD	m	Here. Forget your troubles and just be  happy.
DEEP THROAT	m	I hope you noticed how coolly I  behaved under the threat of discovery.
WOODWARD	m	Do Justice and the FBI know what we  know, and why the hell haven't they  done anything about it?
DEEP THROAT	m	They know, but they focused on the  burglary--if it didn't deal with the  break-in, they didn't pursue it.
WOODWARD	m	Why didn't they?--who told them not  to?
DEEP THROAT	m	Someone with authority I'd imagine,  wouldn't you? Don't you know what you're onto?  Come on.
WOODWARD	m	Mitchell knew then.
DEEP THROAT	m	Of course--my God, you think something  this big just happens? The break-in  and the cover up, of course Mitchell  knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
WOODWARD	m	Haldeman too?
DEEP THROAT	m	You get nothing from me about  Haldeman?
WOODWARD	m	Why did they do all this for  Chrissakes?--what were they after?
DEEP THROAT	m	Total manipulation. I suppose you  could say they wanted to subvert the  Constitution, but they don't think  along philosophical lines.
WOODWARD	m	Talk about Segretti--
DEEP THROAT	m	--don't concentrate on Segretti or  you'll miss the overall scheme too.
WOODWARD	m	There were more then.
DEEP THROAT	m	Follow every lead--every lead goes  somewhere--
WOODWARD	m	--the Canuck letter--was that a White  House operation--
DEEP THROAT	m	--don't you miss the grand scheme  too.
WOODWARD	m	How grand?
DEEP THROAT	m	Nationwide--my God, they were  frightened of Muskie and look who  got destroyed--they wanted to run  against McGovern, and look who they're  running against. They bugged, they  followed people, false press leaks,  fake letters, they canceled Democratic  campaign rallies, they investigated  Democratic private lives, they planted  spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all  the work of little Don Segretti.
WOODWARD	m	And Justice and FBI know all this?
DEEP THROAT	m	Yes, yes, everything. There were  over fifty people employed by the  White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond  belief.
WOODWARD	m	Fifty ratfuckers directed by the  White House to destroy the Democrats?
DEEP THROAT	m	I was being cautious. You can safely say more then fifty...
BERGER	m	Do you guys know about the Canuck  letter?
BERNSTEIN	m	Um-hmm. Why?
BERGER	m	I just wanted to be sure you knew  who wrote it.
BERNSTEIN	m	Tell him what you just told me.
BERGER	m	Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be  a reporter here before he went to  work for Nixon--I had him over for a  drink a few weeks ago and he told me  he wrote the Canuck letter. You did want to know, didn't you?
BERNSTEIN	m	You think we're being set up?--Christ,  Deep Throat tells you last night  that the letter came from inside the  White House and up traipses Marilyn  naming names.
WOODWARD	m	It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they  have at the White House? Each new  member of the President's staff has  to prove his guts by getting an enemy  of Nixon.
BERNSTEIN	m	You think this was Clawsen's  initiation?
WOODWARD	m	Could have won him a fraternity paddle  with a White House seal. God knows it worked.
WOODWARD	m	You claiming it was all a  misunderstanding, Ken?
CLAWSEN	m	Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it  totally wrong--
WOODWARD	m	She's an awfully good reporter--I  can't remember her getting too much  wrong before, can you?
CLAWSEN	m	That's a bullshit question, that's a  question straight out of Wichita,  Kansas.
WOODWARD	m	Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing:  where did your talk with Berger  happen?
CLAWSEN	m	Where? What do you mean, where?
WOODWARD	m	Well, was it in a bar, her apartment,  some restaurant--
CLAWSEN	m	--I've completely forgotten where it  was, except I know it wasn't her  apartment.
WOODWARD	m	Non denial-denial, Marilyn--
CLAWSEN	m	For Chissakes, don't tell them I  came to your place.
BERGER	m	I already told them.
CLAWSEN	m	Oh, that's terrific, that's just so  terrific, I'm thrilled you did that.
BERGER	m	I have a clear conscience.
CLAWSEN	m	Marilyn, I have a wife and a family  and a cat and a dog.
BRADLEE	m	I got Clawsen on hold--
WOODWARD	m	--his dialing finger must be falling  off--
BRADLEE	m	--what do you think?--
WOODWARD	m	--he went to her apartment and he  told her--
BERNSTEIN	m	--if he did it or just said he did  it, God knows.
BRADLEE	m	I could care less about where it  happened; what happened is what  counts.
BRADLEE	m	It's like they taught us at Harvard:  few things are as gratifying to the  soul as having another man's nuts in  a vise...
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN	m	The story is based entirely on hearsay  and--
CREEP P.R. MAN	m	--we at the Committee are continually  amazed at the creativity shown by  the Washington Post--
WESTERN SENATOR	m	--although I am a Republican, I would  like to state in a pure bipartisan  spirit that I am happy that this  latest onslaught against the  intelligence of the American people  will be wrapping fish tomorrow. I  offer my condolences to the fish...
ROSENFELD	m	Speak.
BERNSTEIN	m	We've just been talking to Young--
SIMONS	m	--which Young?
WOODWARD	m	Larry Young, a California lawyer--
BERNSTEIN	m	--he was going to go into law practice  with Segretti.
ROSENFELD	m	And?--
WOODWARD	m	--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
SIMONS	m	--well and good, but when will he  say it on the record.
WOODWARD	m	He just did.
BERNSTEIN	m	He'll give us a sworn statement.
WOODWARD	m	We're inside the White House now.
BRADLEE	m	Look, I wanted to talk because things  are getting really hairy and there's  a couple of things we've got to be  careful of because--
BRADLEE	m	--either of you want a drink or should  I order?-- --because--
BRADLEE	m	--because our cocks are on the  chopping block and you've got to be  sure that you're not just dealing  with people who hate Richard Nixon  and want to get him through us. You  see, I don't give a shit who's  President--I really don't, it's an  adversary situation between them and  us and it's always gonna be. I never  had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy  and once I printed something that  pissed him off and for seven months  I didn't exist.
MAN	m	You none of you know who I am, do  you? You screw me up good, you don't even  know what I look like.
BRADLEE	m	OK, you've had your preamble; who  the hell are you?
MAN	m	Glenn Sedam--you wrote about me last  week, you said I was one of the guys  at the Committee who was sent reports.  You were wrong.
BERNSTEIN	m	Baldwin told the FBI it was you.
SEDAM	?	Baldwin told the FBI it was someone  whose first name sounded like a last  name. They showed him a list and he  picked me but it wasn't me, it was  Gordon Liddy. My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my  wife's hysterical, my kids think I'm  mixed up with the burglary, my friends  don't like me around all of a sudden.
SEDAM	?	You fucked around my life, you two. I just wanted to say thanks.
BRADLEE	m	That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been  wrong? You had a good source? Did he have an ax?
BRADLEE	m	All right, you made a mistake maybe,  we all have, just don't make another.  And watch your personal lives, who  you hang around with. Someone once  said the price of democracy is a  bloodletting every ten years. Make sure it isn't our blood...
SLOAN	m	I really can't talk now--
BERNSTEIN	m	--this'll only take one second--
SLOAN	m	--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get  the house in some kind of shape.
WOODWARD	m	A boy or a girl?
SLOAN	m	A girl. Melissa.
WOODWARD	m	Where does this go?
WOODWARD	m	--That cash fund that financed the  sabotaging of the Democrats--five  guys had control--
BERNSTEIN	m	--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
WOODWARD	m	--we're working on the last guy now  and we're going all the way--that  fifth man was Haldeman.
SLOAN	m	--I'm not your source on that--
BERNSTEIN	m	--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone  from the White House had to be  involved--
WOODWARD	m	--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson  or the President.
SLOAN	m	No, none of those.
BERNSTEIN	m	--that leaves Haldeman, period.
SLOAN	m	I'm not your source on that.
WOODWARD	m	--look, when the Watergate grand  jury questioned you, did you name  names?
SLOAN	m	Of course--everything they asked--
BERNSTEIN	m	--if we wrote a story that said  Haldeman controlled the fund?--
SLOAN	m	--let me put it this way: I'd have  no problem if you did.
WOODWARD'S VOICE	m	Hey?
WOODWARD	m	I think that's him.
BERNSTEIN	m	Who?
WOODWARD	m	Haldeman.
BERNSTEIN	m	Nah. Maybe.
WOODWARD	m	What if I went up and introduced  myself--think he'd slug me?
BERNSTEIN	m	Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
WOODWARD	m	It's nothing personal, though.
BERNSTEIN	m	What's the matter?
WOODWARD	m	Same as Magruder, I don't like it  when they turn out to be human.
BERNSTEIN	m	I wish we were investigating Attila  the Hun.
WOODWARD	m	Maybe we are...
PUDGY MAN	m	--Goddamnit, I'm not gonna say it  again--you get nothing about Haldeman  outta me--
WOODWARD	m	--we don't need it now, because  tomorrow's story is about the FBI--
BERNSTEIN	m	--about how all you supposed experts  really blew the whole investigation--
FBI GUY	m	--we didn't miss so much--
WOODWARD	m	--you never knew Haldeman had control  of the slush fund--
FBI GUY	m	--it's all in our files--
BERNSTEIN	m	--not about Haldeman--
FBI GUY	m	--yeah, Haldeman, John Haldeman.
BERNSTEIN	m	--Jesus--
WOODWARD	m	--he said John Haldeman, not Bob  Haldeman--
BRADLEE	m	--I don't know, I don't know, it  feels thin--
SIMONS	m	--Christ, I wish I knew if we should  print this--
ROSENFELD	m	--listen, we didn't make them do  these things--once they did, it's  our job to report it--
SIMONS	m	--go over your sources again--
WOODWARD	m	--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he  answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
BERNSTEIN	m	--and the FBI confirms--what more do  you need?--
ROSENFELD	m	--listen, I love this country, you  think I want to bring it down?--I'm  not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
SIMONS	m	--Harry, weren't you just arguing  the opposite way?--
ROSENFELD	m	--maybe I'm tense--
BRADLEE	m	--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman  who only happens to be the second  most important man in America of  conducting a criminal conspiracy  from inside the White House-- --it would be nice if we were right--
SIMONS	m	--you double-checked both sources?--
BRADLEE	m	--Bernstein, are you sure on this  story?
BERNSTEIN	m	Absolutely--
BRADLEE	m	--what about you?--
WOODWARD	m	--I'm sure--
BRADLEE	m	--I'm not sure, it still feels thin--
SIMONS	m	--get another source.
BERNSTEIN	m	How many fucking sources they think  we got?--
WOODWARD	m	--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never  thought he was scared of anyone, but  he's scared of Haldeman.
BERNSTEIN	m	I know a guy in the Justice Department  who was around the Grand Jury.
WOODWARD	m	--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
LAWYER'S VOICE	m	...You shouldn't ever call me like  this, Carl...
BERNSTEIN	m	Will you confirm that Haldeman was  mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury?
LAWYER'S VOICE	m	...I won't say anything about  Haldeman... not ever...
BERNSTEIN	m	All right--listen--it's against the  law if you talk about the Grand Jury,  right? But you don't have to say a  thing--I'll count to ten--if the  story's wrong, hang up before I get  there--if it's OK stay on the line  till after, got it?
LAWYER	m	Hang up, right?
BERNSTEIN	m	Right, right--OK, counting: one, two-- --three, four, five, six-- --seven, eight-- --nine, ten, thank you.
LAWYER	m	You've got it straight now? Everything
BERNSTEIN	m	Yeah!
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN	m	On the record let me say just this:  the story is totally untrue. On  background, I'd like to add that Bob  Haldeman is one of the greatest public  servants this country has ever had  and the story is a goddamned lie.
BRADLEE	m	Woodstein!
SCHORR	f	Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment  on your testimony before the Grand  Jury.
SLOAN	m	My lawyer says--
SLOAN'S LAWYER	m	--the answer is an unequivocal no.  Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr.  Haldeman in that testimony at all.
FBI MAN	m	--I'll deny everything--everything-- I never talked to you about Haldeman-- I never talked to you about anything-- I'm not talking to you now--
BERNSTEIN	m	--what went wrong?--
WOODWARD	m	--for Chrissakes just tell that--
PUDGY FBI MAN	m	--fuck you fuck you fuck you--
BERNSTEIN	m	Woodward?
WOODWARD	m	Hmm?
BERNSTEIN	m	What was the mistake? Do you think  it's been rigged, all along the way,  leading us on so they could slip it  to us when it mattered? They couldn't  have set us up better; after all  these months our credibility's gone,  you know what that means?
WOODWARD	m	Only everything...
SIMONS	m	More denunciations?
ROSENFELD	m	One Senator just gave a speech  slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
SIMONS	m	What's this?
BRADLEE	m	My non-denial denial.
ROSENFELD	m	We're not printing a retraction?
BRADLEE	m	Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.
WOODWARD	m	Hello?
BERNSTEIN'S VOICE	m	What'd you find?
WOODWARD	m	Jesus Christ, what time is it?
BERNSTEIN	m	You overslept?
WOODWARD	m	Goddamnit!--
DEEP THROAT	m	--you were doing so well and then  you got stupid, you went too fast-- Christ, what a royal screw up--
WOODWARD	m	--I know, I know, the pressure's off  the White House and it's all back on  the Post--
DEEP THROAT	m	--you've done worse than let Haldeman  slip away, you've got people feeling  sorry for him--I didn't think that  was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around  everyone's neck. You build from the  outer edges and you go step by step.  If you shoot too high and miss, then  everybody feels more secure. You've  put the investigation back months.
WOODWARD	m	We know that--and if we were wrong,  we're resigning--were we wrong?
DEEP THROAT	m	You'll have to find that out, won't  you?--
WOODWARD	m	--I'm tired of your chickenshit games-- I don't want hints, I want what you  know!
DEEP THROAT	m	It was a Haldeman operation--the  whole business--he ran the money,  but he was insulated, you'll have to  find out how--
DEEP THROAT	m	--wait-- --there's more...
WOODWARD	m	We gotta go see Bradlee--I'll fill  you in in the car.
BRADLEE	m	You couldn't have told me over the  phone?
WOODWARD	m	We can't trust the phones, not  anymore. Deep Throat says so.
BRADLEE	m	We can't talk inside either?
WOODWARD	m	Electronic surveillance.
BERNSTEIN	m	I finally got through to Sloan--it  was all a misunderstanding that we  had: he would have told the Grand  Jury about Haldeman, he was ready  to, only nobody on the Grand Jury  asked him the goddamn question.
WOODWARD	m	So I guess you could say that we  screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
BRADLEE	m	Anything else from Mr. Throat?
WOODWARD	m	Mitchell started the cover-up early,  everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole  U.S. intelligence community is mixed  in with the covert activities. The  extent of it is incredible. And people's lives are in danger,  maybe including ours.
BRADLEE	m	He's wrong on that last, we're not  in the least danger, because nobody  gives a shit--what was that Gallup  Poll result? Half the country's never  even heard the word Watergate.
BRADLEE	m	Look, you're both probably a little  tired, right? You should be, you've been under a  lot of pressure. So go home, have a  nice hot bath, rest up fifteen minutes  if you want before you get your asses  back in gear-- --because we're under a lot of  pressure, too, and you put us there-- not that I want it to worry you-- nothing's riding on you except the  First Amendment of the Constitution  plus the freedom of the press plus  the reputation of a hundred-year-old  paper plus the jobs of the two  thousand people who work there-- --but none of that counts as much as  this: you fuck up again, I'm gonna  lose my temper. I promise you, you don't want me to  lose my temper. Move-move-move--what have you done  for me tomorrow...?
WESTERN SENATOR	m	Although I'm a Republican, I would  like to state in a pure bipartisan  spirit tht the greatest political  scandal of this campaign is the brazen  manner in which, without benefit of  clergy, the Washington Post has set  up housekeeping with the McGovern  campaign...
CREEP P.R. MAN	m	For twenty years, the Eastern liberal  press has been trying to smear Dick  Nixon. Fortunately, the American  public is too smart to be fooled  by...
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN	m	I have been informed reliably by  John Dean that no one connected with  the White House...
WESTERN SENATOR	m	It is only our pathetic Post that  deliberately tries to infuse the  Watergate caper with a seriousness  far beyond those shenanigans that  have been the stock trade of political  pranksters ever since...
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN	m	An insult to the American public--
CREEP P.R. MAN	m	--the deplorable tactics employed by  the Washington Post--
WESTERN SENATOR	m	--I have been given access to evidence  in possession of the White House and  that evidence--
WESTERN SENATOR	m	Well, if I was wrong, I sure the  hell wasn't alone--
CREEP	m	--the fact remains that except for  Watergate, we ran one hell of a great  campaign...
