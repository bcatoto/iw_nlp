TOM	m	Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?
CHRISSIE	f	C'mon!
CHRISSIE	f	Tommy? Don't dunk me...
RADIO ANNOUNCER	m	Hayes Landing reports conditions  good, with stripers and jacks. The  Coast Guard has no storm warning  from Block Island to Cape Hatteras;  a light chop with freshening winds,  continued clear and mild... (etc.)
BRODY	m	How come the sun didn't used to shine  in here?
ELLEN	f	'cause when we bought the house it  was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the  dogs.
BRODY	m	Right.
ELLEN	f	Do you see the kids?
BRODY	m	Probably out in the back yard.
ELLEN	f	In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
BRODY	m	The kids are in the yahd, playing  near the cah. How's that sound?
ELLEN	f	Like you're from N'Yawk.
BRODY	m	Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
BRODY	m	Did you burn another kettle? Y'know  you're a fire hazard? This is the  third one!
ELLEN	f	I never hear the whistle.
BRODY	m	Feed the dogs.
ELLEN	f	You want to go through those? I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.   It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity.   Pick out what you want to keep --  it's mostly your city clothes.
BRODY	m	I used to wear this to the Garden.  Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it.
ELLEN	f	Don't be silly -� You're going to  make summer better for them...
MICHAEL	m	Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
BRODY	m	On the swing? I told you not to play  near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?
ELLEN	f	Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band- aid.
ELLEN	f	Don't forget these.
BRODY	m	Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh?
ELLEN	f	I think they make you look sexy.
BRODY	m	Sexy, hm? What was I before?
ELLEN	f	Older, sillier.
BRODY	m	I don't want to depend on these  things, y'know -� sometimes you can  weaken your eyes.
BRODY	m	Let's see...
BRODY	m	Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm...  Well, what do they usually do, float  or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll  meet both of you at the beach in ...20 minutes, okay? Okay. First goddamn weekend of the summer.
ELLEN	f	There. What was that?
BRODY	m	The office.
ELLEN	f	Be careful.
BRODY	m	Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
BRODY	m	Love ya.
ELLEN	f	Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
BRODY	m	Christine what?
CASSIDY	?	Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one  ever died on me before.
BRODY	m	You picked her up on the ferry.
CASSIDY	?	I didn't know her.
BRODY	m	And nobody else saw her in the water?
CASSIDY	?	Somebody could've -- I was sort of  passed out.
BRODY	m	Think she might've run out on you?
CASSIDY	?	Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman  do that. I'm sure she drowned.
BRODY	m	You from around here?
CASSIDY	?	No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's  in Tuxedo, New York, though.
BRODY	m	You here for the summer?
CASSIDY	?	Some friends and me took a house.
BRODY	m	What d'you pay for a place just for  the summer?
CASSIDY	?	A thousand apiece, something like  that. There's five of us. And we  each kick in a hundred a week for  beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
BRODY	m	Pretty stiff.
BRODY	m	Maybe that's your girl.
CASSIDY	?	You can't make me look -- !
BRODY	m	If this is going to work, you've got  to keep current stuff out here, and  put 'closed' files in there. The  'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?
POLLY	f	This is in no order of importance,  Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity  Town Council on Aging this Monday  night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire  Inspector wants you to go over the  fireworks site with him before he  catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly,  you have a batch of calls about that  new Karate school.
POLLY	f	Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale,  Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's  those nine-year-olds from the school  practicing karate on all those nice  picket fences.
POLLY	f	It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away  in the night?
BRODY	m	Jesus, Santos.
POLLY	f	What's the matter?
BRODY	m	Polly, I want to know what water  recreation is on for today.
POLLY	f	Right this minute?
BRODY	m	Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed'  signs?
HENDRICKS	m	We never had any. What's the problem?
LOCAL MERCHANT	m	Glad I caught you. There's a city  truck with New Hampshire plates parked  right in front of my...
KEISEL	f	Wait-a-minute. Glasses, right?
KEISEL	f	Look at those fences! Little guys  about eight to ten years old. And  look at this!
KEISEL	f	They did that with their bare hands.
BRODY	m	Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?
LYNWOOD	m	Stuff's no good to me in August when  the Pilgrims come in June... Go on and help yourself to whatever  you need, Chief. Can you work the  register?
HENDRICKS	m	Polly told me to tell you there's a  scout troop in Avril Bay doing the  mile swim for their Merit Badges. I  couldn't call them in, there's no  phone out there.
BRODY	m	Get out of there � take these back  to the office and make up some 'Beach  Closed' signs, and let Polly do the  printing.
HENDRICKS	m	What's the matter with my printing?
VAUGHN	m	What have you got there, Lenny?
HENDRICKS	m	We had a shark attack at South Chop  this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta  batten down the beach.
VAUGHN	m	Who've you told this to, Lenny?
HENDRICKS	m	I just found out about it -- but  there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the  water a coupla miles down the coast  from where we found the girl. Avril  Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry  them off.
VAUGHN	m	Take my car, okay? You come with us, Lenny.
HENDRICKS	m	I've got all these signs here...
VAUGHN	m	C'mon, it'll give us time to think  about what they're going to say.
SCOUTMASTER	?	Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner.  Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts,  keep kicking...
VAUGHN	m	Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach  on your own authority?
BRODY	m	Do I need any more authority?
MEADOWS	m	Technically, you need the instruction  of a civic ordinance, or a special  meeting of the town selectmen...
VAUGHN	m	That's just going by the book. We're  just a little anxious that you're  rushing into something serious here.  This is your first summer.
BRODY	m	Now tell me something I don't know.
VAUGHN	m	All I'm saying is that Amity is a  summer town -- we need summer dollars,  and if they can't swim here, they'll  use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long  Island.
BRODY	m	So we should set out a smorgasbord?
MEADOWS	m	We're not even sure what it was.
BRODY	m	What else could've done that?
VAUGHN	m	Boat propeller?
DOCTOR	m	I think, possibly... sure. A boating  accident.
VAUGHN	m	Some weekend tramp accidentally goes  swimming too far, she's a little  drunk, a fishing boat comes along --
MEADOWS	m	Remember when Fred Ganz went  scalloping in his BVD's? He was going  to swim to New Bedford, he said.
MEADOWS	m	...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him  in his net...?
BRODY	m	Doctor, you're the one who told me  what it was!
DOCTOR	m	I was wrong. We'll have to amend the  report.
MEADOWS	m	We never had that kind of trouble  here.
VAUGHN	m	I don't think you can appreciate the  gut reaction people have to these  things.
BRODY	m	I was only reacting to what I was  told.
VAUGHN	m	It's all psychological, anyway. You  yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says  'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've  got a panic on our hands. I think we  all agree we don't need a panic this  close to the 4th of July.
BRODY	m	I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't  you make Hendricks Chief? His family's  been here since the Puritans -- half  this island are his cousins.
VAUGHN	m	Martin, we hired the best man we  could find.
VAUGHN	m	We need someone who isn't prejudiced  by old feuds or family ties, someone  who can referee things.
MEADOWS	m	You have our complete support.
VAUGHN	m	Now then. We've got a vandalism  problem we ought to talk about...
SHOPKEEPER	f	Hello, Mr. Quint.
QUINT	m	Four spools of Number 12 piano wire,  Okay? I ordered them.
SHOPKEEPER	f	Yessir, right here. What do those  fish do, eat this stuff?
QUINT	m	They choke on it.
SHOPKEEPER	f	Bye now.
MAX TAFT	m	Looks like another big season. Gets  worse every year.
MRS. TAFT	f	And none of them from the Island.  Just a lot of bother.
BRODY	m	What?
TAFT	m	Present company excepted, but off- islanders are a pain in the butt.  Pardon my French.
ELLEN	f	What about this kid? What if he were  born here. That make him an islander?
TAFT	m	Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an  oven, it don't make them muffins.
SEAN	m	I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!
MRS. KINTNER	f	Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you  think you're going?
ALEX	m	Water. Just once more, please?
MRS. KINTNER	f	Let me see your fingers --
MRS. KINTNER	f	They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes  more.
ELLEN	f	Do you want the boys to come in?  Honey, if you're worried...
BRODY	m	How's the water?
KEISEL	f	Too cold. I'm going in again Labor  Day. Hope we get this weather next  weekend.
ELLEN	f	You're very tight, y'know? Right there.
BRODY	m	Ow. He's gotta be more careful in the  water...
DOG MAN	m	Buster! Hey, Buster! Here boy! He continues to ad lib calling his  dog, but there's no answer, no dog  in the water.
A KID	m	Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes!
TOURIST	m	Something in the water. Right there!  Didn't anyone see it?
WOMAN	f	There's blood in the water.
ELLEN	f	What is it...?
BRODY	m	Michael! Sean! Out of the water.  Everybody out of the water! Michael!  Get out!
MRS. KINTNER	f	Alex! Alex? Alex...!
BRODY	m	Look, I've got to talk to her. This  isn't a contest we want the whole  country entering.
MEADOWS	m	I agree. If she's going to advertise,  I wouldn't recommend out-of-town  papers. Amity people could take care  of this.
BRODY	m	I'm responsible for public safety  around here...
VAUGHN	m	Then go out tomorrow and make sure  no one gets hurt. Everybody, could I have your  attention? Since this affects all of  us, I suggest we move into council  chambers, where there's more room...
VAUGHN	m	Well, here we all are; anyone have  any special questions?
DENHERDER	?	Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in  cash or check?
VAUGHN	m	That's private business between you  brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner. -- Chief --
BRODY	m	I'd like to tell you what we're doing  so far. These are some of the steps  I've taken as Chief of Police...
MEADOWS	m	What's going on with the beaches,  Chief?
BRODY	m	I'll get to that in a minute. First,  I plan to start our seasonal summer  help early, and to use shark spotters  on beaches open to the sea. I'd like  cooperation from local fishermen,  and I've also contacted the  Oceanographic Institute over on the  mainland.
VAUGHN	m	No need to involve outsiders in our  business, Martin.
WOMAN	f	Are you going to close the beaches?
BRODY	m	Larry and I have also decided to  close the beaches for a short time.
VAUGHN	m	Only 24 hours!
BRODY	m	I didn't agree to that!
MRS. TAFT	f	That official business could take  all summer!
MR. KEISEL	m	Maybe it's better to close.
QUINT	m	You all know me. You know what I do  for a living. I'll go out and get  this bird for you. He's a bad one  and it's not like goin' down the  pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods. This is a fish that can swallow  a man whole. A little shakin', a  little tenderizing and down ya' go. You gotta get this fellow and get  him quick. If you do, it'll bring a  lot of tourist business just to see  him and you've got your business  back on a paying basis. A shark of that size is no pleasure  and I value my neck at a hell of a  lot more'n 3,000 bucks. I'll find him for three. But I'll  kill him for ten.
QUINT	m	The bastard is costing you more'n  that every day. Do you wanna stay  alive and annee up the ten or play  it cheap and be on welfare next  winter. I'm gonna kill this thing... just a  matter of whether I do it now -- or  at the end of summer.
VAUGHN	m	Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the  Selectmen will take your offer under  advisement
ELLEN	f	Can you stand something to eat?
BRODY	m	Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
ELLEN	f	Mikey loves his birthday present.
BRODY	m	Where is he?
ELLEN	f	He's sitting in it.
ELLEN	f	Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty  with a double-knot.
BRODY	m	Son! -- Out of the water now!
MICHAEL	m	My boat's neat, dad!
BRODY	m	I want him out of the ocean.
ELLEN	f	It's three feet deep, Martin
BRODY	m	Michael! Come inside!
ELLEN	f	It's his birthday present, and you  closed the beach, Honey. I told him  not to go in the water after what  happened yesterday. I don't believe  he'll ever do it again.
BRODY	m	I told him not to go out until he  memorized the handbook and the safety  safety regulations, until he was  sure of himself...
ELLEN	f	You heard your father! Out right  now!
DENHERDER	?	You wanna call it a night after here?
CHARLIE	m	It's only two-thirty. What, are you  tired?
DENHERDER	?	Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind  three nibbles back.
DENHERDER	?	Leg of lamb this time?
CHARLIE	m	Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
DENHERDER	?	We're blowin' half the bounty on  bait --
DENHERDER	?	One more after this, then I'm going  home.
CHARLIE	m	Set?
CHARLIE	m	Tide's taking it right out.
DENHERDER	?	You do this all the time, right,  Charlie?
CHARLIE	m	Twenty years.
DENHERDER	?	I can't believe that people pay money  to go fishing. This is really dumb.  This isn't even relaxing... it's  just boring.
DENHERDER	?	Hey! What's this?
CHARLIE	m	Look at him take it!
DENHERDER	?	Do I set the goddam hook?
CHARLIE	m	Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
DENHERDER	?	CHARLIE! JUMP!
CHARLIE	m	Holy Jesus Christ!
DENHERDER	?	Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim!
HENDRICKS	m	...So then Denherder and Charlie sat  there trying to catch their breath,  and figuring out how to explain to  Charlie's wife what happened to her  freezer full of meat.
BRODY	m	That wasn't funny.
HENDRICKS	m	Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in  Field and Stream.
BRODY	m	Looks more like the readers of the  National Enquirer.
OUT-OF-TOWNER	?	You're charging me double the usual  rent! I didn't come up here all the  way from New Rochelle to be gouged  by some Yankee Cracker!
BOAT RENTAL MAN	m	Prices go up June First every year.  You want a nice cheap, leaky boat,  you go down to the Hamptons. Right, Chief?
BRODY	m	Hey! You know how many men that's  supposed to hold?
MAN IN BOAT	m	Whatever's safe, right?
BRODY	m	What you got ain't safe. You take  some guys off or you don't go out.
HOOPER	m	Hello.
GARDNER	m	Hello, back.
BRODY	m	You going out too, Ben?
GARDNER	m	Might give it a try. That three  thousand bounty beats working for a  living. We ready?
BRODY	m	Just back up! No, the other way! Cut  it to your left! Your other left!  The big boat, your front end is out  way too far. Little boat, stay still!
SKIPPER 1	m	Dammit, a vessel under sail has the  right of way!
SKIPPER 2	m	You schmuck, you ain't under sail,  you're goddam drifting!
HOOPER	m	Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well,  scull it out!
SAILBOAT SKIPPER	m	Tell that stinkpotter to belay!
MOTORBOAT SKIPPER	m	Tell that ragsetter I'm going to  poke him in the snoot!
HOOPER	m	Just cast off in turn and make for  the channel, OK?
BRODY	m	Thanks.
HOOPER	m	Excuse me, I wonder if you could  tell me...
HOOPER	m	Is that dynamite?
BRODY	m	If that's dynamite, give it here, or  don't leave port.
MAN	m	Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. Sharks  like fireworks, it attracts them.
BRODY	m	Hand it over.
HOOPER	m	There's a fantail launch out there  that won't make it beyond the  breakwater.
BRODY	m	You're tellin' me. I swear, this  town has gone crazy.
HOOPER	m	Officer, I wonder if you could tell  me where I could find Chief Brody?
BRODY	m	Who are you?
HOOPER	m	Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the  Oceanographic Institute.
PRATT	m	Well, get over there! He ain't caught  it yet!
PRATT	m	Hand me that pole! Quick!
HARRY	m	Beat it! I hooked him!
PRATT	m	How's the family, Harry? Go on and do it!
MAN WITH GAFF	m	We split down the middle?
HARRY	m	Let go my shark!
BRODY	m	Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.
HOOPER	m	Victim One, identified as Christine  Watkins, female Caucasian...
HOOPER	m	...height and weight may only be  estimated from partial remains. Torso  severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated  with no major organs remaining. May  I have a drink of water? Right arm  severed above the elbow with massive  tissue loss from upper musculature.  Portions of denuded bone remaining. -- did you notify the coast guard?
BRODY	m	No, it was local jurisdiction.
HOOPER	m	Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum  and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions.  Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy  feeding pattern of large squali,  possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or  isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss  and post-mortem erosion of bite  surfaces prevent detailed analysis;  however, teeth and jaws of the  attacking squali must be considered  above average for these waters. -- Did you go out in a boat and look  around?
BRODY	m	No, we just checked the beach...
HOOPER	m	It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a  boat propeller, or a coral reef, or  Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It  was a shark.
MEADOWS	m	Ginny, get this out on the state  wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New  York. Have one of them pick it up  for the national and call Dave Axelrod  in New York and tell him this is  from me and he owes me one... let's  get a picture.
HOOPER	m	Well, if one man can catch a fish in  50 days, then I guess 50 of these  bozos can catch a fish in one day --  beginner's luck.
BRODY	m	You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch  this?
MEADOWS	m	Okay, everybody, I want to get a  picture for the paper -- could  everyone clear out of the way?
MEADOWS	m	Could you get out of the shot, young  man?
HOOPER	m	Who, me? Okay...
BRODY	m	Larry, if you'd see these clowns  leave, you'd never believe they'd  come back with anything. But they  got him!
VAUGHN	m	That's good. That's real good. Ben  Meadows getting pictures for the  paper.
BRODY	m	Sure he is.
HOOPER	m	It's a tiger shark. Very rare in  these waters, and definitely a  maneater.
VAUGHN	m	Who's that young man?
BRODY	m	Matt Hooper, the specialist they  send down from the Oceanographic  Institute.
VAUGHN	m	I think we all owe a debt of gratitude  to these men for catching this  monster.
PRATT	m	Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's  that?
GAFFER	m	Teeth are teeth, right?
HOOPER	m	I didn't say this wasn't the shark,  I just said I wasn't sure this was  the one...
BRODY	m	What d'ya mean?
HOOPER	m	There are hundreds of different kinds  of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads,  white-tips... any one of them could've  attacked. Look -- shark digestion is  slow. We could open this one up, and  find whatever he's been eating is  still inside.
VAUGHN	m	That's disgusting! This is the  largest, meanest, most vicious shark  ever landed off Amity Island, and a  known maneater!
HOOPER	m	Let's just cut him open and see what's  inside...
BRODY	m	Why not, Larry? We could get a  positive confirmation that way.
VAUGHN	m	Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't  the time or the place to do some  kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish.  Ben... do you have all the pictures you  need?
MEADOWS	m	Plenty.
HOOPER	m	Wait a minute...
VAUGHN	m	I am not going to stand here and  watch this fish cut open and see  some kid fall out on the dock.  Besides...
VAUGHN	m	Chief, I'll take responsibility for  this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch  down before he stinks up the whole  island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl  take him out and dump him right in  the drink.
MRS. KINTNER	f	Chief Brody?
MRS. KINTNER	f	My Alex was a beautiful little boy  and you killed him. Did you know  that? You knew there was a shark out  there. You knew a girl got killed  here last week. I just found that  out. But you knew. You knew it was  dangerous, but you let people go  swimming anyway. You knew all those  things, and still my boy is dead now  and there's nothing you can do about  that. My boy is dead. I wanted you  to know that.
VAUGHN	m	I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick,  terrible state.
HOOPER	m	Look, maybe this is the wrong time  to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
BRODY	m	She's right.
VAUGHN	m	Let's all get out of here, this place  stinks.
BRODY	m	I'm going home.
BRODY	m	C'mere and give Daddy a kiss.
SEAN	m	Why?
BRODY	m	Because he needs it.
HOOPER	m	Martin Brody residence?
HOOPER	m	Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband  is here, I'd like to talk to him.
ELLEN	f	So would I. Come on in.
ELLEN	f	Would you like something? Some coffee?
HOOPER	m	Is anyone having this...?
HOOPER	m	Dynamite! How was your day...?
BRODY	m	Swell.
HOOPER	m	Here... one red, one white.
HOOPER	m	Ummm. Really good.
ELLEN	f	My husband tells me you're in sharks.
HOOPER	m	I wouldn't put it that way. But I  love sharks.
ELLEN	f	You love sharks?
HOOPER	m	I do. But you've still got a problem here,  there's a shark just off the island  somewhere.
BRODY	m	How come you have to tell them that?
ELLEN	f	Excuse me, but what are you talking  about? Didn't they catch the shark  this afternoon? It was on the Cape  station news.
HOOPER	m	They caught a shark, not the shark.  Big difference. I could've proved it  this afternoon, by cutting that one  open and examining his stomach  contents. Also, his bite was too  small.
HOOPER	m	I was lucky to find that in town --  it's an estate bottled vintage year...
HOOPER	m	We ought to let it breathe...  Whatever.
BRODY	m	Let's all have a drink.
BRODY	m	You too, sweetheart...
ELLEN	f	Thank you.
HOOPER	m	Here's to your husband, the only  other rational man on the island.  Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone,  and he'll be the only one.
ELLEN	f	You're leaving?
HOOPER	m	Going out on the 'Aurora.'
ELLEN	f	Is that a boat?
HOOPER	m	Is it! The best-funded research  expedition to ever study the shark...  around the world in 18 months.
ELLEN	f	Like those Cousteau specials on  television? I think it's for the  kids, but I love them.
HOOPER	m	Better than Cousteau, or Compagno  with computers, telemetry, Defense  Department funding...
ELLEN	f	I saw a show with sea otters, and a  big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made  me promise to get him one. Will you  live on the boat?
HOOPER	m	Yep.
ELLEN	f	Martin hates boats. Hates the water.  On the ferry to the mainland, he  sits in the car the whole way over.  He's got this childhood thing, there's  a clinical word for it.
BRODY	m	Drowning. Lemme ask you something.  Is it true most attacks take place  in three feet of water, around 10  feet from the beach?
HOOPER	m	Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark  they caught...
BRODY	m	Something else. Do most attacks go  unreported?
HOOPER	m	About half of them. A lot of 'missing  swimmers' are really shark victims.
BRODY	m	There's a kind of a lone shark,  called, uh...
HOOPER	m	Rogue?
BRODY	m	Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where  there's food and hangs out there as  long as the food supply lasts?
HOOPER	m	It's called Territoriality. It's a  theory.
BRODY	m	And before 1900, when people first  starting swimming for recreation,  before public bathing and resorts,  there were very few shark attacks,  cause sharks didn't know what they  were missing?
HOOPER	m	You could say that.
BRODY	m	Why don't we have one more drink,  you and I, and then we go down and  cut open that old shark and see for  sure what's inside him, or not.
ELLEN	f	Can you do that?
BRODY	m	I am Chief of Police. I can do  anything I want. You want to come?
HOOPER	m	I'm flattered you should ask.
HOOPER	m	...And it was Dartmouth Winter  weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen,  and I was her date; then she got  into the fact that her family had  more money than my family, and she  was right -- her great-grandfather  was in mining, and my ancestors were  Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up  and I went home with some beatnik  from Sarah Lawrence.
BRODY	m	What stinks so bad?
HOOPER	m	Our friend, the shark.
HOOPER	m	We always had a summer place on the  water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I  figured I'd major in something I  knew about. Oceanography, marine  biology. It was that, or design racing  yachts like my older brother. Hmmm.  He we go. Up the old alimentary canal.  Hold the light.
HOOPER	m	We open the abdominal cavity and  check the digestive tract. Simple.
BRODY	m	What's that?
HOOPER	m	Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap  bag... a paint can... aha!
BRODY	m	What? What?!
HOOPER	m	Just as I thought. He drifted up  here with the Gulf Stream, from  southern waters.
BRODY	m	How can you tell?
HOOPER	m	Florida license plate.
BRODY	m	He ate a car?
HOOPER	m	No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage  cans of the ocean. They eat anything.  But this one didn't eat any people.  There's nothing here...
HOOPER	m	...Nothing.
BRODY	m	What do we do?
HOOPER	m	If you're looking for a shark, you  don't look on land. You go out and  chum for him.
BRODY	m	Chum?
HOOPER	m	Only one sure way to find him --  offer him a little something to eat.  Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish,  anything. They can sense it miles  away. If he's out there, we might be  able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night  feeders...
HOOPER	m	That's the Cape Light -- we're on  the stretch where he's feeding, if  he's still here.
BRODY	m	What is all this stuff?
HOOPER	m	Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar,  closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft --  RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
BRODY	m	Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
HOOPER	m	Sometimes. Look here -- something big, probably  a school of mackerel clumped together.  And staying right with us.
BRODY	m	Where'd you get all this?
HOOPER	m	I Bought it.  Both sets of  grandparents set up trust funds for  me; stocks went up, so I don't have  to touch my principal.
BRODY	m	You're at the Institute full time?  Or do you have a job?
HOOPER	m	It is a job. I'm not fooling around  like some amateur. It's my life!
BRODY	m	We gotta get back soon...
BRODY	m	Hey!
BRODY	m	What the hell?
BRODY	m	That's Ben Gardner's boat! It's the  Flicka! Ben? Ben!
BRODY	m	What happened?
HOOPER	m	I want to check something. Hold my  feet.
BRODY	m	Don't they have lifejackets or  something? An extra boat?
HOOPER	m	They must've hit something.
HOOPER	m	He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm  going down to take a look at his  hull.
BRODY	m	Why don't we just tow it in?
HOOPER	m	We will. There's something I've got  to find out.
BRODY	m	Be careful, for chrissake.
BRODY	m	You all right?
HOOPER	m	A White! A Great White, I found a  tooth buried in the hull. He must've  attacked... I knew it... Gardner's  dead in there. I didn't see the  mate...
BRODY	m	No shark did that to a boat!
HOOPER	m	Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd  believe it! We're not talking about  a shark, we're talking about a Shark!
BRODY	m	There is a kind of shark called a  Great White Shark that every expert  in the world agrees is a maneater.
HOOPER	m	You're situation here suggests that  a Great White has staked out a claim  in the waters around Amity Island,  and that he will continue to feed  here as long as there is food in the  water.
BRODY	m	There's no limits to where he can  strike, and we've had three attacks  and two deaths in the past few days.  It happened like this before, in  1916, when a Great White killed five  swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long  Island.
HOOPER	m	A shark's attack is stimulated by  the kind of splashing and activity  that occurs whenever humans go  swimming -- you can't avoid it!
BRODY	m	A 4th of July beach is like ringing  a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
HOOPER	m	I just pulled a shark tooth the size  of a shot glass out of the hull of a  wrecked boat out there.
BRODY	m	We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry;  he was dead and his boat was all  chewed up.
VAUGHN	m	Is that tooth here? Did anyone see  it?
VAUGHN	m	What kind of a shark did you say it  was?
HOOPER	m	Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
VAUGHN	m	Well, I'm not going to commit economic  suicide on that flimsy evidence. We  depend on the summer people for our  lives, and if our beaches are closed,  then we're all finished.
BRODY	m	We have got to close the beaches. We  have got to get someone to kill the  shark, we need non-corrosive mesh  netting, we need scientific support...  It's gonna cost money just to keep  the nuts out and save what we have.
VAUGHN	m	I don't thing either of you is  familiar with our problems...
HOOPER	m	I'm familiar with the fact that you  are going to ignore this thing until  it swims up and bites you on the  ass! There are only two ways to solve  this thing: you can kill it, or you  can cut off its food supply...
BRODY	m	That means closing the beaches.
VAUGHN	m	Come here, I want to show you  something.
VAUGHN	m	Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a  deliberate mutilation of a public  service message! I want those little  paint-happy bastards caught and hung  up by their baby Buster Browns!
HOOPER	m	That's it! I'm standing here arguing  with a guy who can't wait to be a  hot lunch. Goodbye.
BRODY	m	Wait a minute! I need you.
HOOPER	m	Out there is a Perfect Engine, an  Eating Machine that is a miracle of  evolution -- it swims and eats and  that's all. Look at that! Those  proportions are correct. I know sharks.
VAUGHN	m	You'd love to prove that. Getting  your name in the National Geographic.
BRODY	m	Larry, we can re-open the beaches in  August.
VAUGHN	m	August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July,  and we are going to open for business.   It's going to be our best summer in  years. If you're so concerned about  the beaches, you two, you do whatever  you have to to keep them safe, but  with you or without you, the beaches  stay open this weekend.
OFFICER	m	Martin Brody? I'll need your signature here...  here... and here.
BRODY	m	What is this?
OFFICER	m	Authorization for direct payment of  flight expenses not directly connected  to a normal mission of this command. You pay for the gas.
BRODY	m	I signed on the wrong line...
OFFICER	m	Just erase your signature and initial  your erasure.
BRODY	m	I want to thank you guys from local  agencies for cooperating, and I hope  we won't actually be needing your  services. But I'm glad to have you  here.
ENSIGN	m	I want to get our lines and repellent  out, so we better shove off.
BRODY	m	We're all on one channel, so let's  keep radio traffic to a minimum,  okay?
HOOPER	m	I hope we get some more help.
BRODY	m	I wish it would rain...
TV DIRECTOR	m	Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2.  1. Roll.
ANNOUNCER	f	...and with me is the Mayor of Amity,  Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how  about those rumors?
VAUGHN	m	How about them indeed. I'm pleased  and happy to repeat the news that we  have, in fact, caught and killed a  large predator that supposedly injured  some bathers here. As you can see,  it's a beautiful day, the beaches  are open, and the folks here are  having a wonderful time. Amity,  y'know, means 'Friendship.'
ANNOUNCER	f	Also here today is a Marine Biologist  and Research Fellow from the  Oceanographic Institute, Matthew  Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard?
HOOPER	m	What I've heard and what I've seen  are two different things. I believe  there is a large Great White Shark --  Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters  off this very beach, that he has  killed and that he will kill again...
ANNOUNCER	f	And there you have it -- two different  opinions, by men of good will. The  holiday crowd here at Amity seems to  be making up its own mind...
BRODY	m	I'm sorry, I just don't have the  time.
TV DIRECTOR	m	Recue the machines. 2, pan off the  Chief and show me some tits and ass.  1, get me some cute kids. 3... see  if you got a shot at the water.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR	m	Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45  seconds. That's equal time, right?
DIRECTOR	m	Right. Jerry, come on in and look at this. Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1.
ANNOUNCER	f	Amity Island is famed for its clear  air and white sand beaches. But a  cloud appeared...
ANNOUNCER	f	Look at that shine on my nose. It's  a beacon.
DIRECTOR	m	Close enough for remote.
VAUGHN	m	...I'm pleased and happy...
DIRECTOR	m	Think we ought to stick around?
ANNOUNCER	f	What else you got?
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR	m	Teachers' strike downtown.
CAMERAMAN'S VOICE	m	Christenson, this is Al. Union says  time for Engineering Five.
DIRECTOR	m	That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.
VAUGHN	m	Why don't you get in the water?
SELECTMAN	m	I don't want to wash off my suntan  lotion. I'll get a burn...
VAUGHN	m	Nobody's going in!
WOMAN	f	Is there nobody going in? What a  shame. Arthur, should I be going in?
ARTHUR	m	If you'd like.
ARTHUR	m	It's very nice. Not too cold... Quite  refreshing... Very pleasant....
ARTHUR	m	No sharks, m'lady.
WOMAN	f	This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to  come back to this very spot. Will  you make a note of where we are?
HENDRICKS	m	Anything? Thought I saw a shadow.  Over.
COPTER SPOTTER	m	Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over.
HENDRICKS	m	False alarm. Must be this glare.
VOICES	m	Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up  to your knees, yeah -- So come with  me -- I'll go again.
MEADOWS	m	Beautiful day, Chief!
BRODY	m	Hey Mikey -- !
BRODY	m	You're not going to the ocean with  that, are you son?
MICHAEL	m	I'm all checked out for light surf  and look at it.
BRODY	m	Do me this favor just once. Use the  ponds.
MICHAEL	m	Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
BRODY	m	Just a favor for your old man.
MICHAEL	m	Sure, Dad.
COPTER SPOTTER	m	Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four!
HENDRICKS	m	Where -- ?
COPTER SPOTTER	m	Went under your -- There!
SONAR OPERATOR	m	Jesus Christ -- Shark!
BRODY	m	Everybody out! Out of the water,  please -- leave the water, please --
BRODY	m	No whistles! No whistles!
TV DIRECTOR	m	Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody  get that!
THE VICTIM	m	It's no good. I'm dead...
HOOPER	m	Block the estuary! The estuary!
BRODY	m	He's in shock. Get blankets!
NURSE	f	The doctor said it's okay -- mild  shock. He can come home in the  morning.
ELLEN	f	Hey, big guy -- you want anything  from home?
MICHAEL	m	My cars. And a comic book.
BRODY	m	Here -- Take him home.
ELLEN	f	Home... New York?
BRODY	m	No. Home here.
BRODY	m	Got a pen on you?
VAUGHN	m	Why?
BRODY	m	There's only one thing you're good  for anymore -- signing a damn voucher.  Here. It's an authorization to employ  a contractor.
VAUGHN	m	I don't know if I can do that without  a...
BRODY	m	I'm going to hire Quint to kill the  fish. I want to see that shark dead.
VAUGHN	m	Maybe we can save August...
BRODY	m	Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the  mayor of Shark City. You wanted to  keep the beaches open. What happens  when the town finds out about that?
VAUGHN	m	I was acting in the town's best  interests...
BRODY	m	The best interest in this town would  be to see that fish belly-up in the  water with a hole in his head. You  do the right thing. You authorize  me. Right there. Whatever it costs.
VAUGHN	m	My kids were on that beach...
BRODY	m	Just sign it, Larry.
BRODY	m	This has got to be one big  violation...
HOOPER	m	This is quite a place.
QUINT'S VOICE	m	Keep your hands off my stuff.
QUINT	m	Did you bring a check?
BRODY	m	What?
QUINT	m	Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake  and a promise?
BRODY	m	I'm authorized by the township of  Amity to hire you as an independent  contractor. We'll meet your price.
QUINT	m	And my regular daily rate -- $200,  whether we catch him or not.
BRODY	m	You got it.
QUINT	m	And incidental damages, if any...
BRODY	m	You got it.
QUINT	m	And you get the Mayor off my back  with this zoning crap. Nobody tells  me how to run my property.
BRODY	m	You got it.
QUINT	m	And, uh, a case of apricot brandy  and you buy the lunch.
BRODY	m	Two cases. And dinner when you land.
QUINT	m	Try some of this. I made it myself.
QUINT	m	Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged  women.
HERSCHEL	m	Mr. Quint...
HERSCHEL	m	I'm not goin'. No sir.
QUINT	m	You want to get paid, you go.
HERSCHEL	m	Forget the money. You can't pay me  enough. I ain't crazy. I worked some  big mean fish with you, but I ain't  goin' on this one.
QUINT	m	This is the last time I hear from  you. I don't want anyone with piss  for blood on my vessel. Put that  blackfish on board, pump the bilges,  and top off the fuel tanks, and finish  up in the morning. Then you're on  the beach.
HOOPER	m	You're going to need an extra hand...
BRODY	m	This is Matt Hooper...
QUINT	m	I know who he is...
BRODY	m	He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
HOOPER	m	I've been to sea since I was 12.  I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
QUINT	m	Transplants?
HOOPER	m	-- and an America's Cup Trials...
QUINT	m	I'm not talking about day sailing or  pleasure boating. I'm talking about  working for a living. Sharking.
HOOPER	m	And I'm not talking about hooking  some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm  talking about a Great White.
QUINT	m	Are you now. I know about porkers in  the water -- Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
HOOPER	m	I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
QUINT	m	Let me see your hands...
QUINT	m	Ha. City hands. You been counting  money. If you had a $5000 net and  $2000 worth of fish in it, and along  comes Mr. White, and makes it look  like a kiddy scissors class has gone  to work on it and made paper dolls.  If you'd ever worked for a living,  you'd know what that means.
HOOPER	m	Look, I don't need to hear any of  this working class hero crap. Some  party boat skipper who's killed a  few sharks...
BRODY	m	Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to  have to listen to this while we're  out there...
QUINT	m	What do you mean 'We...?'
BRODY	m	It's my charter. My party.
QUINT	m	All right, Commissioner. But when  we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate  and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast.
BRODY	m	You got it.
QUINT	m	5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number  14's, straight gaff, flying gaffs,  tail rope, eye splice, M-1, 20 clips,  pliers, irons...
HOOPER	m	Powerhead, CO2 darts, hypo, regulator,  tanks, depth gauge, camera, extra  magazines, cage...
ASSISTANT	m	You got everything you asked for?
HOOPER	m	All of it. And thank Dr. Miro for  me. And tell Borack I'll catch up  with them in New Zealand.
ASSISTANT	m	This is actually a killing expedition?
HOOPER	m	An eye for an eye, you know.
QUINT	m	Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this  gear or you want me to use it for  ballast? It ain't good for much but  bait.
HOOPER	m	I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
QUINT	m	Hello, Junior. What are you? Some  kind of half-assed astronaut? Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every  little squirt wanted to be a harpooner  or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have  there -- a portable shower?
HOOPER	m	Anti-Shark cage.
QUINT	m	Who's inside, you or the shark?
QUINT	m	You're in the cage? The cage is in the water? The shark is in the water too? You're in the water with the shark.
HOOPER	m	Comin' aboard...
ELLEN	f	Did you take your dramamine? Here.
QUINT	m	Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'.
ELLEN	f	Is that him?
BRODY	m	Colorful, isn't he?
ELLEN	f	You going to be all right?
BRODY	m	Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive  this.
ELLEN	f	I'll see you back soon. There's an  extra pair of glasses in your black  socks, and there's some suntan lotion  and blistex in your kit.
QUINT	m	'Here is the body of Mary Lee. For  15 years she kept her virginity. Not  a bad record for this vicinity.'
BRODY	m	Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
ELLEN	f	What'll I tell the kids?
BRODY	m	Tell 'em I went fishin'!
QUINT	m	Cast off the bow line! Now your stern!
QUINT	m	Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port,  Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a  staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a  rope, it's a line, and if you don't  get it right... I'll throw your ass through that  little round window.
QUINT	m	Now hear this. You're aboard the  fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her  Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner.  You'll jump when I holler. We're  doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't  got time to watch you birds get hooks  in your ass and fall overboard. Ship  with me, and you'll do all right.  Cross me, and I'll slap you upside  your heads. Now -- if you boys are  ready -- let's go fishin'.
QUINT	m	Here's something for you...
QUINT	m	These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat  their own guts.
QUINT	m	Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em  where you got it!
HOOPER	m	What's that supposed to prove?
QUINT	m	Just a little appetizer. I want our  porker to know we're serving. I want  to put some iron into that big yap...
QUINT	m	Keep that chum line going -- we've  got five good miles. Don't break it.
BRODY	m	Who's driving the boat?
QUINT	m	Nobody. We're drifting with the  current.
HOOPER	m	Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
QUINT	m	Hell, in the old days we went out  with good charts, good sounding lead,  and a damn good compass. Nowadays,  these kids are afraid to go out  without depth finders, radar, radio,  electric toothbrush, every stupid  thing...
QUINT	m	Get a fresh barrel.
HOOPER	m	Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw  around with one of those and Boom!  Careful, huh?
QUINT	m	Real fine stuff but it won't mean a  thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he  didn't go to schools in electronics.  He was born with what he does best.  Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course  he might eat this stuff, but then  I've seen him eat a rocking chair,  too. Next time, ask me.
HOOPER	m	That's pilot whale, isn't it?
QUINT	m	It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do  you thing? You're closer to the  situation.
BRODY	m	Why are we way out here, when the  shark's back there?
QUINT	m	...'cause this is where he lives.  You gotta think like they do.
HOOPER	m	Easy for you -- they got a brain the  size of a radish.
QUINT	m	Now if he weren't around, we'd of  hooked something else by now, wouldn't  we? But he scared 'em all away. Big  lonesome son of a bitch...
QUINT	m	-- he'll gulp it down now... Hooooooo!
BRODY	m	You got it?
QUINT	m	Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn -- he's taking  too much line! Wet my reel, quick!
QUINT	m	Starboard, for Chris'sake --
QUINT	m	Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
HOOPER	m	Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel  boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh,  Jim Boy.
QUINT	m	Neutral! Where the hell is he going?
QUINT	m	Oh, this ain't foolin' me -- Sure -- try it!
QUINT	m	Makin' believe it's easy now.
QUINT	m	Gettin' ready to run again -- no?  No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on! Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
HOOPER	m	Let it go, don't waste your time.
QUINT	m	Down here, Hooper!
HOOPER	m	I don't know what it is, but it's  not a shark.
QUINT	m	Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in  the lab, but out here you're just  supercargo, and you'll do as I say,  or you can take your gear and  backstroke home. Now get down here!
BRODY	m	The wire's showing!
QUINT	m	Unbuckle me -- fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal,  this one... they never --
HOOPER	m	It's too wild, too erratic. It's a  marlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish.
QUINT	m	Watch your hands -- Grab onto this!
QUINT	m	A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't  ever tell me my business again. Get  back up on the bridge.
HOOPER	m	I'm okay...
QUINT	m	Fasten the pole.
BRODY	m	What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
QUINT	m	Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
BRODY	m	How -- if they're gonna keep on  breaking?
QUINT	m	What I do is trick him to the surface,  got that? Then I can jab him,  understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if  he's a catfish, like everyone else  does?
QUINT	m	Over there!
HOOPER	m	What do you see?
QUINT	m	At least you handle the boat all  right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
HOOPER	m	20 feet, if it's an inch...
QUINT	m	25 feet. And three tons of him there.
QUINT	m	I never saw one that big.
BRODY	m	What do we do? Get some help? Radio  in?
BRODY	m	How're we gonna handle this?
HOOPER	m	There's a formula! Girth, about 150  inches, squared, divide by 800 --  son of a bitch, they are not going  to believe this! -- divide by 2000...  three tons! You're right, you old fart! Three  tons!
RADIO VOICE	m	Amity Point Light Station to Orca.  This is Amity Point Light Station,  to Orca...
QUINT	m	Orca here.
RADIO VOICE	m	I have Mrs. Martin Brody here...
QUINT	m	Put her on.
ELLEN'S VOICE	m	...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello,  Martin?
QUINT	m	This is Quint, Missus.
ELLEN'S VOICE	m	I just wanted to know if you were  all right... the Coast Guard let me  use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
QUINT	m	He's busy.
ELLEN'S VOICE	m	Well... is everything all right?
QUINT	m	Just fine, Missus. We'll be back  soon. Everything's fine. We haven't  seen anything yet. Orca out.
HOOPER	m	Damn it! I need something in the  foreground to give it some scale.  Martin! Stand here! No, to your left!
QUINT	m	Here. Rig this to the forward keg up  there.
QUINT	m	Get up there and steer her. Follow  my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've  got to get a clean shot at that  porker's head.
QUINT	m	Hurry up, rig the line!
QUINT	m	Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady  now...
QUINT	m	The line, man, the line!
QUINT	m	Get clear, damn you!
HOOPER	m	Clear!
QUINT	m	Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!
QUINT	m	Now you've done it, you piss-ant.  Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to  my gear. Let the bastard fight the  keg for a while. He can't stay down  with that on.
HOOPER	m	Rig another keg! I'm bringing her  around!
HOOPER	m	God damn it! We had him! I'm coming about!
BRODY	m	Why don't we go in? Get another crack  at him tomorrow.
QUINT	m	We got a barrel on him. We can't  lose him. We stay out here until we  find him.
BRODY	m	Let's call in -- we can radio and  have a big boat here in an hour...
QUINT	m	You hired me, remember? It's my  $10,000. It's my shark...
QUINT	m	He's up again.
QUINT	m	That's not so bad. Look at this:  ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans,  in Boston, where some sunovabitch  winged me upside the head with a  spittoon.
HOOPER	m	Look here. Steve Kaplan bit me during recess.
QUINT	m	Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay  from taking my head off.
HOOPER	m	Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet  suit.
QUINT	m	Face and head scars come from amateur  amusements in the bar room. This  love line here... ...that's from some crazy Frenchie  come after me with a knife. I caught  him with a good right hand right in  the snot locker and laid him amongst  the sweetpeas.
HOOPER	m	Ever see one like this?
HOOPER	m	Bull shark scraped me while I was  taking samples...
QUINT	m	Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
QUINT	m	Slammed with a thresher's tail. Look  just like somebody caressed me with  a nutmeg grater...
HOOPER	m	I'll drink to your leg.
QUINT	m	And I'll drink to yours.
QUINT	m	Wait a minute, young fella. Look.  Just look. Don't touch...
QUINT	m	...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope  and onto the deck. You don't get  bitten by one of those bastards but  twice -- your first and your last.
HOOPER	m	I think I can top that, Mister...
HOOPER	m	Gimme a hand, here. I got something  to show you --
HOOPER	m	There. Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit  broke my heart. Let's drink to Mary  Ellen.
QUINT	m	And here's to the ladies. And here's  to their sisters; I'd rather one  Miss than a shipload of Misters.
QUINT	m	Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
BRODY	m	C'mon. Middle appendix --
QUINT	m	I almost had 'im.
BRODY	m	What's that one, there?
QUINT	m	Tattoo. Had it taken off.
HOOPER	m	Don't tell me -- 'Death Before  Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.'  Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon --  what?
QUINT	m	'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
BRODY	m	What's that, a ship?
HOOPER	m	You were on the Indianapolis? In  '45? Jesus...
QUINT	m	Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis. June 29th, 1945, three and a half  minutes past midnight, two torpedoes  from a Japanese submarine slammed  into our side. Two or three. We was  still under sealed orders after  deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima  bomb...we was goin' back across the  Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn  near eleven hundred men went over  the side. The life boats was lashed  down so tight to make the bomb run  we couldn't cut a single one adrift.  Not one. And there was no rafts.  None. That vessel sank in twelve  minutes. Yes, that's all she took.  We didn't see the first shark till  we'd been in the water about an hour.  A thirteen-footer near enough. A  blue. You measure that by judgin'  the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't  know... of course the Captain knew...I  guess some officers knew... was the  bomb mission had been so secret, no  distress signals was sent. What the  men didn't know was that they wouldn't  even list us as overdue for a week.  Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't  an officer -- just as well perhaps.  So some of us were dead already --  in the water -- just hangin' limp in  our lifejackets. And several already  bleedin'. And the three hundred or  so laying on the bottom of the ocean.  As the light went, the sharks came  crusin'. We formed tight groups --  somewhat like squares in an old battle --  You know what I mean -- so that when  one come close, the man nearest would  yell and shout and pound the water  and sometimes it worked and the fish  turned away, but other times that  shark would seem to look right at a  man -- right into his eyes -- and in  spite of all shoutin' and poundin'  you'd hear that terrible high  screamin' and the ocean would go  red, then churn up as they ripped  him.  Then we'd reform our little  squares. By the first dawn the sharks  had taken more than a hundred. Hard  for me to count but more than a  hundred. I don't know how many sharks.  Maybe a thousand. I do know they  averaged six men an hour. All kinds --  blues, makos, tigers. All kinds. In the middle of the second day,  some of us started to go crazy from  the thirst. One fella cried out he  saw a river, another claimed he saw  a waterfall, some started to drink  the ocean and choked on it, and some  left our little groups -- our little  squares -- and swam off alone lookin'  for islands and the sharks always  took them right away. It was mainly  the young fellas that did that --  the older ones stayed where they  was. That second day -- my life jacket  rubbed me raw and that was more blood  in the water. Oh my. On Thursday  morning I bumped up against a friend  of mine -- Herbie Robinson from  Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it  seemed he was asleep but when I  reached over to waken him, he bobbed  in the water and I saw his body upend  because he'd been bitten in half  beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it  went on -- bombers high overhead but  nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides,  sharks, and all this goin' crazy and  dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day,  Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung  around and came in low. Yes. He did  that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And  early evenin', a big fat PBY come  down out of the sky and began the  pickup.  That was when I was most  frightened of all -- while I was  waitin' for my turn. Just two and a  half hours short of five days and  five nights when they got to me and  took me up. Eleven hundred of us  went into that ocean -- three hundred  and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen  hundred and forty five. June the  29th. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
BRODY	m	What the hell?
HOOPER	m	It's a whale out there.
QUINT	m	Show me the way to go home... I'm  tired and I want to go to bed. I had  a little drink about an hour ago,  and it went right to my head.
QUINT	m	Start the engines.
QUINT	m	He's busting the shaft! Start the  pump!
BRODY	m	Where...?
QUINT	m	The bilge pumps. There --
QUINT	m	Cut the engines!
HOOPER	m	Rudder bearings?
QUINT	m	Get up forward! Watch for him!
QUINT	m	Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hooper!
QUINT	m	Nobody sleeps! Nobody.
QUINT	m	Show me the way to go home... I'm  tired and I want to go to bed.
QUINT	m	More left rudder! More! Left hand  down now, Chief.
HOOPER	m	Lemme get a better angle on it. Now.
QUINT	m	He's bent the housing. You can hear  it.
BRODY	m	The barrel!
QUINT	m	It's him.
QUINT	m	He's under the keg. Careful --
QUINT	m	Easy -- just want to goose him up.  The minute he runs, drop it or you'll  lose your hands.
QUINT	m	Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's  been doin'.
BRODY	m	Shark! Starboard!
QUINT	m	Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us! Start the engine!
QUINT	m	Easy! It'll tear right out!
HOOPER	m	The shaft is giving.
BRODY	m	That's it! Radio in for help!
QUINT	m	Shut up! Just pump her out!
BRODY	m	Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a  call.
QUINT	m	Beg your pardon --
QUINT	m	Duty first and pleasure after --
QUINT	m	Excuse me!
BRODY	m	Some great idea! Now where are we?   Some goddamn skipper you are. You're  certifiable, y'know that? You're a  real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!
HOOPER	m	Coming right to us!
QUINT	m	No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead,  he'll hit us head on -- Slower! Throttle back ---
QUINT	m	Hard to port!
QUINT	m	Try shakin' that out!
BRODY	m	Did you get him in the head?
QUINT	m	No! No! No! Swing around! After him!
QUINT	m	More gas... go to half! Get me right  alongside him --
HOOPER	m	We can't rev it up this high --
QUINT	m	Watch it!
QUINT	m	Atta boy!
QUINT	m	Take two, they're small!
HOOPER	m	Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy  on his own blood already!
BRODY	m	I can't stand here doing nothing!
QUINT	m	Order in the court!
QUINT	m	Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble  with two!
QUINT	m	Grab yourselves a couple of poles!
QUINT	m	Get ready! Now snag 'em!
QUINT	m	Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto  the transom -- free ride.
QUINT	m	Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a  little reverse for you!
QUINT	m	Haul in -- watch the prop!
QUINT	m	Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us  to pieces.
QUINT	m	Damn head is too far away. He's too  big.
QUINT	m	He can't go so deep. Not with all  those on him.
BRODY	m	What about us?
QUINT	m	Have to pump her steady, s'all.
QUINT	m	Follow him -- You start pumpin' out here.
HOOPER	m	He's heading under -- !
QUINT	m	No way! He can't!
BRODY	m	Where'd he go?
QUINT	m	He can't stay down with three barrels  on him! Where is he?!
BRODY	m	Have you ever had one do this?
QUINT	m	No!
QUINT	m	Follow him!
HOOPER	m	He's under!
BRODY	m	There!
BRODY	m	He's trying to sink us!
QUINT	m	Dead astern! Zig-zag!
HOOPER	m	Hold her.
HOOPER	m	Keep him there! Keep him!
QUINT	m	Throttling back!
QUINT	m	What can that gun of yours do?
HOOPER	m	Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine  nitrate. If I can hit him. I can  kill him. But I gotta be close.   Very close.
BRODY	m	You gotta go in the water...
HOOPER	m	Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.
HOOPER	m	Take me up.
HOOPER	m	Lower away, Chief. Try and keep him off me till I'm  under.
QUINT	m	Let go of it!
HOOPER	m	Quint...?
BRODY	m	No...
BRODY	m	What day is this?
HOOPER	m	Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I  think.
BRODY	m	Think the tide's with us?
HOOPER	m	Just keep kicking.
BRODY	m	Y'know, I used to hate the water...
HOOPER	m	I can't imagine why.
