SWIMMERï¿½S VOICE	m	You will be lonely. You will howl  like a dog as you walk alone. You  will carry dog shit cupped in your  hands. You will be smeared with dog  shit. Your spirit will wane and  dwindle to blue, the colour of  despair...
SWIMMER	m	...This is your path. There is no  other. That's a curse you can use on  the Yankee before battle.
INMAN	m	And that works?
SWIMMER	m	You have to say it in Cherokee.
INMAN	m	You said it to me in Cherokee.
SWIMMER	m	So keep your head still.
INMAN	m	Anyway, there won't be any war. And  if there is, they say it won't last  a week.
ROURKE	m	Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys  keep store hours. They ain't open  yet.
BUTCHER	m	That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him!
ROURKE	m	I'm not firing, start the damn war  off.
ROURKE	m	That's my rabbit!
BUTCHER	m	That was something! That's hell and  we've been there! Kicked old Nick's  asshole.
BUTCHER	m	You got a charge?
STOBROD	?	That's gold in his mouth he got no  need for. We take his boots.
OAKLEY	m	I got a few. You saw?
INMAN	m	I saw.
OAKLEY	m	I know you don't recognise me. I'm  Mo Oakley's boy. It's okay. I was thirteen when you  all left. Am I going to die?
OAKLEY	m	I'd like to hear some music while I  go.
STOBROD	?	What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's  one I play.
OAKLEY	m	Play me something sweet. Like a girl's  waiting for me.
OAKLEY	m	Play me something like there's nothing  to fear from a merciful Lord.
INMAN	m	You heard him.
STOBROD	?	I only know a couple of tunes.
OAKLEY	m	Like when you're thirsty up at  Bishop's Creek and the water is so  cool.
OAKLEY	m	I'm reaching Cold Mountain before  you.
OFFICER	m	Don't get up, soldier. You are  mentioned tonight in my report. You  are a credit to the Highlands, to  North Carolina and to the Cause.
INMAN	m	Do you have news, sir, on my  application for transfer?
OFFICER	m	I know. A bloody day. It's what our  General said: Good thing war is so  terrible else a man might end up  liking it too much.
INMAN	m	Sir. It was my understanding the  medical corps was desperate for  volunteers.
OFFICER	m	Right now, soldier, it's me who is  in need of volunteers. There's a  dozen Yankees in that stand of trees  between us. Stuck there from the  retreat. Come daylight they can shoot  us down for sport.
SALLY	f	Ada, how are you settling in? Are  you liking the farm?
ADA	f	Very much. It's beautiful country.
SALLY	f	So listen -- if you would say hello  to one of these fools, I'll get a  field cleared this weekend.
ADA	f	Anyone? Like a forfeit?
SALLY	f	No. Him in particular, up in the  rafters. Been pressing me all morning.
ROURKE	m	I call this nail: Northern Aggression. I call this nail: a free nigger.
BUTCHER	m	Show some respect -- these nails are  making a church.
ROURKE	m	I call this nail: respect the church.
ADA	f	Hello.
ADA	f	I'm Ada Monroe.
INMAN	m	I'm Inman.
ADA	f	Inman?
INMAN	m	W. P. Inman.
ADA	f	W. P. Inman.
INMAN	m	Repeating a thing doesn't improve  it. People call me Inman.
ADA	f	If you were to take a glass of  lemonade your friends might stop  staring. Inman.
INMAN	m	They're not my friends.
INMAN	m	Thank you.
ADA	f	And what do you do?
INMAN	m	I work wood. Got a piece of land.  Mostly work wood.
ADA	f	Clear fields?
INMAN	m	I can clear a field.
ADA	f	So, was there something in particular  you wished to say to me?
INMAN	m	Not that comes to me. I'll say thank you for the lemonade.
ROURKE	m	Esco loves the Yankees.
ESCO	m	I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit.
ESCO	m	What is it you think you'd be fighting  for?
ROURKE	m	The South.
ESCO	m	And what's that when it's at home?
ACTON	m	Pop, you causing trouble?
ESCO	m	No.
ELLIS	?	That means yes.
ESCO	m	You cut the wood, you carry the water  for good old King Cotton. Now you  want to fight for him. Somebody has  to explain it to me.
ACTON	m	Don't even try.
BUTCHER	m	How's the lemonade? Sweet?
SALLY	f	That's a fine looking thing.
ADA	f	I've been missing it.
SALLY	f	Thank you, by the way. Inman's down in the bottom field,  clearing his debt.
ADA	f	Oh dear. And then he had nothing to  say.
SALLY	f	He was happy.
ADA	f	Really?
SALLY	f	Are men so different in Charleston?
ADA	f	Men? I don't know. I don't even know  what a woman should be like. In  Charleston I was called a thistle,  twice, by two different men. Both of  them -- they were hunting for a  simile, what was I like -- and thistle  came right to them.
SALLY	f	If you're saying you might like him,  why not go down and say hello.
MONROE	?	Esco, our friends there -- -- they helped build the Chapel?
ESCO	m	That's Teague and his boys. I'd  recommend you kick them out except a  man don't kick a snake. One time the  Teague family owned the whole of  Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm,  all belonged to his grand-daddy.  Teague wanted this place bad. You  got it. He's here sniffing out an  advantage.
MONROE	?	There's no advantage here, but to  celebrate a job well done. Cheers -- -- and thank you.
ADA	f	Were you planning to come inside?
INMAN	m	I'm wetter than a fish.
ADA	f	There's a good fire going.
INMAN	m	I'm all right.
ADA	f	Somebody said you were enlisting. Are you?
INMAN	m	If there's a war we'll all fight.
ADA	f	If there's a mountain we'll all climb,  if there's an ocean we'll all drown.
INMAN	m	Call a thing a war makes it a  challenge to some men.
ADA	f	Did you get a picture made?
INMAN	m	Say again.
ADA	f	A tintype, with your gun and your  courage on display.
INMAN	m	You're laughing at me.
ADA	f	I don't know you.
INMAN	m	You're always carrying a tray.
ADA	f	I'm taking a drink over to the negroes  in the barn.
INMAN	m	I'll do that. I can't get much wetter.
MONROE	?	Mr. Inman.
INMAN	m	Reverend.
MONROE	?	What can I do for you?
INMAN	m	I have some sheet music. Belonged to  my father. No use to me.
MONROE	?	You must come in.
INMAN	m	I should probably get along.
ADA	f	Mr. Inman is more comfortable  outdoors. Perhaps we might take a  walk.
MONROE	?	A splendid idea.
MONROE	?	I want to get sheep into this field.  A big field doesn't look right without  sheep. You're a lucky fellow, Mr.  Inman, you've had this view all your  life.
INMAN	m	I think so.
MONROE	?	It's a special view. I dragged my  poor daughter to Cold Mountain from  Charleston because of my Doctors --  they say my heart is weak -- so the  air's meant to do me good. But it's  the view I think heals.
MONROE	?	I have to get on my visits. Can I  offer you a ride back into town?
ADA	f	Well, you have your war.
TEAGUE	m	Those who follow Lincoln, or preach  abolition, best keep one eye open  when they're sleeping, Old Bogey Man  might get you!
INMAN	m	Are you the law all of a sudden?
TEAGUE	m	That's right, son. Home Guard for  Haywood County. I'm the law from  today. You all go fight now. We'll  watch your sweethearts.
INMAN	m	You might be safer back in Charleston.
ADA	f	But then who'll be waiting for you?
INMAN	m	I'm going to walk back inside the  Chapel.
MONROE	?	Did you want a quiet word?
INMAN	m	Just some quiet.
MONROE	?	Of course Ada.
MONROE	?	I'll daresay Dr. O'Brien'll want to  do a test or two.
ADA	f	And then there'll be a coffee or  two, a brandy or two...
ADA	f	I found you this book. William  Bartram. They tell me it's good. I  think he writes about these parts,  the author, so...
ADA	f	And this... I'm not smiling in it. I don't know  how to do that, hold a smile, so now  I'm solemn...
INMAN	m	Ada...
ADA	f	What?
ROURKE	m	Let's go!
INMAN	m	I'm not dying.
STOBROD	?	What'd he say?
PANGLE	m	Says he ain't about to die.
STOBROD	?	Truth to tell they say you are,  Soldier. We'll meet again, in the  better world.
TEAGUE	m	My condolences to you all. Keep an eye on the negro. They want  what the white man got -- all of you  watch out your brave boys give their  lives to war and meantime your slaves  carry murder, rape and arson to your  firesides.
MONROE	?	The only slaves within twenty miles  labor on my farm. They're good  Christians and I'll vouchsafe for  them.
ADA	f	What?
MONROE	?	You're looking -- at this moment, I  don't know why -- you're looking  exactly like your mother.
ADA	f	Every time you see the doctor you  get melancholy.
MONROE	?	He listens to my heart and I get  emotional.
ADA	f	He gives you alcohol and you get  emotional.
MONROE	?	We commiserate about the folly of  this terrible war. Do you worry when there's no word  from him? From Mr. Inman?
ADA	f	Yes. But then I've tried counting  the number of words which passed  between Mr. Inman and me. Is that a bonfire? So close to the  barns.
ADA	f	What's going on?
MONROE	?	Hey! Stop there! Hey!
MONROE	?	Dear God.
ADA	f	No, Daddy, it's not real.
MONROE	?	What is wrong with us all?
ADA	f	I'll get help. Keep away from the flames.
DOCTOR	m	Most of these men will be dead by  the morning or, if they're stubborn,  by nightfall. I have other men outside  in the quadrangle waiting for the  beds.
DOCTOR	m	So, any kind word will be a blessing.
DOCTOR	m	It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot.
DOCTOR	m	Don't pray. If they're not God fearing  you can stir up a hornet's nest.
MRS. MORGAN	f	I'm sorry, you want water?
INMAN	m	Pigeon River. Little East Fork.
MRS. MORGAN	f	I'm sorry. I don't know what he's  saying.
DOCTOR	m	They ramble. Names of loved ones.
MRS. MORGAN	f	Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold  Mountain?
DOCTOR	m	This man is dead.
MONROE	?	Thank you. For your Providence, Oh lord, we  thank you.
ADA	f	Amen. That was the last of the ham.
MONROE	?	It was delicious.
ADA	f	I have to learn how to cook.
MONROE	?	I was going to say something in  Chapel. Perhaps some of the womenfolk  will volunteer.
ADA	f	I can't have people coming here and  cooking for me!
MONROE	?	It's my fault. I should have raised  you less like a companion and more  like a young woman. I'm sorry.
ADA	f	I'm not sorry, but I don't know how  we'll get through another winter.
MONROE	?	Will you play me something? Something  peaceful while I look over my sermon.
ADA	f	Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with  you!
ADA	f	Daddy, come inside before you drown!
ADA	f	Dear Mr. Inman...
MRS. MORGAN	f	It's come to you by way of Virginia.
MRS. MORGAN	f	It's not too recent -- written this  past winter. I'm afraid I can't read  who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman,
ADA	f	-- I'm still waiting, as I promised  I would, but I find myself alone and  at the end of my wits --
MRS. MORGAN	f	-- at the end of my wits, so now I  say to you, plain as I can, come  back to me. Come back to me is my  request. Then something I can't read,  something, come back to me.
OFFICIAL	m	By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor  of this great state of North Carolina:  any soldier turned deserter is guilty  of treason and shall be hunted down  like a dog.
OFFICIAL	m	-- Any man takes in a deserter is  likewise guilty of treason.
OFFICIAL	m	The Home Guard is powered to enter  any place it sees fit, without notice  or constraint. Names of all deserters  will be posted in every town,  published in every newspaper.
ADA	f	Is there a letter for me?
MRS. CASTLEREAGH	f	Nothing -- we're getting no post  through at all -- although if you  slip out back the material you ordered  has arrived.
MRS. CASTLEREAGH	f	If folks knew I was taking deliveries  from the North.
ADA	f	I know. Thank you so much.
MRS. CASTLEREAGH	f	The sooner we lose this war the  better. Already one boy gone, another  with his leg took off at the knee.  That's enough.
ADA	f	What do you hear?
MRS. CASTLEREAGH	f	All I know is they say not one boy  in ten from these mountains is coming  home again and most of them are  deserters.
TEAGUE	m	It's taken me too long, but I've  come to pay my respects.
ADA	f	Thank you.
TEAGUE	m	I reckoned you might need fattening  up.
TEAGUE	m	This house must bring bad luck. Killed  my granddaddy to lose it, then my  daddy died on account of not having  it, then your daddy died on account  of getting it. We should burn it  down.
ADA	f	Didn't somebody try?
TEAGUE	m	Lot to manage without help. Need a  hand with that pump?
ADA	f	No.
TEAGUE	m	I'm happy to volunteer.
ADA	f	But not to volunteer for the war?
TEAGUE	m	The war? I wanted to go. But you  know: too old, too literate. Plus I  got no spleen. Lost it from a horse's  kick.
ADA	f	You've got no spleen.
TEAGUE	m	That's the thing about an organ. You  don't know you need it till you lost  it. I want to clear this path. I can  just as soon do it and talk as stand  around and talk. Then you can say  men beat a path to your door.
ADA	f	I'd really prefer it if you didn't  do that.
TEAGUE	m	Would you rather I did my job? See if there's any material I should  confiscate. For the war effort.
ADA	f	I was raised in the good manners of  the South where a gentleman doesn't  enter a house with a woman alone.
TEAGUE	m	Good manners didn't quite make it to  these mountains. If it don't yield  meat, or you can't sit on it, or  suck on it... And you're sleeping all right? These  cold dark nights?
ADA	f	I'm sleeping fine.
TEAGUE	m	It's going to be a long hard winter.
ADA	f	Should I imagine you are dead and,  that it is to your spirit I am  writing? No word from you in all  this time. If you receive this please  know I am here and warring, too,  with a faint heart.
SALLY	f	Ada! Ada, It's Sally.
ESCO	m	Will you look at the state of this  place!
SALLY	f	Poor soul. She's got nobody and  nothing and three hundred acres of  misery.
BLIND MAN	m	Getting better all the time.
INMAN	m	Seems that way.
BLIND MAN	m	I wouldn't hurry. War's almost done.
INMAN	m	Where'd you take your wound?
BLIND MAN	m	Before I was born. Never saw a thing  in this world, not a tree a gun or a  woman. Though I put my hand on all  three. Couple of things I felt back  there I'd sure liked to have had a  long look at.
INMAN	m	What would you give for that? To  have your eyeballs back for ten  minutes?
BLIND MAN	m	Ten minutes! Wouldn't give an Indian  head cent. I fear it might turn me  hateful.
INMAN	m	That's sure what seeing's done to  me.
BLIND MAN	m	That ain't the way I meant it. You  said ten minutes. It's having a thing  and then the loss I'm talking about.
INMAN	m	Then we don't agree. There's not  much I wouldn't give for ten minutes  of someplace.
BLIND MAN	m	Someplace or someone.
INMAN	m	Same difference.
BLIND MAN	m	You watch yourself. They're shooting  men who take themselves a walk.
BARBER	m	Next.
BARBER	m	I'll cut your hair, but I ain't about  to shave you. That thing opens up,  your head's liable to falloff.
SALLY	f	Ada...
SALLY	f	You're skinny as a whippet, girl --  you're coming indoors with me.
ADA	f	I can't. I'm not -- I need to clean  some clothes.
SALLY	f	Great God, you ever looked at my  husband! I can't get him to wear  decent Church clothes Christmas  morning. Hang on to me, the wind'll  blow you over.
SALLY	f	Don't go back to that dark house.  There's a bed here, least till our  boys get home.
ESCO	m	That your daddy's coat?
ADA	f	I was saying to Sally, I wasn't  expecting to be visiting, so...
ESCO	m	Don't suit you.
ESCO	m	I can't get up to your place this  week. She's mad at me --
ADA	f	I don't expect -
ESCO	m	-- more than I can do to keep this  place half-managed. I'm ready-to  stop, I tell you. I just want to sit  on my porch with Sal, watch my boys  in the field, holler good job! every  hour or so.
SALLY	f	What about your people in Charleston?
ADA	f	There are no people. And no money.  My father had some bonds and  investments. They're worthless now,  of course, the war has... they're  not worth anything. I love it here. In spite of  everything.
ESCO	m	And waiting on a feller.
ESCO	m	Look down our well. She should! Look down our well with  a mirror, you'll see the future.  S'what they say. You do it! Don't make that face.
SALLY	f	I know it ain't rightly Christian,  but it's what folks do, like when  they dangle a needle over the belly  to see if you're carrying a boy or a  girl.
ADA	f	What kind of mirror?
ESCO	m	See anything?
ADA	f	I don't know.
SALLY	f	I tried many a time, never saw a  dickybird.
SALLY	f	You all right?
ADA	f	Yesterday I found myself crouched  over a well like a mad woman, which  I suppose I have become
ADA	f	-- and staring down into its secrets,  I thought I saw you there, walking  back to me --
ADA	f	-- or wished I did.
RUBY	f	That cow wants milking.
RUBY	f	If that letter ain't urgent, the cow  is -- is what I'm saying.
ADA	f	I don't know you.
RUBY	f	Old Lady Swanger says you need some  help. Here I am.
ADA	f	I need help, I need, I do need help,  but I need a laborer -- there's  plowing and rough work and -- I think  there's been a misunderstanding.
RUBY	f	What's the rake for?
ADA	f	The rake?
RUBY	f	Ain't for gardening, that's for sure.  Number one -- you got a horse I can  plow all day. I'm a worker. Number  two there's no man better than me  cause there's no man around who ain't  old or full of mischief. I know your  plight.
ADA	f	My plight?
RUBY	f	Am I hard to hear cause you keep  repeating everything. I'm not looking  for money, never cared for it and  now it ain't worth nothing. I expect  to board and eat at the same table.  I'm not a servant. Do you get my  meaning?
ADA	f	You're not a servant.
RUBY	f	People'll have to empty their own  night jars, that's my point.
ADA	f	Right.
RUBY	f	And I'm not planning to work while  you watch neither.
ADA	f	Right.
RUBY	f	Is that a yes or a no?
ADA	f	Yes.
RUBY	f	There's half the day yet. Let's make  a start. My name's Ruby. I know your  name.
ADA	f	The rake: there's a rooster devil,  I'm sure of it. He's Lucifer himself.  I go near him he's at me with his  spurs.
RUBY	f	I despise a flogging rooster. Where  is he?
RUBY	f	Let's put him in a pot.
INMAN	m	Hey! I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece  of cheese.
RUBY	f	Ada? Ada? You up?
ADA	f	Yes. It's still dark.
RUBY	f	Tell the cows that. It's late.
ADA	f	I have to eat something.
RUBY	f	Then you have to get up earlier. What's that?
ADA	f	A novel.
RUBY	f	You want to carry a book carry one  you can write in --
RUBY	f	-- we got our own story. Called Black  Cove Farm: a catastrophe.
RUBY	f	I can spell it, too. C-a-t-a-s-t-r-o- phe. Learned the same place you did,  in the schoolroom. That's one of the  first words they taught me. Ruby  Thewes, you are a ca-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h- e...
RUBY	f	You mucking out?
RUBY	f	Three years I was in school before  my daddy -- saying God rest his soul  is like wishing him what he had in  life, cause he lived to rest, he was  born tired -- before my daddy decided  there was better use for my backside  than have it sat all day in front of  a blackboard.
RUBY	f	Number One -- layout a winter garden  for cool season crops: turnips,  onions, cabbage, greens.
RUBY	f	Number Two: patch the shingles on  the barn roof. Do we have a maul and  froe?
ADA	f	Maul?
RUBY	f	M-a-u-l.
ADA	f	I have no idea.
RUBY	f	Number three: clay crocks for  preserves. Tomatoes. Beans. Jams.
RUBY	f	Clear and turn this field. No harm  done letting it go fallow, now we'll  do well.
RUBY	f	Number fifteen
ADA	f	Sixteen.
RUBY	f	Number sixteen: let's get a martin  colony going in the Gourd House.  Keep away crows. You got one thing  in abundance on this farm and that's  crows.
ADA	f	What's a Gourd House?
RUBY	f	There's survival. On them trees. You got a cider press or would that  be wishing on a blessing?
ADA	f	Actually, yes, I think we do.
INMAN	m	Don't let go. Just back up, nice and  steady, do this all in reverse, you're  going to end up with her draped back  over your animal.
VEASEY	?	Don't pull that trigger. I am a man  of God.
INMAN	m	I've killed several of them.
VEASEY	?	I mean I am God's minister.
INMAN	m	What part of God's business is  throwing a woman down a gorge.
VEASEY	?	A slave woman, can you see that in  this light? She's black as a bucket  of tar.
INMAN	m	Is she dead?
VEASEY	?	Drugged her. Like you would a  butterfly. And I care for her, that's  the heartbreak of it.
VEASEY	?	She's got my bastard in her belly.  What kind of pistol is that I never  saw the like of it?
VEASEY	?	I'm begging you. It's better you  blowout my brains than return me to  this place.
INMAN	m	Where does she live?
VEASEY	?	In our house. She sleeps in our  kitchen. You don't know me, friend,  but the good Lord punished me with  want. I am all appetite. That's all  I do all day is want: food, the female  parts...
INMAN	m	Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon  every time I ask a question.
INMAN	m	This your place?
VEASEY	?	Dear God of misery.
INMAN	m	You're going to put her back where  she sleeps.
VEASEY	?	I do that the Members will lynch me.  Consorting with a nigger, adultery,  siring a bastard while serving as  their preacher. We're a strict  congregation we've churched men for  picking up a fiddle on the sabbath.
INMAN	m	So you reckoned to kill her.
VEASEY	?	There's a back door. Have pity.
VEASEY	?	Thank you. I was going to do a  grievous wrong.
VESEY	?	You tasted dark meat? Sweet as  liquorice. I think I should go back  up to my wife. She wakes at the  slightest noise.
INMAN	m	You find me some paper and a pen.
VEASEY	?	You're not entitled to judge me!  You're nothing but an outlier, plain  as daylight!
RUBY	f	Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in  the woods?
ADA	f	No. What? No. We bought our hams.
RUBY	f	There's a world more to a hog than  the two hams! Lard, for example,  we'll need plenty --
RUBY	f	The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's  laundry. I can feel you shutting your eyes.
RUBY	f	What's this wood?
ADA	f	I don't know. Locust?
RUBY	f	Where's North?
ADA	f	North is, North is --
RUBY	f	Name me three herbs growing wild on  this farm.
ADA	f	I can't! I can't! All right? I can  talk about farming in Latin. Will  that do? I can read French. I know  Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my  Bible. I can name the principal rivers  of Europe, but don't ask me to name  one stream in this county. I can  embroider, but I can't darn, I can  arrange cut flowers, but I can't  grow them. If a thing has a function,  if I might do something with it, it  wasn't considered suitable.
RUBY	f	Why?
ADA	f	Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty  much everything to do with me.
ADA	f	This fence is about the first thing  I've ever done that'll produce an  actual result.
RUBY	f	So you never wrapped your legs around  this Inman?
FERRYGIRL	f	For five dollars I wouldn't give a  parched man a dipper of this  riverwater.
INMAN	m	Sign says ferry, five dollars.
FERRYGIRL	f	This look like a ferry? My Daddy's  dead, or gone off to the Federals,  don't matter which. I'm the way across  now.
INMAN	m	What's the name of this thing?
FERRYGIRL	f	Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear  River, is all.
FERRYGIRL	f	Nobody crosses this water unless  they're running from someplace. Some  cross one way, some the other: makes  no difference, they're all running.  You want to wait for your friends?
INMAN	m	I can give you thirty dollars script.
FERRYGIRL	f	Let's go.
VOICE	m	Hey! Hey! Wait!
VEASEY	?	Keep going. We're both in trouble.
INMAN	m	No. Get out.
VEASEY	?	It's Homeguard. Made me tell them  all about you.
INMAN	m	I should have shot you when I had  the chance.
VEASEY	?	I'm not looking for revenge, by the  way. For what you did to me. No, I'm  a Pilgrim now, like you, traveling  the road, paying our dues, relying  on the kindness of strangers.
INMAN	m	You're nothing like me and the last  thing I want right now is a  conversation.
VEASEY	?	You recall Job in the scriptures? I  will give free utterance to my  complaint. I will speak in the  bitterness of my soul. That's our  friend here... They cut off my hair. Which was hard.  I was vain about my hair. I had good curls. But I deserved it.  I'm the Reverend Veasey. Have I seen  you in church?
FERRYGIRL	f	I'm saving for a cowhide, and when I  get it I aim to get a saddle made,  and when I get me a saddle I'll save  for a horse, and when I got a horse  I'll throw on the saddle, and then  you won't see my sorry ass round  this swamp again.
VEASEY	?	What's that?
FERRYGIRL	f	Catfish. 'gator. Keep your hand in  the boat. Already looks like some  critter chewed his neck. Thirty more dollars, we can go to  the cabin. I'll pull this dress over  my head.
VEASEY	?	Have we got thirty dollars?
VEASEY	?	You okay?
INMAN	m	Jesus, god!
VEASEY	?	I figure that righteous, given our  history. Otherwise I'd bear a grudge  on our journey.
INMAN	m	There's nowhere I'm going with you  except to Hellfire!
ADA	f	Agricola poetis viam non monstrat.
RUBY	f	Which means?
ADA	f	The farmer does not point out the  road to a poet.
RUBY	f	Which means? Should be the other way  round
ADA	f	Which means, I suppose, which means  the poet should know where he's going.
RUBY	f	It's no wonder you're helpless and  hopeless if it takes this long to  fix your hair. Say some more.
ADA	f	Terra mutata non mutat mores. It's appalling what's in my head.
RUBY	f	It's appalling what's in my head?
ADA	f	No, it means: A change of place does  not change a character.
RUBY	f	Well that's surely true even in  English.
ADA	f	You can keep those earrings.
RUBY	f	We can't keep anything.
ADA	f	I have to keep the bangles. They  were my mother's.
RUBY	f	Well that's all. The rest is for  trading. Else they can bury you in  your finery.
ADA	f	You're done.
RUBY	f	Good God! Okay.
ADA	f	I like it.
RUBY	f	Takes two minutes. That's what I  like.
RUBY	f	How much do you love that piano?
RUBY	f	We're careful we'll get through the  winter now. I made old man Roy give  me ten of those sheep on account of  I said they were so small put together  they were no bigger than six proper  sheep.
ADA	f	My father always wanted sheep on  this land.
RUBY	f	I'm sorry you had to lose your piano.  I cut off my hair once, for money.  My daddy got two dollars for it.  Made a wig for a rich feller in  Raleigh.
RUBY	f	Stobrod called himself a musician --  my daddy -- he could play six tune  on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead  at Petersburg. I was like his goat  or some creature tethered to a post.  He left me once, up the mountains. I  was eight. He was gone over two weeks.
ADA	f	Oh Ruby.
RUBY	f	I was all right! He'd walk forty  miles for liquor and not forty inches  for kindness.
ADA	f	And your mother?
RUBY	f	Never met her. We're the same in  that regard. He said she was -- he  told me a thousand stories -- she  was a wolf or an indian or a donkey.  Don't say much for him, except you  know he'd be fast to work up a sweat  on a tree if he thought there was  pleasure in it.
RUBY	f	There's cows to milk.
VEASEY	?	Used to be as regular as morning  prayers. Matter of fact I could set  my watch by my bowels. That beeswax  you fed me, day before yesterday, it  stops a man up. Open my gut now they'd  find turds stacked up like little  black twigs.
VEASEY	?	Hey! Look at this! This is a good saw.
INMAN	m	It's not yours. You take it, you  make us another enemy. You're a  Christian -- don' t you know your  commandments?
VEASEY	?	You'll find the good Lord very  flexible on the subject of property.  We could do a lot with this saw...
VEASEY	?	Why you in such a hurry the whole  time? Hurry or slow the destination is  always the same. It's only the journey  that is different. That's either in  the Good Book or I made it up.
VEASEY	?	Good day to you!
JUNIOR	m	My old bull, wandered off and died  in this here creek. Fouled up our  water is how I found it.
VEASEY	?	This is a tricky one.
VEASEY	?	The name for the Bull's member is a  tassel. I learned that and never  forgot it.
JUNIOR	m	Reckon I need a train of mules.
VEASEY	?	I'm getting an idea. My saw is the  remedy. Let's saw up some wood and  make levers.
INMAN	m	Then what?
VEASEY	?	Lever him out. This'll work!
JUNIOR	m	Where you two sports heading?
INMAN	m	I don't know where he's heading. I'm  going down the road. And I got a  good way to go before nightfall.
JUNIOR	m	Charitable of you to make a stop.  Ain't for me to be curious.
VEASEY	?	How do you work this damn thing?
INMAN	m	Give me that saw. Come on.
INMAN	m	Let's do this in chapters.
INMAN	m	You might want to leave off that  water for a day or two.
JUNIOR	m	There'll be a tang, I'd imagine.
JUNIOR	m	There's my place. Hope you can stomach  a yard chock-full of females. Brought  my woman home, she showed up with  her three so-called sisters and their  brats. The noise in that place is  something awful. It's why I go  hunting.
VEASEY	?	Looks a bit crooked.
JUNIOR	m	It is on a bit of a tilt. Them  females. They all roll down one end  each night!
VEASEY	?	-- Roll me over!
JUNIOR	m	-- In the clover
VEASEY	?	One good fart -- that'll tip over!
VEASEY	?	Oh God of my God! Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!
JUNIOR	m	What's up?
VEASEY	?	The Israelites! The tribes of Israel  are about to flee from the banks of  Egypt! Hallelujah!
INMAN	m	He's got a shit coming on. It's  overdue.
JUNIOR	m	And he's a Preacher? Like a Christian?
INMAN	m	Like a Christian.
JUNIOR	m	Good God.
JUNIOR	m	These two boys is stopping for supper.  They're on the road to Atonement.
VEASEY	?	Atonement is not a place.
JUNIOR	m	So what is it when it's at home?
VEASEY	?	Those are fine examples of the female.
JUNIOR	m	Take them all and leave the saw. Be  a sight more use.
SHYLA	f	If they want to get in a tub there's  an hour before food.
JUNIOR	m	They love to scrub a man. Put the water on the boil. It's my liquor, gets their titties  swinging.
VEASEY	?	God damn! I was right about sheep droppings  those stools -- like rock hard. Quite  astonishing.
SHYLA	f	That's battered flesh. I could work a finger in there.
VEASEY	?	He's a hero. Took that wound at  Petersburg.
INMAN	m	He doesn't know what I am. Thanks.
SHYLA	f	He's shy, ain't he?
VEASEY	?	Wait up a few minutes, I'll be in  that tub, then we'll see who's a shy  one.
SHYLA	f	I want to poke my thumb in his holes.
DOLLY	f	Lila says supper's up.
LILA	f	Hey!
JUNIOR	m	He's gone now. Look! His eyes have  gone.
INMAN	m	What?
VEASEY	?	Dolly?
DOLLY	f	S'me.
VEASEY	?	Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That's a  poem. That's a poem.
VEASEY	?	Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae Da-da da-da da-da dae... ...there's a poem there.
JUNIOR	m	I'm leaving soon as I'm full.
VEASEY	?	Really. Goodbye.
JUNIOR	m	Got a bunch of traps needs visiting.  I'll be back tomorrow, before dark.  You'll still be here?
VEASEY	?	That's my fervent prayer.
JUNIOR	m	My house is your house.
INMAN	m	Like to wash their hands and pray.
VEASEY	?	Say again?
INMAN	m	Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae.
VEASEY	?	That's Job. Don't say much but even  liquored up there's a preacher in  him.
INMAN	m	I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and  miles to go before sunset. I'll just quickly lie down.
VEASEY	?	I'm heading for that smokehouse and  I'm ready to be washed clean of my  dirt.
JUNIOR	m	You go tend to him. I'll be seeing you.
DOLLY	f	Come on you -- get!
LILA	f	He's mine. You can go rub yourself  off on the Preacher. Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.
LILA	f	Hey!
LILA	f	You want to see what Mamma's got for  you?
LILA	f	That's good. Ain't that sweet?
LILA	f	You just get on and ride me all the  way to China.
LILA	f	You shy? You need a hand? Let's have a look see what we can  muster.
JUNIOR	m	You little bitch! Look at you! Cover  yourself up!
VEASEY	?	I had a special prayer you'd come  visit.
SALLY	f	Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes! Look at  you both!
RUBY	f	Look at us both what?
SALLY	f	Like a coupla scarecrows after a  thunderstorm.
RUBY	f	We need a scarecrow, birds eating up  half our winter garden.
ADA	f	Sally's right. We should both stop  toiling and stand a while with our  arms stretch out. I'll volunteer.
RUBY	f	We got something for you.
ADA	f	For all your kindness. Coffee. And a  pie.
RUBY	f	That's real coffee. It ain't hickory  and dirt.
SALLY	f	Thank you both. Ruby, I look forward to this. We all  do. Esco and me.
RUBY	f	She made it.
ADA	f	I made it.
SALLY	f	Good God in Heaven.
RUBY	f	I'm still alive.
RUBY	f	We'll be getting along.
SALLY	f	I know Esco's going to be real sorry  he missed you. You all take care.
RUBY	f	That strike you as odd?
ADA	f	What?
RUBY	f	Stood at her front door?
ADA	f	Sally?
RUBY	f	Number one -- I know that woman all  my life. I never stood outside her  house -- she'd invite a wolf inside  if it knocked on the door.
ADA	f	Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she  was busy.
RUBY	f	Number two -- Old Man Swanger was  inside that house: I could smell his  pipe burning. Number three -- look  at these fields.
ADA	f	What about them?
RUBY	f	We came by here a week ago, they  were waist high in hay.
INMAN	m	He's dead.
INMAN	m	This man's dead!
VEASEY	?	Am I so altered that they don't see  me?
VEASEY	?	I christened that child.
SHEFFIELD	m	I'm looking to get out of this. They  drag us back to fight -- we're just  target practice for the Federal boys.
INMAN	m	You run, we're all running with you,  the lame and the stupid, of which we  number both.
SHEFFIELD	m	Either way we're fucked. Run or don't  run.
INMAN	m	Just give me some warning so I can  tell the guard -- I'm not getting  shot again for some cause I don't  believe in.
VEASEY	?	That's Rebecca. That's Rebecca. Rebecca!
REBECCA	f	Mas?
VEASEY	?	Is it well with you? I've been repenting for what I did.  I've walked the road of atonement.
REBECCA	f	Your curls is all gone.
GUARD	m	Hey!
VEASEY	?	God Bless you.
VEASEY	?	I'm with you. I got a baby coming.
INMAN	m	No!
BROWN	m	Get these sacks of shit under the  ground.
RUBY	f	Someone's been in the corncrib.
ADA	f	You sure?
RUBY	f	It's a coon or possum. Scratched out  a fist hole in the side. This place!  I'm telling you -- we grow, others  eat. I'll go into town, take the  last of the cider and trade for a  trap.
TEAGUE	m	What you looking to catch?
RUBY	f	What?
TEAGUE	m	With that trap.
RUBY	f	We got some critter stealing our  corn.
TEAGUE	m	Still but the two of you up there,  is it?
RUBY	f	You know it.
TEAGUE	m	When we get a cold night, camped  out, trying to keep the rule of law,  protecting girls like you from  Federals and deserters, that's a  thought warms us ain't it? -- the two of you up there  on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in  men's clothes. Warms us right up.  What you got in the sacks? Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks  like a bunch of heads. We got  competition!
SALLY	f	Ruby...
RUBY	f	I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not  snooping neither. Just you should  know Teague and his boys are lurking  down by Pigeon River, the old mill.
SALLY	f	You tell Ada that was a good pie.
MADDY	f	Mind that Billy, he's the jealous  kind.
MADDY	f	Pay no attention to me. What happened  to your head?
INMAN	m	Fighting.
MADDY	f	And your neck?
INMAN	m	Different fighting.
MADDY	f	You're the color of a cadaver. I'll  fix you. I can fix you up.
INMAN	m	Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in  your everlasting debt.
MADDY	f	Debts, fighting -- them words don't  mean much round here. For the record,  I'm a female of the species.
RUBY	f	The hat's a nice touch.
RUBY	f	You're quiet.
ADA	f	I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up  the scarecrow in his suit and he  came back, his arms out, said you  never cried enough, you never cried  enough.
RUBY	f	Well now you did.
ADA	f	Then I thought, it's not my Daddy,  it's my sweetheart. I saw him once  that way, when I looked down Sally's  well. So I dressed the scarecrow in  the dress I wore the day he left. In  case his spirit flies over looking  out for me. That looks terrible.
ADA	f	Cabbages.
RUBY	f	I bargained like Lucifer. We can  make all kinds of good eating.
ADA	f	Such as?
RUBY	f	Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage  soup, fried cabbage, stuffed  cabbage...
TEAGUE	m	Afternoon.
ESCO	m	Don't spread out. Why they spreading  out?
TEAGUE	m	I'm not spreading out. I'm sitting  here.
TEAGUE	m	Never knew a man worked in his field  with a shotgun.
ESCO	m	There's a war on.
TEAGUE	m	Got to watch out for the Bogey Man.
ESCO	m	Get off my land.
TEAGUE	m	Your boys come back.
ESCO	m	Ain't seen my boys in four years.  They're fighting other boys, not old  men and women.
TEAGUE	m	He means us. He's referring there to  us. So you won't care if we take a look  around?
ESCO	m	What I gotta give you? A chicken? A  lamb?
TEAGUE	m	Sure.
ESCO	m	Right then.
TEAGUE	m	Thing is -- you got one barrel and  there's five of us. Not a fair fight.
BOSIE	m	Bogey Man! Bogey Man!
RUBY	f	What's that?
TEAGUE	m	You're harbouring deserters. I can  confiscate every animal on this farm,  every plate, every sheet, every little  pellet of chicken shit -- I can  confiscate your old lady's asshole,  so don't offer me a bird.
TEAGUE	m	Hey!
TEAGUE	m	You got your bait. Set it on the  hook.
RUBY	f	I can't get this damn thing off her.
ADA	f	Dear Lord in heaven.
RUBY	f	Ada, I can't get this off her!
RUBY	f	What darling? What?
RUBY	f	She's saying don't bother.
ADA	f	Wait!
ADA	f	There's someone down there. I think  it's Esco.
RUBY	f	This world won't stand long. God  won't let it stand this way long.
INMAN	m	How long have I been sleeping?
MADDY	f	Not long enough.
INMAN	m	I can't stop here. I'm a deserter.  They find me here things could be  bad for you.
MADDY	f	What they going to do? Cut short my  young life? Sit down before you fall  down.
INMAN	m	How long you been up here?
MADDY	f	What year are we? '63?
INMAN	m	Last time I checked it was '64.
MADDY	f	I'd say twenty six years.
INMAN	m	Twenty six years!
MADDY	f	I could move on anytime. I've seen  most of the world anyway, Richmond  in the North, south almost to  Charleston. You're going somewhere  or you are somewhere, what's the  difference?
MADDY	f	I've learned a person can survive  off pretty much of a goat. I can't  abide a chicken, but a goat gives  you company and milk and cheese and  then, when you need it, good meat.
MADDY	f	So you've been fighting?
INMAN	m	I could be at killing for days  sometimes, in the hand to hand, my  feet against the feet of my enemy  and I always killed him and he never  killed me.
MADDY	f	He gave it a try, to look at you.
INMAN	m	I guess he did.
MADDY	f	See I think there's a plan. There's  a design. For each and every one of  us.
MADDY	f	You look at nature, a bird flies  somewhere, picks up a seed, shits  the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's  got a job, seed's got a job.
MADDY	f	Take one of these now with your food.
MADDY	f	Swallow it. If you die I'll give you  your money back.
MADDY	f	Our minds aren't made to hold on to  the particulars of pain, the way we  do bliss.
INMAN	m	It's true...
MADDY	f	What is?
INMAN	m	What you remember.
MADDY	f	What's her name?
INMAN	m	Ada. -- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when  I'm just hungry -- Ada Monroe.
MADDY	f	And is she waiting for you?
INMAN	m	She was. I don't know. Or if she'd  know me. I'm like the boy who goes  out in winter for firewood comes  back in the spring with a whistle.
MADDY	f	Now drink this. It visits the pain.  And you'll sleep.
INMAN	m	I've had to put myself in the way of  people's kindness.
MADDY	f	I hope you found it.
INMAN	m	The passenger pigeons fly south, the  berries ripen. Whether I see them or  not, whether a man dies, or a war is  won.
MADDY	f	That's the laudanum getting to you.  That's good. Say something more. Raise that up for me.
INMAN	m	She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man  by the name of Bartram. Wrote about  his travels. I carried that book  through every battle. I left it  someplace, got to get it back.  Sometimes just reading the name of a  place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire  Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring  me to tears. Thing is I've been  thinking -- those places belonged to  people before us, to the Indian --  and he had a different name. What  did he call Sorell Cove? How can a  name not even the real name break  your heart? It's her, she's the place  I'm heading. And I hardly know her.  So how can a person who's maybe not  even a real person -- I don't know  what I'm talking about -- I have to  close my eyes...
RUBY	f	It's a man.
ADA	f	What is?
RUBY	f	Raiding our corn. Got him in the  trap. That's him yelping.
ADA	f	You're not going to shoot him!
RUBY	f	I don't want him to shoot me. Can you fire this thing?
ADA	f	Yes.
RUBY	f	Listen up -- you got a barrel trained  on your rear-end.
STOBROD	?	Get me out of this dang thing. My  fist's about to drop off.
RUBY	f	You got a weapon?
STOBROD	?	No ma'am. I'm begging you. I'm already  on my knees, otherwise I'd get down  on them.
RUBY	f	Unbelievable! Stobrod Thewes.
STOBROD	?	Ruby? God damn!
ADA	f	What?
RUBY	f	That's my daddy...
STOBROD	?	Just so's you know -- I can eat while  she's doing this -- in case you're  holding off.
RUBY	f	Just so's you know -- you're not  eating inside. Number One -- they  hang people round here for taking in  deserters. Number two -- even if  they gave out prizes -- you'd still  eat outside.
STOBROD	?	You're scarred.
RUBY	f	I'm what?
STOBROD	?	Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to  you.
RUBY	f	You'd be scarred. You'd be really  scarred if I hadn't wrapped them  trap teeth in sacking. Which was her  idea.
STOBROD	?	I hurt you.
RUBY	f	Good God!
STOBROD	?	I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind.  Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the  eyes that sparkle.
RUBY	f	Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you  abandoned me, you ignored me, you  beat me some more -- all of that is  better than Ruby with the eyes that  sparkle!
STOBROD	?	I'm changed. People change. War  changes people something terrible. Ruby's told you -- I've no doubt --  I wasn't always the best...
RUBY	f	You were an asshole.
STOBROD	?	I can't disagree with that. I was.
RUBY	f	Get him out of here!
STOBROD	?	Music's changed me. I'm full of music,  darling. I wish I'd brung my fiddle  Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's  got a little snake's rattle in the  body -- took it off a dead federal  in Virginia. That's a beautiful  fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby.  Don't know if it's from that little  rattle locked up in it, or from  something untied my heart.
RUBY	f	You're all set.
STOBROD	?	Bless you both.
RUBY	f	Ain't you got a proper coat?
STOBROD	?	Darling, I'm fine. And you just say  the word, I won't come back neither.  I don't want to put either you or  your mistress here in any bother.
ADA	f	I'm not Ruby's employer.
STOBROD	?	Oh, okay, who is?
RUBY	f	Nobody. I'll make up food for you, you come  Sundays before it's light, I'll leave  it behind the Old Frazier Mill.
STOBROD	?	Do you know who really needs a coat,  darling, is my partner, fat boy name  of Pangle. We're hiding up in the  caves and he feels the cold like a  thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit  him. I love you, Ruby. In case the sky  falls on our head. You're a good  girl.
RUBY	f	He is so full of manure, that man,  we could lay him on the dirt and  grow another one just like him.
ADA	f	So that's Stobrod Thewes.
RUBY	f	It is and that's the last you'll see  of him.
MADDY	f	That's medicine and goatmeat. You're  sick of both.
INMAN	m	I have a deal to thank you for.
MADDY	f	And that's just for show, or -- if  you can get close enough -- a wild  turkey.
RUBY	f	Get on back where you came from!
ADA	f	My love for Heathcliff resembles the  eternal rocks beneath
ADA	f	-- a source of little visible delight,  But necessary.
RUBY	f	She ain't gonna marry Linton, is  she? She said -- whatever our souls  are made of his and mine are the  same. You can't say that and then  marry Linton.
ADA	f	We'll find out.
RUBY	f	Okay.
ADA	f	Tomorrow.
RUBY	f	I'm not waiting until tomorrow.
ADA	f	Ruby, I'm falling asleep.
RUBY	f	Little visible delight, but necessary.  I like that...
INMAN	m	I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate  soldier on furlough. I have no bad  intention. I need shelter and food.
INMAN	m	Can I at least sleep in the corn  crib -- just for some shelter? I'll  be on my way come morning.
SARA	f	I've got a rifle.
INMAN	m	Fair enough.
SARA	f	There's some beans and corn pone,  all I got. You better come in.
INMAN	m	Thank you.
SARA	f	I'm alone here, as you can see, with  my baby. I need to believe you mean  no harm.
INMAN	m	No, I mean to give it to you.
SARA	f	I don't want it. I had my way they'd  take metal altogether out of this  world. Every blade, every gun.
INMAN	m	Is your baby sick?
SARA	f	He cries. I don't know. He cries a  lot. My man is dead. He took his  wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw  his boy.
INMAN	m	I'm sorry.
SARA	f	It's pretty much what you'll get if  you knock on any door of this war.  Man dead, woman left.
SARA	f	It's mean food but it's hot.
INMAN	m	There's no hunting on the road, just  cress and --
SARA	f	I need to feed this man, if you could  look away.
SARA	f	Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders  took them. Made me kill our own dog  on the porch. That poor creature  watched over me. Nothing left now  save a hog and couple of chickens to  live off till spring. I'll have to  kill that hog and make sense of the  flesh and divisions which is something  I never did.
INMAN	m	I could do that for you in the  morning.
SARA	f	I'm not asking.
INMAN	m	It's what I'd gladly do for you for  what you're gladly doing for me. I'm  Inman by the way. That's my name.
SARA	f	I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan.
INMAN	m	Glad to know you both.
SARA	f	You look about his size. He was  another man straight up and down.
SARA	f	I don't even have a blanket.
INMAN	m	I got a blanket.
SARA	f	I'll leave you the lamp.
SARA	f	They fit?
INMAN	m	Pretty much. These boots are good  boots.
SARA	f	I'll say good night.
INMAN	m	Good night.
SARA	f	Will you come inside?
SARA	f	Could you do something for me? Do  you think you could lie here, next  to me, and not need to go further?
INMAN	m	I don't know. I'll try.
INMAN	m	I'll go. I'll go, shall I?
SARA	f	I don't want you to.
PANGLE	m	She don't speak.
STOBROD	?	She can't speak. I told you.
PANGLE	m	Is she feeble then?
STOBROD	?	No. Don't mind him. Hey Ruby: what about this?
STOBROD	?	Don't make that face -- you listen:  c'mon Georgia...
GEORGIA	f	There's snow in the air.
RUBY	f	Don't sleep here.
STOBROD	?	We won't.
ADA	f	It's bitter, they could stop one  night.
RUBY	f	They stop one night, they'll want to  stop two.
PANGLE	m	This coat's warm.
STOBROD	?	What about next Sunday? That'll be  the New Year. It's gonna be a better  one.
RUBY	f	Maybe.
GEORGIA	f	The war's over in a month.
RUBY	f	He said that a month ago.
ADA	f	It started off being over in a month.
STOBROD	?	Miss Ada. Merry Christmas.
ADA	f	Merry Christmas. Pangle. Georgia.
GEORGIA	f	'Night.
PANGLE	m	'Night now.
STOBROD	?	That's my Ruby.
GEORGIA	f	She's an original.
STOBROD	?	You think the Good Lord would forgive  an old cold fool if he changed his  mind? Ada said it herself it was  bitter...
RUBY	f	What kind of name's Georgia?
ADA	f	It's where he comes from, it's not  his name.
RUBY	f	I know that's meant to be the ugliest  state under the heavens.
ADA	f	Why do you care what his name is?
RUBY	f	What's that cluster of Stars?
ADA	f	Orion.
RUBY	f	What about them shaped like a  wishbone?
ADA	f	That's Taurus the bull, and that's  Gemini and that's Orion's big dog,  Canis Major.
RUBY	f	Listen to her, Sal. She's turned  into a highland girl.
ADA	f	I could always name the stars, Ruby,  that was never my problem.
ADA	f	I love you darling. In case that big  old sky falls on our heads. And I  love you, too. Sal.
RUBY	f	It's sad, Sal. It's a c-a-t-a-s-t-r- o-p-h-e.
STOBROD	?	No sense setting off in snow.
SARA	f	Get out of here, quick!
SARA	f	Federals are coming. They find you  here it'll go bad on all of us.
INMAN	m	I can try and fight them.
SARA	f	No, my baby. Please no! Just get.
PISTOL	m	We got all day.
SARA	f	My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's  shaking! Have some pity.
SARA	f	I got nothing. I swear.
NYM	?	That ain't necessarily so.
SARA	f	Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go  inside! Take my baby inside and then  we'll do whatever you want.
SARA	f	There's nothing! You take that hog  I'm as good as dead. Cover up my  boy!
BARDOLPH	?	This is ready to get a fit going.  It's shuddering. It's gone blue.
PISTOL	m	How long does he want? Hey! Leave  some for the rest of us.
INMAN	m	Move away from the baby.
BARDOLPH	?	Don't shoot.
INMAN	m	Take off your boots. Take off your pants, and your shirt.
BARDOLPH	?	Don't shoot me, please. We're  starving. We haven't eaten.
INMAN	m	You'd better get running before you  catch your death of cold.
BARDOLPH	?	Thanks, thank you. I will.
SARA	f	Good?
ADA	f	Do you think he's dead?
RUBY	f	Who?
ADA	f	This snow. Isn't it supposed to fall  with bad news?
RUBY	f	Bad news is girls get working. I'm  going to round up the animals. This'll settle.
GEORGIA	f	What d'you reckon? Think we could  eat this?
STOBROD	?	You cook something long enough you  can eat anything.
PANGLE	m	It's frozen. How long it been there  for?
STOBROD	?	You hungry?
PANGLE	m	Yeah.
STOBROD	?	Not very long.
STOBROD	?	Edible.
PANGLE	m	Ow!
GEORGIA	f	Don't taste much like venison.
PANGLE	m	It's good. I think it's good.
TEAGUE	m	Evening. Hope we didn't disturb you.
STOBROD	?	You're all right.
TEAGUE	m	Name's Teague. Do I know you?
STOBROD	?	Thewes.
TEAGUE	m	You a deserter? -- don't mind if I  just warm up at your fire. That your wife?
STOBROD	?	Who? That's a he!
TEAGUE	m	He your wife?
STOBROD	?	We're musicians. He picks the banjo,  I got a fiddle.
TEAGUE	m	Look pretty romantic by the fire.  Don't they? Your boyfriend's got a nice bit of  flesh on him. Close your eyes slip  inside that shirt get two good  handfuls -- dark enough I'd be  willing. I'm just kidding. Tell him, I'm just kidding.
BOSIE	m	He's just kidding.
TEAGUE	m	Did you answer my question -- about  your military status?
STOBROD	?	Discharged. Took a wound at  Petersburg.
TEAGUE	m	Oh, so like a hero's discharge.
STOBROD	?	I guess.
TEAGUE	m	And your boyfriend?
STOBROD	?	The military wouldn't take him. He  can't fight. He's simple. He's got a  mind no bigger'n a pickled walnut.
TEAGUE	m	I'm sorry -- he's fat, he's simple  and got titties -- but you're  insisting he ain't a woman. God damn!  Don't that sausage smell outstanding.
STOBROD	?	Miqhty outstanding.
TEAGUE	m	Mighty outstanding! There's a new  phrase. Mighty outstanding. Listen,  don't tell me -- you left your papers  somewhere.
STOBROD	?	Which papers?
TEAGUE	m	Your hero's discharge. For mighty  outstanding valour.
STOBROD	?	They're, they're, they're at my house.
TEAGUE	m	And where, where, where is your house?
STOBROD	?	Down the mountain.
TEAGUE	m	But you're up the mountain.
STOBROD	?	Hunting. Drinking.
TEAGUE	m	On honeymoon. I'm pretty fucking funny tonight.
BOSIE	m	Is he going to play? You gonna play that fiddle?
STOBROD	?	Sure. Sure. Hey, wake up!
TEAGUE	m	Evening, Mrs.
PANGLE	m	Where's Georgia?
TEAGUE	m	Where's Georgia?
STOBROD	?	He don't know what he's saying. We  were talking about Georgia early on --  maybe heading down there.
TEAGUE	m	Georgia's like my armpit. Worse,  it's like yours. Want some sausage?
PANGLE	m	Thanks. You is Home Guard?
TEAGUE	m	Yes, ma'am.
PANGLE	m	You is Teague?
TEAGUE	m	I'm known!
STOBROD	?	He don't know what he's saying.
PANGLE	m	That bastard Teague.
TEAGUE	m	Really.
PANGLE	m	Bad words. Folk always put the curse  words in front of your name.
STOBROD	?	Mr. Teague wants us to play.
PANGLE	m	Okay.
TEAGUE	m	We heard there were deserters in  these parts. Hiding out in a big  cave.
STOBROD	?	Not come to my ears.
TEAGUE	m	You don't know where this cave is?
STOBROD	?	No, sir.
PANGLE	m	You do, Stobes! He means --
STOBROD	?	Right, right! he means, there is a  cave, right, it's up over the other  side, big cave, we played some music  up there, never occurred to me they  were deserters. Near Bearpen Branch.
PANGLE	m	Ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch!  It's this side! He's always getting  lost. That cave -- we live there! --  it's over on Big Stomp. Tell you how  I always find it. There's a big old  locust tree fell down across the  path, that points straight at it,  like a finger, always a dozen  squirrels round that tree. You gets  to the tree, sit on it, and there's  your entrance, straight in front of  you, tree points at it. Come right  to your hand, them squirrels -- -- Chrrrpppp! Chrrrrppp!
TEAGUE	m	Sounds good. Okay, let's eat, let's  hear some music.
STOBROD	?	I call this tune: Ruby's Lament.
PANGLE	m	What'd you make of that?
BOSIE	m	Heartbreaking.
TEAGUE	m	Stand over by that tree.
STOBROD	?	Me?
TEAGUE	m	Over by that tree. Over there. Take  your boyfriend.
STOBROD	?	Come on.
TEAGUE	m	Don't smile.
PANGLE	m	What?
TEAGUE	m	Quit smiling.
STOBROD	?	He always smiles. He don't mean  nothing by it. I told him this world's  got nothing worth a smile.
TEAGUE	m	Put your hat over your face.
PANGLE	m	What do you mean?
TEAGUE	m	Cover your face with your hat.
ADA	f	I told Georgia he can stop here,  sleep in the barn. He's got nothing  inside him. He'd walk out of here  and die in the snow.
RUBY	f	He can milk the cows. I was worrying  about that. It'll be dark in a couple  of hours. I's ten hours climb from  here. He's drawn a map.
ADA	f	Okay.
RUBY	f	You know these fools stayed the night  in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he  can't do one good thing without adding  the bad. Left tracks in the snow all  the way up for them Home Guards to  follow. That's a sign says shoot me!
ADA	f	Ruby, I'm so sorry.
RUBY	f	We should get going.
RUBY	f	Every piece of this is a man's  bullshit. They call this a war a  cloud over the land, but they made  the weather. Then they stand in the  rain and say: shit! It's raining! If I cry one tear for my Daddy I  stole it off a crocodile.
ADA	f	I don't understand.
RUBY	f	Maybe Teague's took him. They did  that with the Swanger boys -- didn't,  they? -- dragged them into town,  then strung them up as warning...  it's snowed since, so I can't read  the story on the ground.
RUBY	f	Let's dig.
ADA	f	Ruby! Ruby!
RUBY	f	He's still breathing! God damn! Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby.  Don't you die on me again. He's still breathing!
RUBY	f	Pack a pan full of snow. I need good  clean water, boiled up.
ADA	f	Let's get him home. We have herbs  there and it's warm.
RUBY	f	He'll die first. He's got hardly no  blood left in him.
ADA	f	He'll die lying here.
RUBY	f	There's a place further on up. Used  to be. Old Cherokee place. There's  good water right by it.
ADA	f	This horse is weary. He's ready to  give up the ghost.
ADA	f	Good boy. That's warmer, isn't it.
ADA	f	I'm getting firewood.
ADA	f	That wood -- that sound when it burns  that mean more snow?
RUBY	f	Yes, it do, country girl.
ADA	f	Turn round and go back where you  came from.
INMAN	m	Ada? Ada Monroe?
ADA	f	I do not know you.
INMAN	m	Then I believe I made a mistake.
INMAN	m	If I knew where to go I'd go there.
ADA	f	Inman?
ADA	f	You'd better come with me.
ADA	f	Ruby, this is Inman.
RUBY	f	Congratulations, I should send you  out with a shotgun more often. He  looks as he needs sleep.
INMAN	m	I may need to.
RUBY	f	Be my guest. You shot or something?
INMAN	m	Not lately.
RUBY	f	Hungry? He woke up.
ADA	f	Stobrod?
RUBY	f	Said -- your mommy's name was Grace  then closed his eyes again.
ADA	f	He's asleep. They both are.
RUBY	f	I'm not surprised. Your man looks  played out.
ADA	f	I saw him. I realize now.
RUBY	f	Saw him when?
ADA	f	In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of  trees. The man like a black smudge  in the snow, the sun behind him.
RUBY	f	Well there you are.
ADA	f	Funny thing is it wasn't the same.  The image. It wasn't snowing. And in  the well, he was, as if he were  falling.
RUBY	f	You probably don't remember it right.
ADA	f	I remember it exactly. There were  crows, these black crows flying  towards me. I thought I was seeing  him fall. Instead I was seeing him  come back to me. All this while I've  been packing ice around my heart.  How will I make it melt?
RUBY	f	Better get a fire going. I've got big plans for that farm.  Got a vision in my mind of how that  Cove needs to be.
ADA	f	I know you have.
RUBY	f	There's not a thing we can't do  ourselves.
INMAN	m	I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet.
ADA	f	I couldn't sleep.
INMAN	m	-- I got no appetite left to be in a  room with wounded men.
ADA	f	I can't see your face.
INMAN	m	It's not a face you recognised.
ADA	f	Did you get my letters?
INMAN	m	I got three letters. Carried them in  that book you gave me. The Bertram.
ADA	f	I must have sent 100. Did you write  to me?
INMAN	m	Whenever I could. If you never got  them I can summarize.
ADA	f	No, it's --
INMAN	m	I pray you're well. I pray I'm in  your thoughts. You are all that keeps  me from sliding into some dark place.
ADA	f	But how did I keep you? We barely  knew each other. A few moments.
INMAN	m	A thousand moments. They're like a  bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a  black heart. Don't matter if they're  real or things I made up. The shape  of your neck. The way you felt under  my hands when I pulled you to me.
ADA	f	Your boots, one polished, one not  yet polished.
INMAN	m	You're playing a piano and I'm  standing outside.
ADA	f	I'm playing a piano and you're  standing outside.
INMAN	m	That kiss -- which I've kissed again  every day of my walking.
ADA	f	Every day of my waiting.
INMAN	m	Maybe you can't see my face, but if  you could see my inside, my whatever  you want to name it, my spirit, that's  the fear I have deeper than any gash  on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They  kept trying to put me in the ground,  but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no  more ready than that scoundrel in  there's not ready to die on us. But  if I had goodness, I lost it. If I  had anything tender in me I shot it  dead.
RUBY	f	Number one -- shut this door, it's  freezing. Number two -- shut that door, it's  freezing. I'm laying on my back, with my fingers  poked in my ears trying to shut out  who's got a bag of diamonds and who's  got boots needs polishing, If you  want to get three feet up a bull's  ass listen to what sweethearts whisper  to each other.
RUBY	f	In fact, if you're going to wimble  all night I'm going to sleep in with  him.
ADA	f	Now I can't see anything.
INMAN	m	I'll say goodnight.
ADA	f	I don't think Ruby's vacating my hut  so that you can sleep in a different  one.
ADA	f	Come in.
ADA	f	Whatever comes to pass between you  and me, I want Ruby to stay in Black  Cove.
INMAN	m	Right.
ADA	f	As long as she wants. And if she  never leaves I'll be glad.
INMAN	m	More a question could she put up  with me.
ADA	f	And you understand she's my friend,  she's not a hired hand and she doesn't  empty a night jar unless it's her  own.
INMAN	m	Sure.
ADA	f	This war's made some things pointless.  It's hard to imagine a wedding. I  think even my father would recognize  that.
INMAN	m	Ada, I want to marry you. If you'll  have me.
ADA	f	Isn't there's some religion where  you just have to say I marry you,  three times, and then you're man and  wife.
INMAN	m	I marry you. I marry you. I marry  you.
INMAN	m	Why's that funny?
ADA	f	No, I think it's I divorce you three  times and then you're not married  anymore.
INMAN	m	I can wait for you.
ADA	f	You waited enough. I certainly did.  I marry you. I marry you. I marry  you.
ADA	f	I'm sorry about the way I look. In  these clothes. And there are so many buttons. Will you turn your back?
INMAN	m	Not for all the gold dollars in the  Federal Bank.
INMAN	m	You go ahead. I'll follow with the  horse at a pace your daddy can  tolerate.
ADA	f	We can all go together.
INMAN	m	It's safer this way. No one has  quarrel with you.
RUBY	f	He's right.
INMAN	m	I gather I need permission if I reckon  on living at Black Cove.
INMAN	m	We'll get to you by nightfall.
ADA	f	You be safe.
INMAN	m	Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some  category of fly born on the hide of  a cow. It flies up into a tree and  waits and waits until it smells cow.  It can wait a year, two years, I  don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow  comes along and it wakes up, flies  down, lays its eggs on the cow.  There's purpose for you.
ADA	f	And am I the fly in this story, or  the cow?
STOBROD	?	You come up the mountain for me,  darling, I'd be dead otherwise, dead  and gone.
RUBY	f	You'd have found some other fool to  rescue you.
STOBROD	?	He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy.
RUBY	f	If you say a thing and then cough  it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse,  and don't lose him or sell him. We'll  need him on the farm.
RUBY	f	I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing  to the animals.
ADA	f	I thought you were thinking on him!
RUBY	f	I was not. I was thinking on swollen  udders -- and before you say same  difference...
ADA	f	I'm saying nothing.
RUBY	f	Miss lovey-dovey!
INMAN	m	Don't look round.
STOBROD	?	Got it.
INMAN	m	How many men does he have?
STOBROD	?	There were five. You can't reason  with that man.
INMAN	m	I got a conversation stopper. Closer we get to that broken ground  the better.
INMAN	m	You hold on tight, do you hear? When  I say three, look round, nice and  slow.
STOBROD	?	Okay.
INMAN	m	One, two, three.
TEAGUE	m	God damn! You're a hard fucker to  put down. Good directions to that cave from  the fat boy -- saw the squirrels,  sat on the tree made some friends,  brought some back with me.
INMAN	m	Come out of there.
BOSIE	m	No, sir. Here's fine.
INMAN	m	I just have to shoot the horse from  under you.
BOSIE	m	Shoot her. She's not mine. You riding  Mr Teague's mare?
INMAN	m	I am.
BOSIE	m	He dead?
INMAN	m	I hope so. Look, how old are you? Give me your  gun and ride home, I'm done fighting.  I'm sick of it.
BOSIE	m	I give you my gun you'll shoot me  dead.
INMAN	m	I will not shoot you, but nor am I  walking down that mountain looking  over my shoulder for you.
BOSIE	m	That's what they call a conundrum. I  tell you what I've got on my side.
INMAN	m	What have you got on your side?
BOSIE	m	The confidence of youth.
ADA	f	You bring that lamb outside.
GRACE	f	What are you doing!
ADA	f	He came out dead, love.
GRACE	f	Don't kill him!
ADA	f	I'm not going to kill him. But we  have to try something or else he's  going to die.
ADA	f	Isn't that a small mercy.
ADA	f	Hot hot hot hot hot!!!
ADA	f	Grace Inman, nobody said eat. Mr. Thewes...
ADA	f	For good friends, good food, good  family: for all our blessings -- Oh  Lord we thank thee. Amen.
ALL	m	Amen !
