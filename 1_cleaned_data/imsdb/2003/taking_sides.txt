ATTENDANT	?	Dr. Furtw�ngler, the Reichsminister.
REICHSMINISTER	?	Dr. Furtw�ngler, I want to apologise  personally for this power failure.   I was so enjoying the performance.   In times like these we need  spiritual nourishment.
REICHSMINISTER	?	But I welcome this unexpected  opportunity of talking to you. When you came on to the platform  tonight, I thought you weren't  well.  You looked tired, Get away from this bombing. Away from the war.  Yes, you look  tired... Even in this light.
A MAN'S VOICE	m	Look at them. Men, women, kids.  Boy, did they love him. You see,  Steve, Adolf Hitler touched  something deep, real deep and savage  and barbaric, and it won't just go  away overnight. It's got to be  rooted out. You know what I think?  I think they were all Nazis. And  let's face it, their leaders, those  bastards now on trial in Nuremberg,  couldn't have done it alone. It's  these people, they gave all the  help that was needed. Willingly.
THE MAN'S VOICE	m	That's him.  Furtw�ngler. Wilhelm  Furtw�ngler.
WALLACE	m	So, you never heard of him.
STEVE	m	Nope.
WALLACE	m	Do you know who Arturo Toscanini  is?
STEVE	m	Sure.
WALLACE	m	He's as big as Toscanini, maybe  even bigger. In this neck of the  woods, he's probably Bob Hope and  Betty Grable rolled into one.
STEVE	m	Jeez, and I never heard of him.
WALLACE	m	You were in insurance before the  war.
STEVE	m	Right. Claims assessor.
WALLACE	m	Conscientious, determined, dogged.
STEVE	m	They said I was dogged?
WALLACE	m	Well, they say here that when you  went on a case, you stayed on it. Now we can't take every Nazi in  this country to trial, although I  would like to; it's an  impossibility. So we're going for  the big boys in industry, education,  law, culture.
STEVE	m	Like this bandleader.
WALLACE	m	Well, he's more than just a  bandleader, Steve. He's a great  conductor, a gifted artist. But we  believe that he sold himself to  the devil. Your number one priority  from this moment on is to connect  him to the Nazi Party. Don't be  impressed by him. I want the folks  back home to understand why we  fought this war. Find Wilhelm  Furtw�ngler guilty. He represents  everything that was rotten in  Germany.
WALLACE	m	Stay put, Steve. There is some  other stuff that I'd like for you  to see here. Background.
WALLACE	m	Oh, one thing that may be a problem.  Our Occupation Authorities in  Wiesbaden have a duty to help these  poor unfortunates with their  defence. They keep repeating: 'We  must be just, we must be seen to  be just.' Well, I've only one thing  to say to the liberals in Wiesbaden:  fuck 'em. You answer to no one but me. Is  that understood? Show him the film.
PROJECTIONIST	?	Yes, sir. Roll it.
ARCHIVE FILM VOICE	m	That is the hand that dropped the  bombs on defenceless Rotterdam,  Brussels, Belgrade. That is the  hand that destroyed the cities,  villages and homes of Russia. That  is the hand that held the whip  over the Polish, Yugoslav, French  and Norwegian slaves. That is the  hand that took their food.
WALLACE	m	Next reel, please.
ARCHIVE FILM	m	Sanitary conditions were so  appalling that heavy equipment had  to be brought in to speed the work  of cleaning up. This was Bergen  Belsen.
AMERICAN RADIO VOICE	m	Remember, men, no fraternisation.  In a German town, if you bow to a  pretty girl or pat a blond child,  you bow to all that Hitler stood  for. You bow to his reign of blood.   You caress the ideology that meant  death and destruction. You never  know who was a member of the Nazi  Party. Don't be fooled. Don't  fraternise.
BOY	m	Cigarettes, chewing gum?
ADAMS	m	We're gonna have the heating fixed  by tonight.
ADAMS	m	Fr�ulein, this is Major Arnold.  Sir, this is your secretary,  Fr�ulein Emmi Straube. Her file's  on your desk. They sent her over  from Admin. I'll leave you to it.
STEVE	m	You live here, in Berlin?
EMMI	f	Yes.
STEVE	m	You do shorthand and typing?
EMMI	f	Yes.
STEVE	m	Okay, let's see. How long were you  in the camp for?
EMMI	f	Three months.
STEVE	m	Says here because of your father.  What's that mean?
EMMI	f	My father was one of the officers  in the plot against Hitler. They  arrested the plotters and their  families.
STEVE	m	Your mother, too.
EMMI	f	Yes. She suffered longer. She was  in Ravensbruck.
STEVE	m	And your father was executed.
STEVE	m	I'm gonna call you Emmi, you're  gonna call me Steve. Okay?
STEVE	m	I got a list of stuff here I'd  like you to get for me.
ADAMS	m	If you need anything, let me know.
EMMI	f	Major...
STEVE	m	Steve.
EMMI	f	There have been messages for you. A Lieutenant David Wills called  from the Allied Kommandatura  Cultural Affairs office in  Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
EMMI	f	Then there have been three calls  from Dr. Furtw�ngler wanting to  know when you wish to see him. I  did not speak to him personally...
STEVE	m	Think you can get me any of that?
EMMI	f	Oh yes, Major, I have recordings  of all his symphonies. I kept them  safe during the bombing. My  favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
STEVE	m	Mine's the Eleventh.
EMMI	f	But... he only wrote nine, Major.
STEVE	m	I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a  record player? You have that, too?
EMMI	f	No. Ours was damaged.
STEVE	m	What's in those files?
EMMI	f	The names of the members of the  Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since  1934 together with their  questionnaires.  Major, what am I  to tell Dr. Furtw�ngler?
STEVE	m	You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he  calls again, you say you know  nothing. We're gonna keep him  waiting while I get acquainted  with his case and with the  witnesses. And, God help me, with  Beethoven.
STEVE	m	Yeah.
DAVID	m	Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major  Arnold. Sir.
STEVE	m	For Chrissakes I hate that shit,  cut it out.
DAVID	m	I'm very sorry.
STEVE	m	I'm Steve. What's your name?
DAVID	m	David. David Wills. I'm your liaison  officer with the Allied Kommandatura  Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
STEVE	m	Sounds a lot of run. So they sent the big guns to check  up on me. We recruiting children  now?
DAVID	m	I guess so, sir.
STEVE	m	You call me sir again and I'll  make you listen to Beethoven.
STEVE	m	Where you from, David?
DAVID	m	was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped  in '36. My parents, they sent me  to my uncle in Philadelphia. They  were to follow. But they delayed  and...
DAVID	m	Our family name was Weill. But  that doesn't sound well in English.  My uncle changed it to Wills and...
EMMI	f	I'm sorry.
STEVE	m	Come in, Emmi, this is your office,  too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David  Wills.
STEVE	m	He is here to watch over us.
STEVE	m	I guess you admire musicians.
DAVID	m	Some.
STEVE	m	Don't. This is like a criminal  investigation, David. Musicians,  morticians, doctors, lawyers,  butchers, clerks. They're all the  same.
STEVE	m	We have a duty, a moral duty.
EMMI	f	It works!  Hallelujah!
EMMI	f	Herr Rudolf Werner.
STEVE	m	Sit down, Werner.
STEVE	m	I want you to understand why you're  here. This is an investigation  into Wilhelm Furtw�ngler, former  Prussian Privy Councillor, banned  from public life under Control  Council Directive No 24 and who's  applied to come before the Tribunal  of Artists of the Denazification  Commission. I'm interested in what  he was up to from 1933 to the end  of the war, understood?
STEVE	m	Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section  since 1936. What instrument did  you play?
WERNER	m	First oboe.
STEVE	m	I have your questionnaire here. It  says you were never a member of  the Nazi Party.
WERNER	m	Absolutely not.
WERNER	m	No, I was never a Nazi, I have no  interest in politics, I'm a musician -
STEVE	m	Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube  has to take down what you say.
WERNER	m	Straube? Any relation to Colonel  Joachim Straube?
EMMI	f	My father.
WERNER	m	It's a great honour to meet you,  Fraulein. Your father was a great  patriot.
WERNER	m	Dr. Furtw�ngler is a great musician.  He actively opposed the Nazis and  later on he helped many Jews to  escape.
STEVE	m	Then how do you explain him being  made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
WERNER	m	It was Hermann Goering. I was told  he just made the maestro his Privy  Councillor, no questions asked.  Although Dr. Furtw�ngler stood up  to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
STEVE	m	He also conducted for Hitler, didn't  he?
WERNER	m	Yes, that's true, but he refused  to give the Nazi salute. He kept  his baton in his right hand. In  Hitler's presence. That was a brave  act...
STEVE	m	Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's  birthday with some heroic piece by  Wagner but without the Nazi salute?  Bravo.
WERNER	m	It was Beethoven's Ninth.
STEVE	m	Do you really think it was brave?  Didn't he bow to him and shake his  hand?
SCHLEE	f	No, no, no, I give you my word. I  was never a member of the Nazi  Party. Never. I am in the percussion  section. I play the timpani.
SCHLEE	f	Anyway, they would never have  allowed it. My brother was married  to a Jewess, may she rest in peace.  And Goebbels said... ...please take this down carefully,  because it's most important,  Fraulein?
EMMI	f	Straube.
SCHLEE	f	Straube? Are you by any chance  related to Colonel Joachim Straube?
EMMI	f	My father.
SCHLEE	f	He was... he was a great hero.
SCHLEE	f	Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said,  'There's not a single filthy Jew  left in Germany on whose behalf  Dr. Furtw�ngler has not intervened.'  No, no one could have been less of  a Nazi than Dr. Furtw�ngler.
STEVE	m	But this was the same guy who  conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
SCHLEE	f	He was forced to do that. But he  refused to give the Nazi salute in  front of Hitler. He kept his baton  in his hand, you can't salute with  a baton in your hand.
DAVID	m	And what about the Nuremberg Rally?
SCHLEE	f	No, we...we played on the evening  before the Rally.
STEVE	m	Oh! The evening before, I see...
SCHLEE	f	Yes, Dr. Furtw�ngler was absolutely  clear about this: politics and art  must be kept separate.
STEVE	m	Politics and art must be kept  separate. I'll remember that. But  let me see if you can help me with  something I just don't understand.  I'd really like to know why all  you guys are so crazy about him.  What's his secret?
SCHLEE	f	Well, it's hard to explain. I can  only tell you from my own  experience. Soon after I joined  the orchestra, we were rehearsing  the Third Symphony of Beethoven,  the Eroica. There are several rather  difficult passages for the timpani.  One particular crescendo. During  the break, I asked how he wanted  it played. He was studying his  score. He didn't look up. He said,  'Just watch me.'  So, of course, I  did. I never stopped watching him.  The moment came. And suddenly, he  turned to me and our eyes were  locked. There was something in his  look that...  that simply demanded  the crescendo. I shall never forget  his look. It was a moment of... of  magic.
STEVE	m	You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes  when he was making a speech? I've  seen 'em on films.
SCHLEE	f	Yes.
STEVE	m	Was looking at Furtw�ngler like  that?
SCHLEE	f	I don't know what you mean, Major.
STEVE	m	When you got to the crescendo.
STEVE	m	You think a whole orchestra, what,  a hundred and forty or so guys,  could be orchestrated?
DAVID	m	I guess it's possible.
STEVE	m	So, what does the Russki want?
DAVID	m	Colonel Dymshitz asked specially  to see you.
STEVE	m	'Dim-shits'?
STEVE	m	What the hell are they doing?
DAVID	m	They're trying to sort out some of  the works of art the Nazis stole  from occupied territories. Who  really owns what? That's Colonel  Dymshitz, on the far side.
DAVID'S VOICE	m	art historian, head of the famous  Leningrad Museum of Art. He is an  expert on German culture.
VERNAY	m	Je suis navr�, Colonel, cette  peinture n'est pas la propri�t� de  I'union sovi�tique mats bien cette  de la France.
GREEN	m	What's he saying? Henri, what is  you saying?
AMERICAN AIDE	m	He's saying that picture is the  property of France
VERNAY	m	C'est un Braque qui avec Picasso  �tait un des pionniers du cubisme.
DYMSHITZ	?	I know who Georges Braque is,  Captain.
AMERICAN AIDE	m	It's a Barque.
FRENCH AIDE	m	We can produce the provenance of  this Braque, you say provenance?
DYMSHITZ	?	Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz.  I'm glad to see you.
STEVE	m	Colonel. Pleasure.
DYMSHITZ	?	So, Major, tell me, have you  questioned Dr. Furtw�ngler?
STEVE	m	Not yet.
DYMSHITZ	?	I've had two meetings with him.  He's a great musician. Maybe the  greatest conductor in the world.  His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert -  unequalled.
DYMSHITZ	?	I'll come straight to point. I've  offered him a very attractive  position. Conductor of the  Staatsoper Unten den Linden. He  refused. But I want him. I want  him badly. And I want your help.
GREEN	m	Hey, just a moment, you should  have discussed this with me first.
DYMSHITZ	?	I'm discussing it with you now.  Major, I want you to drop your  investigation, save everybody time  and trouble.
GREEN	m	We can't drop a case just like  that.
DYMSHITZ	?	I'll give you another conductor in  exchange or writer, musician, actor  what...what do you care?  But I  like Furtw�ngler. He's my favourite  conductor. Mine and Hitler's. He's our  favourite conductor.
DAVID	m	I clicked my heels, saluted and  bowed at the same time.
EMMI	f	That's because you had a proper  upbringing.
DAVID	m	That's right. I was raised very  strictly. So don't speak before  you are spoken to!
EMMI	f	Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
DAVID	m	Respect your elders and your  betters!
EMMI	f	And no elbows on the table!
DAVID	m	Eating is eating... and...
EMMI	f	And talking is talking! Well, I  think we better get on.
DAVID	m	Right. So, this is going to be  very formal, too, now. Lieutenant  David Wills requests die pleasure  of die company of Fraulein Emmi  Straube at dinner any night she  cares.
STEVE	m	David, need to ask you something.  You heard this rumour the British  found something called the Hinkel  Archive?
DAVID	m	Yes.
STEVE	m	So what is it?
DAVID	m	The British occupy the building  where this guy, Hinkel, ran the  Nazi Ministry of Culture and it  seems they've... they've discovered  his secret archive.
STEVE	m	What's that mean?
DAVID	m	I don't know, but the British are  excited about it, I know that. The  rumour is Hinkel kept a file on  every artist working in the Third  Reich.
STEVE	m	Jeez. And you think the British'll  share it with their Allies?
DAVID	m	Major Richards said he'd call to  let us know.
STEVE	m	That's big of him.
STEVE	m	Okay, better question the next  witness. I bet you a bottle of  French champagne he tells us the  baton story inside ten minutes.
DAVID	m	Five minutes.
STEVE	m	It's a bet. You're the witness,  Emmi.
STEVE	m	Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second  violinist since 1935. What's it  mean, second violinist?
RODE	m	It means I wasn't good enough to  be a first violinist.
STEVE	m	Good, and according to your  questionnaire, Helmuth, you never  joined the Nazi Party.
RODE	m	Me? Never.  Never.
RODE	m	I... I know everyone now says they  were never Nazis but in my case it  is absolutely one hundred per cent  true. I am a Catholic, it would  have been totally against my  conscience.
RODE	m	Is it true you're going to interview  Dr. Furtw�ngler today?
STEVE	m	I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
RODE	m	Excuse me. Did you know that he  refused to give the Nazi salute  when Hitler was present in the  audience?
RODE	m	The problem was how could he avoid  giving the Devil's salute when  Satan was actually sitting there. And, I said, 'Dr. Furtw�ngler, why  not enter with the baton in your  right hand? Hitler will be sitting  in the front row. If you give the  salute with the baton in your right  hand it'll look like you're going  to poke his eyes out.'
RODE	m	He was...He was really grateful to  me for that. After the concert,  I... I stole that baton as a memento  of a great act of courage. I still  have it. I should have brought it  to show you. I hope I'm not going  too fast for you, Fraulein?-
EMMI	f	Straube.
RODE	m	Straube. Any relation to Colonel  Joachim Straube?
EMMI	f	My father.
RODE	m	I am deeply honoured to be in your  presence, Fraulein Straube. Your  father was a true patriot, a man  of God.
STEVE	m	You have a question for Helmuth,  David?
DAVID	m	Yes. What was the orchestra's  reaction when they asked you to  play for Hitler's birthday?
RODE	m	Oh, we didn't play for his birthday,  we played the evening before - it  was the 19th of April not the 20th.
STEVE	m	Do you know Hans Hinkel?
RODE	m	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
STEVE	m	That's what I asked.
RODE	m	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
STEVE	m	You seem to understand the question,  now how about answering it?
RODE	m	Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of  Culture; how could I know such a  man?  I
RODE	m	I hear the British have his... his  archive, files, records.
STEVE	m	Do you know what's in this archive?
RODE	m	How could I know what's in the  archive?
STEVE	m	Okay, you can go now, Helmuth. Get  out.
FURTW�NGLER	?	Furtw�ngler.
EMMI	f	Major, Major... he's here ...
STEVE	m	Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down,  Emmi. We're going to keep him  waiting, too.
STEVE	m	Emmi, get us some coffee, will  you? And, Emmi, don't offer him  coffee. Don't even greet him, okay?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Fraulein?
FURTW�NGLER	?	How long am I to be kept waiting?
STEVE	m	Okay, Emmi, go get him.
EMMI	f	Dr. Furtw�ngler.
STEVE	m	I didn't hear anyone invite you to  sit down.
STEVE	m	Sit there.
STEVE	m	I want you to understand why you're  here. You're automatically banned  from public life under Control  Council Directive No 24. We're  here to look into your case before  you appear in front of the Tribunal  for Artists of the Denazification  Commission. You understand that?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I have already been cleared by a  Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
STEVE	m	What they do in Austria doesn't  interest me one little bit. Okay?   I have your questionnaire here, Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm  Furtw�ngler, born Berlin, January  1886. Orchestral conductor. And  you say here you were never a member  of the Nazi Party.
FURTW�NGLER	?	That is correct.
STEVE	m	Could you tell us about being made  a Prussian Privy Councillor. How  did that happen to a non-Party  member?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I received a telegram from Hermann  Goering informing me that he had  made me a Privy Councillor. I was  not given the opportunity either  to accept or refuse. After the  dreadful events of November 1938,  the violent attacks on the Jews, I  stopped using the title.
STEVE	m	What about Vice-President of the  Chamber of Music, you used that  title didn't you? But then I suppose  you had no choice there either,  because I suppose Dr. Goebbels  just sent you a telegram saying,  Dear Mr. Vice-President.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me  a telegram. I was simply told. In  a letter, I believe. I don't  remember exactly.
STEVE	m	Goebbels and Goering were sure  heaping honours on you. One makes  you a Privy Councillor, the other  makes you Vice-President of the  Chamber of Music, and you weren't  even a member of the Party, how do  you explain that?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Well, there was a constant battle  between Goering and Goebbels as to  which of them would control German  culture. I was simply a pawn.   Anyway, I resigned from the  Musikkammer at the same time I  resigned as Musical Director of  the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.  In 1934.
DAVID	m	Why was that? Why did you resign,  Dr. Furtw�ngler?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I wrote an open letter to the  newspapers condemning what they  were doing to music, making these  distinctions between Jews and non- Jews. For my part, the only divide  in art is between good and bad.  Eventually, Goebbels summoned me  and told me I could leave the  country if I wanted to but under  no condition would I ever be allowed  to return. I always believe that  you have to fight from the inside  not from without. I asked myself,  what's the duty of an artist, to  stay or to leave? And then Goebbels  demanded that I acknowledge Hitler  as solely responsible for cultural  policy. Well, that was a fact and  it seemed pointless to deny it. I  simply acknowledged that Hitler  and the Minister of Culture  appointed by him were solely  responsible for the cultural policy  of the Reich. What I wanted to  express was that I, personally,  had no responsibility whatsoever  for their cultural policy. I have  always had the view that art and  politics should... should have  nothing to do with each other.
STEVE	m	Then why did you conduct at one of  their Nuremberg rallies?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I did not conduct at at the rally,  I conducted on the evening before  the rally.
STEVE	m	That sounds like the small print  in one of our insurance policies,  Wilhelm. And what about April 19,  1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration;  you conducted for Hitler, didn't  you? Was that in keeping with your  view that art and politics have  nothing to do with each other?
FURTW�NGLER	?	That... that was a different matter,  I... I was tricked.
STEVE	m	How come?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Could I have a glass of water,  please? Please, Fraulein?
EMMI	f	Straube.
FURTW�ANGLER	?	Thank you. I was in Vienna,  rehearsing the Ninth Symphony of  Beethoven, when Goebbels called  and said I had to conduct at  Hitler's birthday. I'd always  managed to wriggle out of such  invitations, pleading previous  engagements, illness, having my  doctors state I was not well and  so on and so on. I was also  fortunate that Baldur von Shirach,  who controlled Vienna, hated Dr.  Goebbels and would do anything to  thwart his wishes. But this time  Goebbels got to my doctors before  me; they were frightened off, and  von Schirach was threatened, bullied  and gave in. So, I had no  alternative but to conduct for  Hitler. Believe me, I knew I had  compromised, and I deeply regret  it.
STEVE	m	Doesn't sound much of a trick to  me. Sounds like you made a deal.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I made no deal!
STEVE	m	I don't buy that.
FURTW�NGLER	?	It's the truth.
STEVE	m	I keep hearing you helped a lot of  Jews to escape. How did you do  that?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I don't remember in detail, there  were so many.
STEVE	m	Did you call someone you knew?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I may have, as... as I said, I  simply don't remember.
STEVE	m	Let me me help you, then. You picked  up the phone and made a call - 'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking.  Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy  musician I want you to help. He  needs a permit to get to Paris.'
STEVE	m	Or maybe you called Goebbels or  Goering? You were so close you  were in the same shithouse as them.
FURTW�NGLER	?	May I ask a question?
STEVE	m	Sure.
FURTW�NGLER	?	When will my case be heard by the  Tribunal?
STEVE	m	Your guess is as good as mine.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I need to work. I need to make my  living. I live off the generosity  of friends...
STEVE	m	Tough, tough!
FURTW�NGLER	?	Then why is it, please, that another  conductor who was actually a member  of the Party, who used to play the  Horst Wessel before his concerts,  has already been cleared and is  working again while I have to wait  and wait and wait?
STEVE	m	I don't know, he wasn't my case.  Why did you escape to Switzerland  just before the war ended?
FURTW�NGLER	?	It was because I learned that the  Gestapo was about to arrest me.
STEVE	m	Why were they going to arrest you?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I believe it was because of another  letter I'd written to Goebbels  lamenting the decline of musical  standards due to racial policies.
STEVE	m	You didn't complain about the racial  policies, just about the musical  standards, is that right?
STEVE	m	So, how did you learn that the  Gestapo was out to get you?
FURTW�NGLER	?	During an enforced hour-long  interval because of a power failure  at a concert here in Berlin, Albert  Speer, the Minister of Armaments,  said to me, 'You look very tired  Dr. Furtw�ngler, you should go  abroad for a while.' I knew exactly  what he meant.
STEVE	m	You sure knew a lot of people in  high places.
FURTW�NGLER	?	It would be truer to say, I think,  that a lot of people in high places  knew me.
STEVE	m	You were real close to all of them,  to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph,  to Baldur, and now Albert, So, let's hear the truth, let's  come clean. What was your Party  number?
FURTW�NGLER	?	If you are going to bully me like  this, Major, you had better do  your homework. You obviously have  no idea how impertinent and stupid  your questions are.
STEVE	m	David, you remember I said I had a  question that he wouldn't be able  to answer? Well, I'm gonna ask it  now.  You ready for this, Wilhelm?  It's a tough one. Why didn't you  get out right at the start when  Hitler came to power in 1933? Why  didn't you leave Germany?
STEVE	m	I have a list of names here, people  in your profession, who got out in  '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer,  Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
FURTW�NGLER	?	They were Jews, they had to leave.  They were right to leave. I could not leave my country in  her deepest misery. After all, I  am a German.  I... I stayed in my  homeland. Is that my sin in your  eyes?
STEVE	m	See, David? He can't answer the  question. I'll ask it again,  Wilhelm, and don't give me any  more airy-fairy, intellectual  bullshit!
EMMI	f	Major Arnold's office. Yes, he is.
EMMI	f	It's Major Richards for Lieutenant  Wills.
DAVID	m	David Wills. Yes, sir. Well, you want me to tell him?  Okay, Major Richards wants a word with  you, sir.
STEVE	m	Why can't he just ask for me? Why  does he have to ask for you first?  Goddamn British, so correct!
STEVE	m	Steve Arnold...
FURTW�NGLER	?	I've had enough of this, I'm  leaving.
DAVID	m	Dr. Furtw�ngler!  Dr. Furtw�ngler!  Please, please... Don't. It's not advisable.
DAVID	m	When I was a child, my father, he  took me to... he took me to one of  your concerts. I remember you  conducted Beethoven's Fifth  Symphony. I was deeply moved. And  I've loved music ever since. I was  grateful to you. And I've admired  you. How could you... how could  you serve those criminals?
STEVE	m	How many?  Jesus, that's dynamite! Okay.
EMMI	f	Dr. Furtw�ngler.
STEVE	m	Well now. Aren't we all sociable?
STEVE	m	I've got to hand it to the British,  David. You know what those guys  are?  Decent. Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtw�ngler, do  you know Hans Hinkel?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Yes, a despicable human being. He  was in the Ministry of Culture.  His job was to get rid of Jews in  the arts.
STEVE	m	Yup, that's him, that's the guy.  You know what else the little creep  did? He kept files, close on 250,000  files. And you know what's in those  files?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Certainly not, but I knew he had  informers everywhere. Even in my  orchestra there was someone
STEVE	m	Who?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I wasn't told. I just knew it.
STEVE	m	How?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I was warned.
STEVE	m	Who warned you?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Goering. Because Hinkel was working  for Goebbels.
STEVE	m	What did Goering say?
FURTW�NGLER	?	He told me to be careful as one of  Goebbels' men was watching me. He  read a report on me - everything I  said was quoted word by word.
STEVE	m	Oh boy, you're gonna love this.  Take your time with this now. Those  files contain the details of every  working artist in this country.  Those files are gonna tell us who  joined the Party, who informed and  who was helpful.
SECURITY	m	Your name, please.
DAVID	m	David Wills.
SECURITY	m	Over there.
STEVE	m	Fantastic! The only condition is  we have to do the work here. I  want you to collect all the files  on the boys in the band.
EMMI	f	Maybe you can have a look at this.
DAVID	m	Schubert.
DYMSHITZ	?	Dr. Furtw�ngler -
DYMSHITZ	?	Moving, you agree? Whenever I hear  Schubert I am moved.  You agree?
FURTW�NGLER	?	The tempi were a little too correct  for my taste. But I expect that is  because of the rain.
DYMSHITZ	?	Wait, Doctor, I understand you  have difficulties with the  Americans. I want you to know, I  am your champion. We can help.
EMMI	f	What does he mean, too correct?
DAVID	m	I don't know.
STEVE	m	Well, what is this, the office  party?
STEVE	m	May I join you? So, what have you two been up to  tonight? Hey. Don't I owe you a  bottle of French champagne?
STEVE	m	You know, David, you're a lucky  guy. I invited Emmi here but she  turned me down. You must've hidden  depths, David...
STEVE	m	C'mon, Emmi, let's dance. I'll  teach you how to jive.
DAVID	m	I'm very sorry, Major, but I  promised her mother, we have to  go.
EMMI	f	Don't see me to my door, there's  no need.
DAVID	m	But I promised your mother.
EMMI	f	Well, sleep well.
EMMI	f	Excuse me, Major. I found this on  Helmuth Rode. You remember? The  second violinist? Look, he's  Austrian not German. But it's this  that's more important, I think...
AN OFFICER	m	Sssh!
SERGEANT	m	Lieutenant Wills, telephone -
THE OFFICER	m	What is this, a railway station?
DAVID	m	David. Wills. Hello? Who? Who in  Wiesbaden?
RODE	m	Major.
STEVE	m	Helmuth.
RODE	m	Guess what I am holding in my hand.  You like guessing games?
STEVE	m	Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What  are you holding in your hand?
RODE	m	It's Dr. Furtw�ngler's baton, which  I stole.
STEVE	m	The one he kept in his right hand.   Yes, you remember.
RODE	m	Yes, you remember.
STEVE	m	How could I forget?
STEVE	m	Show me.
RODE	m	Show you?
STEVE	m	Yeah, show me, I want to see you  do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're  the maestro, and you have the baton  in your right hand, but you give  me the salute just the same.
RODE	m	Not here, Major, there are people,  if anybody should see... please,  please, Major...
STEVE	m	Do it, Helmuth.
STEVE	m	Do it right.
STEVE'S VOICE	m	You look great doing that.
STEVE	m	And I see what you mean. You nearly  poked my eyes out.
RODE	m	Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives  Steve the case.
STEVE	m	Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our  secret.
BOY	m	Mister, mister, here, here,  mister!!!
STEVE	m	Great catch, kid. The boy runs  off.
RODE	m	So. You wanted to see me.
RODE	m	You usually don't work on Sunday,  Major?
STEVE	m	All in the cause of humanity,  Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
RODE	m	What?
STEVE	m	One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call  you 'one'?
STEVE	m	You know what I say you are,  Helmuth? I say you're a piece of  shit.
RODE	m	That bastard!
STEVE	m	Who's the bastard, Helmuth? Hinkel?
STEVE	m	Why? He promised to remove your  file?
STEVE	m	And what about before that? What  were you a member of in Austria?
STEVE	m	Was a member of...?  Speak up?
RODE	m	(barely audible) I was a member of the Communist  Party. I was a communist. That's  what Hinkel had over me. He knew  everything. He held that over me.  That's how he made me co-operate.
STEVE	m	Oh, I see, he made you co-operate.  And now are you a communist again?
RODE	m	You don't know what it's like to  wake up every single morning of  your life terrified, you don't  know that -
RODE	m	I would never, in my wildest dreams,  have ever been a second violinist  in the Berlin Philharmonic. When  they got rid of the... the Jews in  the orchestra, it gave people like  me a chance.
STEVE	m	Helmuth, you ever heard of plea- bargaining?
STEVE	m	Talk about power, I have the power  to give you work, make your life  easier. Your past won't be  mentioned. I could give you a job  tomorrow but I have to get something  in return. See, Helmuth? That's  plea-bargaining.
STEVE	m	I can give you freedom of movement,  freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth.  But I need something in return.
RODE	m	Major, we're discussing a man of  genius, I don't want...
STEVE	m	Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to  discuss symbols here?  This guy  was a front man. He was the piper,  but he played their tune, you get  my philosophical meaning?  I'm not  interested in small fish, I'm after  Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard  facts.
RODE	m	The only thing I know is he's an  anti-Semite.
STEVE	m	Of course. You, too. Like everyone  else in this goddamn country.
RODE	m	I've remembered something else...
STEVE	m	Yeah?
RODE	m	Furtw�ngler sent Hitler a telegram  for his birthday.
STEVE	m	He did?
RODE	m	One of your people told me.
STEVE	m	One of my people?
RODE	m	Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew.  He said he'd seen the telegram in  the Chancellery.
STEVE	m	Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the  corporal and we'll find the  telegram.
STEVE	m	But I need documentary proof. You  know of anything like that?
RODE	m	No. But that's why we hated him.  We admired him as a conductor but  we all hated him too because he  didn't have to join the Party and  yet he had a better life than any  of us. He didn't have to go and  deliver a report after every trip  abroad. He got everything from  them, everything. He was filthier  than any of us Party members.
RODE	m	There's a rumour... I don't know  if it's true or not... but ask him  about von der Null.
STEVE	m	Never heard of him, who is he?
RODE	m	Edwin von der Null. Music critic.  He gave Furtw�ngler terrible reviews  while he raved about Herbert von  Karajan.
STEVE	m	Who's he?
RODE	m	Also a conductor. Very brilliant.  Young. Von der Null called him  'The Miracle von Karajan'.   Furtw�ngler was outraged and they  say he had von der Null conscripted  into the army. The same thing  happened to another critic. True  or not, it's not such a bad idea.   Critics give you bad reviews, you  have them sent to the Russian front. But if you really want to get  Furtw�ngler, ask him about Herbert  von Karajan.
STEVE	m	The Miracle Kid.
RODE	m	Yes, yes you may notice that he  cannot even bring himself to utter  his name, he... he refers to him  as K.
RODE	m	And ask him about his private life.
STEVE	m	His private life?
RODE	m	Yes, it's all in here. His women.
MARTIN	m	Where do you stand on all this?
DAVID	m	On all what?
MARTIN	m	On Furtw�ngler.
DAVID	m	I don't know.
MARTIN	m	You represent the United States  now. We have a moral duty to be  just and we have to be seen to be  just.
DAVID	m	Major Arnold believes he has a  moral duty, too.
MARTIN	m	Our duty is to help Furtw�ngler  with his defence, That's why I want you to look at  this... These are part of the transcripts  of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't  get them translated fast enough.  But I guess you understand German,  right?
MARTIN	m	That's the evidence of a guy named  Dahlerus. He's a Swede. Friend of  Hermann Goering. I want you to  study it. And I want you to use  it.
MARTIN	m	We're going to find more stuff to  feed you. We'll have some other  suggestions. We need to build a  case for the defence - based not  on feelings, not on prejudice, but  on facts.
WERNER	m	Lieutenant Wills.
WERNER	m	Herr Schlee, timpanist, Herr Romer,  cello and Herr Schmidt, viola.  They are willing to help. We have  already ordered ourselves coffee.  I hope you...
DAVID	m	Yeah, of course.
WERNER	m	The whole orchestra will vouch for  him. He was always there to support  us.
DAVID	m	We need names, if possible with  addresses, because it's urgent.  Names of musicians saved by Dr.  Furtw�ngler, people he helped to  escape abroad. Let's go somewhere  public.
DYMSHITZ	?	To co-operation.
STEVE	m	I was in Vienna. I had with me an  Austrian chauffeur, Max his name  was, he spent time in the camps.  We were looking at these Viennese  cleaning up the bomb damage,  scavenging for rotting food, butt  ends, anything. I said, 'To think  a million of these people came out  to welcome Adolf on the day he  entered the city, a million of  'em, and now look at 'em.'  And  Max said, 'Oh, not these people,  Major. These people were all at  home hiding Jews in their attics.'  You get the point, Colonel? The  point is they're all full of shit.
DYMSHITZ	?	Furtw�ngler's in a different  category.
STEVE	m	We're dealing with degenerates  here.
DYMSHITZ	?	Degenerates?
DYMSHITZ	?	A great artist will have great  privileges in a Russian zone.
STEVE	m	That's why he didn't get the hell  out of here when he had the chance!  I put that to him, he couldn't  answer. Why didn't he go and direct  in America, like that Italian,  Toscanini.
DYMSHITZ	?	Perhaps... perhaps he believed he  could at least try to preserve  something important, things like  an orchestra, a school. That's his  country. Maybe he has an old mother  who can't be left alone. Maybe he  has brothers, sisters... you  can't...
STEVE	m	Colonel. He had no sisters, no  brothers, only a lot of love  affairs.
DYMSHITZ	?	Anyway, Major, why should he leave  his country, his mother tongue,  his family, his history, his past,  his future, just because now,  suddenly, there is a dictatorship?  Why?
STEVE	m	But what... before that turns  rotten...  What if they surround  the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
DYMSHITZ	?	Don't talk about things you know  nothing about. He was in a  dictatorship!
STEVE	m	(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah,  yeah, I heard all about that.
DYMSHITZ	?	In a dictatorship, art belongs to  the Party. If you want to be a  conductor, you have to have an  orchestra. And you can only get an  orchestra if you have contact with  the power. All over the world you  need the right contacts and you  have to make the right compromises.
STEVE	m	This is what I'm saying. He must  have had Party contacts.
DYMSHITZ	?	There are good Party members who  help, and there are dirty non-Party  members who inform on you. Of  course, they gave him privileges.
DYMSHITZ	?	And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you  notice that they like you. They  honour you, suddenly you are the  director of the best museum in the  world, for example.
STEVE	m	What museum?
DYMSHITZ	?	I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said  orchestra. Sorry. Believe me. Help me, Steve. You say you answer  for someone from high up. I, too,  have orders from high up. Very  high up. We want Furtw�ngler. I'll  give you in return the whole  orchestra, four, five conductors.  I need him, Steve.
STEVE	m	No can do.
DYMSHITZ	?	Let Furtw�ngler go. Please.
STEVE	m	I have a duty.
DYMSHITZ	?	Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking  duty. Trouble is, you Americans  want everybody to live like you.  We liberated Berlin, Major Steve,  not you. Our duty also is to bring  back the best of German culture.
STEVE	m	I'm gonna get that fucking  bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No  fucking deal.
DYMSHITZ	?	Then you're going to kill me.
ARCHIVES	m	You'll see ruins, you'll see  flowers, you'll see some mighty  pretty scenery, don't let it fool  you. You are in enemy country. The  Nazi party may be gone, but Nazi  thinking, Nazi training and Nazi  trickery remain. Somewhere in this  Germany are two million ex-Nazi  officials. Out of power but still  in there and thinking, thinking  about next time. Remember that  only yesterday every business,  every profession was part of  Hitler's system. Practically every  German was part of the Nazi network.  They believed they were born to be  masters. Don't argue with them.  You are not being sent Germany as  educators. You're a soldier on  guard. You will observe their local  laws, respect their costumes and  religion and you will respect their  property rights. You will not be  friendly. You will be aloof,  watchful and suspicious.
DAVID	m	Yesterday I read that Furtw�ngler  was asked to lead the New York  Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini  suggested it. Had he accepted, he  would have become the most  celebrated conductor in America.
EMMI	f	When he made his decision, he  couldn't have known everything.  Especially not the way people like  you do, who've returned from exile  and feel that you have a right to  pass judgement. Because you are  blameless, you think you know best  who is a sinner and who deserves  forgiveness. But you have no idea  how people lived here.
DAVID	m	When he met Hitler at his birthday  and shook hands with him, was he  pleased?
EMMI	f	I don't know. But you and I already  know that he has saved lives.
EMMI	f	Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
STEVE	m	Do you know where the Adagio begins?
EMMI	f	Of course.
STEVE	m	Put it on ready to play, and I'll  tell you when to play it.
FURTW�NGLER	?	It is now nine o'clock precisely.  I do not intend to be kept waiting  again.
STEVE	m	Don't talk to me like I was a second  violinist. Go back into the waiting  room. Miss Straube will come and  get you when I am ready to see  you.
STEVE	m	Jesus God, who the hell does he  think he is? Who the hell does he  think he is?
RODE	m	Would you perhaps like to have a  glass of water, Herr Professor?
FURTW�NGLER	?	What is this man doing here?
STEVE	m	Dr. Furtw�ngler!  Come in, come  in, sit down.
STEVE	m	No, no, take this one, it's more  comfortable
STEVE	m	If it's too hot, open your tie.
FURTW�NGLER	?	(interrupting) I wish to say something.
STEVE	m	Go ahead, be my guest.
FURTW�NGLER	?	When I last saw you, I was  unprepared. I did not know what to  expect. In these past weeks, I  have been thinking more carefully  and making some notes. You have to understand who I am  and what I am. I am a musician and  I believe in music. I am an artist  and I believe in art. Art in  general, and music, in particular,  has for me mystical powers which  nurture man's spiritual needs. I  must confess, however, to being  extremely naive.  I insisted for  many years on the absolute  separation of art and politics. My  entire life was devoted to music  because, and this is very important,  because I thought that I could,  through music, do something  practical.
STEVE	m	And what was that?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Maintain liberty, humanity and  justice.
STEVE	m	Gee, that's a thing of beauty,  honest to God, a real thing of  beauty. I'm going to try to remember  that. Liberty, humanity and justice.  Beautiful. But you used the word  'naive'. Are you now saying you  think you were wrong? That art and  politics can't be separated?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I believe art and politics should  be separate, but that they weren't  kept separate I learned to my cost.
STEVE	m	And when did you first learn that -  when you sent the telegram? Was  that the surrender signal, the  waving of the white flag?
FURTW�NGLER	?	What telegram?
STEVE	m	'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love  Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect.  That sounds to me like you were  dropping on your knees and saying,  'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the  number one man. Have a swell party.'
FURTW�NGLER	?	I have no idea what you're talking  about.
STEVE	m	The birthday greetings you sent to  your old pal, Adolf Hider.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I never sent him any birthday  greetings or any other kind of  greetings.
STEVE	m	Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe  not in your own name, but as Privy  Councillor or Vice-President.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I don't have to think carefully.  This is utterly ridiculous.
STEVE	m	Yes, David?
DAVID	m	Why not show Dr. Furtw�ngler the  evidence. It may refresh his memory?
FURTW�NGLER	?	You won't find it because no such  telegram exists.
STEVE	m	Well, I tried, you got to admit I  tried. I thought I might just trap  you there, Wilhelm, but David here  was too quick for me. Smart move,  David, smart move. No, I don't  have the telegram, but I know it  exists. And I want you to know,  Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking  for it because I believe you sent  it.
FURTW�NGLER	?	Then you are wrong.
STEVE	m	Art and politics, yeah, art and  politics. Let's look at that. You  and the Berlin Philharmonic toured  the Third Reich, played in countries  the Nazis had conquered. Are you  saying that conducting in occupied  territories from 1939 on wasn't a  commercial for Adolf and all he  stood for?
FURTW�NGLER	?	We never, never officially  represented the regime when we  played abroad. We always performed  as a private ensemble. As I think  I already told you, I was a  freelance conductor.
STEVE	m	You know something? You should've  written our insurance policies for  us because you got more exclusion  clauses than Double Indemnity.  What do you imagine people thought?  The Berlin Philharmonic's taken  over by Doctor Goebbels and his  Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is  a freelance, so art and politics  are now entirely separate? Is that  what you believed ordinary people  thought?
FURTW�NGLER	?	have no idea what ordinary people  thought.
STEVE	m	No!
FURTW�NGLER	?	No, because I had only one  intention. My only intention  whatever I did was to show that  music means more than politics.
STEVE	m	Tell me about von der Null.
FURTW�NGLER	?	Von der Null?
STEVE	m	Yes, von der Null.
FURTW�NGLER	?	Von der Null?
STEVE	m	How long's this going to go on,  Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you  say von der Null, I say von der  Null, you say von der Null, we  could go on all day. You know who  von der Null is, don't you? Edwin  von der Nuell, music critic.
FURTW�NGLER	?	Yes, I know who he is.
STEVE	m	Isn't it true that because he gave  you bad reviews and praised this  young guy, Von Karajan, called him  a goddamn miracle, said he was a  better conductor than you, then  you had von der Null conscripted  into the army and no one's heard  from him since?
FURTW�NGLER	?	That's an outrageous lie!
STEVE	m	You sure you didn't call one of  your close buddies and say, God in  heaven, did you see what that guy  von der Null wrote about me? The  greatest conductor on earth. I  want him out the way. He had the  nerve to accuse me I am not playing  enough modern music. Send him to  Stalingrad. Isn't that what you  did? You don't like criticism, do  you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't  like them saying there was another  conductor who was better than you...  Are you saying the name von der  Null was never mentioned in your  talks with Goebbels?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Well. Once he said he'd read what  this man wrote about me.
STEVE	m	And what did he say?
FURTW�NGLER	?	He said, 'Don't mind him. His job  is to criticise, your job is to  conduct.'
STEVE	m	And what happened to Von der Nul?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I have no idea.
STEVE	m	You've really no idea? I'll tell  you what happened. He died in  Stalingrad.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I'm sorry.
STEVE	m	Now, that young conductor what's  his name? That miracle kid, you know who I  mean. Von Karajan! But you called  him something else. C'mon. What  did you call von Karajan?
STEVE	m	Say it.
STEVE	m	I'll say it, then. 'Little K.' Is  that right? You couldn't even bear  to say his name!
FURTW�NGLER	?	Please stop playing these games  with me. Why you should bring up  the name of another conductor is  beyond my understanding.
STEVE	m	I'll tell you why. You remember we  talked about you playing for  Hitler's birthday?  And you told  me that Goebbels got to your doctors  first, that you were tricked?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Yes, that's what happened.
STEVE	m	I have a different story to tell.  I don't think you were tricked.  Not in the way you describe. I  believe something else happened.  I've seen the Hinkel Archive, I've  seen records of phone calls, and  putting it all together, this is  what I think happened. I think  Goebbels said, 'Wilhelm, if you  won't conduct for Adolf's birthday,  we'll get the Miracle Kid, the guy  that critic, von der Null, thinks  is the greatest conductor in the  world. He's not just willing to  conduct for Adolf, he's offered to  sing "Happy Birthday" as a solo.'
STEVE	m	Come on, admit it. K worried you,  didn't he? He always worried you.  In 1942, he's thirty-four years  old, you're already fifty-six. And  Goebbels and Goering keep saying  to you, 'If you don't do it, little  K will.' Never mind art and politics  and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit  about liberty, humanity and justice  because I don't care how great you  are. It's the oldest story in the  book, The ageing Romeo jealous of the  young buck. The real reason you  didn't leave the country when you  knew you should have was that you  were frightened that, once you  were out of the way, you'd be  supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the  Party's boy twice over, flashy,  talented little K.
FURTW�NGLER	?	This is absolute nonsense!
STEVE	m	Well, I'm just beginning to develop  my theme. Isn't that what you call  it in classical music, developing  your theme? Okay, so they played  on your insecurity. That's human,  understandable. But, there is one  guy who doesn't like little K as  much as he likes you - yeah, the  number one man your old pal, Adolf.  He thinks you're the greatest, and  when he says, I want Wilhelm for  my birthday, boy, they better go  out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls  and threatens you with little K.  And you said to hell with the Ninth  in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf  as a birthday present in Berlin.  That's the trick they played, they  got you by the balls and they  squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay?  Why did you play for them? Why  were you the flag-carrier for their  regime?  Jealousy?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Of course there was a conspiracy  against me, a campaign - even  abroad.
STEVE	m	You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about  ordinary, everyday reasons. Which  is why I want to discuss your  private life.  How many illegitimate  children do you have?
DAVID	m	Major, I don't see how this line  of questioning could...
STEVE	m	David, what are you Counsel for  the Defence now? ( Did you hear the question?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I have illegitimate children.
STEVE	m	What?
FURTW�NGLER	?	I said I have illegitimate children.  I don't know how many.
STEVE	m	You like the women, don't you,  Wilhelm?
STEVE	m	Isn't it true that before every  concert you got a woman in your  dressing room and gave her the old  conductor's baton, isn't that true?
DAVID	m	Major, this is deeply offensive  and repugnant!
STEVE	m	You bet.
DAVID	m	and totally irrelevant.
STEVE	m	Not so, Counsellor. That secretary  of yours, she wasn't just your  secretary, she procured women for  you, didn't she? As many and as  often as you wanted.
FURTW�NGLER	?	Stop this, please, stop this now!
STEVE	m	No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler  himself offered you a beautiful  house and a personal bomb shelter.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I absolutely refused the house and  the bomb shelter.
STEVE	m	But you see what I'm getting at?  You get a gorgeous house, you're  highly paid. What are you gonna  do, stay or leave? One voice comes  back at me: stay!
DAVID	m	Major, that's not a good argument.  If Dr. Furtw�ngler did indeed enjoy  all these... these privileges, he  enjoyed them because of who he is  and what he is. That's true of any  leading artist in any country in  the world.
STEVE	m	But it still doesn't make them  saints. They still have to get up  and piss in the middle of the night,  don't they? They can still be  vindictive and envious and mean  just like you and me. Well, just  like me. Can't they?
STEVE	m	Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go  home and think about these past  twelve years.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I don't understand what you mean.
STEVE	m	No, that's your problem, Wilhelm.  You understand nothing. We'll call  you. Go!
DAVID	m	Major.
STEVE	m	What?
DAVID	m	Your manner.
STEVE	m	My manner? Why don't you go  downstairs, get a cup of coffee  and calm down? What's the matter,  Emmi? What's going on with you?  What's wrong?
EMMI	f	I'm sorry but I have to leave.  I'll find other work. You'll have  to get someone else, that's all.
STEVE	m	What is this, Emmi?
EMMI	f	I can't do this. It's not right.
STEVE	m	What's not right?
EMMI	f	I have been questioned by the  Gestapo just like that. Just like  you questioned him.
STEVE	m	Emmi, stop! I want to show you  something. Let me show you something  and then if you want to leave, you  can leave, please please. His  friends, they did this. And he  gave them birthday concerts.
EMMI	f	But he had no idea, a lot of people  had no idea. I only realised what  was really going on when I got  arrested.
STEVE	m	If he had no idea, why did the  Jews need saving? This is the  question, Emmi, to all Germans:  Why did the Jews need saving in  this country? Why, if people had  no idea?
EMMI	f	I would like to go now, please.
DAVID	m	Can I ask you a favour, Major?
STEVE	m	Yeah.
DAVID	m	When you question him again, could  you treat him with more respect?
STEVE	m	With more what? More what?
DAVID	m	Major, he may just be the greatest  conductor of this century and that  merits respect.
STEVE	m	David, I don't understand a thing  about you. You're a Jew. Are you a  Jew?
DAVID	m	Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think  first I'm a human being.
STEVE	m	A human being, oh, good, I'm  relieved, I thought you were going  to say you were a music lover.  This man, this great artist has  made anti-Semitic remarks like you  wouldn't believe. I got letters.
DAVID	m	Major, show me someone who hasn't  made an anti-Semitic remark and  I'll show you the gates of paradise.
STEVE	m	What is it with you, David? Where  are your feelings? Where's your  hatred, your disgust? Where's your  fucking outrage, David?
STEVE	m	Think of your parents, David, and  then think of him conducting 'Happy  Birthday, dear Adolf'. I mean, for  Chrissake, whose side are you on?  Grow up! Just grow the fuck up!
DAVID	m	I want you to come back to the  office. May I come in? If you are  there you can influence what  happens. What good can you do by  leaving. If you go, you are giving  up and how can you help Furtw�ngler  or me? Don't think about leaving.  Stay.
STEVE	m	Everybody says what a great  benefactor you were to the Jews.   But-- I have things here you said and  wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew  composer Schonberg is admired by  the Jewish International.' And  what about this: 'Jewish musicians  lack a genuine affinity with our  music.' 'Jewish musicians are good  businessmen with few scruples,  lacking roots.' You deny you said  these things?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Those attitudes do not exist in  me.
STEVE	m	I believe that. But just answer  the question, don't give me  explanations.
FURTW�NGLER	?	Speaking to Party members I used  their language, of course I did,  everyone did.
DAVID	m	Major, sorry to interrupt, but  maybe we have to... maybe we have  to balance those things against  his assistance to his Jewish  colleagues.
DAVID	m	This is a transcript of the  proceedings at Nuremberg. A Swedish businessman, Birger  Dahlerus, testified in cross- examination that he had several  meetings with Hermann Goering. 'I  first saw Goering,' Dahlerus  testified, 'embroiled in a stormy  interview with Wilhelm Furtw�ngler,  the famous conductor of the Berlin  Philharmonic, who was vainly seeking  permission to keep his Jewish  concert master.
DAVID	m	Emmi, pick one of these, any one,  read it out loud.
EMMI	f	'Please remember that Dr.  Furtw�ngler risked his life to  help anyone who asked him. I  personally testify to having seen  literally hundreds of people lined  up outside his dressing room after  concerts to ask for his help. He  never turned anyone away. After he  heard me play... I am a violinist...  he gave me money because I was  unable to feed myself or my family  and then he helped me to escape to  Sweden. He helped countless people  in similar ways.'
DAVID	m	And this, only one of these letters,  Major. I have lots of them.
STEVE	m	How many times have I got to tell  you I was in insurance? You think  I can't smell a phoney policy when  it's shoved under my nose? Sure,  he helped Jews, but that was just  insurance, his cover, because all  the while he was maestro of all he  surveyed, See, Wilhelm, I think you're their  boy, their creature. You were like  an advertising slogan for them:  this is what we produce, the  greatest conductor in the world.  And you went along with it. The  truth of the matter is, Wilhelm,  you didn't need to be a member of  the Party. I made a mistake when I  asked you for your Party number. I  should've asked you for your non- Party number. Just like some other  well-known artists. Emmi, put that record on.
STEVE	m	Do you know what that is?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Of course I know what that is.
STEVE	m	Okay, so what is it?
FURTW�NGLER	?	Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
STEVE	m	Who's conducting?
FURTWANGLBR	?	I am.
STEVE	m	You know the last time it was played  on these air waves?
FURTW�NGLER	?	How can I know such a thing?
STEVE	m	I'll tell you, then. The last time  this music was played on these air  waves was after they announced  that your pal Hitler had shot  himself. Listen to it.  They listen.   Did they pick little K's recording?  Did they pick some other conductor?  No, they picked you, and why?  Because you represented them so  beautifully. When the Devil died,  they wanted his bandleader to  conduct the funeral march. You  were everything to them.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I have always tried to analyse  myself carefully and closely. In  staying here, I believed I walked  a tightrope between exile and the  gallows. You seem to be blaming me  for not having allowed myself to  be hanged.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I didn't directly oppose the Party  because I told myself, that was  not my job. If I had taken any  active part in politics I could  not have remained here. But as a  musician, I am more than a citizen.  I am a citizen of this country in  that eternal sense to which the  genius of great music testifies. I  know that a single performance of  a great masterpiece was a stronger  and more vital negation of the  spirit of Buchenwald and Auschwitz  than words.
STEVE	m	Have you ever smelled burning flesh?  I smelt it four miles away. Four  miles away, I smelt it. Have you  ever seen the gas chambers, the  crematoria? Have you seen the mounds  of rotting corpses? You talk to me  about culture, art and music? You  putting that in the scales, Wilhelm?  You setting culture, art and music  against the millions put to death  by your pals? They had orchestras  in the camps. They played Beethoven,  Wagner. The hangmen were playing  chamber music at home with their  families. I don't understand the  Germans' relationship with music.  What do you need music for? Your  pals you could call to save a few  Jews when millions of them were  being annihilated? Yes, I blame  you for not getting hanged, I blame  you for your cowardice. You strutted  and swaggered, you fucking piece  of shit, king-pin in a shithouse.  You talk to me about walking a  tightrope between exile and the  gallows, and I say to you, lies!
FURTW�NGLER	?	I love my country, I believe in  music, what was I to do?
STEVE	m	Look around you. See the country  you served. Look at people who had  real courage, who took risks, who  risked their lives. Like Emmi's  father.
STEVE	m	Emmi, take your fingers out of  your ears!
STEVE	m	I'm talking about your father.
EMMI	f	My father only joined the plot  when he realised that we could not  win the war.  She cries quietly.
FURTW�NGLER	?	What kind of a world do you want,  Major? What kind of world are you  going to make? Do you honestly  believe that the only reality is  the material world, so you will be  left nothing, nothing but  feculence... more foul-smelling  than that which pervades your  nights... How was I to understand, how was I  to know what they were capable of?  No one knew. No one knew.
FURTW�NGLER	?	I don't want to stay in this  country. Yes, I should have left  in 1934, it would have been better  if I'd left...
STEVE	m	Get him out of here.
FURTW�NGLER	?	Thank you, Fraulein. You have been  most kind. He smiles at her. She is  embarrassed.
STEVE	m	Major Arnold. Get me General  Wallace. General? Major Arnold,  about Furtw�ngler. I don't know if  we've got a case that'll stand up,  but sure as hell we can give him a  hard time.
STEVE	m	Hey, turn that down, would you?  Can't you see I'm on the phone? Never mind, we got a journalist  who'll do whatever we tell him.
STEVE	m	Turn it off!
STEVE'S VOICE	m	We handed Wilhelm Furtw�ngler over  to the civil authorities and he  was charged with serving the Nazi  regime, with uttering anti-Semitic  slurs, performing at an official  Nazi Party function and with being  a Prussian Privy Councillor.  Dr.  Furtw�ngler was acquitted. I didn't  nail him. But I sure winged him.  And I know I did the right thing.  Furtw�ngler resumed his career but  he was never allowed to conduct in  the United States. He died in 1954.  Little K succeeded him as head of  the Berlin Philharmonic.
