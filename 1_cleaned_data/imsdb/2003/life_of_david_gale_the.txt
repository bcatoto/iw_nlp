YOUNG MAN	m	It's probably been about seven  minutes...
COLLEGE GUY	m	Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement.  6:12. Roughly eight minutes. Number 36 this year for the Great  State of Texas.
CONSTANCE	f	David, don't start throwing things.
DAVID	m	I'm going home. Let's do the press  fax tomorrow.
CONSTANCE	f	Go. I'll do it.
DAVID	m	Hey!
DAVID	m	Yo! Officer!
DAVID	m	Your seatbelt.
ROBERTS	m	The high court also refused to stay  Friday's execution of former  philosophy professor, David Gale.
FEMALE	f	Christ doin' Karaoke.
ROBERTS	m	Gale had sought a review of his 1993  conviction for the rape and murder  of University of Texas colleague,  Constance Harraway.
ROBERTS	m	Defense lawyers had hoped to argue  that Gale's former activism against  capital punishment unduly  prejudiced...
ROBERTS	m	...the Texas judicial system. Citing  'discriminating purpose' --
KRUGER	m	Hey, they're not gonna stay Gale.  It's on Court TV right now, listen.
ROBERTS	m	...clear political gain in executing  its leading opponent of the death  penalty...
KRUGER	m	So, what's it gonna be? Belyeu said  to call after the decision... No,  they said only Bitsey.
ROBERTS	m	...Further failed to consider that  the victim was herself an abolitionist  activist...
KRUGER	m	It means only Bitsey. Bill, I don't  get to make the rules, I'm a fat  black woman.
KRUGER	m	...What we need is to put her on a  plane to Houston.
BITSEY	?	Gale's going down.
KRUGER	m	Why do you always get lordosis around  legal? She's here.
BITSEY	?	Hi. What's lordosis?
BILL	m	Female ape's posture when preparing  for intercourse. Hello, Bitsey.
BILL	m	Look, kids, setting aside the cost  issue, though half-a-million dollars  for three two hour interviews is not  only illegal it's obscen--
KRUGER	m	Market value. Guy's never talked.
BILL	m	That aside, I, we are still  uncomfortable with the arrangement.
BITSEY	?	Meaning?
BILL	m	Meaning you've just spent a very  public seven days in jail for a very  public contempt of court citation.
BITSEY	?	Protecting sources, even kiddie porn  scumbags, is magazine policy.
BILL	m	And I, we continue to appreciate  your decision. We're just concerned.  A rapist slash murderer, five days  before he's executed, demands a  reporter known for protecting sexual  deviants. A reporter who is also a  very attractive woman --
KRUGER	m	This is disparate treatment.
BITSEY	?	I could go if I were an ugly blabby  guy?
BILL	m	There's an agenda issue here which  would be diffused with an older  male...
KRUGER	m	I hear lawyers gleefully saying the  words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc.
BITSEY	?	'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice  that my assignments were evaluated  on the basis of my sex.'
KRUGER	m	You've gotta let her go now.
BILL	m	That's not quite what I meant.
KRUGER	m	He's gotta let you go.
BITSEY	?	'Certain references were made -- '
BILL	m	All right. All right. Enough. The  intern is with you at all times?
KRUGER	m	Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye.
BITSEY	?	I'm not baby-sitting.
BITSEY	?	Gale was seen leaving the house.
BITSEY	?	His sperm was inside her.
BITSEY	?	His prints were all over the kitchen,  including one on the bag.
ZACK	m	Half-a-thumb print.
BITSEY	?	Okay, half-a-thumb print.
ZACK	m	Could have touched it before it was  a murder weapon.
BITSEY	?	Do you fondle your friends' garbage  bags?
ZACK	m	Yeah, I get very touchy around  household plastics. 'Hello, everybody --  ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just  saying the bag could have been out  on the counter or something.
BITSEY	?	Hey, Zack?
ZACK	m	Yeah.
BITSEY	?	He did it.
ZACK	m	But the murder's way too fucking  clumsy. And this guy's a major  intellectual. Top of his Yale class,  a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two  books. He's an academic stud.
BITSEY	?	And, empirically speaking, a  psychotic.
ZACK	m	Look at his wife, she's a regular  Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father  was Ambassador to Spain --
BITSEY	?	Shit! The light's on again.
ZACK	m	Ignore it. It's a rental.
BITSEY	?	Thanks, Zack. Do you smell anything?
ZACK	m	No. Besides the guy's a flaming  liberal.
BITSEY	?	A person's politics has nothing to  do with their propensity to commit  crime. Aren't we supposed to smell it if  it's overheating?
ZACK	m	Wrong, seventy-three percent of all  serial killers vote republican.
BITSEY	?	Throw the cigarette out so we can  smell.
BITSEY	?	No! You'll stink up the car. Throw  it out!
ZACK	m	I'm not gonna fucking pollute.
BITSEY	?	Zack!
BITSEY	?	We better pull off. Shit, this is so  irritating.
ZACK	m	How far to Huntsville?
BITSEY	?	Look.
ZACK	m	'NEWS Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom  and Zack Stemmons entered the rest  area with car trouble...
ZACK	m	Little did they know their troubles  were just beginning.
BITSEY	?	Is it hot?
ZACK	m	Oww! Jesus, yes. Isn't it always?
ZACK	m	So what do I do?
BITSEY	?	I don't know, something male.
ZACK	m	Now what?
BITSEY	?	Company.
ZACK	m	I hope whoever it is never saw  Deliverance.
OLDER COWBOY	m	You folks need some help?
BITSEY	?	Actually yes.
HOSTESS	f	How are you this morning?
BITSEY	?	Little early, isn't it?
ZACK	m	The non-smoking section's over there.
BITSEY	?	I meant the book.
ZACK	m	Oh.
BITSEY	?	What time is it?
ZACK	m	9:15. The waitress says the Ellis  Unit is about fifteen minutes out of  town, so we've got like five and  half hours. I --
BITSEY	?	Never eat where the menus have  pictures of the food.
ZACK	m	I was thinking we should drive to  Austin, check out the crime scene.  Could be some story stuff for us.
BITSEY	?	First, this isn't a story. It's an  interview. We come, I listen, you  watch, we go home. Second, there is  no 'us' in the assignment.
ZACK	m	Okay, what do I watch you do for the  next five hours?
BITSEY	?	Drive around looking for decent  restaurant.
ZACK	m	You know, your reputation as Siberian- Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you  justice.
BITSEY	?	My reputation got us invited here. I  play by the rules. It's called  objectivity.
ZACK	m	So where do we report?
GROVER	m	Well, I don't rightly know one  fraternity from another. But if we  catch any those boys out here again,  we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute...  You do that, Susan... Bye now.
GROVER	m	Thank you, Margie. Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I  presume.
BITSEY	?	Yes, hello.
ZACK	m	Stemmons.
GROVER	m	Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again.  I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community  relations.
MARGIE	f	He's usually real good with names.
GROVER	m	And these days I always like to ask,  now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.?
BITSEY	?	Bitsey.
GROVER	m	Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin'  your umbrella.
MARGIE	f	Okey dokey.
GROVER	m	Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?
BITSEY	?	Yes.
GROVER	m	On death row?
BITSEY	?	No.
GROVER	m	Well, we house 422 inmates here.  Average stay with us is nine years.  Some get commuted, move on, most get  killed. It'll put you off your supper,  but then it's supposed to.
GROVER	m	Afternoon, Earl. We've got three concerns here: safety,  safety and safety. The visitation  area is entirely secure -- we just  ask you don't touch the glass. Windex  gets expensive.
GROVER	m	Rules say seven days prior to  execution inmates must be interviewed  in a cage.
GROVER	m	This changes for no man. You're not  carryin' a weapon are you?
BITSEY	?	No.
GROVER	m	Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?
ZACK	m	No, sir.
GROVER	m	Clarence. Karla. New York guests for  Mr. Gale.
CLARENCE	m	May I see your purse, ma'am.
GROVER	m	Go on and walk through.
GROVER	m	Now, should any kinda of  unpleasantness occur in the visitation  area, we ask that you stay put. Come  on through, Mr. Stemmons. And please  follow the instructions of these  fine correctional officers should  they see fit to give you any.
CLARENCE	m	Here you go, ma'am.
GROVER	m	Anythin' you say can be overheard.
GROVER	m	Here we are.
GROVER	m	All yours, Mr. Belyeu. You folks have safe visit now.
BITSEY	?	Thank you.
BELYEU	?	Miss Bloom?
BITSEY	?	Yes.
BELYEU	?	Did that P.R. man validate your  parkin'?
BITSEY	?	He said the gift shop could do it.
BELYEU	?	She's a smart one.
BELYEU	?	Benjamin Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.
BITSEY	?	This is Zack.
BELYEU	?	Pleasure. And this is the man of the hour.
GUARD	m	Sit down, Gale.
DAVID	m	Hello.
BITSEY	?	Hello.
ZACK	m	Hi.
BELYEU	?	Now, why can't they turn that thing  down?
DAVID	m	My lawyer respectfully suggests you  adjust the speaker-system volume.
DAVID	m	They're practicing being cruel and  unusual.
BELYEU	?	Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin'  at the bit.
BELYEU	?	Now, it is our understanding that  you are to have three two-hour  sessions. Today, tomorrow and  Thursday, all at three in the P.M.  I'm sorry we can't afford you more  time, but contrary to popular rumor  we have not yet begun to fight.  Furthermore, it's our understanding  that you will do this with no  recording equipment of any kind. You have my Gregg book?
DAVID	m	I need it for Billy's appeal.
BELYEU	?	My client's got a ten pound bass on  the line and he's worried about  baitin' his neighbor's hook. Now, I have some papers for which I  need your Jo Ann Hancock. Come by my Austin office at your  earliest convenience. Thursday  mornin', say.
BELYEU	?	Fine, till Thursday then.
BELYEU	?	Good luck, Miss Bloom. I'll come by later. We can play a  game of hangman, take up smokin'.
BELYEU	?	Bye, ya' all.
BITSEY	?	So...
DAVID	m	Sorry. Have a seat.
BITSEY	?	He's a character.
DAVID	m	Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met  the summer after 4th grade, spent  the day burning ants with his dad's  magnifying glass. We called it playing  'Execution.'
DAVID	m	Since I grew up in foster homes,  he's become the only family I have.
BITSEY	?	Where's your ex-wife?
DAVID	m	We agreed minimal contact would be  easier. Please don't mention her, or  my son.
BITSEY	?	All right. Anything else, just clearly  say, 'off the record.' I'll take it  to my grave. But then you know that  about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be  here.
BITSEY	?	Is this recording equipment?
DAVID	m	How should we start?
BITSEY	?	I'd say you're a man with a story to  tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the  magazine, the format. You chose me.
BITSEY	?	Go.
DAVID	m	Think. What do you fantasize about?  World peace? Thought so. Money-Fame-Ferrari? A Pulitzer? Nobel? M.T.V. Music Award? A genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but  secretly simmering with noble  passions, and willing to sleep on  the wet spot?
LARGE WOMAN	f	I'll take two!
DAVID	m	A Victoria's Secret model -- just  slumming between law school and  running her family's Vastly Endowed  Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed  Children?
DAVID	m	Okay, good, you see Lucan's point.  Fantasies must be unrealistic. The  minute you get something, you don't,  you can't, want it anymore. To exist,  desire needs absent objects. So desire  supports itself with crazy  fantasies...
STUDENT	m	Sorry.
DAVID	m	This is what Pascal means when he  says the only time we're truly happy  is when day-dreaming about future  happiness.
DAVID	m	Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter  than the kill' or 'Be careful what  you wish for.'
DAVID	m	Not because you'll get it, but because  you're doomed not to want it if you  do. Think about it next time you're  at a wedding.
BERLIN	m	Sorry about being late. There was,  you know, a thing.
DAVID	m	There usually is, Berlin.
BERLIN	m	Look, I know I'm not doing well.
BERLIN	m	And to torture a cliche, I'd do  anything to pass.
BERLIN	m	Anything, Professor Gale.
DAVID	m	Anything, huh?
BERLIN	m	Anything.
DAVID	m	Anything?
BERLIN	m	Any thing.
DAVID	m	Tell you what, I'll give you good  grade, a really good grade, if you  will... ...study.
CONSTANCE	f	David!
DAVID	m	Hey.
CONSTANCE	f	The T.A. finished transcribing the  Governor's radio and TV comments.  Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why  I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The  woman breathes in soundbites.
DAVID	m	'Yes, Virginia, the people of this  State have overwhelmingly affirmed  the reality of Santa.'
CONSTANCE	f	You might can use some of her pre- centrist stuff.
DAVID	m	Tell me again why you aren't doing  the debate.
CONSTANCE	f	Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.
DAVID	m	I hadn't noticed.
CONSTANCE	f	I know.
DAVID	m	That's not what I meant.
CONSTANCE	f	She's gonna do the whole mother thing.  She empathizes with you completely,  but experience has given her the  courage to take the tougher road, ta- da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And  flirt politely.
DAVID	m	'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for  a woman who executed thirty eight  last year.'
CONSTANCE	f	And watch your ego. Don't come across  as one of those I-hate-authority- because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the- New Yorker types.
DAVID	m	Anything else?
CONSTANCE	f	Yeah, don't fall into one of your  brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting  new federal stats from Amnesty  tonight.
DAVID	m	I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them  to Sharon's number at the house.
CONSTANCE	f	If you have a hang-over tomorrow --
DAVID	m	Apropos playing Mother.
CONSTANCE	f	Ten o'clock! Bright-eyed and bushy tailed!
DAVID	m	Did you mark your calendar?
CHASE	m	Yep.
CHASE	m	Only... three more Spain days.
DAVID	m	Only three. That's great, huh?
DAVID	m	What's he doing in here?
CHASE	m	Mommy said I could. Just till she  gets back. That's a special-duper monster laser  knife.
DAVID	m	Where's your laser gun?
CHASE	m	Here.
CHASE	m	Tussshh, tusssshh, tussshh. I never  shoot them in the eyes, Daddy.
DAVID	m	That's 'cause you're a special-duper- super-quadruper boy. Who's now going  to sleep.
DAVID	m	Who loves you?
DAVID	m	Ooooh. Good night, son.
CHASE	m	Do Cloud Dog.
DAVID	m	Good night, Cloud Dog.
DAVID	m	Back before midnight.
BABYSITTER	f	It's cool, Mr. Gale. Don't do anything I wouldn't.
DAVID	m	Rest assured.
GREER	?	The guy's the Immanuel Kant of the  N.F.L. Consistent, accurate,  effective, and boring, boring, boring.
DAVID	m	Meinen Herren.
ROSS	m	Hello, David.
OLDER PROFESSOR	m	Professor Gale. Where's your better  half?
DAVID	m	Spain.
OLDER PROFESSOR	m	Again? Well, I was just off for air.
DAVID	m	Looks like Sharon's affair is an  open secret.
ROSS	m	Hermeneutical bias: the only fun  truths are the ones someone's trying  to hide. Have a seat.
ROSS	m	Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid.  Probations suspended her. She received  the letter today, took the opportunity  to throw a fit in my office. You  should --
BERLIN	m	Talking about me?
DAVID	m	Yep.
BERLIN	m	He tell you I said when you were  circumcised they threw away the wrong  part.
DAVID	m	He mentioned it.
DAVID	m	It's called schmuck.
BERLIN	m	What?
DAVID	m	The part of the foreskin that gets  thrown away. I think it's called  schmuck.
BERLIN	m	Aren't we so fucking clever.
ROSS	m	I suppose I should get us another.  David?
DAVID	m	Black Bush.
BERLIN	m	You were a jerk this afternoon.
DAVID	m	For what it's worth, I didn't know  about the suspension.
BERLIN	m	Is that supposed to be an apology?
DAVID	m	More like a conciliation.
ROSS	m	All right. As the poets have mournfully sung,  Death takes the innocent young, The  screamingly funny, The rolling in  money, And those who are very well  hung.
DAVID	m	There once was a lesbian from Canjuom,  Who took a young man to her room,  And they argued all night, As to who  had the right, To do what, how, and  to whom.
BERLIN	m	One more. C'mon, one more.
DAVID	m	Enough. That's enough.
ROSS	m	Do you bow to the Queen?
DAVID	m	I'm done.
BERLIN	m	I'm not a student anymore.
DAVID	m	Don't think I want to know what that  means.
BERLIN	m	There once was woman named Berlin,  Who liked a bit now and again. Not  now and again, But Now! And Again!  And Again! And Again! And Again!
BERLIN	m	Cute, huh?
DAVID	m	Cute.
BERLIN	m	I have a secret. But I have to come  over there to tell you.
BERLIN	m	Here I come.
BERLIN	m	I wasn't after the grade.
DAVID	m	Berlin, this, this is not...
BERLIN	m	Ssshhhh.
BERLIN	m	We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate.  Or... you can put your mouth on my  body.
BERLIN	m	Don't reject me. Please.
BERLIN	m	Rip them.
DAVID	m	What?
BERLIN	m	Rip them off.
BERLIN	m	No. From behind.
BERLIN	m	Yes.
BERLIN	m	Do it hard.
BERLIN	m	Harder.
BERLIN	m	Harder.
BERLIN	m	Yes.
BERLIN	m	Bite me. Bite my shoulder.
CONSTANCE	f	Okay, let's say we find an innocent  on death row. Wouldn't matter.  Corrections would let him go. Governor  Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks  to the good people at DeathWatch,  the system works.' Yeah, if they  executed an innocent, and we had  absolute, undeniable, in-your-face  proof, we could demand abolition.  Just like happened in England. Are  you okay?
DAVID	m	Sorry. Yeah.
CONSTANCE	f	But it hasn't happened, not since  '76. And won't happen.
CONSTANCE	f	Dead men can't make a case.
DAVID	m	And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.
CONSTANCE	f	Just keep it rational. The death  penalty is expensive and ineffective.  No one wants to see a murderer as a  victim.
DAVID	m	Um-hum.
CONSTANCE	f	And stop that.
DAVID	m	What?
CONSTANCE	f	Active listening. I hate active  listeners. Makes me feel like I'm  with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares  more about appearing to listen than  actually listening. Did you bring  the Amnesty fax?
DAVID	m	I can listen and appear to listen at  the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I  left it home.
CONSTANCE	f	I have a copy.
CONSTANCE	f	You want to tell me what's up.
DAVID	m	Nothing. Everything. Something  profoundly stupid happened last night.
CONSTANCE	f	I hope you used a condom.
CONSTANCE	f	Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of  yours?
DAVID	m	It was Berlin.
CONSTANCE	f	Oh, that's great, great. I can hear  the grapevine now. They suspended  her so Gale could dick her with a  clear conscience.
CONSTANCE	f	A power differential equals coercion.  Great. You are so weak.
DAVID	m	Constance, you're not my wife. Thank  God.
CONSTANCE	f	I know you can tell yourself it's a  position I aspire to, but believe  me, I would rather...
DAVID	m	I didn't mean --
CONSTANCE	f	Let's go.
DAVID	m	Are you okay?
CONSTANCE	f	Yes, let's just go.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR	m	In three, two...
HOST	m	Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.'  Tonight we continue our very special  four-part series with the Governor  Hardin. Arguing capital punishment  with her is DeathWatch coordinator,  Professor David Gale. Governor, you're  up.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	Alan, let me say somethin' I always  say.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And  that is I hate killin.' That's why  my administration is willing to kill  to stop it.
DAVID	m	So you don't subscribe to the idea  that 'a good state is one that  protects its most despised members'?
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	It's a nice liberal idea, but like  most nice liberal ideas, naive.
DAVID	m	It's a quote from you, Governor,  from your first state attorney  campaign.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	You've got me, Professor. But let  me, in my defense, give you a quote.  Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a  liberal at twenty, you've got no  heart, if you're still a liberal at  thirty, you've got no brain.'
DAVID	m	So, basically you feel, to choose  another quote, 'society must be  cleansed of elements which represent  its own death.'
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	Well, yes. I would have to agree. Did I say that, too?
DAVID	m	No, ma'am. That was Hitler.
DAVID	m	Governor, can't we examine the  possibility that capital punishment  isn't working. That murderers aren't  deterred by the law because they  have about as much forethought as  lemmings. That it's expensive,  inequably administered, that...
DAVID	m	...that we may even be killing  innocents.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your  game. Name one. Name one innocent  man Texas has put to death in my  tenure. One.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	Name one in the last twenty years.  In any state in this country.
HOST	m	Well, Mr. Gale?
DAVID	m	Dead men can't make a case.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	Well, as my daddy used to say: If  you can't find a problem, there  probably isn't one.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	Well, you certainly had me on that  Hitler quote.
DAVID	m	Thank you, Governor.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	These debates are awfully good for  the state, don't you think?
DAVID	m	Of course.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	Well, I've got to buzz.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	You folks keep up the good work. We  need that opposition.
CONSTANCE	f	Your exact words were, 'Just tell me  when my ego gets in the way of the  work.' Now I'm telling you: Your  ego's in the way of work.
DAVID	m	Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.
CONSTANCE	f	You put up precisely two seconds of  protest at the thought of a televised  debate.
DAVID	m	What's that supposed to mean?
CONSTANCE	f	It means DeathWatch suffers because  you're so anxious to finger authority,  to publicly prove that David Gale is  so much fucking smarter than the  powers that be. Learn to work without  an audience. Try squeezing money  from the donor list. Have you ever  licked one single mail-out envelope?
MAN #2	m	Mr. Gale?
DAVID	m	Look, guys, there's not much more to  say --
MAN #2	m	Rameriz, Austin police. This is  Officer Haslinger.
DAVID	m	What, arguing with the Governor is a  crime?
MAN #3	m	No, sir, rape is.
GUARD	m	Gale, time's up.
DAVID	m	Berlin had my bite marks, bruises,  ripped clothing. My skin was beneath  her nails. It didn't look like  anything but rape. Two days later  she called the D.A., said she wouldn't  testify, too drunk to be sure, etc.  On the plane home, Sharon read about  her husband's rape case being dropped.
BITSEY	?	Why'd she do it?
DAVID	m	Finger authority, show she was smarter  than the powers that be.
BITSEY	?	Do you know where I can find her?
DAVID	m	First year in here I received a card  postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't  signed, but I suspect it was from  her -- the front had the text 'Sex  is Power.'
BITSEY	?	Anything written on it?
DAVID	m	Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you  can know.' See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom.
BITSEY	?	Try phone records, a net search.
ZACK	m	Fucking better than watching you  work.
ZACK	m	You think he's telling the truth?
BITSEY	?	Don't ask me that. I don't know.  There is no truth, only perspectives.
ZACK	m	Can't say that. If you say 'there is  no truth,' you're claiming it's true  that there is no truth -- it's a  logical contradiction.
BITSEY	?	Working on our philosophy merit badge,  Zack?
ZACK	m	I, on the other hand, think Gale's  telling the truth.
BITSEY	?	This you know telepathically?
ZACK	m	It's just my perspective.
ZACK	m	Thirty-three o what?
BITSEY	?	Seven. 'Check out the crime scene in Austin.'  You made it sound so close. Shit,  two and half hours and that damn lig --
ZACK	m	Bitsey.
BITSEY	?	Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is  Zack Stemmons. We --
GOTH GIRL	f	You want the tour?
BITSEY	?	Uh, yes.
GOTH GIRL	f	There's a twenty-dollar mandatory  donation, apiece. But you get a re- enactment photo packet. It's got  five pictures.
BITSEY	?	Okay.
GOTH GIRL	f	I gotta collect first.
BITSEY	?	Oh, sure.
GOTH GIRL	f	You gotta sign the book. Doesn't  have to be your real name, though.
GOTH GIRL	f	First page says you're here to do  research on violent crime. The state  requires it for nonprofit shit.
GOTH GIRL	f	Take a re-enactment photo packet.
GOTH GIRL	f	If you guys could share one, it would  be really cool. The butt wipes where  I do prints kinda jerk my chain.
GOTH GIRL	f	That's me. My boyfriend took it. We  also did a video. It's fifty bucks  'cause you can see my tits. There's  a version without tits, that's thirty- five.
BITSEY	?	Do many people take the tour?
GOTH GIRL	f	Not so much anymore. We thought this  would be like a busy week -- Gale  gettin' the prune juice and all.  Prune juice is what death row dudes  call the poison, 'cause it gives you  the shits. Most jerks just take a  photo from the street. They shot a  'Real Crimes' episode here, but the  owner didn't give us dick.
ZACK	m	You don't mind living here?
GOTH GIRL	f	I'm cool with ghouls. Beats livin'  with my dickwad parents. It starts  over here.
GOTH GIRL	f	She let him crash here sometimes. He  was like constantly wasted. Drank  Black Label religiously.
GOTH GIRL	f	This is where the tripod was. My  boyfriend borrowed the one we usually  show folks. They never found a camera,  photos, or videos or anything. Gale  must have buried them. These serial  killer dudes take photos to whack  off to later.
ZACK	m	He's not exactly a serial killer.
GOTH GIRL	f	Whatever.
GOTH GIRL	f	She was like totally naked right  here. The meter man saw her through  the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped  her mouth, then taped a bag over her  head so she couldn't breathe. My  boyfriend says that's probably when  he fucked her. Your muscles tense up  when you die -- the sex is better. He used those housewife gloves so he  wouldn't leave prints. They found  sticky stuff from the tape on them.
GOTH GIRL	f	We ask folks not to touch the exhibit.
ZACK	m	Right.
GOTH GIRL	f	The totally sick part was where they  found the key --
BITSEY	?	We know, you can save that.
ZACK	m	What? Where was it?
GOTH GIRL	f	It was in her stomach, dude. He made  her swallow it before he bagged her.
GOTH GIRL	f	That's pretty much the highlight.
BITSEY	?	It was in the case file.
ZACK	m	Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder  than Wisconsin.
BITSEY	?	Zack, open your vanity.
ZACK	m	What?
BITSEY	?	The vanity mirror, pull it down.
BITSEY	?	See that truck behind us?
ZACK	m	Yeah.
BITSEY	?	Isn't that the cowboy from the rest  area?
ZACK	m	Same truck.
BITSEY	?	Weird coincidence, huh?
ZACK	m	Coincidences are always weird, that's  why they're coincidences.
DAVID	m	Off-the-record?
BITSEY	?	Alright, we're off.
DAVID	m	Constance was murdered with what's  called the Securitat Method. You're  hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the  key, taped at the mouth, a bag's  sealed over your head and you're  left to suffocate. The Securitat did  this to Romanians who wouldn't inform  or confess. Sometimes the bag was  ripped off at the last second, you  got a second chance. If not, you die  knowing the 'key' to your freedom  was inside you the whole time. A  cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem  is I mentioned the method in an early  article. The prosecution never knew.
BITSEY	?	You're telling me someone's framing  you?
DAVID	m	It's more than that.
DAVID	m	There was a tripod.
BITSEY	?	Right, facing her body. Are we on?
DAVID	m	Not a single print was found on it.  Someone brought it, wiped it, left  it. Why? It's as if they wanted me  to know that somewhere there's a  record of what really happened that  afternoon. As if they wanted me to  die knowing the key to my freedom  was... out there.
BITSEY	?	Maybe you're being paranoid?
DAVID	m	Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row  activist on death row. Doesn't that  strike you as odd?
BITSEY	?	Any ideas who 'they' are?
DAVID	m	No.
DAVID	m	But I have someone on it, someone  I'm hoping will one day find an  answer.
BITSEY	?	Belyeu's hired a detective?
DAVID	m	A journalist.
DAVID	m	'She's a smart one.'
CONSTANCE	f	I'll drop by your office after.
CHASE	m	Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me  like a fur!
DAVID	m	Who's your hero?
DAVID	m	Call me when you get to Boston?
SHARON	f	Yeah.
DAVID	m	I wish you --
SHARON	f	Don't.
SHARON	f	Chase, get in, Sweetie.
CHASE	m	See ya later, Alli-gator.
DAVID	m	After awhile, Crocodile.
CHASE	m	Take it easy, Japa-ne-se.
DAVID	m	Okey-dokey, Artichokey.
SHARON	f	Scoot.
SHARON	f	I sent you an e-mail.
DAVID	m	Okay?
SHARON	f	Just read it.
SHARON	f	Come on, Chase.
CONSTANCE	f	You could at least hide the bottle.
DAVID	m	Well?
CONSTANCE	f	Officially, you're on sabbatical.  Unofficially, they want you to look  for another position. It was four to  two.
DAVID	m	How did Ross vote?
CONSTANCE	f	You're not supp... Against you.
DAVID	m	And you?
CONSTANCE	f	Against my politics.
DAVID	m	So, I wanted to get your feedback on  the idea.
IVY LEAGUER	f	Look, Professor Gale, I could sit  here, as I'm sure others have, and  plead departmental cutbacks. Claim  you need more publications, or I  need a minority, whatever. All bull- geschichte. Your record's brilliant.  You're an original voice worth -- in  the scarcity-defines-value capitalist  system under which we toil -- your  weight in gold. Hell, it's not even  the alcohol. It'd be nice to have  faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac.  But, to speak plainly, if I hire  you, in the eyes of the regents,  alumni and every freshman with an  ear for gossip, I'd be hiring a  rapist.
IVY LEAGUER	f	You're not politically correct, Dr.  Gale. Welcome to the club.
CHASE	m	We aren't home. Please, tell us a  message.
SHARON	f	At the beep.
CHASE	m	At the peep.
SORORITY PLEDGE	m	I got it! I got it!
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN	f	What exactly attracts you to the  bond market?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN	f	Mr. Gale?
YUPPIE MAN	m	Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me  three personal qualities you have  that would make you a successful  Radio Shack manager.
BELYEU	?	Because divorce proceedings do not  require her presence in the country.  For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll  have to return.
BELYEU	?	But without successful completion of  an alcohol treatment program, you'll  be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'.
DAVID	m	So my chances of getting partial  custody aren't good?
BELYEU	?	Roughly the same as you sinkin' that  from here.
CONSTANCE	f	I'm sorry.
CONSTANCE	f	You look good.
DAVID	m	I feel... washed.
CONSTANCE	f	I need you. DeathWatch needs you,  now more than ever.
DAVID	m	Nothing like I need you, both. You're  all I have.
CONSTANCE	f	Look.
CONSTANCE	f	Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled.
CONSTANCE	f	I've got a call with Hawkins tonight,  and if national will commit emergency  funds...
DAVID	m	Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll  only prove the system works.
CONSTANCE	f	But I'll save a life.
DAVID	m	Where'd you get those?
CONSTANCE	f	Spring cleaning.
CONSTANCE	f	She went up at 18, she's 26 now.
DAVID	m	Hey! She ever not make you work when  you come by?
OLDER COWBOY	m	Mornin', David.
DAVID	m	What's her story?
CONSTANCE	f	I really want us to get behind this  one. She's articul --
DAVID	m	Constance, who did she kill?
CONSTANCE	f	A cop.
DAVID	m	She admit to it?
DAVID	m	You're a crazy woman. Not your medium  grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's- bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose- screws-in-the-belfry insane.
CONSTANCE	f	You're mixing metaphors.
DAVID	m	A real danger to flora and fauna.
CONSTANCE	f	Are we gonna do this?
DAVID	m	And how.
DAVID	m	You're burning up.
COLLEGE GUY	m	Howdy, Mr. Gale.
DAVID	m	Hello, folks.
MATRON	m	Hello. My, this is service. Thank  you.
DAVID	m	Gladly.
DAVID	m	Latte on your left, partner.
DIRECTOR	m	...and see what kind of resources  the religious groups can deliver.
CONSTANCE	f	I'm sure we can get some pulpit time,  maybe cable.
DIRECTOR	m	Cable's good. Listen, I need to run.  For now, I agree the first press  release should focus on the woman's  youth.
DIRECTOR	m	I'll have the Washington people look  into counsel competency, though I'm  almost sure she's exhausted this  issue on appeal.
CONSTANCE	f	John, David's going to --
DIRECTOR	m	Oh, I almost forgot. He's not around,  is he?
CONSTANCE	f	No.
DIRECTOR	m	Good, keep it that way. His  relationship to DeathWatch is over,  terminated. Last thing we need is  this rape thing coming back to bite  our butts.
DIRECTOR	m	These guys don't stay on the wagon  for very long.
DIRECTOR	m	I'm serious, Constance. Ban him from  the premises. I realize you two...
DAVID	m	Sharon, pick up. For once just pick  up the goddamn phone! If you keep  him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging  you. He's my son! Please! Please....  Please.
DAVID	m	We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.
CONSTANCE	f	Come on, come inside.
DAVID	m	We fell off our wagon.
DAVID	m	Know why Saint Jude is the patron  saint of lost causes? 'Cause his  real name was Judas. There were two  Judases, Judai, the saint guy and  the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus,  and tried to kiss him. Medievalers  wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear  of getting bad Judas on the line by  mistake. Ergo, they only gave him  business when really desperate. That's  why. Then they changed his name.
DAVID	m	Constance?
DAVID	m	Your mail's blowing.
DOCTOR	m	How we doing?
DAVID	m	Fine. How's Constance?
DOCTOR	m	Sleeping.
DOCTOR	m	Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's  condition is highly susceptible to  external stress. While we don't want  to totally restrict Constance's life --
DAVID	m	What?
DOCTOR	m	Constance's illness requires a degree  of regularity.
DAVID	m	Constance has leukemia?
DOCTOR	m	Acute. She was diagnosed last fall.
DOCTOR	m	Have I created a problem?
DAVID	m	No, no.
GUARD	m	Gale, time's up.
DAVID	m	When I asked why she hadn't told me,  she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess  she figured as long as death was  chasing her, she could help others  escape.
DAVID	m	Constance left the world better than  she found it. It's a small, difficult thing.
ZACK	m	Fuck.
ZACK	m	Hey.
BITSEY	?	For God's sake, Zack.
ZACK	m	You're not a happy camper.
BITSEY	?	It's not a happy place.
ZACK	m	Talked to the Austin prosecutor.  Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he  fucked up the penalty phase, says  Gale probably would have gotten life  on mitigating factors. Gale stuck  with him, though, all through appeals,  despite major pro bono offers.
BITSEY	?	What else?
ZACK	m	Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money  in Houston tonight, overheat light  came on twice, and you're about to  get a surprise.
BITSEY	?	I don't want a surprise.
ZACK	m	Too late.
ZACK	m	This is mostly an Oklahoma caravan.  I got stuck behind them on the way  in.
ZACK	m	Execution's not for another 36 hours.  It's gonna be a zoo. There's the  P.R. guy.
BITSEY	?	What a life, waiting around for  someone to die.
ZACK	m	Fuck, look.
BITSEY	?	This is a little too coincidental.
ZACK	m	'Cause I couldn't see the license  plate.
BITSEY	?	Forget it. What time is it?
ZACK	m	6:05. Why don't you have a watch?
BITSEY	?	It's a long story.
BITSEY	?	Give me an hour.
BITSEY	?	Zack!
ZACK	m	What!?
BITSEY	?	It's open.
ZACK	m	So? Maybe the maid forgot.
BITSEY	?	Look!
ZACK	m	I'll check the bathroom.
ZACK	m	Clear in here! Don't touch it!
ZACK	m	Fuck, Bitsey, there could have been  prints.
BITSEY	?	Look.
ZACK	m	She says no one asked for you. And  all the room keys are different.
ZACK	m	Just she and her husband have masters.
BITSEY	?	What did you tell her?
ZACK	m	That you have a jealous boyfriend.
BITSEY	?	Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?
ZACK	m	She didn't ask. I think she assumed  it had something to do with why he  was jealous. I still say we should  do this in my room -- this one's a  fucking crime scene.
BITSEY	?	Whoever got in here -- without a key  in broad daylight -- was probably  smart enough not to leave prints. I  have the remote.
ZACK	m	Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try  three.
BITSEY	?	They don't look for D.N.A. when  someone breaks in to deliver, Zack.  Here.
ZACK	m	You sure you want to see what's on  here?
BITSEY	?	No. Start it.
BITSEY	?	I hope this isn't what I think it  is.
BITSEY	?	God, no.
ZACK	m	Fuck. Is it her?
BITSEY	?	Turn it up.
ZACK	m	Belyeu says to bring the tape first  thing tomorrow. Also said you were  right about not calling the police.
ZACK	m	Are you gonna be okay?
ZACK	m	Let's say Gale's right. Some sick- fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him  up, arranged like the perfect murder.  Why send a magazine journalist proof  a few hours before he's won? Doesn't  make sense.
BITSEY	?	No, it's perfect. He knows News  Magazine won't give the scoop to the  dailies or nightly news, not after  having paid for it. Probably guessed  we wouldn't call the cops. And, most  importantly, knows I'll tell Gale  tomorrow.
ZACK	m	Why does he give a shit?
BITSEY	?	Zack, what if Harraway's murder was  just a means to getting Gale. I mean  sending him through hell, a sick cat  and mouse game. You kill the one  person he has left. Make sure he  sits six years on death row for the  murder -- a place he's made a public  career of loathing. And then just  let him die, die knowing everyone  will remember him with disgust. You  destroy his loved ones, his life's  work, his memory -- and you make him  watch.
ZACK	m	That's a lot of hate. You're talking  beyond sadism.
ZACK	m	Then why release it?
BITSEY	?	If the mouse dies the game's over.  Maybe the cat's enjoying himself.  Or...
ZACK	m	Or?
BITSEY	?	Imagine walking to the chamber knowing  this exists.
ZACK	m	The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath.
BITSEY	?	Yeah, but smart.
ZACK	m	Why do they call it check-book  journalism if we always pay cash?
ZACK	m	Woa, woa. Sadist at six o'clock!
BITSEY	?	Is it the truck?
ZACK	m	Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding.
ZACK	m	He must think we're idiots. You think  he's our fucked-up feline?
BITSEY	?	Is he gaining?
ZACK	m	No. Just sitting back there.
BITSEY	?	Can you see the license?
ZACK	m	Too much mist. What the fuck does  this guy want?
BELYEU	?	Fine. Oh, and bring in Miss Bloom's  original when that's done. Don't blame you for not watching  that twice.
BITSEY	?	I couldn't sleep afterwards.
BELYEU	?	I understand. I generally tell folks  I'm no more afraid of the grim reaper  than I am of a Presbyterian on  Mother's Day. But watching your  tape... well. I had to keep tellin'  myself 'that's not Constance' just  to get through. Unfortunately, others may argue the  same.
BITSEY	?	Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her  house.
BELYEU	?	Currently home to Weirdos  Incorporated. Arguably, that tape  could have been made by anybody with  twenty dollars and a tolerance for  vulgarity.
BITSEY	?	But it will at least get us a  postponement?
BELYEU	?	I hope so, Miss Bloom, I certainly  hope so. But you've got to remember  that there's a machine a runnin'.  And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin'  that machine wants to be fed.
CLERK	m	All here, Mr. Belyeu.
BELYEU	?	Thank you, Joshua. To add to our troubles, your own  credibility may come into question.
BITSEY	?	Why?
BELYEU	?	You've been fraternizin' with the  condemned. In the court's eyes, he's  the most likely candidate to have  put you onto the tape. He's a  persuasive man, you're a out-of-state  woman -- it don't look good on paper.
BITSEY	?	But someone put it in my hotel room.
BELYEU	?	A fact for which we have no evidence.
BELYEU	?	Thank you, Bobbi.
BITSEY	?	Thanks.
BELYEU	?	Well, let's not start readin' Kafka  just yet. Could we find a sympathetic  judge. I'll file within the hour.  You headin' back over to Ellis?
BITSEY	?	Yeah.
BELYEU	?	Fine. I'll call over at the motel  later and give you an update.
BITSEY	?	Shit.
BITSEY	?	Did you see the cowboy go in?
ZACK	m	He went in Belyeu's building?
BITSEY	?	Into his office. Just saw him.
ZACK	m	Fuck!
BITSEY	?	Follow him. Find out who he is, where  he lives -- what he --
ZACK	m	How are you gonna get to Ellis?
BITSEY	?	A taxi.
DAVID	m	Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to  sit.
GUARD	m	Visitors need to stay seated.
DAVID	m	Sorry. Look at me. He's not your man. His  name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch  Director before Constance. He's a  'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a  good demonstration has to end in a  riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs  don't mean shit.' They fired him.  Constance kept him in the  organization, and he loved her for  it. The man adored her.
BITSEY	?	Then why was he following us? Why  was he at Belyeu and Crane?
DAVID	m	He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U.  cases together, until Dusty punched  a clansman in a federal court. Benny  sometimes still gives him work,  probably had him follow you.
BITSEY	?	Why?
DAVID	m	To make sure you honored your  agreement, one for which there's no  contract.
BITSEY	?	He would've said something.
DAVID	m	He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom.
BITSEY	?	Maybe Dusty was jealous because you  were seeing Constance.
DAVID	m	I wasn't 'seeing' Constance.
BITSEY	?	She died... she had your sperm --
DAVID	m	It's more complicated than that.
CONSTANCE	f	All I can feel is envy.
CONSTANCE	f	Remember those Kubler-Ross stages,  the ones the dying go through?
DAVID	m	Denial, anger, bargaining, depression,  and acceptance. Where are you?
CONSTANCE	f	Denial.
DAVID	m	Denial's my personal favorite.
CONSTANCE	f	The whole idea of there being a  process makes me tired. I'm not up  to the job of Dying Person. Marveling  at blades of grass. Lecturing  strangers to relish every moment.
DAVID	m	Mending bridges.
CONSTANCE	f	Mending bridges. Confessing regrets.  Uuuggh.
DAVID	m	No regrets?
CONSTANCE	f	Nope.
CONSTANCE	f	Take that back. I wish I had a child.
DAVID	m	Me, too.
CONSTANCE	f	I'm sorry, David.
CONSTANCE	f	I guess I just wish I would have  risked more.
CONSTANCE	f	Uumm, also not enough sex. Should  have had more sex.
DAVID	m	How much... how many lovers have you  had?
CONSTANCE	f	Including college?
DAVID	m	Including college.
DAVID	m	Well, it's... not every... yeah, you  should have had more sex.
CONSTANCE	f	You work hard not to be seen as a  sex object. Before long, you're not  seen at all.
DAVID	m	I see you.
DAVID	m	Want to make it five? Finish the  hand?
CONSTANCE	f	A pity lay. No thanks.
DAVID	m	It wouldn't be pity.
DAVID	m	Are you okay?
CONSTANCE	f	Don't worry.
CONSTANCE	f	It's good.
CONSTANCE	f	Talk to me. Let me hear your voice.
DAVID	m	I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy.
CONSTANCE	f	Hold me tight.
DAVID	m	I'm here.
CONSTANCE	f	Tight... I'm scared.
DAVID	m	It's okay.
DAVID	m	Okay.
CONSTANCE	f	Don't stop. Stay in me. Please stay  in me.
DAVID	m	Shhh. I'm staying.
CONSTANCE	f	I need to feel you inside.
DAVID	m	It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling  out.
CONSTANCE	f	I'm so tired.
DAVID	m	I know, I know.
CONSTANCE	f	Tired of being afraid.
DAVID	m	Shhh.
CONSTANCE	f	Help me.
DAVID	m	I'm here. It's okay.
CONSTANCE	f	Help me. Please. Make it stop.
DAVID	m	Shhh. I'm here. I'm here.
CONSTANCE	f	How do you feel about last night?
DAVID	m	Rescued. You?
CONSTANCE	f	Like I have a reason to get out of  bed. Ironic, huh?
DAVID	m	Let's say they move back from Spain,  that I somehow got my one weekend a  month. Would it matter? By high  school, I'd be his weak spot, the  focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed  pride. In college there'd be late- night angst: 'What if I turn out  like the old man?' Holidays would be  forced smiles and unscheduled exits.  I mean, what girl comes home with  you if there's talk that Pops is a  rapist?
DAVID	m	I can't stand the idea of being his  model of failure. Without him, I  drink. To cover the hole. To prove  to myself he's better off without  me.
DAVID	m	Sorry, just leaving.
POLICEMAN	m	Gale, time's up.
BITSEY	?	But there has to be someone. Someone  with a motive, who knew you both.  Someone who visited that morning.
DAVID	m	If I could answer... we wouldn't be  having this conversation. It's why I  need you, why I chose you. You have  my story, now... 'Go.'
BITSEY	?	There's not enough time.
DAVID	m	You'll find time.
BITSEY	?	You know that's not what I meant.  You should have done this earlier.
DAVID	m	You're not here to save me. You're  here to save my son's memory of his  father -- that's all I want.
BITSEY	?	You're going to let them kill you.
DAVID	m	We live to stop death. Eating,  inventing, loving, praying, fighting,  killing -- choose a verb. All to  stall this evil, Job's 'king of  terrors.' But what do we really know  about it? Nobody comes back. There's  a point, when your mind out-lives  its obsessions, when your habits  survive your dreams, when your  losses... You wonder, maybe death is  a gift. All I know is that by this  time tomorrow, I'll be better off.  What I don't know is why. Goodbye, Bitsey.
BITSEY	?	Goodbye, David.
GUARD	m	Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here?
BITSEY	?	No thanks.
JOURNALIST #1	m	I got it. I got it. You could have  corporate sponsors. Volkswagen for  Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy. And 'The  David Gale Execution, brought to you  by...'
JOURNALIST #2	m	'...Hefty.'
BITSEY	?	What time is it?
ZACK	m	Nine hours, 52 minutes.
BITSEY	?	Belyeu!
BITSEY	?	Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?
BELYEU	?	I employ Mr. Wright from time to  time.
BITSEY	?	You could have said something.
BELYEU	?	That would have defeated the purpose.  Apologies if I caused you unnecessary  anxiety, but I'm paid to be  suspicious. Thought I'd return this.
ZACK	m	Any word on the writ?
BELYEU	?	Denied. Tape went to a federal judge  two hours ago. Your videographer  friend made contact?
BITSEY	?	No.
BELYEU	?	What you got was definitely a snippet.  Could be he has more previews  scheduled. Best stick close to your  room.
BITSEY	?	How's David?
BELYEU	?	Holdin' up. I'm headed back over.
BITSEY	?	Tell him I'll take care of it, about  his son, I mean.
BELYEU	?	Will do. We'll talk later?
BELYEU	?	Watch yourselves.
BITSEY	?	Mr. Belyeu.
BITSEY	?	Were Dusty and Constance close?
BELYEU	?	Thick as thieves.
BITSEY	?	Zack! Wake up! Get up!
BITSEY	?	Did you throw the towel on the floor?
ZACK	m	What?
BITSEY	?	The towel on my bathroom floor. Did  you put it there?
ZACK	m	Yeah, I guess. It's a hotel room.  What --
BITSEY	?	Do you do that at home?
ZACK	m	No. Fuck, Bitsey. I'm sorry, it's  not like it's --
BITSEY	?	Get up.
ZACK	m	What the fuck's wrong with you?
BITSEY	?	Grab the T.V. I want to check  something.
ZACK	m	What?
BITSEY	?	We're taking a tour.
ZACK	m	Where?
BITSEY	?	Austin. Get the T.V.
BITSEY	?	Wanna make a hundred bucks?
GOTH GIRL	f	What do I gotta do?
BITSEY	?	We're going over the crime scene.
BITSEY	?	And for the next hour I want you to  do exactly what I say when I say to  do it. If I say suck Zack's dick,  all I want to hear from you is 'May  I swallow.'
GOTH GIRL	f	You want me to suck his dick?
ZACK	m	It's just a patriarchal figure of  speech.
BITSEY	?	Is your boyfriend here?
GOTH GIRL	f	He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore.
BITSEY	?	Well is his video camera here?
GOTH GIRL	f	Yeah.
BITSEY	?	Get it.
GOTH GIRL	f	I gotta collect first.
ZACK	m	Move those index cards, too.
BITSEY	?	Zoom in a hair.
BITSEY	?	Put the gloves on a dish rack.
GOTH GIRL	f	I don't have one.
BITSEY	?	Turn them inside out.
BITSEY	?	Move the tape roll about a foot to  the left. And get rid of the  handcuffs.
BITSEY	?	Come check this, Zack. Could you... what's your name?
GOTH GIRL	f	Nico's cool.
BITSEY	?	Nico, lie down on the floor, facing  the counter.
ZACK	m	We can imagine that part. I'll position her.
BITSEY	?	That's fine. Just straighten her  legs.
BITSEY	?	What's this?
ZACK	m	Towel or something.
BITSEY	?	Okay, look at this.
BITSEY	?	I noticed this back at the hotel.  See?
BITSEY	?	She moves her foot. Why?
ZACK	m	Fucking good question.
BITSEY	?	It's another fifteen seconds before  she comes to. If she had passed out  once, without fresh air she wouldn't  come back. There was no head trauma,  her blood tested normal --
ZACK	m	Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping  he would go away.
BITSEY	?	Or...
BITSEY	?	We've got to bag her.
ZACK	m	Woa. Not a good idea.
BITSEY	?	All right, I'll do it.
NICO	m	I found it.
BITSEY	?	Okay, I want you to wait three minutes  before you take it off.
ZACK	m	Bitsey, I'm not so sure about this.
BITSEY	?	Three full minutes. Just stand behind  the tripod. Both of you.
BITSEY	?	Have you started?
ZACK	m	Twenty-two seconds.
ZACK	m	Thirty seconds.
NICO	m	Fuckin' wicked.
ZACK	m	Thirty-five... Forty... Forty-five...  Fifty.
NICO	m	Maybe she shouldn't...
ZACK	m	Fifty-five... one minute... five...  ten... one-fifteen...
ZACK	m	Fuck. Twenty... twenty-five...  thirty...
NICO	m	This isn't cool.
ZACK	m	...thirty-five... Fuck... one-forty...  one-forty fi...
BITSEY	?	Zack!
ZACK	m	Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You  okay? What if I'd've waited?
ZACK	m	No more fucking experiments, all  right? Just tell me what's going on.  You okay?
BITSEY	?	She... she did it herself.
BITSEY	?	She used the gloves to keep  fingerprints off the tape and bag.  Then she put them back on the dish  rack, but upside down and inside  out, a housewives' habit. A murderer  would have just tossed them aside --  like they were the first time we  were here, like you do a towel in a  hotel.
ZACK	m	Maybe, all right, maybe. But why wear these?
BITSEY	?	They threw me. I forgot you have to  have the key to put them on. But she  needed them. She knew she would  instinctively try to rip the bag  off, that at some point automatism  would kick in.
NICO	m	Fuckin' A, like when people hang  themselves. At the last second they  go chicken, claw at the rope and  shit. The police find their own skin  beneath their nails.
BITSEY	?	And she swallowed the key so she  couldn't get to it. She made sure  there was no way out.
ZACK	m	Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang  yourself, or take pills. Why take  your fucking clothes off? Why make  it look like a murder?
BITSEY	?	It's so calculated. She's handcuffed,  taped at the mouth. The gloves. The  damn tripod.
ZACK	m	Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder?
BITSEY	?	I don't know.
ZACK	m	Motive's like a major issue here.
BITSEY	?	Thanks, Zack.
ZACK	m	It doesn't make sense. The woman's a  bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why  frame an innocent man? Why send Gale  to the chair for what looks --
BITSEY	?	What'd you say?
ZACK	m	She had to know some innocent fuck  would take the fall.
BITSEY	?	Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's  why! To prove it happens. To have  absolute proof that the system  convicts innocents.
ZACK	m	Get the fuck out of here.
BITSEY	?	No, that's how she thought. She lived  for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die,  why not die for it? That's why the  tripod was here. To record proof,  undeniable proof, the tape. That's  why we got an out-take.
ZACK	m	A dead woman put the tape in your  room?
BITSEY	?	Of course not. She needed help,  someone to keep it, release it.  Someone she could trust, someone  dedicated to the cause...
ZACK	m	Thick as thieves.
ZACK	m	Hairy.
BITSEY	?	Come on.
BITSEY	?	...Because of the Berlin thing,  Constance knew the police would go  straight to Gale. In a way, he's  perfect. A high profile alcoholic  whose life was shit anyway. But...
ZACK	m	She was in love with him.
BITSEY	?	I don't know. Something. They were  close. She wouldn't want him dead.
BITSEY	?	Remember this thing about Dusty being  a bull-horner, going to far?
ZACK	m	Why he was fired from DeathWatch,  and the A.C.L.U.
BITSEY	?	Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty  to release the tape after Gale's  conviction, after a year or so. You  know, force him to dry out, let him  play the heroic victim, give him  back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's  sitting on this tape, waiting, the  only one who knows about it. And  maybe good ole Dusty starts to think  that an erroneous execution is a  hell of a lot more politically useful  than a last-minute save.
ZACK	m	Which would only prove the system  works.
BITSEY	?	Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count.  What's one murder to stop thousands?
ZACK	m	So he'll wait, release the whole  tape after the execution.
BITSEY	?	Right. Somewhere he must have the  original. What time is it?
DUSTY	m	Hello?
ZACK	m	Let's talk about your tape... No,  meet me at the station down the hill,  in fifteen minutes.
BITSEY	?	Don't move from the booth. Call the  second you see the truck. Remember,  let it ring just once. Then get into  the woods --
ZACK	m	I know. Go.
BITSEY	?	Into the woods, Zack.
ZACK	m	Go!
BITSEY	?	Shit!
BITSEY	?	Shit!
BITSEY	?	Shit!
ZACK	m	Come on. Fucking come on.
CONSTANCE	f	Ready?
ZACK	m	He didn't show! Fuckin' move!
BITSEY	?	Everyone! Wake up New York, the  warden, the Governor, the goddamn  Supreme Court death clerk! How far  is it?
ZACK	m	Took me 30 this afternoon. You've  got 26, maybe more.
BITSEY	?	I'll make it.
BITSEY	?	Give me the time. Give me the goddamn  time.
ROBERTS	m	Here's what we know so far. Last  night, News Magazine posted on their  web site a video obtained by reporter  Bitsey Bloom...
ROBERTS	m	The footage appears to show Constance  Harraway commit suicide.
ROBERTS	m	Bloom reports she received the tape  Friday morning at a motel in  Huntsville, where she was staying  while conducting Gale's last  interview.
ROBERTS	m	The tape apparently had been in the  possession of a former DeathWatch  Director...
ROBERTS	m	...Dustin Emil Wright. As you can  see, police and officials from the  State Attorney's office have been in  and out of his cabin all morning,  looking for clues to his whereabouts.
ROBERTS	m	...a fanatic in the movement to stop  the death penalty.
ROBERTS	m	It appears Wright withheld the tape  to make an obscure political point  about the potential for error in  capital cases.
DUSTY	m	All there?
BELYEU	?	Passport and ticket as well.
GOVERNOR HARDIN	m	Well, it's a tragedy for all of us.  As to whether this will change policy,  the people of Texas will have to  decide. Right now, the prudent course  is to put things on hold pendin' a  procedural review, allow ourselves  time to mourn.
KRUGER	m	You bet she'll review. Capital  punishment approval rates dropped 17  points.
BELYEU	?	What are you going to do?
DUSTY	m	Go to the opera.
ROBERTS	m	Of course, the ultimate irony is  that David Gale, a man who became an  unwitting martyr, may achieve in  death what he worked for in life.
DUSTY	m	Senorita Gale esta viviendo aqui?
OLD WOMAN	f	Si. Si.
DUSTY	m	Gracias.
MAIL GUY	m	This just came.
BITSEY	?	Key to your freedom? Key to your...
DUSTY	m	It's over.
DUSTY	m	Want me to turn this off?
VOICE	m	No.
DAVID	m	I couldn't watch.
DUSTY	m	She preferred it that way. You were  right about not tellin' her the whole  plan.
DAVID	m	It helped her to think her death  would save me.
DUSTY	m	You sure you want to do this?
DAVID	m	Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count.
DUSTY	m	Better go ahead then.
