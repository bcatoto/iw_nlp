DEALER	m	Insurance?
PLAYER IN F.G.	m	Don't you hold back, baby. Spit it  out, darlin'. C'mon... Hey! Hey,  this ain't right. S'posed to be eight  hundred dollars. Where's the goddamn  manager? Who's in charge of these  rip-off slots? Yo, ma'am... change  lady...
FIGURE/BERNIE	?	Hey Doris, you got any cream?
BERNIE	m	Forget it.
NATALIE	f	Shit. Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please.
BERNIE	m	Hi, Natalie.
NATALIE	f	Hi. Uh...
BERNIE	m	Bernie.
NATALIE	f	Yeah, Bernie. Hey, you seen Shelly around? He  promised to position me at the tables  tonight. I've been on skid row all  week.
DORIS	f	You didn't settle me from last night.
NATALIE	f	No? You sure? Fuck... And I was way  under. It's been, like, an A.A.  convention the whole week. I'll make  up for it tonight. Promise.
BERNIE	m	If I see Shelly, I'll let him know.  That you're looking for him.
NATALIE	f	Thanks.
DORIS	f	Bitch. That's the third time this  month... Let me get you that cream.
BERNIE	m	Nah, it's okay.
DORIS	f	Don't get sweet on that, Bernie. Not  unless you're looking to get short- changed.
FLOORMAN	m	Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on  eleven.
BERNIE	m	Uh... Let's do the Chivas Regal.  Have that... Natalie bring it over.  The one working nickel slots next to  the Paradise. I spoke to Shelly  earlier, he wants her at the tables.
NATALIE	f	This is you, right?
BERNIE	m	Thanks.
NATALIE	f	Joe said I should stick around. You  say something to Shelly?
NATALIE	f	Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks.
BERNIE	m	Don't mention it.
BULLDOG	m	I'll make you a fortune on five and  nine. C'mon forty-five-sixty-three  fifty-four!
BERNIE	m	Hey, buddy, is this your drink?
BULLDOG	m	Back off, pal. I'm on a roll here.
STICKMAN	m	Seven out!
BULLDOG	m	Mother-fucker!
STICKMAN	m	Thank you for those bets, folks.
VOICE	m	Conway, party of twelve, please check  your reservation at the Paradise  Lounge.
BERNIE	m	Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'...
SHELLY	f	Nicky, how the hell are you? I didn't  know you were coming in...
NICKY	?	Whassimater? You think I don't wash  up after goin' to the John? Forget  about it.
SHELLY	f	You shoulda called ahead. I woulda  sent a car...
NICKY	?	Ehh. We thought we'd surprise you.
SHELLY	f	Well, anytime, Nicky. Anytime.
NICKY	?	Shelly, I want you to meet one of  our smartest VPs, Larry Sokolov. And  his numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.
LARRY	m	How do you do, Shelly?
SHELLY	f	What can I get you boys to drink?
SHELLY	f	So... what brings you to town, Nicky?
NICKY	?	Look, Shelly, this is your joint,  you run it the way you see fit. But  we got a smart kid here and he's got  some good ideas on how to revitalize  the Shangri-la.
SHELLY	f	Revitalize? What are you talking  about? We did thirty-five million  last year.
LARRY	m	First off, Shelly, I want you to  know, I have nothing but respect for  you. You've done a fantastic job  with the Shangri-la for the last  sixteen years. No one would dispute  that.
NICKY	?	Yeah, no one doubts that, Shelly.
LARRY	m	But, the business has changed out  here. You just have to take a look  at the Strip to see what I'm talking  about.
SHELLY	f	You mean, that amusement park mook  fest out there? You know what that  is? That's a fucking violation of  something that used to be beautiful.  That used to have class. Like a  gorgeous high priced hooker with an  exclusive clientele. And then that  Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up  and puts her in a family way.
SHELLY	f	Now she's nothing but a cheap, fat  whore hiding behind too much makeup.  I look at her and see all those ugly  stretch marks and I want to cry.  'Cause I remember her as she was.
LARRY	m	Yes, well... there's no denying the  bottom line. Those eyesores are raking  it in. And we can't compete against  that.
SHELLY	f	What? You think I'm trying to compete  with that? You think this joint's  about bringing in the stroller crowd?  Fresh off some fucking E-ticket ride,  looking to break the house on red  and black. Fremont's never been about  that bullshit. This is where old  time and real money comes to play.
LARRY	m	The numbers, they don't back you up,  Shelly. Nostalgia's grand. We all  love nostalgia -- but it belongs in  a museum. I think it's time to decide  whether you're running a museum or a  casino.
NICKY	?	Hey, forget about it. We'll talk  later. Over dinner.
MARTY	f	So, how's the action?
SHELLY	f	Bernie. Mr. Cool. Got a moment?
BERNIE	m	I was just heading over to --
SHELLY	f	It can wait.
SHELLY	f	How's the knee?
SHELLY	f	I was speaking to this orthopedic  surgeon over at Vegas Memorial. He  tells me they can replace a man's  entire kneecap with titanium. It's  the kinda thing that costs a shitload,  but since the man's into us for five  hundred large, I'm sure we could --
BERNIE	m	I told you, I'm not gonna be around  after Sunday.
SHELLY	f	Where you gonna go, Bernie? Where  the fuck are you gonna go that's  better'n here? I got you covered in  this town. People, they know you  work for me, that's currency in your  pocket. That's fuckin' respect when  you walk the floor. Where you gonna  get that anyplace else?
BERNIE	m	Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and  I'm out from under.
SHELLY	f	That's right. I like to know who's  shopping it in my neighborhood. You  wanna keep working the Shangri-la,  you come see me tomorrow morning in  my office. We'll go over the rules  together. And before you come, you  bring me a clean bill of health. OK?
SHELLY	f	All right, get outta here.
SHELLY	f	You want that, Bernie? She's yours.  Anytime. I'll keep a tab running for  you. What's a matter? Not your type?
BERNIE	m	Things are getting hot on fourteen.  I gotta go.
HOOKER	m	...Oh yeah, baby, give it to me. Oh  yeah, that's the spot... Do it to me  harder, you big stud... Oooooh...
NATALIE	f	Seven and Seven?
PINKERTON	m	Thanks, dollface.
NATALIE	f	Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz.
BERNIE	m	It's all right. Happens.
NATALIE	f	Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands,  you know...
BERNIE	m	S'okay. You might want to stick  around.
STICKMAN	m	Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have  no hard eight.
PINKERTON	m	Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight.
STICKMAN	m	Eight the hard way!
STICKMAN	m	Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton.
PINKERTON	m	Parlay! Parlay!
PINKERTON	m	C'mon. You can take that action.
PINKERTON	m	That's what I'm talking about. None  of this low limit bullshit.
BERNIE	m	Dollar hard eight.
STICKMAN	m	Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight  comes down.
PINKERTON	m	Five hundred dollar hard eight. And  press my nine up two units.
STICKMAN	m	Easy way eight! Eight easy!
PINKERTON	m	Hard eight.
PLAYER	m	Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm.
STICKMAN	m	Seven out!
PINKERTON	m	What the fuck you smiling at, bitch?
BUDDY	m	Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment  tonight. I shouldn'a let you talk me  into going on. It's definitely strep.
SHELLY	f	You were velvet out there, pops.  Silk.
SHELLY	f	They were hanging on the door outside.  Forget your tonsils. When the muff  confetti stops coming, that's when  you got yourself a problem.
BUDDY	m	You get a receipt?
SHELLY	f	Excuse me?
BUDDY	m	Charmayne's in the lobby. They got  these on sale in the window. Victoria  Secret's Valentine's Collection. And  the broad waiting in the room, what  she set you back? Always Grade-A for  Ol' Buddy.
SHELLY	f	Are you kidding me? Gimme that. You don't fucking deserve this. All  those ladies going home with a sweet  breeze between their legs because  you still do it for them and you're  fingering me for some kinda Buddy  Stafford ego pimp. Hey, fuck you,  old man.
BUDDY	m	Get back here, you prick. Hand it  over.
BUDDY	m	Whassimatter, kid? You got that  Nostradamus look.
BUDDY	m	You ever watch those nature shows on
BUDDY	m	I've seen this one a dozen times.  It's about lions. Cycle of life thing.  The leader of the pack...
SHELLY	f	Pride. It's called a pride.
BUDDY	m	Yeah, pride. The leader of the  pride... when he gets on in years.  It's just a matter of time before  some young male arrives on the scene  to challenge him. They go at it and  the old cat gets the crap beaten  outta him. It's humiliating. In front  of all the females, this goes down.  And after he's defeated, he's cast  out of the pride, to scavenge and  die alone in the bush.
SHELLY	f	Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense  of humor.
BUDDY	m	No shit. It's fucking tragic because  the old lion can't figure it out on  his own. That he's past it. It'd be  so much easier for him to just walk  away and save himself all that pain  and humiliation.
SHELLY	f	That's like admitting to yourself  that you're already dead. I prefer  nature's way.
BUDDY	m	Yeah. Me, too.
LARRY	m	Shelly, got a minute...
LARRY	m	Shelly, this is Johnny Capella.
JOHNNY	m	How ya doin', Shelly?
SHELLY	f	I know you from somewhere, right?
LARRY	m	Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz  at the Mirage. Sony's talking about  signing him to a three album deal.  They're positioning him as the new  Ricki Martin.
SHELLY	f	And I should be interested in this,  why?
LARRY	m	Johnny's looking to headline. I told  him we might be interested.
SHELLY	f	We?
JOHNNY	m	Hey, if this is a bad time...
SHELLY	f	Even if I were interested, Buddy's  got ink with us through 2003. I just  renegotiated his contract last year.
JOHNNY	m	Sounds like the two of you need to  get on the same page. If I don't hear from you by Thursday,  I'm taking the Stardust's offer.
NICKY	?	Where's Buddy? I wanna buy the old  fart a drink.
SHELLY	f	Buddy asked me to send you his  regards, Nicky. He's not feeling so  great. I think he's got that stomach  flu that's going around.
NICKY	?	Oh yeah? That's too bad. Well, another time then.
MARTY	f	Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be  able to hook us up with some  showgirls. Something with class.
SHELLY	f	Sure, no problem. You got any  preferences?
NICKY	?	Yeah. Something with big headlights,  nice rims and low mileage.
MARTY	f	You got any Asian babes?
LARRY	m	I think I'll just stick with the  tables.
NATALIE	f	Buy you a drink?
NATALIE	f	Your Progressed Venus is Gemini,  12.5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion.  Which tells me that you're a slow  starter when it comes to romance. You know what? This is real  unprofessional of me. I shouldn't  discuss your chart with you until  I'm all done. I can tell by that  look, you think this is all a lot of
BERNIE	m	No... I just know what the outcome's  going to be.
NATALIE	f	The outcome? There's not, like, one  particular outcome. A lot of things  enter into it. The planets, moon  phases...
BERNIE	m	The outcome won't change with me.  It'll be all bad.
NATALIE	f	God, I have never met anyone who was  so down on themselves. I used to be  down on myself, OK? I don't go there  anymore. I've got just three more  correspondence classes with this  stuff, then I'll have my certificate  and everything. And you know how I  got OK?
BERNIE	m	You had your chart done.
NATALIE	f	Yes, as a matter of fact that is  perfectly correct.
BERNIE	m	Do you know what I do at the Shangri- la?
NATALIE	f	I asked around. You're a "cooler."  You turn winners into losers.
BERNIE	m	And do you know how I do that?
NATALIE	f	I know there's stuff that goes on in  casinos all the time --
BERNIE	m	I do it by being myself. People get  next to me and their luck turns.  It's always been that way.
NATALIE	f	That sounds to me like a self  fulfilling prophecy. There's a whole  chapter on that in my course. Anyways,  I can see a big factor in your life  is that you're lacking companionship.  There's nobody to deflect off. If  you've got, as you put it, bad karma,  then you need someone with good karma  to neutralize it. Well, that's my  take on it anyway.
BERNIE	m	I don't know about you, but I'm real  tired.
NATALIE	f	I have this recurring dream where  I'm on some beautiful island in the  Bahamas. I'm sitting on the beach,  taking in this amazing sunset with  one of these in my hand ...and then it starts to rain. And I  wake up and it's my roof leaking on  me. Yeah, I'm also real tired, Bernie.
BERNIE	m	I only got six more days. Well, almost  five really. Then I'll be leaving  town.
NATALIE	f	Only five more days? Then we shouldn't waste any more  time.
NATALIE	f	Why don't we go back to your place?
BERNIE	m	I, uh... If this is... I don't know...  I don't know if I can afford...
BERNIE	m	Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't  mean... You see -- that's exactly  what I'm talking about. I've gone  and "cooled" the damn table.
NATALIE	f	Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't  gone and cooled anything. Not by a  long shot.
NATALIE	f	You should complain about this.
BERNIE	m	I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry,  all I got's gin.
NATALIE	f	Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead.
NATALIE	f	You know, once they're dead, they  don't really grow back. In case,  that's what you're waiting for.
NATALIE	f	So... got any music?
NATALIE	f	Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least  one of us has done this before.
BERNIE	m	This is not my first --
NATALIE	f	Sssh. Surprise me.
NATALIE	f	You're doing real good.
BERNIE	m	Sorry...
NATALIE	f	Don't worry, Bernie. I've had worse.  We'll try again later.
NATALIE	f	Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast?
BERNIE	m	-- I did six months at Rikers for  running numbers. It was Shelly's  thing, but I took the rap for it.
BERNIE	m	After I get out, I call up Shelly  and he tells me to come out here. I  figure he's going to set me up good  at the Shangri-la. But he tells me  they got all these rules about casinos  employing felons. So he gets me this  gig doing telemarketing for one of  their fronts -- trying to scam  pensioners out of their retirement  money. I lasted two weeks.
BERNIE	m	Already, I was getting in deep.  Finally it got so bad, I had to beg  Shelly to take on my markers around  town. That just bought me more time  to keep losing. I put Shelly in an  awkward position. I understand why  he did what he did.
NATALIE	f	He did that to you? What, he shot  you?
BERNIE	m	Baseball bat. I got off easy.
NATALIE	f	That's getting off easy?
BERNIE	m	I was out of control.
NATALIE	f	But he maimed you...
BERNIE	m	Let me tell you something. I'm  grateful for what he did. No kidding. Every time I get an urge  to play off the clock -- to so much  as drop a quarter in a slot -- I  reach down and squeeze what's left  of my cartilage. It's one helluva  reminder.
NATALIE	f	Jesus... I thought stuff like that  didn't happen no more. Like that was  just in the movies or something.
BERNIE	m	Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a  payment plan. Two years off the books  at the Shangri-la, cooling tables.  Five more days and I walk.
PREGNANT GIRL	f	Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor!
BERNIE	m	Mikey?
MIKEY	m	Bernie...
PREGNANT GIRL	f	I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks.
BERNIE	m	Mikey? Is that...? You're not the...
MIKEY	m	Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs  in the family. I guess you're gonna  be a grandfather, Bernie.
BERNIE	m	This you?
MIKEY	m	Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways,  we gotta be somewhere...
BERNIE	m	How's your mom doing?
MIKEY	m	I'm gonna pretend like you give a  shit and tell you, she's getting by.  As long as she's wasted.
MIKEY	m	Name's Charlene, in case you were  wondering. Looks like she's carrying  a whole litter in there, don't it?
NATALIE	f	When was the last time you saw a  doctor?
CHARLENE	f	This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six  months ago. I wasn't about to go  back after they treated me like  cattle. Just because I didn't have  no insurance. And those places,  they're crawling with T.B. from all  'em spies.
BERNIE	m	So, you're in town...?
MIKEY	m	Maybe a week or so. Got some business  to take care of.
BERNIE	m	If you want, stop by the Lucky Star  Motel. Give us a chance to catch up.  I'm on three to eleven shift at the  Shangri-la. I work the floor.
MIKEY	m	No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah,  maybe I'll do that. We can play catch  up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split.
NATALIE	f	Take care.
PLAYER	m	Thanks...
BERNIE	m	Don't mention it.
DEALER	m	Hundred dollar minimum here, sir.
DEALER	m	Money plays one hundred.
PLAYER	m	No offense, pal, but there's twenty  other tables. What do you wanna come  sit on my head for?
BERNIE	m	Just wanna play one hand. Feeling  lucky tonight. I got this voice in  my head, says this is the table...
PLAYER	m	I know this is the table. I'm already  doing good here. It's my fucking  table --
BERNIE	m	Hey, heard the one about the fella  walks into a bar and says, "Hey, who  owns that big great dane outside?" A  man at the end of the bar raises his  hand. "I do." The fella says, "Yeah?  Well, my dog just killed it."
BERNIE	m	"Whaddya mean your dog just killed  my great dane? What kinda dog you  have?" The fella just shrugs and  says, "A chihuahua." "You tellin' me  your chihuahua just killed my great  dane? How?" "I dunno," the fella says, "I think  he got stuck in his throat."
DEALER	m	Insurance?
PLAYER	m	God damnit!
PLAYER	m	You said, one hand.
BERNIE	m	Keep going.
PLAYER	m	Hey, stick around, pal. You and me,  we make a great team.
SHELLY	f	What was that?
SHELLY	f	Well, what fucking gives? Is it  McGann? He's been with us twelve  years. The man's as standup as my  dick. Maybe he's got money problems. I'm  gonna pull him. He wasn't counting  'em, was he? The mook with the streak?
LARRY	m	Is there a problem?
SHELLY	f	No, there's no problem. Fella's on a  streak, is all.
LARRY	m	Let me guess? This is one of your  "coolers?"
SHELLY	f	Why don't you announce it to the  whole fucking joint?
LARRY	m	Man, they told me you were a stickler  for the old ways. But coolers? What  is this guy, some kind of degenerate  gambler? Reformed card shark? He  doesn't look too effective to me.
SHELLY	f	He's the best. Take it from me.
LARRY	m	Sure. Whatever. But there ways --  subtle ways -- to keep things in our  favor. I'm talking more forward  thinking methods.
SHELLY	f	That right? I suppose you got a whole  fucking prospectus on the subject.
LARRY	m	As a matter of fact I do. Like, right  off the bat, I can tell you this  wallpaper isn't going to cut it.  It's too uplifting. I would go with  more muted tones.
SHELLY	f	Yeah? Wallpaper?
LARRY	m	And personally, I think the waitresses  can all pop another button or two.  Myself, I wouldn't hire anything  less than a C cup.
LARRY	m	Know what this is? Music to be sure.  Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended  in at a subsonic level is a mantra.  "Lose... lose... lose." And that's  just skimming the surface. We really  need to talk, Shelly.
MORRIE	m	Shelly, you better come quick.
SHELLY	f	Get a hold of his daughter. Assist  her with the arrangements. The Shangri- la will take care of everything.
MORRIE	m	What about the Paradise?
SHELLY	f	She goes dark tonight.
LARRY	m	That won't be necessary.
RING TOSS WORKER	m	Over here, young lady! C'mon, give  it a try. Eight for a dollar.
RING TOSS WORKER	m	Sorry there, sweetheart. Better luck  next time. Wanna try again?
NATALIE	f	What?
BERNIE	m	Nothing.
NATALIE	f	What?
BERNIE	m	Nothing. You're just an easy mark,  is all.
NATALIE	f	An easy mark?
BERNIE	m	Yeah. Easy mark. You never heard  that term?
BERNIE	m	When we were kids, Shelly and me, we  used to work Coney Island during the  summer. When a guy would walk up and  seemed eager to open his wallet, we  would always mark him with chalk.  We'd pat him on the back or arm with  the chalk. Like, 'Hey buddy, good  job!' Meanwhile, he had no clue the other  guys saw him coming a mile away.  Easy mark.
BERNIE	m	You OK?
NATALIE	f	You notice last night, that tattoo  on my butt?
BERNIE	m	Little Joe.
NATALIE	f	Yeah, two twos. Little Joe.
NATALIE	f	I had a son. His name was Joe. I was  his mother for a year.
BERNIE	m	You know, you don't have to tell me  this.
NATALIE	f	I want to, Bernie. Better you know  the worst of me up front. Later,  when I'm already invested in you,  it'll be too hard to come clean.  After I tell you this, you'll  probably... I mean, I'll understand.
NATALIE	f	I gave my son up for adoption. I  just wanted my life back. I was  seventeen going on eighteen and I  was selfish. My family, they didn't  want to have nothing to do with me  after that. So I hitched a ride out  here. Figured I could make it as a  showgirl. Ten years later... I like to think that if it happened  when I was older -- with some guy I  cared about -- maybe things would  have been different. I think about  my Little Joe. And, I do know he's  better off. I'm convinced of that.
BERNIE	m	So, you wanna go try your hand at  the dime pitch? It's early still.
CHARLENE	f	I gotta go pee. I'm always peeing.
NATALIE	f	How did you get in here?
MIKEY	m	I told the desk clerk Bernie was my  old man. He let us wait inside. That  a problem?
NATALIE	f	Bernie's looking for a parking space.
MIKEY	m	Shit. I musta taken the last one.
MIKEY	m	Tell me something, Natalie? Is he  paying you?
NATALIE	f	Excuse me?
MIKEY	m	My old man, is he renting your ass?  'Cause otherwise I just don't get  it. A loser like my pops in the  company of some primo T & A. It don't  compute.
MIKEY	m	This enough to get me a taste? Family  discount?
BERNIE	m	Mikey...
MIKEY	m	Hey, Bernie. I told you I was gonna  stop by.
BERNIE	m	Yeah... I figured you'd call ahead.  We were out at breakfast.
NATALIE	f	You missed some.
MIKEY	m	You see, the thing is, Bernie, we're  kinda strapped. I mean, Charly here's  expecting like yesterday, and we  don't have the dough to make with  the right nutrition for her an' all.  So, I was wondering if you would  care to invest a little in your  grandchild's future... his well being.
BERNIE	m	There's about three grand there.  That's all I got.
CHARLENE	f	Bless you, Bernie. You know, Michael, I  -- think we  should name her Bernadette. After  your father.
MIKEY	m	You mean, Bernie. Trust me, it's a  boy.
CHARLENE	f	Wanna feel her?
BERNIE	m	I don't think... I don't want anything  to hap...
CHARLENE	f	Ooh, I just felt her kick. C'mon,  Bernie, gimme your hand...
CHARLENE	f	Feel that?
BERNIE	m	I don't know... I think so...
MIKEY	m	We'll catch you later, Bernie. I  think I'm gonna take Charly over to  the hospital right now. Get her  checked up real good.
CHARLENE	f	Take care, Pop.
BERNIE	m	Mikey...
BERNIE	m	You're not going to try anything  stupid while you're in town?
BERNIE	m	You mess up and they'll cut you no  slack. That's all I'm saying. You  got a kid to think about.
NICKY	?	Shelly, I hope you don't mind...
SHELLY	f	What's going on, Nicky?
NICKY	?	I'm sorry we didn't say nothing about  this earlier... but the deal wasn't  closed yet.
MARTY	f	Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna  love it.
NICKY	?	The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino.  We break ground on her in six months.
NICKY	?	I know what you're thinking? Where's  she gonna go? You need space to  expand, right? Well, that's been  taken care of. We're now the proud  owners of The Golden Frontier next  door.
LARRY	m	She's perfect. Three floors of gaming,  IMAX theater, entertainment center,  boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster,  you name it. She'll pay for herself  in three years, and then it's easy  money.
NICKY	?	Isn't she great, Shell?
SHELLY	f	In "Lost Horizon," these people,  their plane crashes in the Himalayas --  and they get rescued and taken to  this Utopia in the mountains. Shangri- la. It's beautiful. The place is  completely isolated. Untouched by  the outside world. There's no war,  no greed, no bullshit... Time is  slowed down. People, they don't age.  It's... paradise. That's what Shangri- la is. Paradise.
LARRY	m	Yeah, we've all seen the movie. And  your point is?
SHELLY	f	You don't fuck with paradise! All'a  ya!
NICKY	?	Hey, Jesus, c'mon, Shelly. We're not  trying to fuck with it. We're trying  to make it better.
SHELLY	f	How... how, Nicky, could it be any  better? Right now it's perfect. It's  the last of its kind. It's pure...  and this. ...this is just... it's a mockery.  An insult. Trying to make something  of it that it isn't.
LARRY	m	What are you talking about? It's  right outta the movie?
SHELLY	f	Whose talking about a fuckin' movie?  This ain't a fuckin' movie. This is  my life. This is my house of worship.  You people are shittin' on all that's  sacred to me.
SHELLY	f	I got just one question? Where you  gonna be when they decide to change  it back? When the people, they come  looking for the real Vegas, from  before all this Epcott Center  bullshit. Who's gonna it give it to  them? You guys? I don't think so.  You know who? The same fucks who  started this shit in the first place.  It's all gonna come full circle and  bite you in the ass. Mark my words.
NICKY	?	You make some good points, Shelly.  Maybe it'll swing back the other  way, who knows? But the smart money  suggests we roll the dice. I'm not  gonna bullshit you; naturally there's  gonna be a lot of restructuring in  the months to come, but I want you  to know, you'll always have a place  with us.
SHELLY	f	Where's that? Behind the bar?
MARTY	f	Behind the bar, that's a good one.
NICKY	?	I think you should take some time  and think things through. All this,  it's a lot to digest, y'know.
MARTY	f	Speaking of things to digest, I'm  starving. How's that buffet they got  in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You  recommend their prime rib, Shell?
SHELLY	f	It's food.
NICKY	?	Hey, my arteries can use a workout.  Lead us to the trough, Shell.
NICKY	?	Wait up a second...
MARTY	f	I thought we were gonna eat?
SHELLY	f	Maybe we wanna play over there. Less  crowded.
NICKY	?	Nah, let's play here. This is my  lucky table. I always play here. Go on ahead. I know where to find  you guys.
STICKMAN	m	Out! Seven, line away seven...
SUBURBANITE	?	C"mon, pops! What the hell? I coulda  paid my mortgage with the money I  just lost.
SHOOTER	m	Hey? I'm supposed to be next...
NICKY	?	File a grievance, shithead.
STICKMAN	m	We're coming out. Crap Eleven, any  seven.
NICKY	?	Hundred dollar big red.
SUBURBANITE	?	Hurry it up, gramps. Your soup's  getting cold.
STICKMAN	m	Crap, Ace Deuce. Line down.
SUBURBANITE	?	Hey, Busketti, maybe you should try  shuffleboard.
SUBURBANITE	?	Uncle Palsy? Shake'em this direction.
STICKMAN	m	Four, hard four. The point is four.
SUBURBANITE	?	Good now throw it before you fucking  keel over and die, old man.
SUBURBANITE	?	Happy birthday to me. Happy Birthday  to me... Jesus, fuck, I'm another  year older already.
STICKMAN	m	OUT! Seven! Line away.
SUBURBANITE	?	Don't take it so hard, pops. Everybody  craps out.
SUBURBANITE	?	Now go change your fucking Depends.
NICKY	?	Who's laughing now, huh? ya fuckin!  prick! C'mon, crack wise again... Ya  fuckin' smooth as a Ken doll, no- dick, suburbanite scum. How's that  for a game?!
NICKY	?	That ain't right, Shelly! Guy fucks  up my game like that. Who the fuck  does he think he is?
SHELLY	f	You're right. He's just a piece of  shit. Forget about him.
NICKY	?	I thought this joint had more class.  Used to be, we wouldn't even let  bums like that in...
BERNIE	m	This town... You know, Natalie, all  I want to do is go some place where  I can tell day from night. Where  they got clocks on the wall. I can't  breathe around here no more. Four  days and I'm gone. I'm not even sure  I can hold out that long.
NATALIE	f	So where does that leave us?
BERNIE	m	A week ago, I didn't remember what  it was like to have a woman's hands  on me. I'm still pinching myself,  expecting to wake-up from... Come with me, Natalie. I want you to  come with me.
NATALIE	f	God, Bernie, that's...
BERNIE	m	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring  that on you.
NATALIE	f	Bernie... I want to be with you. I  do. But I don't know if I can leave  with you.
NATALIE	f	I was working on a compatibility  chart for the two of us. And it looks  good, really, it does.
BERNIE	m	So, what's the problem?
NATALIE	f	That's with us here. In Vegas.
NATALIE	f	Maybe I was being presumptuous, 'cause  I knew you were leaving... and I  tried working it in different ways...  It wasn't good, Bernie. I got scared.  But that's just for now, for the  immediate future. Once the planets  realign, maybe a year from now...
BERNIE	m	Natalie... I can't... Not another  year. Not another week.
BERNIE	m	I think... we probably shouldn't see  each other anymore.
NATALIE	f	Why, Bernie? We only got a couple  days left together. Why not make the  most of them?
BERNIE	m	Because if I spend one more night in  your arms, I'm not going anywhere.
NATALIE	f	And that's so bad?
NATALIE	f	Take care, Bernie.
BERNIE	m	Natalie, don't...
WAITRESS	?	Get you another?
BERNIE	m	I think you better bring me the  bottle. Please.
VOICE	m	Chang, party of fifteen, your table  is ready, Chang party of fifteen.
CHARLENE	f	Come on, Mikey. This is our future.  Don't blow it.
MIKEY	m	Put this on the line for the boys.
MIKEY	m	With shoes!
STICKMAN	m	Dealer's got shoes. Hands high, the  dice are out! The point is nine.
CHARLENE	f	Come on all you's. Put a good thought  in for our baby!
STICKMAN	m	Six the hard way!
CHARLENE	f	Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He  knows. He knows you're all pulling  for him. God bless you all.
STICKMAN	m	Six the hard way! Look out, we got a  shooter!
SHELLY	f	How much?
BERNIE	m	Eighteen thousand since I stepped  up. I'm sorry, Shelly, I guess I've  been hit and miss lately.
SHELLY	f	Fucking amateurs...
STICKMAN	m	Seven out! Line away.
MIKEY	m	I thank you. My wife thanks you. My  unborn child thanks you.
MIKEY	m	Color me up will ya?
LARRY	m	You've gotta be kidding me. That's not how I propose we handle  it. We'll turn the matter over to  the authorities. They'll be  blacklisted, their credit ruined...
SHELLY	f	And then we'll give 'em both a  lollipop for the ride home. Come  watch and learn, Harvard. A little  lesson on how to protect your  investment -- the old school way.
SHELLY	f	Hey, that was some run you had back  there.
MIKEY	m	Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess.
SHELLY	f	Why don't we go do this in my office?  I don't like to hand out all this  amount of cash on the floor.
CHARLENE	f	Oh my God... I can feel the  contractions coming on...
BERNIE	m	Shelly, stop them! Don't do this!
SHELLY	f	Get lost, Bernie, this got nothing  to do with you.
BERNIE	m	It's got everything to do with me.  He's my son.
SHELLY	f	What did you say?
BERNIE	m	I said, he's my --
SHELLY	f	Who? This little prick?
MIKEY	m	Pop, help me...
BERNIE	m	Shelly, don't you fucking do it!
SHELLY	f	Were you in on this? Jesus, you better  come clean with me.
BERNIE	m	NO! God, no! I didn't know nothing  about it.
SHELLY	f	How much you think their lives are  worth, Bernie? Myself, I don't think  they're worth piss. But, hey, it  ain't my kid...
SHELLY	f	Let me see: they were up almost a  hundred and fifty grand. That's 150  G's someone's gonna have to account  for. What do you say, Bernie, seventy- five grand a piece?
SHELLY	f	Hey, I know you don't have that kind  of cash. But, since you're a friend  of the house, I'm willing to front  you.
BERNIE	m	Shelly, they didn't get away with  the money... You didn't lose  anything...
BERNIE	m	Oh Jesus... Yes! All right. It's on  me. 150 G's.
CHARLENE	f	Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me  to the hospital... contractions...
BERNIE	m	Shelly, please help her. That's my  grandson...
SHELLY	f	Hey, why don't we all break out the  champagne? Lootz is about to become  a granddaddy. How you doin' there, sweetheart?  Must hurt like crap, huh?
CHARLENE	f	Hurts so bad...
SHELLY	f	Yeah?
NATALIE	f	Oh God...
BERNIE	m	Jesus NOOOOO!!!
SHELLY	f	Here! It's a fuckin' boy. Anyone got  a cigar?
SHELLY	f	You sure you still want to be good  for it? Because if you want to change  your mind, I don't blame you.
MIKEY	m	I'll make it up to you, Pop, I  swear...
BERNIE	m	It's on me.
SHELLY	f	That's the worst fucking call you  ever made in your life.
BERNIE	m	What are you doing?! I thought we  had --
SHELLY	f	150 G's buys their lives. This is  just a little slap on the wrist to  remember me by.
CHARLENE	f	Oh god... it wasn't my idea.
SHELLY	f	You know, motherhood is a beautiful  thing. This... you made a mockery  out of it. Maybe you'll get to  experience it for real one day.
CHARLENE	f	I want... to be a mother... please  don't hurt me...
SHELLY	f	I'm not going to hurt you.
SHELLY	f	Get 'em outta here. You ever see  them in this joint again, kill 'em.
SHELLY	f	You two, you're still on shift.
BERNIE	m	I did this to myself. I planted the  seed. When Angela took off with Mikey,  I didn't... I never made an effort  to get back in his life. I figured,  the kid don't need a loser for a  father. Now it's all come full circle.  I give him the money, I open the  door to all this... I musta had it  coming. Payback.
NATALIE	f	Bernie, it's a big world out there.  If you just took off -- if we took  off.
NATALIE	f	You awake, Bernie?
NATALIE	f	I -- think I love you.
NATALIE	f	No, I don't think. I'm pretty certain  of it.
NATALIE	f	You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I  never saw this coming. You shouldn't  do that to a girl.
NATALIE	f	There's still things you don't know...  should know... I don't want to ruin  it...
BERNIE	m	It won't make any difference, Natalie.  Whatever you come clean about, I'm  not gonna feel any different about  you. I'd say the words, but with my  luck...
NATALIE	f	Say 'em anyway. To hell with rotten  luck. That's overs.
BERNIE	m	I love you, Natalie.
BERNIE	m	Trixie?
BERNIE	m	Trix. You came back.
SHELLY	f	Yeah, it's me. Get Bernie over to  crap table six.
BERNIE	m	Got any cre --
VOICE	m	Lovett, party of six, your table is  ready, Lovett, party of six.
BERNIE	m	Duty calls.
FLOOR MANAGER	m	Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new  Mega-Million. I call her Marnie,  'cause she's one frigid broad. Sure,  once in a while she'll flash you a  bit of tit, but your chances of  hitting a home run -- one in twenty  million. Here, give her a shot...
SHELLY	f	You wanna tell me what's going on  out there?
BERNIE	m	I don't know...
SHELLY	f	What do you mean...
SHELLY	f	What do you mean, you don't know?  We're down almost a mil out there.  Doesn't seem strange to you?
BERNIE	m	Guess I'm having an off day.
SHELLY	f	You don't have off days, Lootz. You're  shitty luck incarnate. What's wrong?  You coming down with something? You've  got this look about you...
BERNIE	m	Nothing's wrong. Fact is, I've never  felt better.
SHELLY	f	What's that supposed to mean?
BERNIE	m	She loves me, Shelly. She told me  last night. Natalie.
FLOOR MANAGER	m	Sweet Jesus... you popped her  cherries.
SHELLY	f	Natalie? She told you, she loves  you?
SHELLY	f	Put that fucking thing out!
NATALIE	f	Sorry.
SHELLY	f	You should be. You've gone and fucked  it up big time. I paid you to be his  cooze companion, not his fucking  true love. But, no, you had to go  and get all profound on the poor  schmuck. "I love you, Bernie." You know what  you've gone and done, sweetheart?  Those four little words of endearment  have already cost this casino a  million and counting today.
NATALIE	f	I don't understand...
SHELLY	f	Lady luck. You never heard'a lady  luck?! That's what's goin' on out  there. Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick.  He should have 'em throwing ice cubes  out there, but instead I got a fuckin'  meltdown on my hands.
SHELLY	f	OK, here's what's gonna happen. You're  outta his life by the time he gets  home. Don't even tell him to his  face, just leave a note. I'll make  some calls, situate you at another  joint.
NATALIE	f	I can't do that.
SHELLY	f	Excuse me?
NATALIE	f	It wasn't an act. I meant it. I love  him.
SHELLY	f	What's there to fuckin' love? He's a  loser. Always has been, always will  be.
NATALIE	f	I thought you were his friend...
SHELLY	f	And I thought you were a smart cookie  when I picked you out. You do not  want to fuck me over, darlin'. I'll  see to it that your next John's a  rattlesnake out in the desert. Now  get the fuck outta here.
BERNIE	m	Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around?  I'm supposed to give her a ride home.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS #1	m	I think she left already. She wasn't  feelin' too good. We been covering  for her.
BERNIE	m	Natalie? You in there?
BERNIE	m	Natalie.
BERNIE	m	I want you to tell me the truth,  Shelly. Did you say something to  Natalie? Did you muscle her --
SHELLY	f	Jesus, Bernie, is that what you think  of me? That I would fuck with your  happiness? That hurts.
BERNIE	m	This guy's all flash. No soul. I  miss Buddy. Place isn't the same  without him.
SHELLY	f	Buddy was tired. I gave him an easy  out. It coulda been a lot worse...
BERNIE	m	You gave him an easy out? What are  you talkin' about? I thought he...
SHELLY	f	He woulda never taken the buy-out  offer. Buddy woulda stuck to his  guns, no matter what. And they woulda  ended up hurting him. I couldn't let  that happen.
BERNIE	m	Jesus... you... How can you sit here  and justify it? Like you were Dr.  Kevorkian or something?
SHELLY	f	Listen to me, you dumb fuck -- I  loved that sonofabitch. But his time  was up. What I was supposed to do,  leave him to those corporate wolves?  What I did, it was the humanitarian  thing. That I have no doubt about.  Afterwards, I held him in my arms  and I cried like a fucking baby.  What? You got this look -- what's  this fucking look?
NATALIE	f	Bernie? You awake?
BERNIE	m	Yeah.
NATALIE	f	Let's just take off.
NATALIE	f	I mean it. Let's just pack up and  go. Tonight.
BERNIE	m	I can't do that. I've got an  obligation to Shelly. There's no --
NATALIE	f	Fuck Shelly. He doesn't give a shit  about you. Let's just climb into  your car and get the hell out of  here.
BERNIE	m	I can't do that, Natalie. They'd  come after me. And because you were  with me... I wouldn't want that on  me.
NATALIE	f	Just hold me.
NATALIE	f	Hey! Ouch! What are you...?
NATALIE	f	You got no fucking right...!
SHELLY	f	What did I tell you?! What did I  fuckin' tell you?!
NATALIE	f	I tried... I couldn't...
SHELLY	f	I don't give a fuck!
SHELLY	f	You're gone, sweetheart. History.  Kiss paradise goodbye.
NATALIE	f	I can't leave! I won't! I love him.  Doesn't that mean anything to you,  you heartless fuck?
SHELLY	f	Who the fuck do you think you are?  You ain't nobody! I could make you  disappear like this... And nobody would ever notice you  were gone. Nobody!
NATALIE	f	Bernie would! I got friends! You  don't fuckin' own me. You got no  right --
NATALIE	f	Fuck you!
SHELLY	f	You fuckin' cunt...
SHELLY	f	You think that's bad? That's just a  taste, bitch. You're still here when  Bernie gets home and I'll finish the  job. I'll cut you into so many fuckin'  pieces, the vultures'll be trading  on you for a month.
SHELLY	f	Here... go get yourself some cosmetic  surgery.
BERNIE	m	Natalie.
NATALIE	f	No, don't. I've got a headache.
BERNIE	m	Did you take something? I got some  aspirin in the --
NATALIE	f	Yeah. I already took something.
BERNIE	m	Ouch!
BERNIE	m	Natalie, what happened? The mirror...
BERNIE	m	Natalie.
NATALIE	f	Bernie, no! Shit...
BERNIE	m	Oh Jesus... Natalie, who did this to  you? We need to call the police...
NATALIE	f	I love you, Bernie. I just want you  to know that. I fell in love with  you. That wasn't part of the plan. I  thought... easy money...
BERNIE	m	What are you saying?
NATALIE	f	Shelly. He paid me to get next to  you. To keep you around. Whatever it  took...
BERNIE	m	Shelly?
NATALIE	f	You got it right the first night. I  was for sale. Bought and paid for.  You were the easy mark, Bernie.
NATALIE	f	At first you were just another John.  But then I started to take a closer  look. For the first time, here was  someone who wasn't trying to hustle  me. Wasn't pretending to be somebody  he wasn't. Just a decent guy trying  to get back on track. And it didn't  hurt any that you put me up on a  pedestal. It sure puts the gutter  into perspective...
BERNIE	m	Shelly...
NATALIE	f	Shelly wants me gone. He says I bring  you luck. Lady luck. I stayed... to  tell you to your face... and then  you wouldn't want me no more... and  I could just go...
BERNIE	m	We gotta get you to the hospital.  We'll talk about this later.
NATALIE	f	Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell  me there's gonna be a later.
BERNIE	m	Ssshh.
NATALIE	f	Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it's  all gonna be okay.
BERNIE	m	Everything's gonna be fine. This is  our time. This is you and me and  we're going for it.
BERNIE	m	You look in the mirror, you don't  like what you see, don't believe it.  You look in my eyes. That's the only  mirror you gonna need. Look in my  eyes, Natalie.
BERNIE	m	I love you. Marry me?
NATALIE	f	You don't have to do this, Bernie.
BERNIE	m	Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right  to his face. I will not look over my  shoulder for the rest of my life --  our lives.
NATALIE	f	Bernie, your chart... that first  night. I wasn't being straight with  you. It's the worst chart I've ever  seen. There's nothing in the cards  for you. I'm scared...
BERNIE	m	Don't you see, that was before you  opened your heart to me. Everything's  different now. I got lady luck on my  side. Ain't nothing gonna happen to  me.
NATALIE	f	It's three thousand dollars. Take  it. Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a  down payment. We can send him the  rest in installments... after we get  settled.
BERNIE	m	I don't think --
NATALIE	f	Take it.
BERNIE	m	Whatever happens, I --
NATALIE	f	I know, Bernie.
NATALIE	f	I know.
SHELLY	f	Bernie, what's the matter? You look  a little fucking spooked.
BERNIE	m	You lay another finger on her, I  swear to God I'll kill you. You hear  me? I'll fuckin' kill you!
SHELLY	f	Will you excuse me for a moment?
BERNIE	m	Why? Why, Shelly?
SHELLY	f	Because you never give up a good  thing, Bernie. You are a good thing.  The best fuckin' cooler there ever  was. And I need him back.
BERNIE	m	He ain't never comin' back.
SHELLY	f	That's a dead man talking.
BERNIE	m	I'm through with this joint, Shelly.  Natalie and me, we just got married.  We're outta here. I'll get a job out  there in the world. Send you half my  paycheck every month. Make good on  my obligations.
SHELLY	f	You try to walk on me, Bernie, and  I'll fuckin' bury you. The both of  you.
BERNIE	m	I don't think so.
BERNIE	m	You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't  the world's biggest loser no more.  That honor's gonna fall upon you,  Shelly. And maybe you had it all  along.
SHELLY	f	What the fuck? Me? I'm the loser?
BERNIE	m	What you got? What do you got in  your life besides this joint?
SHELLY	f	What the fuck more do I need?
BERNIE	m	You got nothin', Shelly. This place --  your legacy -- it's a mirage. You  turn your back and it don't even  exist. There's no day, there's no  night, it's all just one big fuckin'  blur and it don't count for nothin'!
SHELLY	f	You believe this fuckin' guy?
BERNIE	m	I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you  got this fear of germs thing. But it  goes deeper than that. You can't get  close to no one. On an emotional  level. You're the worst kind of  gambler there ever was: too scared  to put his chips on the table. Too  scared to open his heart... to extend  any real kinda friendship. Always  afraid it's gonna end out in the  desert. Well, sweet fuckin' dreams,  pal, 'cause I'm out and if that's  where it ends, that's where it ends.
SHELLY	f	That's a real heartfelt speech, Lootz.  All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face  intensity. You almost sold me. Man, I've got a fucking lump in my  throat. But it still don't change things.  You bail on me without making good  on my 150 G's and I'm gonna be forced  to close the books on you. You and  the broad. You leave me no choice.
BERNIE	m	Change only...
CROUPIER	m	Check change three thousand.
BOXMAN	m	This a pleasure cruise, Bernie?
BERNIE	m	You could say that.
BOXMAN	m	Well, it'll be a short one. Table's  dead.
CROUPIER	m	It is now, anyway.
STICKMAN	m	Yo Eleven! Pay the line.
STICKMAN	m	Winner seven!
STICKMAN	m	Six easy. Easy way six!
BERNIE	m	Natalie... this is you...
BERNIE	m	For the boys.
STICKMAN	m	Okay, we're coming out. Get your YO  bets, C&E, any seven...
TONY	m	Shelly, take a look at number 4.
SHELLY	f	How much is he up?
BOXMAN	m	Around three hundred thousand.
SHELLY	f	Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses  call me?
BOXMAN	m	We tried. You weren't picking up.  Besides, it was Bernie.
STICKMAN	m	Alright. We're coming out folks,  hands high...
BERNIE	m	Wait!
BERNIE	m	Color me up a hundred fifty thousand. And give it to him.
BERNIE	m	That's what I owe you, Shelly. There  it is. We're square. Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives  up to his obligations.
BOXMAN	m	One hundred fifty thousand, coming  in.
LARRY	m	What's the matter with you? He's one  of ours and he's taking us to the  fucking cleaners.
SHELLY	f	Lootz's off the clock. As long as  he's off the clock, he's free to  play. Just like every other schmuck  in this joint.
LARRY	m	It smells wrong. I'm shutting him  down. He's not leaving here with a  dime --
SHELLY	f	Now you listen real good, you Harvard  turd. Lootz is on the up-and-up. He  leaves here tonight with whatever he  comes out with. You so much as touch  a hair on his head and I'll fucking  wallpaper this joint with your ass.  Muted tones, right? What's that? I don't hear nothing.  Wait a minute -- yeah, now I hear  it.
STICKMAN	m	Crap ace deuce! Line down!
STICKMAN	m	Call it.
CROUPIER	m	Twelve crap.
BERNIE	m	Fifty thousand dollars!
MAN	m	On the field? What're you fucking  nuts?
WOMAN	f	Don't do it!
MAN 2	m	Shake it, don't break it, baby!
BERNIE	m	Come on sixty-six!
NATALIE	f	Thank God... I thought for sure...
NATALIE	f	It's okay, right? You guys worked it  out. He took the three grand? Tell  me it's okay, Bernie?
LOU	f	Want me to get that, Shelly?
NATALIE	f	What are you stopping for?
BERNIE	m	I think I'm gonna...
BERNIE	m	Bahamas, here we come, baby.
COP	m	Step out of the car please.
BERNIE	m	What's the problem, officer?
COP	m	Just step out of the car, please.  Both of you.
BERNIE	m	If my driving... if I was going a  little fast -- I was just over  excited, officer. See, we just had a big win at the Shangri-la --
COP	m	You didn't win nothing.
NATALIE	f	Oh Jesus, Bernie, I knew it. It was  too good to be true. Who were we  kidding?
COP	m	Get down on your knees. Both of you.
NICKY	?	The kid wants you should know, Shelly,  he's just protecting our investment --  the old school way. See you around.
BERNIE	m	He was drunk. It was just freak  luck...
NATALIE	f	Don't give it a name, Bernie. It  scares me. All I know is, you're  still running hot and that's a good  thing. But we're only winners if we  keep going. No looking back.
BERNIE	m	Lady luck, Natalie. I'm calling it.  Lady luck. And we got it as long as  we're together. They can't touch us  now.
LARRY	m	Gentlemen... I thank you for your vote of  confidence. As the Shangri-la's new  Director of Casino Operations, I'm  gonna make a personal guarantee to  each and every one of you. Your  investment in this casino will be  well looked after. The future looks  bright, gentlemen. Very, very bright.
