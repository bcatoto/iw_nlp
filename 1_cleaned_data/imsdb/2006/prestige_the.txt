STAGEHAND	f	Where'd you think you're going?!
BEARDED MAN	m	I'm part of the act, you fool!
CUTTER	m	Who was that?
CUTTER	m	Because of course, you're not really looking...
PROSECUTOR	m	And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer, get to that final part of his trick that night?
CUTTER	m	No, sir. Something went wrong.
PROSECUTOR	m	What went wrong?
CUTTER	m	I saw a someone head below the stage... I followed... and I found
CUTTER	m	-watching Mr. Angier drown in a tank.
PROSECUTOR	m	Would you describe your occupation to the jury please, Mr.Cutter?
CUTTER	m	I'm an ingeneur. I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for perfoming them.
PROSECUTOR	m	And for how long had you been Mr.Angier's "ingeneur"?
CUTTER	m	Eight years. I was privvy to the secrets of his entire act.
PROSECUTOR	m	So, Mr.Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr.Angier's illusion- the illusion billed as "THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN"?
CUTTER	m	No, sir. The tank had been used for the first trick, then taken offstage. Borden must have put it under the trap door after the interval.
DEFENDER	m	How large was this tank?
CUTTER	m	The sort of tank used for underwater escapes- four or five hundred gallons.
DEFENDER	m	How do you think Mr.Borden was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?
CUTTER	m	Ask him- he's the magician.
DEFENDER	m	I ask again that this man explain the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.
CUTTER	m	If I reveal my magician's secrets here in open court, I'll be unemployable and the secrets will be worthless. The Real Transported Man is the most sought-after illusion in the business and I have te right to sell it on.
JUDGE	m	Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament but we are talking about a capital offence- Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.
JUDGE	m	If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private, I might be able to judge their relevance to the case. Might this be an acceptable compromisse?
CAPTAIN	m	I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.
CAPTAIN	m	Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air- he's convinced he'll try an escape.
CAPTAIN	m	I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear is if I leave him out with the others immates.
CAPTAIN	m	Check the locks. Twice.
OWENS	m	My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor.
OWENS	m	I represent Lord Caldlow, and accomplished amateur magician and historian of magic-
BORDEN	m	How much?
OWENS	m	Lord Caldlow is interested in-
BORDEN	m	How much for my tricks?
OWENS	m	Five thousand pounds.
BORDEN	m	Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the money's for him.
OWENS	m	I did. He offered to sell all of your tricks... except the most valuable one - The Transported Man.
BORDEN	m	I'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.
OWENS	m	Even for your daughter?
OWENS	m	If the newspapers are right, and you're for the drop, your daughter's going to need looking after
BORDEN	m	Fallon can take care of-
OWENS	m	Bernard Fallon? A man with a past even more obscure than your own? The court have already motioned to have the girl removed from his "care". No, the girl is to be an orphan. I've been to the work house...
OWENS	m	It's better than this.
OWENS	m	I'm offering you a way to warp up your affairs with dignity, and I'm offering your daughter a future. As Lord Caldlow's ward she will want for nothing. Ever. (hands him a card) Think it over.
OWENS	m	Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this- (produces a leather
BOUND JOURNAL)	m	As a show of good faith. He thought it might be of interest.
OWENS	m	Robert Angier's diary... It includes the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick...
BORDEN	m	Angier never learned my trick.
OWENS	m	Really? When he returned from Colorado he mounted a version of the Transported Man that the papers said was better, even... Than your original.
BORDEN	m	If you want Angier's secret you can dig him up and ask him for yourself.
OWENS	m	I want your secret, Mr.Borden... Consider your daughter!
ANGIER	f	The whole town has electricity?
ANGIER	f	Quit a reception.
MANAGER	m	You're our first guest of the season, Mr.Angier. (opens guest book) Your telegram didn't indicate how long you would be staying with us.
ANGIER	f	As long as it takes. I'll need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.
MANAGER	m	The peak is closed, sit. For scientific experimentation.
ANGIER	f	That's why I'm here.
DRIVER	m	You have to walk the reat, I'm afraid, sir.
SHOTGUN	m	I'm amazed at how many of you newspaper writers can't read mu sign.
ANGIER	f	Not the welcome I was expecting.
SHOTGUN	m	I know you. You're that magician-the Great Danton. (helps Angier up) I'm Alley. I saw your show. IN London. Seven times- you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets.
ALLEY	?	I'm sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.
ANGIER	f	I've come to see Tesla.
ALLEY	?	Why?
ANGIER	f	He built a machine for a- for a colleague of mine. A long time ago. Can you get me a meeting with him? (off his look) I've come a very long way.
ALLEY	?	Impossible, I'm afraid.
ANGIER	f	I've brought a lot of money.
ALLEY	?	I'm sorry, Mr.Angier. I simply can't help you.
ANGIER	f	I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely.
ALLEY	?	What am I holding?
ANGIER	f	Your watch.
MILTON	m	Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman...
MILTON	m	Are either of you two gentlemen gailors?
MILTON	m	Well, I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot...
BORDEN	m	Milton's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-
ANGIER	f	Old favourites, please.
BORDEN	m	What about something fresh? He won't even try a bullet catch-
ANGIER	f	He can't use plants for every trick.
JULIA	f	There'd be no seats left for the punters.
BORDEN	m	Fine- no bullet catch. But a real magician tries to invent something new, something other magicians scratch their heads over-
CUTTER	m	They sells it to them for a small fortune.
CUTTER	m	I suposse you have such a trick, Mr.Borden?
ANGIER	f	Actually, I do.
CUTTER	m	Care to sell it?
BORDEN	m	No one else could do my trick.
ANGIER	f	I could.
BORDEN	m	You don't even know what it is.
ANGIER	f	Show it to me twice, I'll do it.
CUTTER	m	I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier. But if Borden here really has invented his masterpiece it might well be something only he can do.
ANGIER	f	Why?
CUTTER	m	It might be something only he is prepared to do. (gestures to the props) my illusions employer, Mr.Milton, is a skilled showman. But Borden's right- he won't get his hands dirty. You want to see what it takes to make real magic- go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there who's got what it takes.
ANGIER	f	Chung Ling Soo.
BORDEN	m	Tickets are pricey.
CUTTER	m	I know a lad on the door. You two watch his show- whoever tells me how he does his goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.
ANGIER	f	Which is?
CUTTER	m	Ten minutes onstage in front of my old friend, Mr.Ackerman.
JULIA	f	Who's Ackerman?
BORDEN	m	The most powerful theatrical agent in London.
CUTTER	m	I saw you drop the knot again, Borden.
JULIA	f	I think I had my wrist turned-
CUTTER	m	Some nights you just can't get it, can you? If that knot slips when Julia's on the hoist she'll break a leg.
BORDEN	m	It's the wrong knot. A Langford double would hold tighter.
CUTTER	m	The Langford double's not a wet knot it's too dangerous. The ropes could swell and she'd never slip it-
JULIA	f	I can slip a Lanford underwater.
BORDEN	m	We've been practiced it-
ANGIER	f	He said no.
CUTTER	m	No more mistakes.
ANGIER	f	Where's he from?
CUTTER	m	Where are you from?
CUTTER	m	He shuffles props for Virgil at the Hall.
ANGIER	f	He works for another magician? Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?
CUTTER	m	He doesn't deal in methods.
ANGIER	f	How do you know?
CUTTER	m	Because I hired him to try and find out Virgil's orange trick.
ANGIER	f	I don't know if I trust him.
CUTTER	m	He's a natural magician. Of course you can't trust him.
JULIA	f	I think he's alright.
ANGIER	f	You think everyone's alright.
JULIA	f	Even you.
CUTTER	m	And Mr.Angier...? (Angier looks up) Learn your aight lines- if I can see you sneaking a peck on your wife's ankle from the wings, the blokes on each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too.
BORDEN	m	Look- he's all right. He's fine.
BOY	m	But where's his brother?
BORDEN	m	Sharp lad, your son.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	My brother.
BORDEN	m	You're the lucky one tonight.
BORDEN	m	(to the brother) Are you watching closely?
BORDEN	m	Look closer.
BOY	m	It's got two heads.
BORDEN	m	Never. Show. Anyone.
BORDEN	m	They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret- but as soon as you give it up you'll be nothing to them. Understand? Nothing. The secret impresses no one- the trick you use it for is everything.
BORDEN	m	Where do you two live?
SARAH	f	He lives with Mum.
BORDEN	m	And you?
BORDEN	m	Enough to keep me out?
SARAH	f	I think so. Wil I see you again?
ANGIER	f	You're wrong. It can't be.
BORDEN	m	It is. He carries the bowl between his knees for the entire performance.
ANGIER	f	but look at the man!
BORDEN	m	This is the trick. This is why no one detectes his method.
BORDEN	m	Total devotion to his art... (looks at Angier) Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only way to escape this.
ANGIER	f	I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish. He must be strong as an ox.
JULIA	f	He's been preteding to be an cripple for years?
ANGIER	f	Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.
ANGIER	f	Borden saw it at once. I couldn't fathom it- living your whole life pretending to be someone else.
JULIA	f	You're pretending to be someone else.
ANGIER	f	I don't think changing your name compares.
JULIA	f	Not just your name- who you are, where you're from...
ANGIER	f	I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors.
JULIA	f	I came up with a name for you... "The Great Danton" You don't like it? It's sophisticated.
ANGIER	f	It's French.
SARAH	f	Alfred?!
BORDEN	m	We have our routine for Ackerman!
SARAH	f	We haven't had the pleasure.
BORDEN	m	Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur-
SARAH	f	Where did yo get all of-
BORDEN	m	Begged, borrowed and don't ask. Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.
SARAH	f	I need talk to you.
SARAH	f	We can't afford to pay him-
BORDEN	m	We'll start making money once we have our audience-
SARAH	f	And until then? What I earn is barely enough for us.
BORDEN	m	I'll give him half of my food.
SARAH	f	You're already going to be sharing it with someone else.
BORDEN	m	You're...?
SARAH	f	Having a baby.
SARAH	f	What's this?
BORDEN	m	The trick to wake up Ackerman at the end of my audition.
SARAH	f	Your great trick? The "masterpiece that will make our fortunes"?
BORDEN	m	No. The world isn't ready for that one, yet.
BORDEN	m	This is merely a run-of-the-mill daring and spectacular bullet catch-
SARAH	f	I'm not letting you get shot.
BORDEN	m	It's perfectly safe. Shoot me.
SARAH	f	Show me. (Borden shakes head) Then you're not doing it. I can't raise a child on my own, Alfred.
BORDEN	m	The bullet goes in the gun. Then comes the ramrod.
BORDEN	m	The buller's not even in the gun when the charge is fired.
SARAH	f	Once you know it's so obvious.
BORDEN	m	Yes, well, people still get killed perfoming it.
SARAH	f	How?
BORDEN	m	Sme smart-arse drops something down the barrel.
SARAH	f	Such as?
BORDEN	m	A penny, or a button. Or, of course, a bullet. (off worried look) But don't fret-
BORDEN	m	I'm not letting anything happen- I love you too much.
SARAH	f	Say it again.
BORDEN	m	I love you.
SARAH	f	Nope. Not today.
BORDEN	m	What?
SARAH	f	Some days, it's not true. Todayt you don't mean it. Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me. It's alright. I like being able to tell the difference- it makes the days it is true mean something.
BORDEN	m	Bloody fool.
POLICEMAN	m	It's all laid out down the end, you honour.
JUDGE	m	What's in there?
CUTTER	m	Angier's machine.
JUDGE	m	You built this, Mr.Cutter?
CUTTER	m	Oh no. This wasn't built by a magician... it was built by a wizard. A man who can actually do the things a magician pretends to...
CUTTER	m	your honour, what will happen to these things when the trial is over?
JUDGE	m	They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo. An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case.
CUTTER	m	Don't let him take this.
JUDGE	m	Why ever not?
CUTTER	m	It's dangerous.
JUDGE	m	I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's get some simple and disappointing trick.
CUTTER	m	The most disappointing of all- it has no trick. It's real.
JUDGE	m	This is the tank Angier drowned in?
CUTTER	m	This lets the performer's hands reach the trick padlock... -a small section POPS open.
JUDGE	m	A standard magical apparatus for escapes?
CUTTER	m	With one important difference...
CUTTER	m	This isn't a trick lock... it's been switched out for a real one.
JUDGE	m	What a way to kill someone. Why in God's name go to such lengths?
CUTTER	m	These are magicians, you honour. Showmen. Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze. To shock.
JUDGE	m	Even without and audience?
CUTTER	m	There was and audience. (looks at Judge) See, the water tank had a particular signinficance for the two men...
MILTON	m	Which of you brave souls is willing bind this lovely young woman?
ANGIER	f	How can be not know?!
BORDEN	m	"How can be not know?!" Because, Angier, life is complicated, people are complicated, knots are
JUDGE	m	Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier. You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
BORDEN	m	They took her away? To the workhouse?
BORDEN	m	Tell him I've reconsidered. It's for the best.
ALLEY	?	Tesla sends me down here during the storms. Perfect excuse to come shere a drink with the Great Danton.
ALLEY	?	Have you tried our Bourbon yet, Mr. Angier? It matches the scenery nicely. Two of 'em. Beautiful, isn't it? I do miss New York, though.
ANGIER	f	Why are you here?
ALLEY	?	The lightning lives here. And noit much else- our work is secret.
ALLEY	?	A cypher?
ANGIER	f	My profession also deals in secrets.
ANGIER	f	It's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the dairy. Simple but time-consuming to translate once you have the five-letter keyword.
ALLEY	?	Which is?
ANGIER	f	We magicians have a circle of trust.
ALLEY	?	You have a circle of trust with someone whose dairy you stole?
ANGIER	f	Maybe I bought it.
ALLEY	?	Magicians sell their secrets?
ANGIER	f	It's how we pay for our retirements and how greats tricks outlive us.
ALLEY	?	You're hoping to find a great secretin there?
ANGIER	f	I've already found it. That's why I'm here.
ANGIER	f	Tesla built one for another magician.
ALLEY	?	Why would you want the same thing?
ANGIER	f	Call it a professional rivalry.
ALLEY	?	Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people, but he would never talk about it.
ANGIER	f	I understand discretion. I just want the machine.
ALLEY	?	Finish your drink. You'll have a special appreciation for our work.
ANGIER	f	I thought it was a secret.
ALLEY	?	You're a magician. Who's going to believe you?
ALLEY	?	We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.
ALLEY	?	Not long now.
ALLEY	?	Our equipment requires a great deal of current. Tesla eletrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need to.
ANGIER	f	Where are the wires?
ALLEY	?	Exactly.
ANGIER	f	Where's the generator?
ALLEY	?	You saw it last week.
ANGIER	f	But that must be ten miles from here.
ALLEY	?	Fifteen. And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed. (turns to leave) I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr.Angier.
VOICE	m	Get out your gun, Professor!
BORDEN	m	A volunteer.
BORDEN	m	Are you man enought, sir?
MOUSTACHE	m	Yes.
BORDEN	m	I think not.
ANGIER	f	Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.
CUTTER	m	Hasn't stopped you looking. I heard about a booking. Nice little theatre. Good up-and-coming magician.
ANGIER	f	Who?
CUTTER	m	You.
ANGIER	f	You got me a booking? Why?
CUTTER	m	Because I want to keep working... (looks up at Angier) And who's going to hire the ingeneur who killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
ANGIER	f	Someone who know that it wasn't your fault. Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.
CUTTER	m	Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing a bullet catch South of the river.
ANGIER	f	To die like that. Locked in water... lungs screaming... What did she go through, Cutter?
CUTTER	m	I knew an old sailor. Told me about a time he got pulled over the side tangled in the sheets... they dragged him out, but it was five minutes before he coughed...
CUTTER	m	He said it was like... going home.
ANGIER	f	Which knot did Borden tie that night?
CUTTER	m	He wouldn't say.
ANGIER	f	Wouldn't say?!
CUTTER	m	It was as if... as if he didn't know.
CUTTER	m	We'll have to whitewash the windows to cofound the more curious members of your audience... But this should do.
ANGIER	f	We should see about an assistant.
CUTTER	m	I've made arrangements. Have you settled on a name?
ANGIER	f	Yes, I have. The Great Danton.
CUTTER	m	Hmm. Bit old-fashioned?
ANGIER	f	No. It's sophisticated.
OLIVIA	f	What's so hard about this?
CUTTER	m	In here, Miss Wenscombe. No point meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit.
CUTTER	m	Breathe as little as possible.
CUTTER	m	Not much experience , but she knows the basics. She knows how to present herself and a pretty assistant's the most effective from of misdirection.
CUTTER	m	I suppose I should let her out.
SARAH	f	I don't understand, Alfred. How can it be bleeding again?
SARAH	f	What have you been doing to it? It looks as had as the day it happened. We need to get the doctot back-
BORDEN	m	We can' afford the doctor back!
SARAH	f	You've woken her.
BORDEN	m	I'm sorry. I just need this to heal so I can het back to work.
SARAH	f	Alfred, you have to face things. What tricks could you peform with this kind of injury?
BORDEN	m	Some of the card pulls, prop tricks... (leans forward, excited) And the trick I've been telling you about. The trick they'll remember me for.
ANGIER	f	The bird cage can't be our climax- everybody knows it.
CUTTER	m	Not like this, they don't.
ANGIER	f	And I don't want to kill doves.
CUTTER	m	Then stay off the stage. (glares at Angier) You're a magician, not a wizard- you have to get your hands dirty to achieve the impossible.
ANGIER	f	You sound like him.
CUTTER	m	(holds up cage) Put your hands on the sides...
ANGIER	f	I need a volunteer.
CUTTER	m	Hang on, hang on...
CUTTER	m	There we go. Now you tell the volunteer to put his hands here...
MERRIT	f	You'd beat not be intending to hut this animal, Mr.Angier.
ANGIER	f	Of course not.
ANGIER	f	And one, two... THREE!
ANGIER	f	Bloody marvelous, Cutter.
CUTTER	m	And the best part...
ANGIER	f	Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.
CUTTER	m	Someday, perhaps you will. I needed to know that you can.
MERRIT	f	Very nice. Very nice indeed.
ANGIER	f	I haven't had a chance to compliment you on your beautiful theatre yet, Mr.Merrit.
MERRIT	f	A lot more beautiful when it's full, Mr.Angier.
ANGIER	f	Don't worry.
MERRIT	f	You all say that. Why sould I worry? If your tricks don't get 'em in, someone else's will. Maybe someone willing to do a bullet catch or a water scape.
CUTTER	m	cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People hoping for an accident- and quite likely to see one, too. What would that do for your business?
MERRIT	f	You've got a week.
ANGIER	f	You sir, in the hat. Could you show us your handkerchief?
MAN	m	This isn't mine.
ANGIER	f	Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the other man. He has yours.
OLIVIA	f	I'm so nervous- I'm sorry, I'm making mistakes.
ANGIER	f	The audience doesn't seem to be responding much, Cutter.
CUTTER	m	This is a grand theatre with a sophisticated audience- They've seen most of these tricks before. But not this next one. You'll see.
CUTTER	m	You! Piss off out it!
ANGIER	f	Wish us luc, Cutter.
CUTTER	m	I'll have the champagne ready.
ANGIER	f	You've seen this one before?
ANGIER	f	Well, I'll make it a little harder, shall I?
ANGIER	f	Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentleman to hold this cage with me...
ANGIER	f	I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or by any other audience anywhere in the worth...
ANGIER	f	Any magician can make this cage disappear... that's why I'll ask this good lady and fine gentleman to place their hands firmly on the cage...
ANGIER	f	...to ensure that no trickery whatsover is employed.
ANGIER	f	I should've spotted him.
CUTTER	m	You had a lot of plates spinning.
ANGIER	f	Don't suppose they'll let us do this one again.
CUTTER	m	No.
ANGIER	f	So what's the climax of our show?
ANGIER	f	Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment-
MERRIT	f	To perform magic- not butcher birds and break my costomer's fingers! Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned.
CUTTER	m	Mr.Merrit-
MERRIT	f	It's done, John. I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians, which should indicate the may I felel about your friend's future as a stage magician.
CUTTER	m	There are plenty of good theatres... if we can come up with another trick and change the name of the act-
ANGIER	f	The name stays.
CUTTER	m	Right. Well, the new trick will have to be irresistible, then. I've a couple of methods to try out, but we'll need a fresh angle on the presentation.
CUTTER	m	If you need inspiration, there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week. Scientists and engineers. That sort of thing captures the popular imagination.
TICKET HAWKER	m	Would you like to know the future, sir? The man who kill change the world is speaking right now. Continents divided no more. Free, clean power. The mysteries of the world solved.
TESLA	m	With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years.
TESLA	m	Mr. Edison's direct current system is flawed and dangerous. With my alternating current devices-
AUDIENCE MEMBER	m	Fraud.
BORDEN	m	I love you.
SARAH	f	See? Today, it's true.
ANGIER	f	The family life he craves one minute he rails against the next, demanding freedom. His mind is a divided one...
BORDEN	m	Guard! Guard!!
GUARD	m	What do want, Professor?
BORDEN	m	Paper and pencil. Please.
SULLEN	f	Let me see?
SULLEN	f	I'm going to know all of the Professor's secrets.
BORDEN	m	Only if I teach you how to read.
SULLEN	f	Just stupid tricks, right? Haven't helped you get out of here-
)	?	Have they? Or can't you open real locks, Professor?
BORDEN	m	Perhaps I'm just biding my time. Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my
BORDEN	m	-get you attention. Then quietly
SAY-	m	"are you wacthing closely"... perhaps say a magic word or two... then I'll be gone.
SULLEN	f	How'd you get so famous, then?
BORDEN	m	Magic.
SULLEN	f	Oi, Borden, get back here!
ANGIER	f	I thought you'd gone.
OLIVIA	f	I don't really.... have anywhere to go.
ANGIER	f	You've been sleeping here?
OLIVIA	f	Cutter said it would be okay till we get another booking. What are you doing?
ANGIER	f	Researching. Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions they're-
OLIVIA	f	You're going to do something to that man, aren't you?
OLIVIA	f	Cutter's hopig you'll let things life. He says if Borden thinks things are even between you then we can-
ANGIER	f	Even? My wife for a couple of his fingers? He has a child now. And he's perfoming again. Borden is out there, living his life just as he always intended. As if nothing had happened. And look at me. I'm alone. And no theatre will touch me.
OLIVIA	f	Us.
OLIVIA	f	You're going to need a better disguise.
BORDEN	m	I need a volunteer.
BORDEN	m	As you can see , it's just a rubber ball. But it's not normal at all.
BORDEN	m	Thank you.
BORDEN	m	You're not impressed?
BORDEN	m	It's a magic ball.
OLIVIA	f	What happened, Robert?
ANGIER	f	He had a new trick.
OLIVIA	f	Was it good?
ANGIER	f	Did they applaud when you saw it?
CUTTER	m	Not very enthusiastically.
CUTTER	m	The trick is too good -- too simple- the audience harly knows what they've seen.
ANGIER	f	He's a dreadful magician.
CUTTER	m	He's a wonderfull magician- he's a dreadful showman. He doesn't know how to dress it up, how to sell the trick.
ANGIER	f	How does he do it?
CUTTER	m	He uses a double.
ANGIER	f	It's not that simple. This is a complex illusion.
CUTTER	m	You think that because you don't know the method. It's a double who comes out at the end. It's the only way.
ANGIER	f	I've seen his perfom ir three times now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the
ANGIER	f	The same man comes out of the second cabinet. I promise you.
OLIVIA	f	It is the same man.
OLIVIA	f	He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but if you look closely you can tell.
ANGIER	f	He doesn't know how to sell his trick to an audience. But I do.
CUTTER	m	It would give us our climax.
ANGIER	f	The man stole my life. I'm going to steal his trick.
CUTTER	m	We'll have to find someone who can look like you on a stage.
ANGIER	f	He doesn't use a double-
CUTTER	m	I don't know how Borden does it, Robert. So either you wait for Borden to retire and buy his secret, or you can listen to how I would do this trick. Ang the only way I know is to find you a bloody good double.
ANGIER	f	Take a good look- let's get out there and find me.
ALLEY	?	It's perfectly safe.
TESLA	m	So this is the Great Danton.
TESLA	m	Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions. Something you did with pockets?
ANGIER	f	I saw a lecture you gave in London, several years ago. I'm flattered you agreed to see me.
ANGIER	f	What's conducting the electricity?
TESLA	m	Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting, and indeed, producing energy.
TESLA	m	Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?
TESLA	m	Alley has explained that you require a very interesting device.
ANGIER	f	I need something impossible.
TESLA	m	You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's reach exceeds his grasp'?
TESLA	m	(off his look) It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. The only limits on scientific progress are these imposed by society.
TESLA	m	The first time I changed the world I was hailed as a visionary. The second time I was asked politely to retire. The world only tolerates one change at a time. And so here I am. (gestures at laboratory) Enjoying "retirement". (looking at Angier) Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive.
TESLA	m	Alley says you are a stage magician. If a built you this device, you would be presenting it only as an illusion?
ANGIER	f	If people thought the things I did on stage were real, they wouldn't clap- they'd scream. Think of saving a woman in half.
TESLA	m	Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-
ANGIER	f	Price is not an object.
TESLA	m	Perhaps not. But have you considered the cost?
ANGIER	f	I'm noit sure I follow.
TESLA	m	I can make your machine, Mr. Angier. But I can also give you some advice... Go home. Forget this thing. I can recognize an obsession. As Mr. Alley could tell you, I myself an given to one now and then. It will not do you any good.
ANGIER	f	Have your obsessions done you no good?
TESLA	m	At first. But I've followed them too long- I am their slave. Their whipping boy. And one day they may choose to destroy me.
ANGIER	f	if you understand an obsession then you know you won't change my mind.
TESLA	m	So be it.
ANGIER	f	Will you build it?
TESLA	m	I have already begun to build it, Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take time.
OLIVIA	f	Gerry?
OLIVIA	f	Mr. Angier, Mr. Cutter, I would like you to meet Mr. Gerald Root.
ROOT	m	A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
ROOT	m	Would you like for me to tell you a little joke?
ROOT	m	Are you laughing?
ANGIER	f	He's out of his mind.
OLIVIA	f	He's an out-of-work actor- of course he's out of his mind.
CUTTER	m	He's perfect. A little work, mind you, but when I'm done with him he could be your brother.
ANGIER	f	I don't need him to be my brother. I need him to be me.
BORDEN	m	Would you like to see a magic trick?
SARAH	f	What is this for?
SARAH	f	When I asked last week you said we couldn't afford.
BORDEN	m	You caught me in the wrong mood.
SARAH	f	But you want through all the-
BORDEN	m	Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I? The act is taking off, maybe soon I'll get us into a bigger theatre. Things will work.
OLIVIA	f	You walk through this one- then...?
OLIVIA	f	Oof. Couldn't you find a softer one?
ANGIER	f	It's not for sleeping on.
OLIVIA	f	And Root goes up through there?
OLIVIA	f	It's going to be amazing, Robert.
ANGIER	f	It has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed. The place was packed today.
OLIVIA	f	You went and saw his show again?
OLIVIA	f	You becoming obsessed, Robert.
ANGIER	f	All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference.
CUTTER	m	A little faith, sir. Could you favor us with a perfomance. Mr. Root?
ROOT	m	You would drink, too, if you know the world half so well as I do.
ROOT	m	Did you think you were unique, Mr. Angier? I have been Cassar. I have been Faust. How difficult could it possibly be to play 'The Great Danton?'
CUTTER	m	You can go back to being yourself. Root. For free..
ROOT	m	I'd rather be him, for now. I find it amusing.
CUTTER	m	Root has to keep a low profile-- anyone sees him the game's up.
ANGIER	f	I don't know how you do these things, Cutter. I'm not sure I want to know.
CUTTER	m	Have you thought about what we should call the trick?
ANGIER	f	No point being coy. Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man'?
ANGIER	f	Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight can be termed illusions. Entertaining trifles of the sort you may have seen other magicians perform.
ANGIER	f	Alas, I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully- you will see no trickery, for no trickery is being employed. Merely a techique familiar to certain citizens of the orient and various holy men of the Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...
OLIVIA	f	To our achivement.
CUTTER	m	The manager said he's never seen a reaction like it.
ANGIER	f	At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hidden under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears, the man who goes into the box. They care about the man who comes out the other side.
OLIVIA	f	I care about the man in the box.
ANGIER	f	Thank you. Maybe we could switch before the trick. That way I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below stage.
CUTTER	m	The antecipation of the trick is everything- it needs your showmanship to built suspense. If Root opens his mouth, it's all over- he can't introduce the trick.
CUTTER	m	Root, you bloody fool, get that costume and makeup off right now, anyone could walk in here!
CUTTER	m	Congratulation, all.
ANGIER	f	I suppose I should get more rest.
OLIVIA	f	Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
OLIVIA	f	We've worked hard for this, and we need to celebrate properly.
OLIVIA	f	What's wrong? It is your wife?
ANGIER	f	The trick isn't good enough.
OLIVIA	f	Didn't you see the audience?
ANGIER	f	No.
OLIVIA	f	Well, they loved it.
ANGIER	f	It's not as good as his trick.
OLIVIA	f	Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He doesn't have any style-
ANGIER	f	He doesn't have to spend the finale hiding under the stage.
ANGIER	f	I need to know how he does it.
OLIVIA	f	Why?
ANGIER	f	So that I can do it better.
ANGIER	f	I need you to go and work for him.
OLIVIA	f	Work for him? Are you joking
ANGIER	f	You'll be my spy.
OLIVIA	f	We just got our start and you want me to leave?
ANGIER	f	It's how we advance.
ANGIER	f	Think of it, Olivia... we've got people excited about Cutter's version of the trick- imagine what we could do with the real illusion. We'll have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.
OLIVIA	f	He knows I work for you.
ANGIER	f	Exactly why he'll want to hire you. He'll want my secrets.
OLIVIA	f	Why would he trust me?
ANGIER	f	Because you're going to tell him the truth.
TESLA	m	You must be curious to see what so much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
TESLA	m	Fitting that you should be here for the maiden voyage.
TESLA	m	Your hat.
ALLEY	?	You might want to stand back.
TESLA	m	No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley, please proceed.
ANGIER	f	I don't understand-
ALLEY	?	Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. We'll see you next week?
OLIVIA	f	Interesting workshop.
BORDEN	m	We make do.
OLIVIA	f	My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
BORDEN	m	I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show?
OLIVIA	f	No. I'm here to give your show what is missing.
BORDEN	m	And what might that be?
OLIVIA	f	Me.
BORDEN	m	Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard? A woman's touch.
OLIVIA	f	I've left Angier. I want a job.
OLIVIA	f	I know you have no reason to trust
BORDEN	m	Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy.
OLIVIA	f	Mr.Borden-
BORDEN	m	Alfred.
OLIVIA	f	Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth.
BORDEN	m	Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.
OLIVIA	f	I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret.
BORDEN	m	What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk.
BORDEN	m	Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?
OLIVIA	f	No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
BORDEN	m	He has no secrets from me.
BORDEN	m	And this is the truth?
CUTTER	m	Best be getting changed for the martinee, sir.
CUTTER	m	ROOT! You're late. And even more drunk than usual. Get yourself below stairs, right away!
ROOT	m	No.
CUTTER	m	No?!
ROOT	m	We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter.
ANGIER	f	We have a problem, Cutter.
ANGIER	f	He'll be perfoming right across the street.
CUTTER	m	We have a bigger problem. Root.
ANGIER	f	Don't tell me he fell over again.
CUTTER	m	Worse. He realized he can make demands.
ANGIER	f	He's blackmailing us?
CUTTER	m	In a word, yes. I'm surprised, to be honest- it usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.
ANGIER	f	How much does he want?
CUTTER	m	It makes no difference- we have to stop doing the trick.
ANGIER	f	Stop doing the trick? Look at this.
CUTTER	m	Look at yesterday's. And last week's, where they called you "London's premiere stage performer", not "magician" mind. Performer. Of any kind.
ANGIER	f	What's the point?
CUTTER	m	My point, Robert, is that you've climbed too high to get away with any kind of professional embarrassament. We're not doing any tricks we can't control.
ANGIER	f	Pay him whatever he wants, for now. We keep doing the trick till Borden opens, then we'll phase it out.
ANGIER	f	Get up there!!
CUTTER	m	Get it down!
ROOT	m	To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?
BORDEN	m	You are the Great Danton, aren't you?
ROOT	m	Of course I am. But don't advertise it- I'll be mobbed with fans. (grins at Borden) And who might you be?
BORDEN	m	Just a humble admirer. And fellow practitioner.
ROOT	m	Ah, very good.
BORDEN	m	Another?
ROOT	m	If you insist. I'm not perfoming tonight. Well, only one show, and, to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days.
BORDEN	m	You could probably do it blindfolded.
ROOT	m	Bloody good idea.
BORDEN	m	Have it.
ROOT	m	Thanks.
BORDEN	m	Actually, there's something I might warn you about.
ROOT	m	Oh?
BORDEN	m	Well, it's your Transported Man illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to know your method... but I had a similar trick in my act- and I used... (looks around,
WHISPERING)	?	...a double.
ROOT	m	Oh, I see, very good.
BORDEN	m	At first. Then it went bad. You se, I hadn't counted on the fact that once I incorporated this bloke into my act, he had complete power over me.
ROOT	m	Complete power, you say?
BORDEN	m	Weel, he was the secret, you see. And the more successful I became, the more outrageous his demands became. He practically backrupted me. In the end I had to stop performing the illusion completely. (looks at Root) You must be very careful about giving someone that power over you.
ROOT	m	Thanks for the warning.
ANGIER	f	...some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...
BORDEN	m	Great Danton, I must apologize! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages!
BORDEN	m	Pardon my intrusion!
CUTTER	m	I don't see how Borden found him- I had him under wraps, I was careful.
ANGIER	f	Well, he did.
CUTTER	m	Sit, do you think it might be her? Olivia?
ANGIER	f	No. I don't.
CUTTER	m	Shall we cut him down?
ANGIER	f	He's the Great Danton. Let him cut himself down.
ANGIER	f	You weren't expecting me?
OLIVIA	f	I was expecting you sooner, Robbie. Your message said "afternoon".
ANGIER	f	Well, it takes a bit for me to get around these days...
ANGIER	f	He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career... now you.
OLIVIA	f	What do you mean? You sent me to-
ANGIER	f	I sent you to steal his secret- not to improve his act-
OLIVIA	f	That's my job-!
ANGIER	f	Or to fall in love with him!
OLIVIA	f	You abandoned me to him!
OLIVIA	f	I did everything you asked.
ANGIER	f	Yes? Then how does he do it?!
OLIVIA	f	Cutter was right- it's a double.
ANGIER	f	Of course Borden said that-
OLIVIA	f	He didn't say anything- he'd never say. I've seen things- make-up, glasses, wigs. We don't use any of it for the show, but I've found it hidden backstage.
ANGIER	f	It's misdirection- he leaves those things lying around to make you think he's using a double.
OLIVIA	f	All the time? He doesn't know when
ANGIER	f	All the time, Olivia- that's who he is, that's what it takes- he lives his act, don't you see?! And just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.
OLIVIA	f	You thing you can see everything, don't you?
OLIVIA	f	But the Great Danton, is a blind fool.
OLIVIA	f	His notebook.
ANGIER	f	You stole it?
OLIVIA	f	I borrowed it for tonight. I thought you'd be able to translate some of it, but now I realize-
ANGIER	f	I can't.
OLIVIA	f	You can't.
ANGIER	f	Olivia, no one could- It's a cypher- with a transposition that probably shifts every day of the diary. Even with the keyword it would take months to decode...
OLIVIA	f	And without the keyword?
ANGIER	f	Perhaps never. We'll see.
OLIVIA	f	No, we won't- if I don't get that back tomorrow morning, he'll know I took it.
ANGIER	f	You can'r possibly think I'd let this go? This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here, in my hands.
OLIVIA	f	Don't do this do me, Robert!
ANGIER	f	Leave him.
OLIVIA	f	He knows where I live!
ANGIER	f	I need to know his method.
OLIVIA	f	It won't get your wife back, Robert.
ANGIER	f	I don't care about my wife- I care about his secret!
ANGIER	f	Look, I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in-
OLIVIA	f	He'll know it was you-
ANGIER	f	Yes, me, not you. Understand?
OLIVIA	f	Robert? I have fallen in love with him.
ANGIER	f	Then I know how hard this had been hard for you.
BORDEN	m	Notebook.
BORDEN	m	Then he's just getting started.
BORDEN	m	I'm walking tonight, gentlemen.
BORDEN	m	Let him come. I don't care.
CUTTER	m	I'll live. You save me the trouble to making you an air hole!
BORDEN	m	I'm impressed.
ANGIER	f	Why's that?
BORDEN	m	You're finally getting your hands dirty. This is what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice.
ANGIER	f	The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all going to be yours. Unless you give me what I want.
BORDEN	m	Which is?
ANGIER	f	Your secret.
BORDEN	m	My secret?
ANGIER	f	Your method for the Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact, he doesn't talk at all.
BORDEN	m	You have my notebook.
ANGIER	f	Useless without the keyword.
ANGIER	f	Write down your method Mr. Borden. Describe it in full.
ANGIER	f	I want the method not the keyword- I don't even know if the secret is in you notebook.
BORDEN	m	The keyword is the method.
BORDEN	m	Where is my ingeneur?
ANGIER	f	How fast can you gid?
ANGIER	f	How's the arm?
CUTTER	m	Still attached. Did you get your answer?
ANGIER	f	Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet, I wanted you to share this.
CUTTER	m	I already know how he does it, Robert. The same way he always has, the same way we do. You just want it to be something more.
ANGIER	f	Well, let's find out, shall we?
CUTTER	m	What does it mean?
ANGIER	f	It means, Cutter, that we have a journey ahead of us. To America.
CUTTER	m	Robert, listen to me. (gentle, but definite) Obssession is a young man's game, I can't follow you any farther in this.
ANGIER	f	Then the rest is up to me.
SARAH	f	I didn't know we'd be joined for dinner.
BORDEN	m	Absolutely. We're celebrating.
SARAH	f	Miss Wenscombe. Mr.Fallon.
BORDEN	m	(to wine waiter) Champagne. Your finest
SARAH	f	What are we celebrating, dear?
BORDEN	m	Well, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?
OLIVIA	f	What trick, Freddy?
SARAH	f	Yes, "Freddy". What trick?
BORDEN	m	I'm going to bury myself alive. Every night. Then someone's going to come along and dig me up!
SARAH	f	I'm not sure my husband needs-
BORDEN	m	Who are you to tell me what?!
SARAH	f	Perhaps, Mr.Fallon, you might escort Miss Wenscombe home. My husband's being a bore. I see no reason for the two of you to suffer as well.
OLIVIA	f	Good-night, Mrs.Borden. Good-night, Freddy.
SARAH	f	"Freddy"?
BORDEN	m	It's my name.
SARAH	f	Not at home.
BORDEN	m	I'm not always at home.
SARAH	f	Alfred, why are you being like this?
BORDEN	m	Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought I'd lost something very precious to me.
SARAH	f	What?
SARAH	f	I see. More secrets.
BORDEN	m	Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our life.
SARAH	f	When you're like this, Alfred, I'm not seeing the real you. You're treating me like your audience. Performing. I can't live with that.
ANGIER	f	I thought I had the place to myself.
MANAGER	m	Unexpected guests. (looks out the window at the men) Not very polite. A lot of questions. At first I thought they might work for the government.
ANGIER	f	No?
MANAGER	m	Worse. They work for Thomas Edison.
BORDEN	m	Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?
OLIVIA	f	No. It's killing him. He's obssessed with discovering your method. he thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our success. I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
BORDEN	m	He has no secrets from me.
BORDEN	m	This is the "truth" you spoke of?
OLIVIA	f	No. This is what he told me to tell you.
OLIVIA	f	The truth is that I loved him. And stood by him. And he sent me to you like he'd send a stagehand to pick up his shirts. (looks him in the eye) I hate him for that.
BORDEN	m	I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theatre. What could you possibly have to offer me?
OLIVIA	f	You may know he does his tricks... but you can't understand why no one can see that yours are better.
OLIVIA	f	You hide this. I had to look closely to spot it when you performed the Transported Man. (looks into his eyes) But this makes you unique... it shows the audience that you aren't using a double; You musn't hide it, you must display it proudly... (looks at hand) I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.
BORDEN	m	It does.
OLIVIA	f	Then let people know. You can be so much more then he is. I can show you how.
BORDEN	m	How could he send you away? He must be blind, deaf and dumb.
OLIVIA	f	Robbie's blinded by his jealosy. He'd do anything for you secret. Sending me away was the least of it.
ANGIER	f	I've veen played for a fool!
ALLEY	?	Who by?
ANGIER	f	Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.
ALLEY	?	We never said he had.
ANGIER	f	You let me believe that he had, Alley!
ANGIER	f	You stole my money because your funding was cut off- you've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along while you use my money to stave off ruin. I've seen Edison's men-
ALLEY	?	Where?
ANGIER	f	In the hotel. I've every mind to bring them up here myself-
TESLA	m	That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
TESLA	m	It is true, sir, that you are your one remaining financier. But we have not stolen your money...
ALLEY	?	Sir, my cat?
ALLEY	?	When I told you I could make your machine I spoke the simple truth. Science is just a name for the art of rendering the exotic mundane. It has no boundaries- its very purpose is to destroy boundaries.
ANGIER	f	Then why isn't the machine working?
TESLA	m	Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is not an exact science. The machine simply does not operate as expected. It needs continued examination.
ANGIER	f	Where did my top hat go?
ALLEY	?	Nowhere.
ALLEY	?	We've tried the damn thing a dozen times. And the hat went nowhere.
TESLA	m	Which is why we need to rey a different material. It may provoke a different result.
TESLA	m	You don't expect me to handle the thing myself?
ALLEY	?	You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, Doctor.
ANGIER	f	I'll go.
ANGIER	f	Here, kitty, kitty.
ANGIER	f	So the machine was working?
ALLEY	?	I never bothered to check the calibration. The hat never moved.
TESLA	m	These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science.
TESLA	m	We'll need a couple of weeks to iron
OUT THE-	m	(looks at hats) -problems with the machine. I'll send word when it's ready.
TESLA	m	Don't forget your hat.
ANGIER	f	Which one is mine?
TESLA	m	They are all your hat, Mr. Angier.
JESS	?	Are we going to the zoo this afternoon, daddy?
BORDEN	m	Daddy's got some business this afternoon.
JESS	?	But you promised.
BORDEN	m	Did I?
BORDEN	m	Then go to the zoo we shall.
BORDEN	m	(gestures to newspaper) Who's that?
JESS	?	That's you, daddy?
BORDEN	m	Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready.
SARAH	f	We each have our vices.
BORDEN	m	Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone.
SARAH	f	You mean it today.
BORDEN	m	Absolutely.
SARAH	f	That makes it so much harder when you don't.
BORDEN	m	More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she?
BORDEN	m	The little lady wants to visit the Zoo, I thought you could take her. I'll do it tomorrow, if not. (looks at his feet) Sarah... she knows. At least, she knows things aren't right. (looks at Fallon,
PLEADING)	?	Help me with her. Try and convince her that I love her. Please.
OLIVIA	f	What is it. Freddy?
BORDEN	m	Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong.
OLIVIA	f	Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong.
BORDEN	m	I'm trying, Olivia. Please.
OLIVIA	f	I'll get dressed.
OLIVIA	f	There's something about him I don't trust.
BORDEN	m	You trust me? (off her look) Then trust Fallon- he protects the things I care about.
MANAGER	m	We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.
MANAGER	m	We are sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave as well. He was very good to Colorado Springs. A very generous man.
MANAGER	m	Mr. Angier? I didn't feel it was necessary to tell the other men about the box.
ANGIER	f	What box?
MANAGER	m	We never use these rooms in the off - season. It's a shame.
TESLA	m	Such thing will only bring you misery.
ANGIER	f	Yes, you, Borden. Sitting there, in your cell, reading my diary. Awaiting your death. For my murder.
OWENS	m	Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that you'd reconsidered his offer.
BORDEN	m	Angier's journal, the "gesture of good faith"? It's a fake.
OWENS	m	I assure you it's not.
BORDEN	m	It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death.
OWENS	m	Clever predictions, I'm sure. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt. It's written in Angier own hand, of which we have numerous examples. (looks at Borden) What makes you think it's a fake?
BORDEN	m	It doesn't matter.
BORDEN	m	My tricks. All of them.
OWENS	m	Including the Transported Man? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
BORDEN	m	No he won't. They're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each.
OWENS	m	Without the Prestige for each trick these are wothless.
BORDEN	m	You'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here.
BORDEN	m	I want to say goodbye.
SARAH	f	Deny it all you want- I know!
BORDEN	m	Sarah, it's not true! I've told you Olivia means nothing to me!
SARAH	f	I'll go yo her! I know what you really are, Alfred!
BORDEN	m	Sarah. You can't do that.
SARAH	f	I can't live like this!
BORDEN	m	What do you want from me!
SARAH	f	I want you to be honest with me. No tricks, no lies, no secrets.
SARAH	f	Do you love me?
BORDEN	m	Not today.
SARAH	f	Thank you.
CUTTER	m	I- I'm looking for an old friend-
ANGIER	f	Nice little theatre. Good up-and- coming magician.
CUTTER	m	You came back.
ANGIER	f	It's a good to see you, John.
CUTTER	m	Good rehearsal space. Blind stagehands. I like it- You always had an eye for publicity.
ANGIER	f	I need your help, John. My last show. A limited engagement.
CUTTER	m	Your last show?
ANGIER	f	A wise man once told me that obsession was a young man's game. I'm almost done. One thing left... (points at crate) The real Transported Man.
CUTTER	m	You want to design a show around it?
ANGIER	f	i don't want you backstage, I need you front of house, managing.
ANGIER	f	i need you calling in any favours and connections you have left to get us the right booking for the run.
CUTTER	m	What sort of booking are you after?
ANGIER	f	The sort that Borden can't ignore.
DRIVER	m	This is the address, sir.
CUTTER	m	Mr.Ackerman. It's an honor to see you again, sir.
ACKERMAN	m	When you said you only wanted to show me one trick it piqued my interest.
CUTTER	m	It's a very special trick. Mr.Ackerman.
ANGIER	f	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.
ACKERMAN	m	Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on, shall we?
CUTTER	m	(down to stage) Turn it on, please.
ACKERMAN	m	Very pretty.
ACKERMAN	m	That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears? That's not a trick. He has to come back. There has to be a-
ACKERMAN	m	(quiet, haunted) Pardon me. It's very rare to see... real magic. it's been many years since I've seen...
ANGIER	f	Are you interested in helping us?
ACKERMAN	m	Yes. But you'll have to dress it up a little. Disguise it. Give them enough reason to doubt it.
MERRIT	f	Mr. Ackerman. When they said...I didn't think you'd be here in person.
ACKERMAN	m	I have an act for your venue.
MERRIT	f	Well, of course, sir...But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet. They're playing through next year.
ACKERMAN	m	Get rid of them. This is a magical act. An excellent one. I believe you booked his first engagement several years ago. The Great Danton.
MERRIT	f	You really want me to-
MERRIT	f	I'll do it. Of course.
ACKERMAN	m	There will be one hundred performances. No more, no less. Five perfomances a week. No matinees, no weekends.
ACKERMAN	m	And that's what you'll be charging for each ticket. Good day.
OLIVIA	f	You haven't spopken about her, Freddy. Not once.
BORDEN	m	Who?
OLIVIA	f	Don't be cruel.
BORDEN	m	Why would I talk about her to you?
OLIVIA	f	Because she was part of your life and now she's gone.
OLIVIA	f	She wanted to meet me the day before she killed herself. Said she had something to tell me about you. I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her. (looks at Borden) What would she have said, I wonder?
BORDEN	m	You want the truth about me, Olivia? (she nods, wary) I never loved Sarah.
OLIVIA	f	You married her, had a child with
BORDEN	m	Part of me loved her. But part of me didn't. The part that found you. The part that's sitting here now. I love you. That is the truth that matters.
OLIVIA	f	You could be sitting in some other restaurant talking to some other woman about me that way. It's unhuman to be so cold.
OLIVIA	f	By the way, have you seen who's opened at the Pantages? (Borden shakes head) The Great Danton.
BORDEN	m	He's back?
OLIVIA	f	After two years. And he has a new trick. They're saying it's the best that London's ever seen.
OLIVIA	f	If you could see the look on your face, Professor. You should go to him- you deserve each other.
ANGIER	f	Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk. (removes his coat) Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocable damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now, for when I tell you that the young lady who taught performing it, you will understand the seriousness of the danger involved.
ANGIER	f	In my travels I have seen the future, and it is a strange future indeed. The world is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities.
ANGIER	f	Man's reach exceeds his IMAGINATION!
BORDEN	m	Why only 100 performances? Do his methods dictate it, or is it simply a publicity move?
BORDEN	m	Fifty yards in a second. And all I know is that he uses a trapdoor. What's going on under that stage?
CUTTER	m	It's Cutter.
BLIND STAGEHAND	m	What do you want?
CUTTER	m	I'm looking for Angier.
ANGIER	f	You found him.
ANGIER	f	I told you, John- I don't want you backstage on this one.
CUTTER	m	What are they doing?
ANGIER	f	Disposing of the Prestige materials.
CUTTER	m	What's down there?
ANGIER	f	Do you really want to know?
CUTTER	m	Perhaps not.
BORDEN	m	They do this every night. After each performance?
BORDEN	m	We're done. (turns to Fallon) Let him have this trick. You're not to go back there. I don't need to know his secret. Leave him alone.
STAGEHAND	f	Where'd you think you're going?
BORDEN	m	I'm part of the act, you fool!
CUTTER	m	Who was that?
CUTTER	m	What did you do?
JUDGE	m	You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
OWENS	m	Mr.Cutter? Owens.
CUTTER	m	Thank you for coming, Mr.Owens. It's fallen to me to dispose of Mr.Angier's equipment. Looking at the manifest, it's cleat that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.
OWENS	m	Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver the items you surely could have just-
CUTTER	m	It's not just that, Mr.Owens. There is a particular item (turns to crate) This time, in fact, that I wish to... well, that is to say, I want to-
OWENS	m	You wnat to buy it instead.
CUTTER	m	I suppose so, yes.
OWENS	m	This is the machine? I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about procuring this particular item.
CUTTER	m	Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord Caldlow in person.
OWENS	m	Out of the question, I'm afraid.
OWENS	m	of course, I suppose... if, in the course of your delivery arrangements your paths were to cross... I can't stop you from speaking your mind.
SULLEN	f	Still here, Borden?
BORDEN	m	For now.
SULLEN	f	Got a visitor. Lord Caldlow. With a little girl.
BORDEN	m	Jess, how are you?
BORDEN	m	Are you alright?
BORDEN	m	I've missed you. Fallon's missed you. We both have.
JESS	?	Can I come in there, Daddy?
BORDEN	m	Everything's going to be okay.
BORDEN	m	You must be Lord-
ANGIER	f	Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.
BORDEN	m	I saw you die.
ANGIER	f	They flatter you with all those chains, Alfred. Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball?
ANGIER	f	All I wanted to do was prove that I was the better magician. But you couldn't leave me alone.
BORDEN	m	You were always afraid to get your hands dirty... (looks down at his
JESS)	?	Not anymore.
ANGIER	f	No. Not anymore. And I win. Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.
BORDEN	m	You win. But don't take my little girl...
ANGIER	f	I know how hard it is to have someone so precious taken away, don't I
ANGIER	f	Borden? But you can't take her with you know, can you? She'll be looked after. Good-bye, Professor.
BORDEN	m	Wait. Don't you want this? You paid for it.
ANGIER	f	Your secret.
ANGIER	f	You always were the better magician, Borden. We both know that.
ANGIER	f	But whatever your secret was, you'll have to agree-
ANGIER	f	-mine is better.
BORDEN	m	Angier! Let me say good-bye. Please.
JESS	?	When are you taking me home, Daddy?
BORDEN	m	Soon. I promise. Soon.
ANGIER	f	For God's sake, Borden.
BORDEN	m	Daddy's coming, I promise. I promise.
BORDEN	m	I promise.
BORDEN	m	You think this place can hold me, Angier?
BORDEN	m	Angier!
HOUSEKEEPER	m	Come here, love. Sir, there's gentleman waiting.
CAPTAIN	m	Dead God.
ANGIER	f	Hello, Cutter.
CUTTER	m	You're alive. You're Lord Caldlow. (Angier nods again) How?
	?	I learned an American accent from-
CUTTER	m	How are you alive, Robert?! I saw you on the slab, for God's sake.
ANGIER	f	I magician never reveals his secrets.
HOUSEKEEPER	m	Go on, child.
ANGIER	f	Good night, Jess.
CUTTER	m	Who's the girl?
CUTTER	m	I've seen her. I've seen her in court with Fallon...
CUTTER	m	What have you done?
ANGIER	f	She needs looking after-
CUTTER	m	She needs her father, but you're letting him hang. And I helped you.
CUTTER	m	I came here tonight to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine. But I won't beg you for anything.
ANGIER	f	You don't have to. I'm going to make sure the machine. is never used again. A good magician never repeats his tricks.
CUTTER	m	Then, Lord Caldlow, where would like me to deliver it?
ANGIER	f	My theatre. It belongs with the Prestige materials.
CUTTER	m	I once told you about the sailor who described drowing to me...
ANGIER	f	He said it was like going home.
CUTTER	m	I was lying. He said it was agony.
BORDEN	m	We go alone now- both of us. Only I don't have as far to go as you.
BORDEN	m	You were right. I should've left him to his damned trick... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for so many things. For Sarah. I didn't want to hurt her.
BORDEN	m	Don't cry. Not for me. Go live your life in full. For both of us.
BORDEN	m	Are you watching closely?
CUTTER	m	Thank-you gents.
WORKMAN	m	Where do you want it?
CUTTER	m	Don't worry. Someone's coming to help.
CUTTER	m	I'm bringing this over after we're done.
ANGIER	f	Cautions as ever, Cutter. No one's going to use the place. I own it.
CUTTER	m	No room left- you couldn't have acommodated 100 performances.
ANGIER	f	It's a good thing I retired early then.
ANGIER	f	We'll put it down the end.
CUTTER	m	I'll go mix the cement.
CUTTER	m	Take a minute to consider your achiviement.
ANGIER	f	Cutter, I tried not to involve you.
ANGIER	f	No one cares about the man in the box.
ANGIER	f	Cutter?
WARDEN	m	Alfred borden, on this day, in the name of the King and the high court of England, you will meet your end. Do you have anything to say for yourself.
BORDEN	m	Abacadabra.
ANGIER	f	You- you died.
ANGIER	f	A brother. A Twin.
ANGIER	f	You were Fallon. The whole time...
BORDEN	m	We were both Fallon. And we were both Borden.
ANGIER	f	Were you the one who went into the
ANGIER	f	Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple. Too easy.
BORDEN	m	Simple, maybe. But not easy.
ANGIER	f	What about Olivia? And your wife?
BORDEN	m	We each loved one of them. We each had half a full life. Enough for us, but not for them.
BORDEN	m	Sacrifice, Robert- that's the price of a good trick.
BORDEN	m	But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
ANGIER	f	I've made sacrificies.
BORDEN	m	It takes nothing to steal someone else's work.
ANGIER	f	It takes everything.
ANGIER	f	It didn't work.
SECOND ANGIER	m	No, wait! I'm the-
ANGIER	f	Do you want to see what it cost me? You didn't see where you are, did you? Let me show you.
ANGIER	f	It took courage to climb into that machine every night...
BORDEN	m	You went halfway around the world. You spent a fortune. You did terrible things... and all of it for nothing.
ANGIER	f	Nothing? You never understood, id you? Why we did this? The audience knows the truth- that the world is simple. Miserable. Solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second, you could make them wonder. Then you got to see something very special... (coughs, looks up) You really don't know?
ANGIER	f	It was the look on their faced.
CUTTER	m	But you won't find it...
CUTTER	m	...because you don't really want to know...
