TRUMAN	m	So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot  of his book, and he says to me: the  writing's going well, but I just  want to make sure it's not one of  those problem novels. I said: Jimmy,  your novel's about a Negro homosexual  who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't  you call that a problem?
CHRISTOPHER	m	Susan's father had a minor heart  attack, so she's writing more erotic  poems about death and sex.
BARBARA	f	It's so tiresome.
WILLIAMS	m	Hmm. What rhymes with angina?
GRAYSON	m	How's your writing?
TRUMAN	m	Oh, I've got a million ideas of what  to write next -- I just have to choose  one.
GRAYSON	m	Really?
TRUMAN	m	No.
BARBARA	f	Who would I want to play me? Natalie  Wood.
ROSE	f	Too fat.
BARBARA	f	Audrey Hepburn?
ROSE	f	Not bad. Sort of middle-class.
TRUMAN	m	When a movie is made of my life I  know exactly who I want as me... Marilyn Monroe.
TRUMAN	m	William Shawn, please. Adorable one? All of a sudden I know  what article I'm going to write for  you next.
TRUMAN	m	...never had anything like this happen  to them before. They're used to  sleeping at night with the doors  unlatched.... Yes, we should buy stock in Master  Locks -- all of Kansas will be in  the hardware store tomorrow.
TRUMAN	m	They have no idea who the killer is.  But it doesn't matter who the killer  is -- what matters is who the  townspeople imagine the killer is.  That's what I want to write about.
TRUMAN	m	I'm gonna need some help... I'm  thinking about Nelle -- she can  protect me...
TRUMAN	m	I want to leave tonight...
NELLE	f	I figured you'd missed it.
TRUMAN	m	God I'm glad you agreed to come.  You're the only one I know with the  qualifications to be both a research  assistant and personal bodyguard. Oh, Nelle, you poor thing.
NELLE	f	Off. Truman. Off. I'm happy to see you too, but I can  still whip your behind.
PORTER #1	m	Mr. Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper  Lee. Where would you like these,  sir?
TRUMAN	m	That one up there and that one on  the floor.
NELLE	f	What all did you bring?
PORTER #2	m	Thank you greatly, sir. It's an honor  to have you with us. If you don't  mind my saying, your last book was  even better than the first --
TRUMAN	m	You're sweet.
PORTER #2	m	Just when you think they've gotten  as good as they can get.
TRUMAN	m	Thank you. You're very kind.
PORTER #1	m	Ma'am.
NELLE	f	You're pathetic.
NELLE	f	You're pathetic.
TRUMAN	m	What?
NELLE	f	You paid them to say that.
NELLE	f	You paid them to say that!
TRUMAN	m	How'd you know? How did you know?!
NELLE	f	"Just when you think they've gotten  as good as they can get."
TRUMAN	m	You think that was too much? I thought that was a good line.
NELLE	f	Pathetic.
TRUMAN	m	Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of  Investigation. KBI.
TRUMAN	m	Mr. Alvin Dewey, please.
GUARD	m	Third floor. In what used to be the  Sheriff's Office.
CHURCH	m	The wife said no more smoking in the  house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's  got a couch upstairs in his apartment.  I'll stay with him and Dorothy till  we're done here." I've got my bag and a carton of  cigarettes in the car.
DEWEY	m	Roy.
TRUMAN	m	Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the  New Yorker.
TRUMAN	m	Hello.
TRUMAN	m	Bergdorf's.
NYE	m	Sorry?
TRUMAN	m	The scarf.
NYE	m	Oh. Nice.
TRUMAN	m	Thank you. I wonder when we could arrange an  interview? Some time to talk.
DEWEY	m	About what?
TRUMAN	m	We're not looking for any inside  information -- I don't care one way  or another if you catch whoever did  this -- I'm writing an article not  about the Clutter killings, but how  they're affecting the town, how you  all are bearing up --
DEWEY	m	I care.
TRUMAN	m	Excuse me?
DEWEY	m	I care. I care a great deal if we catch  whoever did this.
TRUMAN	m	Yes --
DEWEY	m	As do a lot of folks around here.
TRUMAN	m	Of course.
NYE	m	New Yorker?
CHURCH	m	You have press credentials?
NYE	m	What's the New Yorker?
CHURCH	m	Magazine.
TRUMAN	m	Magazines don't give out --
CHURCH	m	You can come to the news conference  with the rest of them. Sears and Roebuck.
DEWEY	m	I'll talk facts but I won't speculate.  The main fact here we need to be  clear on is not one, but four people  were killed. A lot of folks say Herb  Clutter had to be the main target  because he was dealt with the most  brutally --
JOURNALIST #1	m	Had his throat cut.
DEWEY	m	Yes. We'd all like to know why. But  it could've been any one of the family  they were after. We just don't know --
JOURNALIST #2	m	You've identified the murder weapon?
DEWEY	m	Wounds indicate a shotgun, close- range, but no casings were found.
JOURNALIST #1	m	Twelve-gauge, hunting --
DEWEY	m	Right.
JOURNALIST #1	m	They were all shot in the face?
DEWEY	m	No. Nancy in the back of the head.
JOURNALIST #2	m	Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry,  sexual molestation of the women?
DEWEY	m	No.
JOURNALIST #2	m	Anything else stolen?
DEWEY	m	Kenyon's radio seems to be the only...
JOURNALIST #3	m	The boy was sixteen?
DEWEY	m	Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen.
JOURNALIST #2	m	It's her friend that found them?
DEWEY	m	Laura Kinney.
JOURNALIST #2	m	Spell that?
DEWEY	m	I assume you're okay with the Laura  part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave  her be.
OLD MAN	m	There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans,  a whole bunch of Mexicans...
DEWEY	m	George, it's good to see you again.  I do have an opinion whether this  was the work of one man or a whole  bunch, as you said, but it doesn't  matter a whole lot whether it was  Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos.  We're going to find whoever did this.  Four good people from our community  are dead. Let's remember that. Okay  with you? The West Kansas Farm Committee's  offering a thousand dollar reward  for information leading to an arrest.  Please print that. Thank you all for coming.
TRUMAN	m	Mr. Dewey's protective of the  Clutters. I wonder how well he knew  them...
TRUMAN	m	He was foxy with that old man. Are you ever gonna let me drive?
NELLE	f	Truman, you're a menace. You can  barely see over the wheel.
NELLE	f	This make you miss Alabama?
TRUMAN	m	Not even a little bit.
TRUMAN	m	Hello.
NELLE	f	Morning.
GIRL #1	f	Hi.
NELLE	f	Can any of you tell me where I'd  find Laura Kinney?
GIRL #1	f	Oh, um...
NELLE	f	Is that her? With the tall boy?
GIRL #2	f	Yeah. With Danny Burke.
NELLE	f	Danny Burke? Thank you.
GIRL #2	f	Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.
NELLE	f	Truman. Truman --
NELLE	f	These folks live their lives in a  particular way. You need to consider  adapting yourself to that fact.
TRUMAN	m	What --
NELLE	f	-- I'm gonna find out where those  two kids live. Maybe you'll let me  do that alone?
JACK	m	I think I scared a friend of yours  this morning. He came looking for  you while I was writing.
TRUMAN	m	You hate my friends.
JACK	m	I wouldn't say hate. So long as they  don't knock on my door.
TRUMAN	m	I saw the bodies today.
JACK	m	Which?
TRUMAN	m	The Clutters. I looked inside the  coffins.
JACK	m	That's horrifying.
TRUMAN	m	It comforts me -- something so  horrifying it's freeing. It's a  relief. Normal life falls away. But, then, I was never much for normal  life --
JACK	m	No, you weren't.
TRUMAN	m	People here won't talk to me. They  want someone like you, like Nelle.  Me they hate.
JACK	m	I can't think of a single quality I  share with Nelle.
TRUMAN	m	Well --
JACK	m	Maybe manliness.
TRUMAN	m	My point exactly.
JACK	m	It's why I left the Midwest in the  first place. I knew I could only  find someone like you in New York  City.
NELLE	f	Let's go.
NELLE	f	Danny? Would you mind terribly if I walked  with you for a bit?
LAURA	f	I thought you were from the FBI with  your long coat.
TRUMAN	m	Is that so?
LAURA	f	That's why I ran off.
TRUMAN	m	I've been getting a lot of that  lately.
LAURA	f	It's fine talking to you all.  Practically nobody around here wants  to talk since what happened.
NELLE	f	Folks have been through a rough patch.  Including you. Nancy was your best friend.
LAURA	f	She was my best friend.
NELLE	f	How has Danny been?
LAURA	f	Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible  ever happened to him before. Nancy  just started wearing his ring again  after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter  was trying to get her to end it 'cause  Danny's Catholic.
NELLE	f	What were the Clutters?
LAURA	f	Methodist. Danny was the last person  at the house that night. That's why  Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him --  they don't think he had anything to  do with it -- just to see if he  remembers anything unusual and all.
NELLE	f	People in town seem to wonder if he  was involved.
LAURA	f	That's been real hard for Danny.
TRUMAN	m	Oh, it's the hardest -- when people  have a notion about you and it's  impossible to convince them otherwise.  Since I was a child folks have thought  they had me pegged because of the  way I look and the way I talk. They're  always wrong. Do you know what I mean?
LAURA	f	I want to show you something.
TRUMAN	m	Not one person here understands her.
LAURA	f	Maybe you'll get a better picture of  Nancy. And the family.
NELLE	f	What is this?
LAURA	f	It's her diary.
NELLE	f	"Danny here tonight and we watched  TV. So nice just having him sit with  us. Left at eleven. P.S. -- He's the  only one I really love."
NELLE	f	And that was that.
TRUMAN	m	The end of a life.
NELLE	f	"Shattered."
TRUMAN	m	"Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible  ever happened to him before. "
TRUMAN	m	I have 94 percent recall of all  conversations.
NELLE	f	94 percent.
TRUMAN	m	I've tested myself.
NELLE	f	I hate that you're better than me at  this.
NELLE	f	Don't you dare close your eyes on my  bed.
NELLE	f	Stand up and walk out that door. Go  to your room if you're gonna sleep.  Truman. Truman.
NELLE	f	Crap.
NELLE	f	What right do you have being tired?  You were snoring blissfully --
TRUMAN	m	I don't snore --
NELLE	f	-- while I lay there, hating you --
TRUMAN	m	You don't hate me.
NELLE	f	Not much. What? Marie Dewey?... We've got somewhere  to go for Thanksgiving supper.
TRUMAN	m	Apparently Detective Foxy's wife has  a better opinion of me than Detective  Foxy.
MARIE	f	You came.
NELLE	f	Hi.
TRUMAN	m	Thank you for having us.
MARIE	f	Thank you. Get yourselves in here. Alvin! Get your pants on. They're  here.
TRUMAN	m	More. More.
MARIE	f	Alvin will hate this.
TRUMAN	m	Yes, but we who know the truth will  love it.
MARIE	f	I have to stop. I cannot believe you're from New  Orleans. I miss it so much.
TRUMAN	m	I only lived there for a short while  but my Mama was born and bred.
MARIE	f	You know something -- Alvin pretends  he doesn't know who you are, but the  minute you came to town he read your  books. He had one of his men pick up  "Breakfast at Tiffany's" in Kansas  City 'cause it's banned from the  library here.
TRUMAN	m	What did Mr. Dewey think?
MARIE	f	He liked it more than he's willing  to admit.
TRUMAN	m	How very foxy.
TRUMAN	m	Mama would've put in half the bottle  by now.
MARIE	f	Alright, one more shake.
TRUMAN	m	Hello.
NELLE	f	Hi.
MARIE	f	How you doing, foxy?
TRUMAN	m	I was writing the script as they  were filming, all that time in Italy.  I'd work like mad all day long and  then dash down to the bar around  midnight to hand in the next day's  scenes. Humphrey had just about moved  into the hotel bar --
MARIE	f	Humphrey Bogart.
TRUMAN	m	-- where he and John drank every  night --
MARIE	f	John Huston.
TRUMAN	m	-- and I mean drank, like famished  water buffaloes. Well -- I'd only  just handed them the final scene  when the bellhop told me I had a  phone call. It was my stepfather,  Joe Capote, calling to say that my  mother had died. I flew home to New  York -- terribly distraught -- but  when I got to the apartment I could  see that Joe was in even worse shape  than I was. He grabbed my hands and  sat me down at the kitchen table,  and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about  anything, any subject in the world.  Don't worry whether it will interest  me or not. Just talk so I won't break  down." And I did. He couldn't bear  to be alone with his thoughts. It  was too painful.
MARIE	f	It's been a hard couple weeks for  Alvin. He and Herb Clutter were good  friends. From church.
DEWEY	m	Marie --
MARIE	f	Oh come on, Alvin. These are good  people.
TRUMAN	m	Who would put a pillow under the  boy's head just to shoot him? Why  would they tuck Nancy in?
DEWEY	m	I want to know the same thing.
NELLE	f	Twisted notion of tenderness.
NELLE	f	Thank you.
MARIE	f	So many of my friends would love to  meet you.
NELLE	f	That'd be fine --
TRUMAN	m	You don't have to worry. I'm not  going to write about this until  everything's over.
DEWEY	m	I'm not worried. I know what room  you're in at the hotel. And I know  where you live in Brooklyn.
HOLT	m	I'd of picked them up but I haven't  been myself. Mind you, I make the  walk out here every day, check the  house, make sure the pipes don't  freeze -- that sort of item. The  least I can do for Mr. Clutter.
NELLE	f	How long have you worked here?
HOLT	m	1940 -- a lotta years. The wife too,  cleaning the house. Cooking.
NELLE	f	Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was  wonderful.
HOLT	m	She had a hard job after what all  happened. Cleaning. I burned most of  the rest -- mattresses -- too far of  a mess. I've asked around some -- if anyone's  looking for a strong hand.
HOLT	m	I don't think they'll be able to  sell the place till they catch the  ones that did it. That's what I hear anyhow.
JACK	m	You're celebrating.
TRUMAN	m	Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent  me in New York?
JACK	m	Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird.  You said it was good.
TRUMAN	m	And I was right. She just heard  Lipincott wants to publish it.
JACK	m	Well. Jesus. That's terrific. Tell  her congratulations.
TRUMAN	m	Congratulations. Jealous.
JACK	m	Just promise you'll be home by  Christmas.
TRUMAN	m	I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it  was hard at first, but now I'm  practically the mayor.
JACK	m	Alright.
TRUMAN	m	I want to come home -- I do. Though  if they catch whoever did this, who  knows what -- I'll probably be here  til next Christmas.
JACK	m	Right. I'll let you go.
TRUMAN	m	Jack, we'll go away this spring to  write. Maybe Spain...
JACK	m	Alright, Truman.
TRUMAN	m	Bye. The poor boy misses me.
NELLE	f	Truman.
TRUMAN	m	Nelle.
NELLE	f	You remember when we were kids?
TRUMAN	m	I was never a kid. I was born fully  formed.
NELLE	f	I had no idea what a homosexual was.  But I knew whatever they were, you  were one of 'em.
MAN IN HALL	m	Oh. Uh. Oh. Excuse us.
TRUMAN	m	-- girdle up -- no extra bulges --  if you're dressed right for him when  he gets home, the evening should be  smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals.
MARIE	f	I can't believe you got this whole  page -- I only read it to you once!
TRUMAN	m	You cut that out.
MARIE	f	You believe that Alvin?
ALVIN	m	Impressive.
MARIE	f	I'm sorry. He's upset. -- smoking three packs a day. Two men did it. They know who. One  of them used to have a cellmate who  gave him up for the thousand dollar  reward. They passed through Kansas  City last week writing bad checks --  by the time Alvin's boys got up there  they'd skipped out again.
NELLE	f	Where to?
MARIE	f	They have no idea.
DEWEY	m	Alvin. Paul. Now.
DEWEY	m	Damnit. Come here.
MARIE	f	Alvin ...
DEWEY	m	Alvin Jr. Get over here.
ALVIN JR.	m	Dad, the phone.
DEWEY	m	Paul. Back to the table.
DEWEY	m	Sit.
ALVIN JR.	m	Dad?
MARIE	f	Tell them we're at dinner, Alvin.
ALVIN JR.	m	Dad?
DEWEY	m	Not now, Alvin.
ALVIN JR.	m	You need to call the Chief of Police  in Las Vegas when you have a minute.
RADIO ANNOUNCER	m	...This is KERG radio, Garden City.  A friendly broadcast from a friendly  place. Our lead story:
RADIO ANNOUNCER	m	...newsmen from six states have joined  scores of Kansans as they await the  arrival of confessed killers Perry  Smith and Richard Hickock. KBI  officers have been driving the Clutter  family's brutal killers nonstop  from...
NELLE	f	Hey.
MARIE	f	Motorcycle accident. He broke them  and they never healed right. Alvin told me.
DOROTHY	f	Truman Capote.
TRUMAN	m	Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd  be left alone this morning by that  hard-working husband of yours. So I have breakfast. I have news. And I have literature. My friend  Jack mailed me the book you wanted.
DOROTHY	f	"For the maiden of the Midwest, the  priestess of the plains, the queen  of the kitchen: my first novel.  Truman."
DOROTHY	f	You're too much. Go on into the living  room, lemme grab that -- it's been  ringing all morning.
DOROTHY	f	Oh. Truman. I meant in there. I... um...
DOROTHY	f	It's the women's cell. It's hardly  ever used. But they wanted to, um,  separate... Please. Let's sit in the  living room. I'll set up in the living  room.
DOROTHY	f	Come.
TRUMAN	m	They put you in the women's cell.
PERRY	m	Among other indignities.
TRUMAN	m	Well... she's a good cook.
PERRY	m	She's scared of me.
TRUMAN	m	I think so am I. A little bit.
PERRY	m	Are you? You have any aspirin? My legs --
DOROTHY	f	Um. Truman? All set.
TRUMAN	m	I'm sorry.
TRUMAN	m	His feet don't touch the floor.
JUDGE TATE	m	In the matter of the State of Kansas  v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry  Edward Smith this Court has been  informed by counsel -- Mr. Weeks --  that defendants wish to waive their  right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr.  Hickock, is that your wish?
HICKOCK	m	Yessir. Yes.
TRUMAN	m	Why are they doing that?
JUDGE TATE	m	Mr. Smith.
PERRY	m	I ask that the waiver be effectuated.
JUDGE TATE	m	So noted. We're adjourned.
DOROTHY	f	Mr. Capote.
TRUMAN	m	Madame Sanderson.
DOROTHY	f	Is that for the two of us to share?  Or for me to eat alone while you  talk to our guest?
TRUMAN	m	Was it your choice to waive the  hearing?
TRUMAN	m	You still need some? Give me your hand.
PERRY	m	I could kill you if you got too close.
TRUMAN	m	Would you like some water?
TRUMAN	m	Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book --
PERRY	m	He said we'd curry favor with the  Judge if we waived our rights.
TRUMAN	m	Who did?
PERRY	m	The lawyer.
TRUMAN	m	Okay.
PERRY	m	Your picture's undignified. People  recall first impressions.
TRUMAN	m	What's been your first impression?
PERRY	m	You want something.
TRUMAN	m	From you?
DOROTHY	f	Truman. Walter's gonna be home soon.
TRUMAN	m	I just want permission to talk. Has anyone else visited?
DOROTHY	f	Truman --
TRUMAN	m	Will you tell me if you need anything?  I can have whatever you want sent  from New York. Will you do that?
SHAWN	m	William Shawn.
TRUMAN	m	Gorgeous?
SHAWN	m	Truman.
TRUMAN	m	I'm writing a book. It's too much  for a single article -- this town,  the killers most of all -- you will  be stunned by Perry Smith --
SHAWN	m	Why? What has he --
TRUMAN	m	Not much yet, but I know. I can sense  him. He's desperately lonely,  frightened... I have questions --  are you ready?
SHAWN	m	Would it matter --
TRUMAN	m	How much more money can you send me?  How quickly can you get Dick Avedon  out here to take some pictures?
HICKOCK	m	Perry, honey. You look terrific...
HICKOCK	m	Calm yourself down, sweetheart.
HICKOCK	m	Be patient, Capote. Maybe later  they'll send you my skin.
TRUMAN	m	I have the perfect place for it,  over the hearth.
NELLE	f	Where'd Perry get the art set?
JUDGE TATE	m	Members of the jury. Have you reached  a verdict?
FOREMAN	m	Yes sir.
JUDGE TATE	m	Defendants rise.
JUDGE TATE	m	Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene  Hickock stand accused of four counts  of the crime of murder in the first  degree. Have you reached a unanimous  verdict?
FOREMAN	m	We have, your honor.
JUDGE TATE	m	What is your verdict?
FOREMAN	m	Guilty. On all counts.
JUDGE TATE	m	Have you unanimously reached a  sentence.
FOREMAN	m	We have, your honor.
JUDGE TATE	m	What is the sentence?
FOREMAN	m	Death.
JUDGE TATE	m	Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene  Hickock. You've been found guilty of  four counts of murder in the first  degree. You will be taken to the  state penitentiary at Lansing. No  later than midnight, May 13 of this  year, nineteen hundred and sixty,  each of you will be hanged by the  neck until dead. So ordered.
HICKOCK	m	Alright, partner. Least now we're  not the only killers in Kansas.
TRUMAN	m	You think he slept at all?
TRUMAN	m	I need to see him before we go.
TRUMAN	m	They're going to transfer you up to  Lansing today. You'll have to make  sure to put me on the visitor's list.  Otherwise I can't see you.
TRUMAN	m	Will you do that? I'm going to help  find you a proper lawyer. You need a  serious lawyer for an appeal. They took Dick last night. I need  you to get him to do the same thing --  put me on the visitor's list. Will  you do that, Perry?
TRUMAN	m	Perry.
BEN BARON	m	Nelle. Kudos on "Kill the Bird." Is  that it?
NELLE	f	Close enough. Thanks.
SHAWN	m	He hasn't written a word yet, though  he says it's the nonfiction book of  the decade...
TRUMAN	m	He's little, but terrifying --
TRUMAN	m	He's as short as I am. And almost as  pretty. I'd be with him right now  but he's being given new  accommodations --
TRUMAN	m	Most people assume he's a monster. I  don't see him that way. The book I'm  writing will return him to the realm  of humanity -- it's the book I was  always meant to write...
JACK	m	Watch out. This is the start of a  great love affair.
NELLE	f	Oh yes. Truman in love with Truman.
TRUMAN	m	...I was in Marilyn's apartment just  last week. I had to break it to her  that, of the four Matisses hanging  on her wall, two were upside down.
TRUMAN	m	Another. To answer your question, I'm following  "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing  a different path -- by inventing an  entirely new kind of writing: the  non-fiction novel.
REPORTER	m	You have a subject?
TRUMAN	m	On the night of November 14, two men  broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas  and murdered an entire family. Why  did they do that? It's been suggested  that this subject is tawdry -- it's  not worthy of literature. I disagree.  Two worlds exist in this country --  the quiet conservative life, and the  life of those two men -- the  underbelly, the criminally violent.  Those worlds converged that bloody  night. I spent the past three months  interviewing everyone in Kansas  touched by that violence. I spent  hours talking to the killers -- and  I'll spend more. Researching this work has changed my  life, altered my point of view about  almost everything. I think those who  read it will be similarly affected. Such a book can only be written by a  journalist who has mastered the  techniques of fiction --
REPORTER	m	You're speaking of yourself.
TRUMAN	m	You're really very clever.
TRUMAN	m	Perry's decided to appeal. He claims  their attorney was incompetent --  that he never raised the issue of  temporary insanity.
JACK	m	So you find them a new lawyer.
TRUMAN	m	They're facing execution in six weeks,  Jack. They need someone to argue  whether or not that's right.
JACK	m	Okay.
TRUMAN	m	I'd also like to see them alive,  yes, thank you very much. I need to  hear their story.
TRUMAN	m	If you met him you'd understand.  It's as if no-one's ever asked him a  single question about himself. He's  so... damaged -- and strange --  unexplored... I don't trust this Hickock fellow.  Perry's the only person who can  describe to me what happened that  night. I need to hear him say it.
JACK	m	Just be careful what you do to get  what you want.
TRUMAN	m	I'm finding them a lawyer.
JACK	m	Truman. You're finding yourself a  lawyer.
YOUNG PRISON GUARD	m	Warden Krutch will see you now.
KRUTCH	m	We do well by our boys. Showers once  a week. Feed em good. We'll be feeding  Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if  he don't eat. Get the food in through  his arm.
TRUMAN	m	What are you talking about?
KRUTCH	m	Hasn't eaten in a month. But it's  not his right to kill himself. It's  the People's right. The People of  this State. And that's who I work  for, the People. You can write any  of this down.
TRUMAN	m	No one told me.
KRUTCH	m	Yah. Won't eat.
TRUMAN	m	When can I see him?
KRUTCH	m	How about you come back Thursday?
TRUMAN	m	No. That's no good. I need to see  them now, then whenever I want for  as long as I want.
KRUTCH	m	Not how we do things here.
TRUMAN	m	I see.
TRUMAN	m	I understand what a burden unlimited  visitation might be -- on this  institution, and on the People who  pay for it. I want to be clear that  I don't expect the citizens of  Leavenworth County to have to shoulder  that burden.
TRUMAN	m	To be dispensed as you see fit.
KRUTCH	m	I didn't know where to count your  boy -- being half-Indian. I did him  a favor though. Counted him White.
TRUMAN	m	You're a kind and generous man.
HICKOCK	m	My hero.
TRUMAN	m	Hello.
HICKOCK	m	Thanks for your help with the lawyer.
TRUMAN	m	That's fine.
HICKOCK	m	You must be desperate for a story to  come all the way out here.
YOUNG PRISON GUARD	m	Mr. Capote. You're entitled to go  in. You may, um, go in. If you wish.
HICKOCK	m	You want to see Perry. Go ahead.
TRUMAN	m	Thank you.
HICKOCK	m	Ask me, he's just trying to prove  the insanity defense.
TRUMAN	m	I don't care what your plans are for  yourself...
TRUMAN	m	But you're gonna wake up enough to  tell me what you did with my tie.
TRUMAN	m	It's okay. It's Truman. It's your  friend.
TRUMAN	m	How'd you learn to draw like that?
PERRY	m	Before she had us. Before she started  drinking.
TRUMAN	m	Who took care of you as a child?
PERRY	m	Orphanage. Me and Linda.
TRUMAN	m	That's your sister?
TRUMAN	m	We're not so different as you might  think. I was abandoned repeatedly as  a child. My mama'd drag me along to  some new town so she could take up  with another man she'd met. Night  after night she'd lock me in the  hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch  and tell the staff not to let me out  no matter what. I was terrified --  I'd scream my head off -- till finally  I'd collapse on the carpet next to  the door and fall asleep. After years  of this she just left me with  relatives in Alabama.
PERRY	m	Who raised you up?
TRUMAN	m	My Aunts. That's when I met Nelle -- she lived  next door. Your mother was Indian?
PERRY	m	Cherokee.
TRUMAN	m	Drinking was not a good thing for  her.
PERRY	m	No tolerance for it.
TRUMAN	m	And your father?
PERRY	m	No tolerance for him either.
TRUMAN	m	What I can't decide is if you  understand how fascinating you are.
PERRY	m	I'm sorry about your tie. They took  it away from me because we're all on  suicide watch. It's why the lights  stay on at night.
TRUMAN	m	I hope we're past that now. You had  me worried.
PERRY	m	Okay.
TRUMAN	m	I don't care about the tie. It's  just a pity because it looked so  good on you.
PERRY	m	Be careful of Ricardo. I think he  wants you all to himself.
TRUMAN	m	Alright --
PERRY	m	But he's naturally mendacious -- not  to be trusted -- if he had a hundred  dollars he'd steal a stick of chewing  gum.
TRUMAN	m	You wouldn't.
TRUMAN	m	I want to take your notebooks with  me -- I want to read them.
TRUMAN	m	If I leave here without understanding  you, the world will always see you  as a monster. I don't want that -- I  don't see you that way.
PERRY	m	I tracked my father down in Alaska.  I was 14. One day I said to him,  "Mom's dead." I could see it. A week  later we got the news. She finally  drunk herself to death.
TRUMAN	m	This is remarkable.
PERRY	m	Sometimes you see a thing -- how it  really is.
TRUMAN	m	He trusts me -- that's why he gave  it to me. He's given me absolutely  everything. You should see his drawings, Nelle,  how good he is. He wants so badly to  be taken seriously, to be held in  some esteem.
NELLE	f	Do you?
TRUMAN	m	Do I what?
NELLE	f	Hold him in esteem?
TRUMAN	m	Well... he's a gold mine. I mean  he's told me his entire life, and  now it's all here for me to write  down -- All of the history I need.  His entire life in this Diary. His  dead mother. A brother and sister  killed themselves.
NELLE	f	You tell him your mama did the same  thing?
TRUMAN	m	I tell him everything. We've been  talking our heads off the past month.  Sometimes, when I think how good my  book can be, I can hardly breathe.
NELLE	f	Huh.
TRUMAN	m	Here's what I wanted to read to you:  "If Called Upon to Make a Speech:" --  this is exactly what I was talking  about -- a speech just in case he's  ever recognized for an achievement:  "If Called Upon to Make a Speech: I  can't remember what I was going to  say for the life of me. I don't think  ever before have so many people been  so directly responsible for my being  so very, very glad. It's a wonderful  moment and a rare one. Thank you!" There's an exclamation point on the  end of that thank you, in case you  didn't catch it... Where'd you go?
NELLE	f	Christ. I guess it stopped being  funny.
TRUMAN	m	I never said it was. Listen to this...
DEWEY	m	Thanks.
DEWEY	m	You're nothing if not hard-working.
TRUMAN	m	You look good, healthy again.
DEWEY	m	Not a chance.
TRUMAN	m	I've decided on a title for my book.  I think you'll like it -- very  masculine. "In Cold Blood."
DEWEY	m	That refers to the crime or the fact  that you're still talking to the  criminals?
TRUMAN	m	The former, among other things.
DEWEY	m	I see.
TRUMAN	m	I've been wanting to ask if you'll  let me look at your investigation  notes.
DEWEY	m	That lawyer you helped find for your  friends got them a hearing at the  Kansas Supreme Court --
TRUMAN	m	I heard this morning.
DEWEY	m	-- on the issue of inadequate counsel.
TRUMAN	m	Alvin. Do you not want me to look at  your notes? You are permitted to say  no.
DEWEY	m	I'll tell you what: if those boys  get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to  hunt you down.
DEWEY	m	I have to be in court at nine o'clock.
DEWEY	m	Call Roy Church. He'll show you what  you want to see.
HICKOCK	m	Hey, hey...
PERRY	m	Thank you.
TRUMAN	m	It was as much for me as for anyone.  I couldn't bear the thought of losing  you so soon.
PERRY	m	We're going to be able to use your  book for our case. You'll write we  never got to raise our insanity plea.  You wrote how terrible the lawyer  was?
TRUMAN	m	I haven't written a word yet.
PERRY	m	What have you been doing?
TRUMAN	m	Research. Waiting to talk to you.
PERRY	m	All right.
TRUMAN	m	I had hoped --
PERRY	m	What are you calling it?
TRUMAN	m	The book? I have no idea.
TRUMAN	m	If I'm going to write about you --  if I'm going to determine how to  write about you -- you need to tell  me about that night at the Clutter  house.
TRUMAN	m	Perry.
TRUMAN	m	Why? Do you worry what I'll think?
TRUMAN	m	Is that it?
PERRY	m	Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.
TRUMAN	m	I know a lot of people.
TRUMAN	m	What is that you keep drawing?
PERRY	m	You must hate having to come to this  place --
TRUMAN	m	Perry, I have invitations to be in  Morocco, Greece... I choose to be  here. Those people have everything,  all their prayers have been answered,  yet they're more desperate than ever.  I prefer to be here with you.
PERRY	m	I was ten, I wet the bed, the nuns  at the orphanage hated the smell.  First month one of them found me  shivering -- just trying to get  through the night. The Sister pulled  back the covers and shined her  flashlight to see what I'd did. The  sheets were wet. She hit me so many  times with that flashlight she broke  it. That night I dreamed about the yellow  bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It  picked me up and it clawed the Nun's  eyes and it lifted me into the sky.
TRUMAN	m	I'm just missing this one piece,  Jack. Be patient with me.
JACK	m	How long is that gonna take? Why  don't you try leaving him alone for  a while? Come to Spain. You can always  visit him later.
TRUMAN	m	I don't know.
JACK	m	Well, I'm off. I've got my own writing  to do.
TRUMAN	m	Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.
JACK	m	Too many people around. I'll leave the address on the kitchen  table. Truman, what do you do there  when you're not with him? -- It must  be awful.
JACK	m	Think about what I said. Join me  when you can.
TRUMAN	m	I will. I will. Bye.
PERRY	m	I didn't see you. Jesus, you... Come in. Where's the guard?
TRUMAN	m	I can't. I brought you some things,  but I have to fly back East.
PERRY	m	When?
TRUMAN	m	An hour. I'm sorry.
PERRY	m	You can't.
TRUMAN	m	I'm sorry.
PERRY	m	Who are you going there to see --
HICKOCK	m	Capote, get it straight in your book --  we never intended on killing that  family --
PERRY	m	I told him that.
HICKOCK	m	No premeditation --
PERRY	m	I told him!
TRUMAN	m	Your writings are magnificent. I  hope these help you do more.
TRUMAN	m	I have so much material -- from the  trial, from our visits, your journals.  I have to organize it all, and I  have to start the process of writing. I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall. I miss you already. Write me every  five minutes.
HICKOCK	m	Be good now.
TRUMAN	m	What.
SHAWN	m	Truman. I was supposed to be home  for dinner with my wife three hours  ago -- I have not been able to tear  myself away from your book. It's  that good. It's not good, it's  astonishing. This first half is  astonishing. If the second half lives  up to this it, -- it -- how much is  left to do?
TRUMAN	m	I'm already well into the third part,  but I -- I can't finish that till I  convince Perry to describe the night  of the killings to me. I was planning  to visit this fall, see --
SHAWN	m	I think you need to talk to him now.
TRUMAN	m	And we all need to see how this ends  for the final part. I can't finish  the book till I know what happens.  If Perry and Dick are executed it's  one thing -- and if not, well --
SHAWN	m	Truman. You got your ending --
TRUMAN	m	I really don't know --
SHAWN	m	The Kansas court denied their appeal.  It came over the wire on Friday. You  need to talk to Perry now. He'll be  dead by September. I'm sorry, I know  how much you've come to care about  him.
SHAWN	m	Truman?
TRUMAN	m	Right. Yes. Right.
SHAWN	m	I want to set up a reading for you  in the fall, in New York. We'll build  some interest, and we'll publish in  the fall.
TRUMAN	m	Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in  the house.
TRUMAN	m	Why aren't you working?
JACK	m	I knew you couldn't be depended on  to stock the kitchen.
JACK	m	What would we feed our famous guest?
TRUMAN	m	Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot.
JACK	m	Plus -- I finished my novel yesterday.
TRUMAN	m	My man, my hero, my talented... My  man...
JACK	m	You said that.
TRUMAN	m	You are the hardest worker, the most  unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes  by on her way to London to sell her  book which needs no selling, may a  little of her success rub off on  both of us.
JACK	m	Here, here!
NELLE	f	When was the last time you wrote  back to him?
TRUMAN	m	I don't know.
JACK	m	What's this?
NELLE	f	A letter for your boyfriend I was  asked to deliver.
TRUMAN	m	From Perry.
JACK	m	Let's have it.
NELLE	f	"Dear Friend Truman. Where are you?  Read this item in a medical  dictionary: "Death by hanging is  caused by asphyxia, by fracture of  the cervical vertebrae, by laceration  of the trachea." Not too comforting  as we lost our appeal. Missing you --  alone and desirous of your presence.  Your amigo, Perry."
TRUMAN	m	Mr. Shawn told me about the court  decision yesterday.
JACK	m	I was wondering why you were in such  a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's  not because I finished my little  book.
TRUMAN	m	That's a terrible thing to say.
TRUMAN	m	I used to write him all the time.  I've been so focused lately on the  book.
TRUMAN	m	Jack says I'm using Perry, but he  also thinks I fell in love with him  when I was in Kansas. How both of  those things can be true is beyond  me.
NELLE	f	Did you? Fall in love with him.
NELLE	f	Truman? --
TRUMAN	m	I don't know how to answer that...  It's as if Perry and I started life  in the same house. One day he stood  up and walked out the back door while  I walked out the front. With some  different choices, he's the man I  might have become.
NELLE	f	Are you kidding me?
NELLE	f	Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think  he's what I like about you best.
TRUMAN	m	I'll see you at the reading in New  York.
NELLE	f	The sixteenth.
NELLE	f	Truman. Honestly. Are you going back  to Kansas because you care about  Perry or because you need information  before he's killed?
TRUMAN	m	Can't it be both?
NELLE	f	No. I don't think it can be.
HICKOCK	m	Hey, buddy. Thanks.
PERRY	m	What was he in jail for?
TRUMAN	m	They said it was not paying his taxes.  But really for being an outsider --  refusing to go along.
TRUMAN	m	You don't have to read any of these  if you don't want to. But I thought  you'd like something decent. You're  much too smart for adventure  magazines.
ROW GUARD	m	Lock-down while Lowell goes to  solitary. Nobody in or out. You want in or out?
TRUMAN	m	In.
PERRY	m	Everyone says he's a genius. I don't  think he's a genius. He's rich and  he went to college -- like any of us  would've if we got the chance. He  came home for Christmas and shot his  parents --
TRUMAN	m	-- in front of the television.
PERRY	m	You remember the story --
TRUMAN	m	They were watching Father Knows Best.
PERRY	m	I won't be sorry to see him go. Always  correcting my grammar.
PERRY	m	Now -- Dick and me -- we're next in  line.
TRUMAN	m	I'm so sorry I've been away.
PERRY	m	It was a long time.
TRUMAN	m	I know.
PERRY	m	I wish you could come next week,  when they take him out to the Corner,  but the whole prison shuts down.
TRUMAN	m	I have to be in New York anyway.
PERRY	m	How's the book going?
TRUMAN	m	Very slowly.
PERRY	m	Will you show it to me?
TRUMAN	m	I've hardly written anything.
GUARD #1	m	Ready.
HICKOCK	m	Keep your head high, buddy.
ANDREWS	m	Alright now.
HICKOCK	m	...or they won't be able to rope you  under your fat fucking chin.
ANDREWS	m	Next!
BEN BARON	m	Hello Hollywood. That's quite a bundle  you sold your book for.
NELLE	f	Well...
NELLE	f	What a gentleman.
YOUNG ASSISTANT	m	Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything?
TRUMAN	m	No. Thank you.
SHAWN	m	Welcome New Yorkers...
SHAWN	m	Thank you for coming to the first  public reading, the first offering  of any kind, of Truman Capote's new  work "In Cold Blood." Our magazine --
TRUMAN	m	Hello. My name is Truman Capote.
TRUMAN	m	Perry Smith's voice was both gentle  and prim -- a voice that, though  soft, manufactured each sound exactly --  ejected it like a smoke ring issuing  from a parson's mouth.
TRUMAN	m	The village of Holcomb stands on the  high wheat plains of western Kansas,  a lonesome area that other Kansans  call "out there." Until one morning  in mid-November 1959, few Americans --  in fact, few Kansans -- had ever  heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of  the [Arkansas] river, like the  motorists on the highway...  exceptional happenings had never  stopped there.
TRUMAN	m	The four coffins, which quite filled  the small, flower-crowded parlor,  were to be sealed at the funeral  services -- very understandably, for  the effect... was disquieting. Nancy  wore her dress of cherry-red velvet,  her brother a bright plaid shirt;  the parents were more sedately  attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue  flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe;  and -- and it was this especially  that lent the scene an awful aura --  the head of each was completely  encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon  twice the size of an ordinary blown- up balloon, and the cotton, because  it had been sprayed with a glossy  substance, twinkled like Christmas- tree snow.
TRUMAN	m	Imagination, of course, can open any  door -- turn the key and let terror  walk right in. [One] Tuesday, at  dawn, a carload of... strangers,  ignorant of the local disaster --  were startled by what they saw as  they crossed the prairies and passed  through Holcomb: windows ablaze,  almost every window in almost every  house, and, in the brightly lit rooms,  fully clothed people, even entire  families, who had sat the whole night  wide awake, watchful, listening. Of  what were they frightened? "It might  happen again."
LITERARY ENTHUSIAST	m	Your portrait of those men was  terrifying. Terrifying.
TRUMAN	m	Thank you.
ISHERWOOD	m	Your hairpiece is terrifying.
TRUMAN	m	I was going to say the same thing!
SHAWN	m	Everyone was there.
TRUMAN	m	Tennessee loved it.
SHAWN	m	Of course he did.
TRUMAN	m	Should we do more? I was terrified,  but --
SHAWN	m	No, Now we get to withhold while  everyone else talks. Let them do the  work.
SHAWN	m	This book is going to change  everything. It'll change how people  see you as a writer. It'll change  how people write. You'll finish by  October?
TRUMAN	m	I think so. You know they're scheduled  for next month?
SHAWN	m	Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many  issues as it takes to publish. Three.  As many as it takes.
TRUMAN	m	I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll  get Perry to talk --
SHAWN	m	Honestly, what's he got to lose?
TRUMAN	m	It really is too awful.  Institutionalized sadism.
SHAWN	m	You'll be able to finish now.
TRUMAN	m	As strange as it may sound to you,  I'm going to miss him.
TRUMAN	m	When did you hear?
PERRY	m	Two days ago.
PERRY	m	It's what we've been waiting for. A  stay of execution to make a federal  appeal.
PERRY	m	All thanks to you.
PERRY	m	Kansas's had it in for me for ten  years -- in prison the first time,  at that trial, here. They can't corner  me now. Not till the U.S. Government  says so --
TRUMAN	m	Perry, sit down. For a minute. I need you to talk to me...
PERRY	m	We've got all the time in the world  to talk. About everything. I've been  thinking about Ricardo. You need to  stop sending him those trashy books.  I won't even mention the pornography. I realize he might have trouble  grasping the literature you gave me,  but those books only exacerbate the  problem -- only 'heighten' or  'intensify' it. Maybe we should start  him on a program...
TRUMAN	m	Perry.
PERRY	m	Give him the simple novels first --
TRUMAN	m	Perry.
TRUMAN	m	I know what exacerbate means.
PERRY	m	Okay. I thought in case...
TRUMAN	m	There is not a word, or a sentence,  or a concept, that you can illuminate  for me. There is one singular reason  that I keep coming here --
PERRY	m	Truman --
TRUMAN	m	...November 14th, 1959. Three years  ago. Three years. That's all I want  to hear from you.
PERRY	m	I've asked you not to --
TRUMAN	m	This is ridiculous. I'm ready. I have a plane to catch. I found  your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll  talk to me about something useful.
PERRY	m	Don't go out there.
PERRY	m	Please don't go out there.
TRUMAN	m	This is my work, Perry. I'm working.  When you want to tell me what I need  to hear, you let me know.
MRS. MURCHAK	f	They'll play outside a while longer.
MRS. MURCHAK	f	I don't want them to see that.
TRUMAN	m	They've never seen these pictures?
MRS. MURCHAK	f	Too many questions.
MRS. MURCHAK	f	June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now  Perry's did what he did. I suppose  I'm next. Some ruination will visit  me.
TRUMAN	m	I don't think life works that way.
MRS. MURCHAK	f	It does in this family.
MRS. MURCHAK	f	I used to love him. He was my little  doll.
MRS. MURCHAK	f	He scares me now.
TRUMAN	m	When was the last time you saw him?
MRS. MURCHAK	f	Ten years.
TRUMAN	m	Do you think I could borrow one of  those pictures?
MRS. MURCHAK	f	Take the whole thing. I don't want'em  anymore. Just... Perry doesn't know where I  live. He thinks we're still in  Portland. Please don't tell him we're  not.
TRUMAN	m	Alright.
MRS. MURCHAK	f	Don't be taken in by my brother.  He's got this sensitive side he'll  show. You believe he's gentle, so  easily hurt. But he'd just as soon  kill you as shake your hand. I believe  that.
TRUMAN	m	Hello handsome.
ROW GUARD	m	You want to go in?
TRUMAN	m	Yes
PERRY	m	What's the name of your book?
PERRY	m	What's the name of your book?
TRUMAN	m	I don't...
PERRY	m	What's the name of your book?
TRUMAN	m	I don't know what you're talking  about.
PERRY	m	"Truman Capote read last night before  a packed audience from his non-fiction  book IN COLD BLOOD."
PERRY	m	More? "The true-crime novel tells of killers  Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, who  brutally murdered a Kansas family  three years ago."
TRUMAN	m	Who sent that to you?
TRUMAN	m	Who sent that to you?
PERRY	m	That's not your goddamn business.
TRUMAN	m	It is my business, because it's not  true. The organizers of the reading  needed a title. They picked one -- a  sensational one, I admit -- to attract  a crowd.
PERRY	m	They picked it.
TRUMAN	m	Yes.
PERRY	m	That's not your title.
TRUMAN	m	I haven't chosen one yet.
TRUMAN	m	How could I choose --
PERRY	m	You pretend to be my friend...
TRUMAN	m	How could I choose a title when you  still haven't told me what happened  that night? How could I? I couldn't  possibly.
TRUMAN	m	I have something from your sister.
TRUMAN	m	She misses you.
TRUMAN	m	It's alright. I'll go in.
TRUMAN	m	I'm sorry. I should have told you  what they made me call the book. I couldn't pretend to be your friend.  The truth is, I can't help wanting  to be. You don't have to tell me anything  if you don't want to.
PERRY	m	Look at my belly.
PERRY	m	There must be something wrong with  us. To do what we did.
PERRY	m	We heard there was ten thousand  dollars in that house. Once we'd  tied up everybody and searched all  over, I knew the guy who told us  about it was wrong. There wasn't any  money. But Dick wouldn't believe it.  He went tearing through the house  again, banging on the walls, looking  for a safe. He said when he was done,  he was going to come up to Nancy's  room and have his way with her. I  wouldn't allow it. I told him that.  I sat with Nancy.
PERRY	m	It was nice in there.
PERRY	m	Dick came to get me and we turned  out the lights and went down to the  basement, where we had Mr. Clutter  and the boy. Dick kept saying "No  witnesses." I figured if I just waited  him out he'd give up and leave them  tied up there. We'd drive all night,  they'd never find us. Mr. Clutter's  wrists were tied to a pipe over his  head. He looked like he was hurt, so  I cut him down.
PERRY	m	We put a box there on the floor so  he'd be more comfortable. He asked  if his wife and daughter were alright  and I said they were fine, they were  ready to go to sleep. I told him it  wasn't long till morning when somebody  would find them. He was looking at me. Just... looking  at me. Looking at my eyes. Like he  expects me to kill him -- expects me  to be the kind of person who would  kill him. I was thinking -- this  nice man, he's scared of me. I was  ashamed. I mean, I thought he was a  kind man, a good... a gentleman. I  thought so right up to the moment I  cut his throat. I didn't realize  what I'd did till I heard the sound.
PERRY	m	Like some one drowning under water.
PERRY	m	I was staring at him, bleeding on  the floor. I told Dick to finish him  off, but he wouldn't do it. We  couldn't leave Mr. Clutter like that,  so I got the shotgun.
PERRY	m	We went to Mrs. Clutter's room.
PERRY	m	Then we drove off.
PERRY	m	What do you think of me now?
TRUMAN	m	Added up, how much money did you get  from the Clutters?
PERRY	m	Between forty and fifty dollars.
TRUMAN	m	Jack.
TRUMAN	m	Jack.
TRUMAN	m	...I want to give it to you. The  truth is, I'm desperate to be done  with it...
TRUMAN	m	Mr. Shawn, I... I've spent four years  of my life on this book... They got  a stay of execution yesterday...  Another, yes....
TRUMAN	m	Supreme Court....
TRUMAN	m	...It's harrowing -- all I want is  to write the ending and there's no  fucking end in sight... No. No, I  haven't been drinking again...
JACK	m	I don't know how you can eat that.  Perhaps if you weren't drinking so  much you wouldn't have to.
JACK	m	"Dear friend Truman. Haven't heard  from you in such a long while. Please  help find new lawyer. If not, Dick  will have to write Supreme Court  brief himself. Our last appeal. What  a pair of wretched creatures. Please  help. Your amigo? Perry."
JACK	m	Your amigo.
TRUMAN	m	Put it with the others.
JACK	m	You tried?
JACK	m	You need to get ready.
JACK	m	At least pretend for Nelle that you're  having a good time tonight.
TRUMAN	m	Nelle.
NELLE	f	I thought I'd find you here.
TRUMAN	m	Please, another.
NELLE	f	How are you?
TRUMAN	m	Terrible.
NELLE	f	I'm sorry to hear that.
TRUMAN	m	Well. It's torture. Torture... ...what they're doing to me.
NELLE	f	Uh-huh.
TRUMAN	m	Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe  it? If they win this appeal I will  have a complete nervous breakdown. I  may never recover. Just pray things  turn my way.
NELLE	f	It must be hard.
TRUMAN	m	It's torture. They're torturing me.
NELLE	f	I see.
NELLE	f	And how'd you like the movie, Truman.
TRUMAN	m	I frankly don't know what the fuss  is about.
TRUMAN	m	Hello.
OPERATOR	m	Mr. Capote?
TRUMAN	m	Yes?
OPERATOR	m	I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith  in the Kansas Correctional System.  Will you accept charges?
OPERATOR	m	Mr. Truman Capote?
TRUMAN	m	Yes.
OPERATOR	m	Will you accept charges?
TRUMAN	m	Oh. Uh... Yes.
OPERATOR	m	You'll accept charges?
TRUMAN	m	Yes.
OPERATOR	m	Mr. Smith, you're on the line.
PERRY	m	Hello.
PERRY	m	Hello? I can't -- This doesn't seem -- Operator, I don't think you put me --
TRUMAN	m	I'm here.
PERRY	m	Truman.
TRUMAN	m	Hello, Perry.
PERRY	m	They let me make a couple phone calls  before I go down to Holding... You  heard the Supreme Court rejected the  appeal.
TRUMAN	m	I didn't... I hadn't heard that.
PERRY	m	Yeah.
TRUMAN	m	I'm sorry.
PERRY	m	Yeah. They let me make two phone  calls.
PERRY	m	We've got a date set for the  Warehouse, Dick and me. Two weeks  and... Finito. April 14.
PERRY	m	Will you visit me? Truman. Will you  come visit?
TRUMAN	m	I don't know if I can. I'll try. I don't know if I can.
GUARD IN BACKGROUND	m	Time, Smith. Hang it up.
PERRY	m	Please visit me, Truman. Just...
GUARD IN BACKGROUND	m	Time. Smith.
GUARD	m	Ready.
KRUTCH	m	Perry.
KRUTCH	m	You're allowed three names of people  you'd like to witness tomorrow. If  there's anybody you want, tell me  now.
PERRY	m	Truman Capote.
KRUTCH	m	Anybody else?
SHAWN	m	You want anything?
PERRY	m	Thank you. You sent the telegram to his hotel?
GUARD	m	Hours ago.
PERRY	m	May I make a phone call?
SHAWN	m	That's him again.
SHAWN	m	We've never even met. It is utterly  inappropriate for me to be talking  to him.
SHAWN	m	Yes... I'm sorry, he's out, gone  out... I'm not sure when...
KRUTCH	m	You got a telex.
KRUTCH	m	"Perry. Unable to visit today because  not permitted. Always your friend,  Truman." That's it.
PERRY	m	It's not true, is it?
NELLE	f	Mr. Shawn? It's Nelle... I just got  this telegram, has he seen it?
SHAWN	m	He won't look at it.
NELLE	f	Would you put him on please?
SHAWN	m	He won't talk.
NELLE	f	Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him  down and put the phone on his ear, I  need to speak to him.
SHAWN	m	It's Nelle.
NELLE	f	Truman.
PERRY	m	"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman  Capote: Sorry that Truman was unable  to make it here at the prison for a  brief word prior to necktie party...
PERRY	m	...Whatever his reason for not showing  up, I want him to know that I cannot  condemn him for it and understand...
PERRY	m	...Not much time left but want you  both to know that I've been sincerely  grateful for your friendship through  the years and everything else...
PERRY	m	...I'm not very good at these  things....
PERRY	m	I have become extremely affectionate  toward you both. But, harness time.  Adios amigos. Your friend, Perry."
KRUTCH	m	I didn't think I'd be seeing you  again. You can visit for a few minutes.
SHAWN	m	No.
TRUMAN	m	Come with me.
SHAWN	m	Truman. No.
KRUTCH	m	Five minutes.
HICKOCK	m	He returns. Long time.
TRUMAN	m	I don't know what you must think of  me.
HICKOCK	m	You haven't been foremost on my mind  lately. As you can imagine.
PERRY	m	You got the letter?
TRUMAN	m	Yes.
PERRY	m	It's true. I mean I understand why  you didn't want to come. I wouldn't  be here either if I didn't have to.
HICKOCK	m	You got that right.
PERRY	m	You know Ricardo donated his eyes to  science? Next week, some blind man  will be seeing what Dick used to  see.
HICKOCK	m	He'd be better off the way he was.  What I've seen hasn't been so nice  to look at -- but I guess it's better  than nothing. They came around with a form. Hey. You'll be walking down the street  one day in Denver, wherever -- and  suddenly these eyes will be staring  at you. Wouldn't that be something?
TRUMAN	m	It would be.
KRUTCH	m	Time.
PERRY	m	You'll be watching?
TRUMAN	m	I don't know. Do you want me to?
PERRY	m	I'd like to have a friend there.
TRUMAN	m	Okay. Then I will.
PERRY	m	It's alright.
TRUMAN	m	I did everything I could.
PERRY	m	Okay.
TRUMAN	m	I truly did.
PERRY	m	I know.
TRUMAN	m	Goodbye, Perry.
PERRY	m	You're not rid of me yet. I'll see  you in a few minutes.
PERRY	m	Nice to see you.
KRUTCH	m	Perry Edward Smith. "For the crime of murder in the first  degree, by order of the Court of  Finney County and the Supreme Court  of the sovereign State of Kansas,  you are sentenced to hang until you  die." You can say something if you want.
PERRY	m	Is there anybody from the family  here?
KRUTCH	m	No.
PERRY	m	Well. Tell them... I can't remember what I was going to  say for the life of me...
CHAPLAIN	m	Though I walk through the valley of  the shadow of death, I will fear no  evil, for thou art with me.
CHAPLAIN	m	Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort  me.
CHAPLAIN	m	Thou preparest a table before me in  the presence of mine enemies. Thou  annointest my head with oil.
CHAPLAIN	m	My cup runneth over.
NELLE	f	Hello.
TRUMAN	m	Someday I'll tell you about it. For  the moment, I'm too shattered.
NELLE	f	They're dead, Truman. You're alive.
TRUMAN	m	It was a terrible experience and I  will never get over it. There wasn't anything I could have  done to save them.
NELLE	f	Maybe not.
NELLE	f	But the fact is, you didn't want to.
SHAWN	m	It came to the hotel this morning. I  told them I'd give it to you.
PERRY	m	Did we not know we were to die, we  would be children. By knowing it, we  are given the opportunity to mature  in spirit...
PERRY	m	Some take that opportunity. I hope I  have...
PERRY	m	Life is only the father of wisdom.  Death is the mother.
