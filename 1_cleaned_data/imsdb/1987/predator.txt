MAN	m	He's here.
PHILIPS	m	You're looking well, Dutch.
SCHAEFER	?	It's been a long time, General.
PHILIPS	m	We've got a real problem here, something right up your alley.
PHILIPS	m	Eighteen hours ago I was informed that one of our choppers, transporting three presidential cabinet members from this charming little country, was shot down... ...The pilots radioed from the ground that they were all alive.  Their position was fixed by the transponder beacon onboard the chopper. Here.
SCHAEFER	?	That's over the border, General.
PHILIPS	m	That's the problem.  Apparently they strayed off course. We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
SCHAEFER	?	What have you got in mind, General.
PHILIPS	m	We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them.  After that, there's not much hope.  We want a rescue operation mounted tonight.  That doesn't give you much time.
SCHAEFER	?	What else it new?  When do we leave?
PHILIPS	m	You lift off in three hours. There's one other thing.
SCHAEFER	?	What's that, General?
PHILIPS	m	Someone else will be going in with you.
SCHAEFER	?	You know we don't work with outsiders, General.
VOICE	m	Who said anything about outsiders, Dutch?
DILLON	m	Last time we danced, it was Lieutenant, Schaefer.
SCHAEFER	?	Dillon, you son of a bitch.
DILLON	m	How you been, Dutch?
SCHAEFER	?	You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon.  Had enough?
DILLON	m	No way, old buddy.
SCHAEFER	?	You never did know when to quit.
DILLON	m	That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something.  Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
SCHAEFER	?	Like the old days, Dillon.
DILLON	m	Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
SCHAEFER	?	Wasn't my style.  We're a rescue unit, not assassins. This must be good.  Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
DILLON	m	Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world.  They're about to get squeezed.  We can't let that happen.  I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet...no screw-ups.  I needed the best. The best.  So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department...and here we are.
SCHAEFER	?	Go on.
DILLON	m	The set-up is simple, Dutch. One day job.  We pick up their trail at the chopper, run 'em down, grab the hostages and bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there.  You've done it a hundred times.  Nothing out of the ordinary.
SCHAEFER	?	And nothing we can't handle alone.
PHILIPS	m	I'm afraid those are your orders, Major.  Once you reach your objective, Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge.
DILLON	m	Not to worry, Dutch.  I haven't lost my edge.  They've got a head start on us in some real tough country, otherwise, believe me, it's a piece of cake.
PHILIPS	m	Gentlemen, we're losing time. You'd better get your men ready. Good luck, Major.
PILOT ONE	m	Redbird Two, Two.  Bearing south, three, five, zero, one o'ckock on the saddle ridge. Over.
PILOT TWO	m	Roger, Blue Leader.  Three, five, zero, on your move. Over.
HAWKINS	m	Hey, Billy, how many marines does it take to eat a squirrel?
HAWKINS	m	Two.  One to eat it and one to watch for cars.
RAMIREZ	m	Get that stinkin' thing out of my face, Blain!
BLAIN	m	...bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here... ...this stuff will put hair guaranteed... ...make you a God-damned sexual ty-ran-toe-sore-ass... just like me.
DILLON	m	Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed.  AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
SCHAEFER	?	Who's our back-up on this?
DILLON	m	No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
SCHAEFER	?	This gets better by the minute.
PILOT NUMBER ONE	m	...roger Bird Two, Two. Reconfirm insertion at Tango, Charlie, Delta One, zero, niner on the grid at zero, two, two, mark four by zero. Over.
PILOT NUMBER TWO	m	Two, Two, leader.  Roger your insert co-ord.  Over.
PILOT NUMBER ONE	m	Leader to Bird Two Two.  I bear two minutes to Landing Zone.
DILLON	m	Man, that's a real bad habit you've got.
PILOT NUMBER ONE	m	LZ comin' up in 30 seconds. Stand by the rappel lines.
DILLON	m	You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!!  Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
SCHAEFER	?	You never were all that smart...let's go!!!
RAMIREZ	m	The pilots have each got one round in the head.  And whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.
SCHAEFER	?	Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
RAMIREZ	m	There's something else, Major...
SCHAEFER	?	Mmmnnn...?
RAMIREZ	m	I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
RAMIREZ	m	...looks more like a surveillance bird to me.
DILLON	m	Have you picked up their trail yet?
SCHAEFER	?	Billy's on it. Heat seeker.  Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
DILLON	m	They're getting better equipped every day.
BILLY	m	Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas.  Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper. Then a different set of track, over there.
SCHAEFER	?	What do you mean?
BILLY	m	Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots.  They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
SCHAEFER	?	Mean anything to you?
DILLON	m	Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
SCHAEFER	?	Get ahead, see what you can find. Slow and easy.
SCHAEFER	?	What's he got?
RAMIREZ	m	Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper...followed by men with American equipment...
RAMIREZ	m	Holy Mother...
SCHAEFER	?	J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army...
SCHAEFER	?	Mac.  Cut them down.
SCHAEFER	?	I knew this man.  Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg.  What the hell were they doing in here?  You got any answers for this, Dillon?
DILLON	m	Jesus...this is inhuman. Uh...I wasn't told of any operations in this area.  They shouldn't have been here.
SCHAEFER	?	Well somebody sent them.
RAMIREZ	m	Must have run into the guerrillas ...Fucking animals.
MAC	m	Ain't no way for a soldier to die. Time to let 'ol 'painless' out of the bag.
SCHAEFER	?	What happened here, Billy?
BILLY	m	Strange, Major.  There was a firefight.  Shooting in all directions.
SCHAEFER	?	I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
BILLY	m	I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
SCHAEFER	?	What about the rest of Hopper's men?
BILLY	m	No sign.  They never left here Major. It's like they just disappeared.
SCHAEFER	?	Stick with the guerilla trail. Let's get it over with.  We move. Five meter spread.  No sound. Nothing.
BLAIN	m	Payback time.
MAC	m	You're ghostin' on me, mother fokaaa!...I don't care who you are back in the world... You give away our position again and I'll bleed you quiet and leave your fuckin' ass right here. Got it?
BLAIN	m	Say, Bull.  What's goin' down? We got movement?
MAC	m	No.  Shithead with his trenchcoat and dee-coda-da ring was makin' enough noise to get us all waxed.  I don't like that guy.  Don't like him at my back.  I ain't winding up like those bastards back there.
BLAIN	m	I know what you mean, Bull, but don't sweat it, me and 'ol 'painless' here are watchin' the front door.
MAC	m	As always, bro...
SCHAEFER	?	Just killed one of the  prisoners.  No time for invitations.  We take them, now.
DILLON	m	Ready, kid?
DILLON	m	On your nine!!!
SCHAEFER	?	Stick around.
SCHAEFER	?	Down!!!
SCHAEFER	?	Hawk, Get Con. Op. on the hook!  Position and situation, now!
HAWKINS	m	You got it, Major!
SCHAEFER	?	Any sign of the hostages?
MAC	m	We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman.  By* the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA. Another thing, Major, we were lucky...couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it.  Something big was about to happen here.
SCHAEFER	?	Good work, Mac.  Clear the area, no traces.  Get the men ready to move.
SCHAEFER	?	Shit...
RAMIREZ	m	You're hit.  You're bleedin', man.
BLAIN	m	Ain't got time to bleed.
BLAIN	m	Son of a bitch's dug in like a Alabama tick... ...jack us around all day.
RAMIREZ	m	Hell, dude, we don't have all day.
BLAIN	m	Shit, Pancho!!!
RAMIREZ	m	What's your problem, dude?
DILLON	m	This is beautiful!  More than we ever thought.  We got the bastards!
SCHAEFER	?	I think this is the one you want.
DILLON	m	Two days...that's all we had. In two days, three hundred of these bastards would have been equipped with all this.  After they crossed the border, it would have taken a year to stop them. We've averted a major guerrilla invasion, Dutch...
SCHAEFER	?	It was all bullshit.  All of it. From the start...you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
DILLON	m	That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
SCHAEFER	?	Why us?
DILLON	m	Because I told you, you're the best.  I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
SCHAEFER	?	What story did you give to Davis?
DILLON	m	We've been lookin' for this place for months.  The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down.  Hopper* was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up,  I had to stop there bastards.  We were so close, we couldn't quit.  We couldn't sleep through this one.  I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
DILLON	m	To invade a foreign country, illegally?  You lied, Dillon. Stacked the odds against us.  Set us up.  You could have gotten us all killed. You used to be one of us, Dillon, someone I could trust with my life...
DILLON	m	We've been through a lot together Dutch.  When we were together, no* one could stop us, the hottest* Goddamned team the army ever saw.* But things changed, I woke up. We're fighting them in a dozen Goddamned countries.  It's a fight we can't lose, Dutch.  We're all expendable assets, can't you see that?
SCHAEFER	?	That's your problem, Dillon. You always did put ambition before the lives of your men. My men are not expendable.  I don't do this kind of work. This is your dirty little war, not mine.
HAWKINS	m	Major!
DILLON	m	Are you all right?
HAWKINS	m	Major, we stepped into some real shit here.  I got a hook-up with aerial surveillance.
SCHAEFER	?	Movement?
HAWKINS	m	Guerrillas swarming like flies* all over the place.  Can't be more  then one, maybe two miles away.  Place is going down, Major.
SCHAEFER	?	How much time?
HAWKINS	m	Half an hour, maybe less.
SCHAEFER	?	Tell Mac we move in five.
DILLON	m	She goes with us.
DILLON	m	She's too valuable.  She's got to know their whole network.  The whole set up. We take her with us.SCHAEFER We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets.  No prisoners, Dillon.
DILLON	m	You're still under orders, Dutch.  You want to make the call, or should I?
SCHAEFER	?	I'm getting my men out of this damn jungle, Dillon.  She's your baggage.  You fall behind, you're on your own.
SCHAEFER	?	This place is too hot for a pick-up. They won't touch us until we're over the border.  We can lift at LZ 49, here. Spotter plane says we're cut off. Except for this valley.
BILLY	m	Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be a real bitch. If we follow above the river and then down, here, at this canyon, we might find a way out.
SCHAEFER	?	Not much choice.  Pancho, take the lead.  Double time it.
SCHAEFER	?	Lock n' load, watch your ass.
ANNA	f	You touch me again, pig, and I will cut off your balls!
DILLON	m	It's a long walk back, make it easy on yourself.
MAC	m	Hey, Dillon, over here.
MAC	m	Dillon, over here.
DILLON	m	Yeah, what is it, Sergeant?
ANNA	f	When my people catch you, you'll wish you were him.
DILLON	m	Thanks.
MAC	m	Anytime.
HUNTER	m	Dillon, over here.
HUNTER	m	Dillon, over here.
HUNTER	m	Dillon, over here.
MAC	m	I've seen some badass bush before, but nothin' like this, man. Little taste 'o home?
BLAIN	m	I hear you bro, this is some shit.  Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.  Lose your way in here, man, you be in some kinda hurt.
DILLON	m	Shit.  Come on...
RAMIREZ	m	Don't try it.
RAMIREZ	m	You should put her on a leash, Agent Man.  If you can't handle her, just say the word.
DILLON	m	Try that again.  Please.*
DILLON	m	Watch her.
SCHAEFER	?	What's got Billy so spooked?
MAC	m	Can't say, Major...been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird...sometimes I think that nose of his is too good...smells things that ain't there.
SCHAEFER	?	What is it...?
SCHAEFER	?	Billy...What the hell's wrong with you?
BILLY	m	Something...in the trees...
BILLY	m	Can you see anything... ...there?
SCHAEFER	?	It's...nothing...
SCHAEFER	?	What do you think...?
BILLY	m	It's nothing...
HAWKINS	m	Please...
ANNA	f	Look out, behind you!!!
SCHAEFER	?	It's not her blood.
RAMIREZ	m	Major, you'd better take a look at this.
SCHAEFER	?	Hawkins?
RAMIREZ	m	I can't tell.
SCHAEFER	?	What in God's name...?
RAMIREZ	m	I think it's Hawkins.
SCHAEFER	?	Where the hell is his body?
RAMIREZ	m	There's no sign of it.
SCHAEFER	?	Ramirez, ask her what happened.
RAMIREZ	m	She says...the jungle came alive, and took him...
DILLON	m	That isn't what she said... she said... ...she doesn't make sense.
RAMIREZ	m	Couple of sappers been trailing us all the way from the camp, Major.  Billy heard them.  She set us up, ran for it...They were waiting. I should've wasted the bitch when I had the chance.
SCHAEFER	?	Why didn't they take the radio and his weapon? Why didn't she escape?
DILLON	m	They did the same thing to Davis...
SCHAEFER	?	I want him found.  Sweep pattern and double back.  Fifty meters.
BLAIN	m	Come on in you fuckers...come on in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'...
 MAC	m	Contact, 30 Right!!!
MAC	m	I...saw it.
SCHAEFER	?	You saw what?
 MAC	m	I saw it.
SCHAEFER	?	Blain... ...Just like the others...no powder burns, no shrapnel.
DILLON	m	The wound all fused, cauterized...what the hell did this?
SCHAEFER	?	...Mac!
SCHAEFER	?	Mac, who did this?
MAC	m	I don't know.  Goddamn it, something...I saw something/.
RAMIREZ	m	Nothing.  The same thing. Not a fucking trace.  No bodies, blood, anything.
SCHAEFER	?	We're losing the light.  Mac, I want a defensive position above this ridge, mined with everything we're got.
MAC	m	Yessir.
SCHAEFER	?	Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
MAC	m	I'll take him.
MAC	m	We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside.  Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
SCHAEFER	?	Thank you, Sergeant.
SCHAEFER	?	I'm sorry, Bull.  It's never easy.  He was a good soldier.
MAC	m	The best friend I ever had.
MAC	m	Good-bye, Bro.
DILLON	m	Blazer One, say again...
BLAZER ONE	m	Red Fox, I say again.  Your request for extraction denied. Your area still compromised. Proceed to Sector 3000 for prisoner extraction, Priority Alpha.  Next contact at 1030 hours.
DILLON	m	Roger, Blazer One.  1030 hours...damn, bastards.
DILLON	m	We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
SCHAEFER	?	Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
DILLON	m	I can accept that, it comes with the job.
SCHAEFER	?	Bullshit.  You're just like the rest of us.
RAMIREZ	m	Shit load o' good a chopper'd do us in here anyway.
DILLON	m	Mac.  Who hit us today?
MAC	m	Don't know, only saw one of 'em.  Camouflaged.  He was there... ...Those fucking eyes...
DILLON	m	What, Sergeant?
MAC	m	Those eyes...disappeared.  But I know one thing, Major... ...I drew down and fired right at it.  Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'...nothin' on this earth could have lived...not at that range.
MAC	m	I've got the first watch.
DILLON	m	Ask her again.  What did she see?  What happened to Hawkins?
RAMIREZ	m	She says the same thing... It was the jungle...
RAMIREZ	m	You know something Billy, what is it?
BILLY	m	I'm scared.
RAMIREZ	m	Bullshit.  You ain't afraid of no man.
BILLY	m	There's something out there, waiting for us...it ain't no man.
DILLON	m	He's losing his cool.  There's nothing out there but a couple of men that we're going to have to take down.
SCHAEFER	?	You still don't get it, do you Dillon?  He took Davis... and now he wants us.
MAC	m	It's the same kinda jungle, Bro, same moon... everything... ...a real number ten night. Remember Bro?  Only you and me, the only one's out of the whole fuckin' platoon who made it out.
MAC	m	...we walked out on top of 'em.  Not a scratch, not a fuckin' scratch. No fuckin' chili-choker got to you, Bro...you were just too good...
MAC	m	...I promise you this, Bro... whoever he is, I hope he's plannin' to hit us again... ...'cause he's got my name on 'em.
MAC	m	Got the motherfucker...
MAC	m	A pig...just a fucking pig...
RAMIREZ	m	Holy shit, Mac.
SCHAEFER	?	Get a field dressing on that right away.
SCHAEFER	?	Where's the girl?
BILLY	m	Major, over here.
BILLY	m	The body...it's gone.
RAMIREZ	m	Came in through the trip wires, took it right out from under our noses...
BILLY	m	Boar set off the trip flare, Major.  No other tracks.
RAMIREZ	m	How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right  under our noses without leavin'  a trace?
SCHAEFER	?	He knows our defenses.
RAMIREZ	m	Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
SCHAEFER	?	He came back for the body. He's killing us, one at a time...
BILLY	m	Like a Hunter.*
SCHAEFER	?	He uses the trees.  SCHAEFER Yesterday.  What did you see?
DILLON	m	You're wastin' your time.
SCHAEFER	?	No more games.
ANNA	f	I don't know what it was. It...
SCHAEFER	?	Go on.
ANNA	f	It changes colors, like the chameleon.  It uses the jungle...
DILLON	m	Shit, you trying to tell me Blain and Hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard?  Don't listen to her.  Its's a psych-job. Two, maybe three of them, that's all.  We keep our cool, out-think* them 'til we're across the border...
SCHAEFER	?	What's you name?
ANNA	f	Anna.
SCHAEFER	?	Anna.  He's hunting us.  You know that?
DILLON	m	What the hell do you think you're doing?
SCHAEFER	?	We're going to need everyone.
DILLON	m	What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten*  minutes.*
SCHAEFER	?	We're not going. DILLON That rendezvous is ten maybe  twelve miles, at most!  We're almost home.  But the chopper won't wait.
SCHAEFER	?	Dillon...This thing doesn't* care who we are, who she is. We make a stand or there won't* be anyone left to make that* chopper.
ANNA	f	There is something else.  When the big man was killed, you must have wounded it. It's blood was on the leaves.
SCHAEFER	?	If it bleeds, we can kill it.
DILLON	m	I'm tellin' you, this little  'boy scout' stunt is a  Godamned waste of time. We've got to get the hell out of here, now, while we've still  got the chance.
SCHAEFER	?	He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
DILLON	m	Now what, Dutch.  You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
SCHAEFER	?	You're catching on, Dillon.
 ANNA	f	When I was little we find a man -- -- like a butcher.  The old ones in the village cross themselves and whisper crazy things.  'Demonio, cazador de trofoes...Only the hottest times of the hottest years...'  Crazy things...This year is grows hot.  And we begin finding our men.  We find them sometimes without their skin. Sometimes...much, much worse.  Cazador de trofoes...means the demon who takes trophies.
DILLON	m	What'll you try next -- cheese?
DILLON	m	Satisfied?  Now let's get the hell out...
DILLON	m	What is God's name...?
SCHAEFER	?	Mac!
SCHAEFER	?	Get Ramirez on his feet!  Take the girl and get the hell out of here!
DILLON	m	No way, Dutch.  I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
SCHAEFER	?	This isn't your style, Dillon.
DILLON	m	Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch.  Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right.  Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
SCHAEFER	?	You know you can't win this one.
DILLON	m	You know me, Dutch, I never did know when to quit.
SCHAEFER	?	Dillon!
SCHAEFER	?	I'll see you there.
DILLON	m	Right behind you.
BILLY	m	He's busted up, bad, Major.
RAMIREZ	m	I can make it, Major.
SCHAEFER	?	Come on, Poncho, we're getting out of here. Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.  Come on!
MAC	m	Come on, you motherfucker!
VOICE	m	Dillon, over here.
VOICE	m	Dillon, over here.
DILLON	m	Mac?
MAC	m	Out there.  Past the rocks... can you see it?
DILLON	m	I see it! We're gonna take this thing.
DILLON	m	Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
MAC	m	...Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
DILLON	m	We both got scores to settle.
DILLON	m	Mac...Mac.
SCHAEFER	?	Billy!!!
SCHAEFER	?	Billy!!!
SCHAEFER	?	Get back, into the rocks!
SCHAEFER	?	Run!  Get to the chopper!
SCHAEFER	?	You couldn't see me.
SCHAEFER	?	One chance, that's all.
ANNA'S VOICE	m	Look out, behind you!!!
ANNA'S VOICE	m	...Look out, behind you!
SCHAEFER	?	Anna...?
SCHAEFER	?	Anna...?
HUNTER	m	Dillon, over here...
SCHAEFER	?	Bleed, you bastard.
SCHAEFER	?	Who the hell are you...?
HUNTER	m	Who... ...the hell... ...are... ...You?
PILOT	m	Holy, fuck, what was that...?!!!
PHILIPS	m	Orbit right...check it out!
ANNA	f	NOOOOOO!!!!!!
MEDIC	m	Looks like he's been through hell...can't believe he's still alive.  What the hell went on down there?
PHILIPS	m	If it hadn't been for her, he'd be dead now.  That story she told us...I still can't believe it.
