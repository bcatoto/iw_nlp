ZITO'S VOICE	m	Three times they cancel the order  with me, and three times they come  back. Who they kidding? They cheap,  cheap, cheap. The other bread they  get is no good. They save pennies.  Everybody complain and they come  back. "Zito, your bread is the best."  They're like children stupid in school  who cannot learn. The water. It's  the water. You buy bread in Hoboken,  you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water  is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask  your father. He knows.
ZITO	m	You want me to make you some coffee?
LORETTA	f	What d'you know about coffee? Gimme  a loaf of bread.
OLD WOMAN	f	He looks great.
RUBY	f	That Al Conti is a genius.
CONTI'S VOICE	m	I am a genius.
LORETTA'S VOICE	m	If you're such an artistic genius,  why can't you keep track of your  receipts? How am I going to do your  income tax?
CONTI'S VOICE	m	I am an artistic genius.
LORETTA	f	If you're an artistic genius, how  come you got butter on your tie?
LORETTA	f	Give it here. I'll give you this,  Al, you make good coffee.
FLORIST'S VOICE	m	Red roses. Very romantic. The man  who sends these knows what he's doing.
LORETTA	f	The man who sends those spends a lot  of money on something that ends up  in the garbage can.
FLORIST	m	I'm glad everybody ain't like you,  Loretta. I'd be outta business.
LORETTA	f	Without me, you'd be out of business.  I like flowers.
BOBO	m	Are you ready?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
BOBO	m	Very good, Mr. Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY	m	We will both have the Salad Ticino.
BOBO	m	Uh-huh
MR. JOHNNY	m	And I'll have the special fish.
LORETTA	f	You don't want the fish.
MR. JOHNNY	m	No?
LORETTA	f	It's the oily fish tonight. Not before  the plane ride.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Maybe you're right.
LORETTA	f	Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me,  too.
BOBO	m	Yes, Miss Loretta.
LORETTA	f	That will give you a base. For your  stomach. You eat that oily fish, you  go up in the air, halfway to Sicily  you'll be green and your hands will  be sweating.
MR. JOHNNY	m	You look after me.
PERRY	m	Patricia, please don't go!
PATRICIA	f	What do you think I am, a talking  dog?
PERRY	m	I was just making a point about the  way you said... the way you stated  your aspirations.
PATRICIA	f	You can kiss my aspirations!  Professor!
PERRY	m	Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever.  The height of cleverness. Waiter!
SHY WAITER	m	Yes?
PERRY	m	Could you do away with her dinner,  and any evidence of her, and bring  me an big glass of vodka?
SHY WAITER	m	But absolutely!
MR. JOHNNY	m	A man who can't control his woman is  funny.
LORETTA	f	She was too young for him.
EDDIE	m	What'samatter, Uncle Bobo?
BOBO	m	Tonight Mr. Johnny's gonna propose  marriage.
EDDIE	m	How you know that?
BOBO	m	He arranged it with me. When he asks  her, then he'll wave to me and I'll  bring champagne. Good bachelor  customer for twenty years. But who  knows? Maybe he'll lose courage.
EDDIE	m	Heavy duty stuff.
PERRY	m	Can I get another one of these?
SHY WAITER	m	Definitely!
PERRY	m	May I presume to ask you a question?
SHY WAITER	m	Sure!
PERRY	m	Do you have a girlfriend?
SHY WAITER	m	I am alone in the world.
PERRY	m	That's very sad.
BOBO	m	How's things?
LORETTA	f	Fine, Bobo. We'll take the check.
MR. JOHNNY	m	No, I want to see the dessert cart.
BOBO	m	Very good.
LORETTA	f	You never have dessert.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Never is a long time.
LORETTA	f	What's the matter?
MR. JOHNNY	m	My scalp is not getting enough blood  sometimes.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Have Something.
LORETTA	f	I shouldn't.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Will you marry me?
LORETTA	f	What?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Will you marry me?
LORETTA	f	Bobo, take the cart away.
LORETTA	f	Are you proposing marriage to me?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Yes?
LORETTA	f	You know I was married and that my  husband died. But what you don't  know is I think he and I had Bad  Luck.
MR. JOHNNY	m	What do you mean?
LORETTA	f	We got married at the City Hall and  I think it gave bad luck the whole  marriage.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I don't understand.
LORETTA	f	Right from the start we didn't do it  right. Could you kneel down?
MR. JOHNNY	m	On the floor?
LORETTA	f	Yes, on the floor.
MR. JOHNNY	m	This is a good suit.
LORETTA	f	I helped you buy it. It came with  two pairs of pants. It's for luck,  Johnny. When you propose marriage to  a woman, you should kneel down.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Alright.
PERRY	m	Is that man praying?
JOHNNY	m	So. Will you ma...
LORETTA	f	Where's the ring?
MR. JOHNNY	m	The ring?
BOB	m	A ring. That's right.
MOOK	f	I woulda sprung for a ring if it was  me.
BOBO	m	She's got him on his knees. He's  ruining his suit.
LORETTA	f	You could use your pinky ring.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I like this ring.
LORETTA	f	You propose to a woman you should  offer her a ring of engagement.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Loretta. Loretta Castorini Clark. On  my knees. In front of all these  people. Will you marry me?
LORETTA	f	Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony  Cammareri. I will marry you. I will  be your wife.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Bobo! The check!
PERRY	m	I feel like I have just witnessed a  car accident.
SHY WAITER	m	When I was twenty-seven years old,  in Jersey City, I asked a woman to  marry me. She had red hair. She  smelled a jasmine. She wore black  shoes with pointy white tips.
PERRY	m	What happened?
SHY WAITER	m	She didn't hear me. She asked me to  repeat, so she could understand what  I said. But I wouldn't repeat it.  Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
LORETTA	f	What time is it?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Seven-thirty.
LORETTA	f	So we'll pick up the car, we'll make  the plane in plenty of time.
MR. JOHNNY	m	My mother will be happy I'm getting  married.
BOBO	m	I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr.  Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I forgot to wave. We'll have it at  the wedding.
LORETTA	f	What about the wedding?
MR. JOHNNY	m	My mother is dying. When she is dead,  I'll come back and we'll be married.
LORETTA	f	How near is she to death?
MR. JOHNNY	m	A week. Two weeks. No more.
LORETTA	f	Then let's set the date.
LORETTA	f	How about a month from today?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Must it be so definite? Can't we  just say that we will be married  when I get back?
LORETTA	f	Where? At the City Hall? No! I want  the whole wedding or we will have  Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be  planned, a date must be set.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Alright. A month. In a month.
LORETTA	f	A month from today?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Yeah.
LORETTA	f	I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll  take care of the whole thing. All  you have to do is show up.
AVA	f	Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
GREGORY	m	No, I'm going.
AVA	f	The Shawfish?
GREGORY	m	Just across the bay, at the fuel  depot. The men wanted to try to get  home. I can't explain.
AVA	f	Then, I suppose the time has come  say it's been nice Dwight Lionel.  It's been everything. Oh, Dwight,  I'm frightened.
GREGORY	m	I know, I am so sorry for so many  things. I love you, Moira. I love  you. I love you.
VOICE	m	International Flight Number Six-ohfour  boarding for Rome and Palermo at  Gate Twenty-six.
LORETTA	f	Call me when you get in.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I'll call you when I get to Mama's  house.
LORETTA	f	You've made me very happy, Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY	m	There's one thing about this wedding  I want you to do. Call this number.  It's a business number. Ask for Ronny.  Invite him to the wedding.
LORETTA	f	Who is he?
MR. JOHNNY	m	He's my younger brother.
LORETTA	f	You have a brother?
MR. JOHNNY	m	We haven't spoken in five years.  There was some bad blood. I want you  to call him and invite him to the  wedding. Will you do it?
LORETTA	f	Sure.
VOICE	m	This is the last call for  International Flight Number Six-ohfour  boarding at Gate Twenty-six for Rome  and Palermo.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I've got to go.
CRONE	m	Do you have someone on that plane?
LORETTA	f	Yeah. My fianc�.
CRONE	m	I have put a curse on that plane. My  sister is on that plane. I have put  a curse on that plane that it should  explode. Burn on fire and fall into  the sea. Fifty years ago she stole a  man from me. Today she told me that  she didn't even love him. She took  him to feel strong with me. Now she  goes back to Sicily. I have cursed  her that the green Atlantic water  should swallow her up.
LORETTA	f	I don't believe in curses.
CRONE	m	Neither do I.
ATTENDANT	?	Mr. Johnny's, right?
LORETTA	f	Right. The key's in it.
ATTENDANT	?	Good night.
LORETTA	f	Night.
LOTTE	f	I've seen how you look at her and it  isn't right.
IRV	m	How do I look at her? Can I help you?
LORETTA	f	A split of Moet.
LOTTE	f	Like a wolf.
IRV	m	Like a wolf, huh? You never seen a  wolf in your life.
IRV	m	That's seven-fifty-seven.
LOTTE	f	I seen a wolf in everybody I ever  met and I see a wolf in you.
IRV	m	That makes ten. Thanks. Have a nice  night.
LORETTA	f	You, too.
IRV	m	You know what I see in you, Lotte?
LOTTE	f	What?
IRV	m	The girl I married.
LORETTA	f	Hello, boys and girls. Guess what  happened to me?
OLD MAN'S VOICE	m	How long must I wait? Quanto tempo  devo aspettare?
COSMO	m	Hi.
LORETTA	f	Where's Ma?
COSMO	m	Bed.
LORETTA	f	You're not sleepy?
COSMO	m	I can't sleep anymore. It's too much  like death.
LORETTA	f	Pop, I got news.
COSMO	m	Alright. Let's go in the kitchen.
LORETTA	f	Here. Ti amo.
COSMO	m	Ti amo.
LORETTA	f	You look tired.
COSMO	m	What's your news?
LORETTA	f	I'm getting married.
COSMO	m	Again?
LORETTA	f	Yeah.
COSMO	m	You did this once it didn't work  out.
LORETTA	f	The guy died.
COSMO	m	What killed him?
LORETTA	f	He got hit by a bus.
COSMO	m	No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been  married fifty-two years an nobody  died. You were married, what, two  years, and somebody is dead. Don't  get married again, Loretta. It don't  work out for you. Who's the man?
LORETTA	f	Johnny Cammareri.
COSMO	m	Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he  here with you telling me?
LORETTA	f	He's flying to Sicily. His mother's  dying.
COSMO	m	More Bad Luck! I don't like his face,  Loretta. I don't like his lips. When  he smiles I can't see his teeth.  When will you do it?
LORETTA	f	In a month.
COSMO	m	I won't come.
LORETTA	f	You've got to come. You've got to  give me away.
COSMO	m	I didn't give you away the first  time.
LORETTA	f	And maybe that's why I had the Bad  Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and  I got married in a church, in a  wedding dress, instead of at the  City Hall with strangers standing  outside the door, maybe then I  wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
COSMO	m	Maybe.
LORETTA	f	I didn't have no wedding cake, no  reception or nothing. Johnny got  down on his knees and proposed to me  at The Grand Ticino.
COSMO	m	He did?
LORETTA	f	Yeah.
COSMO	m	That don't sound like Johnny. Where's  the ring?
LORETTA	f	Here.
COSMO	m	It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring.  It's a man's ring.
LORETTA	f	It's temporary.
COSMO	m	Everything is temporary. That don't  excuse nothing.
LORETTA	f	So you'll come to the wedding, right?
COSMO	m	Let's go tell your Mother.
COSMO	m	Rose. Rose. Rose. Rose.
ROSE	f	Who's dead?
COSMO	m	Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
ROSE	f	Again? Johnny Cammareri.
COSMO	m	I don't like him.
ROSE	f	You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.  Do you love him, Loretta?
LORETTA	f	No.
ROSE	f	Good. When you love them they drive  you crazy cause they know they can.  But you like him?
LORETTA	f	Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna  have a big church wedding, Ma. And a  reception.
ROSE	f	And who's gonna pay for that?
LORETTA	f	Pop.
COSMO	m	WHAT?
LORETTA	f	Father of the bride pays.
COSMO	m	I have no money!
ROSE	f	You're rich as Roosevelt. You're  just cheap, Cosmo.
COSMO	m	I won't pay for nothing.
ROSE	f	He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks  if he holds on to his money, he will  never die.
LORETTA	f	It's his duty as a father to pay for  my wedding, Ma ...
ROSE	f	Now he's gonna play that damn Vicki  Carr record. And then when he comes  to bed, he won't touch me.
FELIX	m	It's wrong to just let them go.
OLD MAN	m	Good morning, Lucy.
LUCY	f	Good morning.
FELIX	m	They run around, they mess up the  whole park.
OLD MAN	m	What do you want me to do? Pick up  after five dogs? I'm eighty-three  years old. God in his heaven  understands that I cannot pick up  after five dogs.
FELIX	m	You have too many dogs.
OLD MAN	m	Lucy. There are big things going on  in my house. My granddaughter Loretta,  the only daughter of my son Cosmo,  has engaged herself to be married a  second time.
LUCY	f	I have heard that Johnny Cammareri  got down on his knees in The Grand  Ticino and proposed to her.
OLD MAN	m	My son does not like this Johnny  Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
FELIX	m	You should have one dog. Like Lucy.  Like me. I wish I hadda gun. If I  hadda gun, I would shoot four of  your dogs.
LUCY	f	Don't fight.
OLD MAN	m	My granddaughter wants my son to pay  for the wedding. But he does not  want to pay.
LUCY	f	He should pay.
OLD MAN	m	I don't know.
LUCY	f	He owes her a wedding from the first  time when there was none.
OLD MAN	m	Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked  my advice. If he asks my advice, I  don't know what I will say.
FELIX	m	I won't have to shoot those dogs.  They will kill each other.
OLD MAN	m	You think so, huh, Stupid? Those  dogs love each other.
ROSE	f	Will you live here?
LORETTA	f	No.
ROSE	f	Why not?
LORETTA	f	Pop don't like Johnny.
ROSE	f	So we'll sell the house.
LORETTA	f	I got married before, you didn't  sell.
ROSE	f	Grandma was still alive. Chiro was  still home going to school. Now he's  married and gone to Florida. If you  and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
LORETTA	f	I'm thirty-seven years old.
ROSE	f	What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro  after I was thirty-seven. It ain't  over till it's over.
LORETTA	f	Johnny has a big apartment. We'll  live there.
ROSE	f	And we'll sell the house.
LORETTA	f	I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the  house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
ROSE	f	No. He don't.
LORETTA	f	Hello? Yea, this is Loretta Castorini -  yeah. Is that you Johnny?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the  deathbed of my mother.
LORETTA	f	How was your plane ride?
MR. JOHNNY	m	The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away.
VESTA	f	Quanto tempo devo aspettare? How long must I wait?!
MR. JOHNNY	m	I can't talk long.
LORETTA	f	Have you told her we're getting  married?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment  when she's peaceful.
LORETTA'S VOICE	m	Just don't wait until she's dead.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Have you called my brother?
LORETTA'S VOICE	m	Not yet.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Will you do it today? Call him, make  him come to the wedding. Five years  is too long for bad blood between  brothers. Nothing can replace your  family. I see that now.
LORETTA	f	Alright. I'll call him. Today. Listen,  Johnny. Call me after you tell your  mother. Alright? Alright. And don't  stand directly under the sun. You've  got your hat, use your hat. Alright.  Bye-bye.
ROSE	f	How's the mother?
LORETTA	f	She's dying. But I could still hear  her big mouth.
ROSE	f	Did he tell her?
LORETTA	f	Not yet. That old lady makes him  sweat. Where's that card?
ROSE	f	Who Are you calling?
CHRISSY	f	Cammareri's Bake Shop.
LORETTA	f	Is Ronny there?
CHRISSY	f	Hold on. Ronny, the phone!
RONNY	m	Yeah, this is Ronny.
LORETTA	f	I'm calling for your brother Johnny.  He's getting married and he wants  you to come.
RONNY	m	Why didn't he call himself?
LORETTA	f	He's in Palermo.
RONNY	m	What's wrong can never be made right.
LORETTA	f	Let me come and talk to you.
LORETTA	f	Is Ronny Cammareri here?
CHRISSY	f	He down at the ovens. What do you  want?
LORETTA	f	I would like to speak to him.
CHRISSY	f	Hey, RONNY.
ROCCO	m	What!
CHRISSY'S VOICE	m	Somebody to see Ronny.
ROCCO	m	Ronny!
RONNY	m	What!
ROCCO	m	Somebody here to see you.
RONNY	m	Have you come from my brother?
LORETTA	f	Yes.
RONNY	m	Why?
LORETTA	f	I'm going to marry him.
RONNY	m	You are going to marry my brother?
LORETTA	f	Yes. Do you want...
RONNY	m	I have no life.
LORETTA	f	Excuse me.
RONNY	m	I have no life. My brother Johnny  took my life from me.
LORETTA	f	I don't understand.
RONNY	m	And now he's getting married. He has  his, he's getting his. And he wants  me to come? What is life?
LORETTA	f	I didn't come here to upset you.
RONNY	m	They say bread is life. So I bake  bread, bread, bread. And the years go by! By! By! And I  sweat and shovel this stinking dough  in and outta this hot hole in the  wall and I should be so happy, huh,  sweetheart? You want me to come to  the wedding of my brother Johnny?!!  Where is my wedding? Chrissy! Over  by the wall! Gimme the big knife!
CHRISSY	f	No, Ronny!
RONNY	m	Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut  my throat!
LORETTA	f	Maybe I should come back another  time.
RONNY	m	No, I want you to see this! I want  you to watch me kill myself so you  can tell my brother on his wedding  day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
CHRISSY	f	I tell you I won't do it!
RONNY	m	Do you know about me?
BARBARA	f	Oh, Mr. Cammareri!
RONNY	m	Nothing is anybody's fault, but things  happen. Look.
RONNY	m	It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago  I was engaged to be married. Johnny  came in here, he ordered bread from  me. I put it in the slicer and I  talked with him and my hand got caught  cause I wasn't paying attention. The  slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny  'cause - when my fianc� saw that I  was maimed, she left me for another  man.
LORETTA	f	That's the bad blood between you and  Johnny?
RONNY	m	That's it.
LORETTA	f	But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
RONNY	m	I don't care! I ain't no freakin  monument to justice! I lost my hand,  I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand,  Johnny has his bride! You come in  here and you want me to put away my  heartbreak and forget?
RONNY	m	Is it just a matter of time till a  man opens his eyes and gives up his  one dream of happiness? Maybe. Maybe.  All I have... Have you come here,  Stranger, Bride of my Brother, to  take these last few loaves from my  table? Alright. Alright.
CHRISSY	f	This is the most tormented man I  have ever known. I am in love with  this man. He doesn't know that. I  never told him cause he can never  love anybody since he lost his hand  and his girl.
CHRISSY	f	Here. Why don't you just kill him?  It would be so much more kind than  coming here and inviting him to a  wedding like he'll never have.
LORETTA	f	Where you live?
RONNY	m	Upstairs.
LORETTA	f	Come on.
COSMO	m	And then there is copper, which is  the only pipe I use. It costs money.  But it costs money because it saves  money.
MONA	f	And what did they say?
COSMO	m	The man understood me. The woman  wanted to be cheap, but the man saw  that I was right.
MONA	f	You have such a head for knowing.  You know everything.
COSMO	m	I brought you something.
COSMO	m	It's a present.
MONA	f	Oh, Cosmo!
COSMO	m	They are little stars and birds.  Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
LORETTA	f	You ready for the coffee?
RONNY	m	Loretta. What's that smell?
LORETTA	f	I'm making you a steak.
RONNY	m	You don't have to help me.
LORETTA	f	I know that. I do what I want.
RONNY	m	I like it well done.
LORETTA	f	You'll eat this bloody to feed your  blood.
RONNY	m	This is good. Uhh...
LORETTA	f	Loretta.
RONNY	m	Where'd Johnny find you?
LORETTA	f	He knew my husband who died.
RONNY	m	How'd he die?
LORETTA	f	Bus hit him.
RONNY	m	Fast.
LORETTA	f	Instantaneous.
RONNY	m	When you get engaged?
LORETTA	f	Yesterday.
RONNY	m	Why?
LORETTA	f	Why what?
RONNY	m	I don't know.
LORETTA	f	So. Five years ago your hand got cut  off and your woman left you for  another man. No woman since then?
RONNY	m	No.
LORETTA	f	Stupid.
RONNY	m	When your husband get hit by the  bus?
LORETTA	f	Seven years ago.
RONNY	m	How many men since then?
LORETTA	f	Just Johnny.
RONNY	m	Stupid yourself.
LORETTA	f	No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
RONNY	m	I don't care about Luck, you  understand me? It ain't that.
LORETTA	f	What? Do you think you're the only  one ever shed a tear?
RONNY	m	Why you talking to me?
LORETTA	f	You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving  me a glass of whiskey?
RONNY	m	She was right to leave me.
LORETTA	f	You think so?
RONNY	m	Yes.
LORETTA	f	You really are stupid, you know that.
RONNY	m	You don't know nothing about it.
LORETTA	f	I was raised that a girl gets married  young. I didn't get married until I  was twenty-eight. I met a man. I  loved him. I married him. He wanted  to have a baby right away. I said  no. Then he got hit by a bus. No  man. No baby. No nothing! I did not  know that man was a gift I could not  keep. I didn't know... You tell me a  story and you think you know what it  means, but I see what the true story  is, and you can't. She didn't leave you! You can't see  what you are. I can see everything.  You are a wolf!
RONNY	m	I'm a wolf?
LORETTA	f	The big part of you has no words and  it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap  for you. She caught you and you could  not get away. So you chewed off your foot! That  was the price you had to pay to be  free. Johnny had nothing to do with it.  You did what you had to do, between  you and you, and I know I'm right, I  don't care what you say. And now  you're afraid because you found out  the big part of you is a wolf that  has the courage to bite off its own  hand to save itself from the trap of  the wrong love. That's why there has  been no woman since that wrong woman.  You are scared to death what the  wolf will do if you make that mistake  again!
RONNY	m	What are you doing!
LORETTA	f	I'm telling you your life!
RONNY	m	Stop it!
LORETTA	f	No!
RONNY	m	Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a  fool!
LORETTA	f	Because I have no Luck!
RONNY	m	He made me look the wrong way and I  cut off my hand. He could make you  look the wrong way and you could cut  off your whole head!
LORETTA	f	I am looking where I should to become  a bride!
RONNY	m	A bride without a head!
LORETTA	f	A wolf without a foot!
LORETTA	f	Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
RONNY	m	It's like I'm falling! It's like I'm  in the ocean!
LORETTA	f	I have no Luck!
RONNY	m	Son of a bitch!
LORETTA	f	Where are you taking me?
RONNY	m	To the bed.
LORETTA	f	Oh. Oh God. I don't care about  anything. I don't care about anything!  Take me to the bed.
RONNY	m	I can't believe what is happening.
LORETTA	f	Me neither.
RONNY	m	I was dead.
LORETTA	f	I was dead, too.
RONNY	m	Your blood.
LORETTA	f	All my life I have never reached a  man. I knew that I would reach my  husband, but I took my time and he  was dead. Ronny.
RONNY	m	Loretta.
LORETTA	f	I want to cut you open and crawl  inside of you. I want you to swallow  me.
RONNY	m	I've got you.
LORETTA	f	Get all of me. Take everything.
RONNY	m	What about Johnny?
LORETTA	f	You're mad at him, take it out on  me, take your revenge on me! Take  everything, leave nothing for him to  marry! Hollow me out so there's  nothing left but the skin over my  bones. Suck me dry!
RONNY	m	Alright. Alright. There will be  nothing left.
COSMO	m	Where's Loretta? We're gonna start  without her.
ROSE'S VOICE	f	She must be eating out.
RAYMOND'S VOICE	m	She don't know what she's missing.
ROSE'S VOICE	f	It's not like her not to call.
RITA'S VOICE	f	Well, she's got a lot on her mind.
RITA	f	I mean, can we talk about it, Rose?  Everybody's heard. She's getting  married again.
COSMO	m	I don't wanna talk about it.
RAYMOND	m	Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great  and about time. What's she gonna do  with the rest of her life she don't  get married?
COSMO	m	I don't wanna talk about it.
COSMO	m	My father needs a plate.
RAYMOND	m	Cosmo. Many years ago, when they  told me you were marrying my sister,  I was happy. When I told Rose I was  marrying Rita, she was happy.
RITA	f	Marriage is happy news.
COSMO	m	Rose, pass the wine.
RAYMOND	m	I never seen anybody so in love like  Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside  the house all day and look in the  windows. I never told you this cause  it's not really a story. But one  time I woke up in the middle of the  night cause this bright light was in  my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't  think a what it was. I looked out  the window, and it was the moon! Big  as a house! I never seen the moon so  big before or since. I was almost  scared, like it was gonna crush the  house. And I looked down, and standing  there in the street was Cosmo, looking  up at the windows. This is the funny  part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I  thought you brought this big moon  over to my house cause you were so  in love and woke me up with it. I  was half asleep I guess and didn't  know no better.
COSMO	m	You were altogether asleep. You were  dreaming.
RAYMOND	m	No. You were there.
COSMO	m	I don't wanna talk about it.
ROSE	f	Well, what do you wanna talk about!
COSMO	m	Rita. Pass the wine.
ROSE	f	Why you drinking so much?
ROSE	f	Old Man, if you give another piece  of my food to those dogs, I'm gonna  kick you till you're dead!
ROSE	f	Cosmo?
ROSE	f	You drank too much and now you sleep  too hard, and later you'll be up  when you should be down.
LORETTA	f	What's that?
RONNY	m	What?
LORETTA	f	That light.
RONNY	m	I don't know. I think it's the moon.
LORETTA	f	Oh.
RONNY	m	It's so bright.
LORETTA	f	I've never seen a moon like that.
RONNY	m	It makes you look like an angel.
RONNY	m	Yeah. Looks like a big snowball.
RAYMOND	m	Rita. Rita.
RITA	f	What? What?
RAYMOND	m	Look.
RITA	f	Oh.
RAYMOND	m	It's Cosmo's moon.
RITA	f	What are you talking about, Raymond?  Cosmo can't own the moon.
RAYMOND	m	I mean it's that moon I was talking  about at dinner. Is he down there? No.
RITA	f	Is who down there?
RAYMOND	m	Cosmo.
RITA	f	What would he be doing down there?
RAYMOND	m	I don't know.
RITA	f	You know, in this light, and with  that expression on your face, you  look about twenty-five years old.
OLD MAN	m	Alright now. Howl. Howl.
OLD MAN	m	How long must I wait? Quanto tempo  devo aspettare!
LORETTA	f	Oh my God.
RONNY	m	What?
LORETTA	f	What? What have we done?
RONNY	m	Take it easy.
LORETTA	f	This time I was trying to do  everything right.
RONNY	m	Don't just become excited.
LORETTA	f	I thought if I stayed away from the  City Hall, I won't have that Bad  Luck I had again.
RONNY	m	You're trying to make me feel guilty.
LORETTA	f	I'm marrying your brother!
RONNY	m	All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
LORETTA	f	You're invited to the wedding! It's  in a few weeks. Why didn't you do  like him and be with your dying mother  in Palermo?
RONNY	m	She didn't like me.
LORETTA	f	You don't get along with anybody!
RONNY	m	What did you do?
LORETTA	f	What did I do?
RONNY	m	You ruined my life.
LORETTA	f	That's impossible! It was ruint when  I got here! You ruint my life!
RONNY	m	Oh no I didn't!
LORETTA	f	Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got  those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why  didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck!  Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why  didn't I just pick up a stone and  kill myself years and years ago? I'm  gonna marry him!
RONNY	m	What?
LORETTA	f	Last night never happened, you hear  me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and  last night never happened, and you  and I are gonna take this to our  coffins!
RONNY	m	I can't do that!
LORETTA	f	Why not?
RONNY	m	I'm in love with you!
LORETTA	f	Snap out of it!
RONNY	m	I can't!
LORETTA	f	Alright. Then I must never see you  again. The bad blood will have to  stay there between you and Johnny  for all time. You won't come to the  wedding.
RONNY	m	I'll come to the wedding.
LORETTA	f	I'm telling you you can't.
RONNY	m	But he wants me to come!
LORETTA	f	But that's cause he don't know!
RONNY	m	Alright. I will not come. Provided  one thing.
LORETTA	f	What?
RONNY	m	That you come with me tonight. Once.  To the Opera.
LORETTA	f	What are you talking about?
RONNY	m	I love two things. I love you, and I  love the Opera. If I can have the  two things that I love together for  one night, I will be satisfied to  give up the rest of my life.
LORETTA	f	Alright.
RONNY	m	Alright. Meet me at the Met.
LORETTA	f	Alright. Where's the Met?
LORETTA	f	Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It's been two months since my last  confession.
PRIEST	m	What sins have you to confess?
LORETTA	f	Twice I took the name of God in vain,  once I slept with the brother of my  fianc�, and once I bounced a check  at the liquor store -- but that was  really an accident.
PRIEST	m	Then it was not a sin. But what was  that second thing you said, Loretta?
LORETTA	f	I... a... slept with my fianc�'s  brother.
PRIEST	m	That's a pretty big sin.
LORETTA	f	I know.
PRIEST	m	You should think about this.
LORETTA	f	I know.
PRIEST	m	Alright. This is your penance. Say  two rosaries and... be careful,  Loretta. Reflect on your life.
LORETTA	f	Alright.
PRIEST	m	I absolve you in the name of the  Father, and of the Son, and of the  Holy Spirit, Amen.
LORETTA	f	Hi.
ROSE	f	Where you been?
LORETTA	f	I don't wanna talk about it.
ROSE	f	Just like your father. I lied to  him. He thinks you came home last  night.
LORETTA	f	Thanks. What's the matter with you?
ROSE	f	Cosmo's cheating on me.
LORETTA	f	What! How do you know?
ROSE	f	A wife knows.
LORETTA	f	Then you don't know. You're just  imagining it. He's too old.
LORETTA	f	I won't be home for dinner.
HARVEY	m	See you tomorrow, Chrissy.
CHRISSY	f	Okay, Harvey.
BARBARA	f	So what do you think?
CHRISSY	f	About what?
BARBARA	f	The cake!
CHRISSY	f	Where's Ronny? How come he ain't  come down?
BARBARA	f	How should I know?
CHRISSY	f	Hello, Cammareri's? Hi. Uh-huh. Okay.
CHRISSY	f	That was Ronny. He don't feel good.  He ain't gonna be down today.
BARBARA	f	What, is he still upset?
CHRISSY	f	It's that bitch!
RAYMOND	m	I feel great I got no sleep but I  feel like Orlando Furioso!
RITA	f	You were a tiger last night.
RAYMOND	m	And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
RITA	f	Shut up. They'll hear you in the  back.
RAYMOND	m	So what? The pleasure of marriage is  you sleep with the woman and then  you don't worry about nothing. Hey,  how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's  eat pasta and roll around.
RITA	f	Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice!  What's got into you?
RAYMOND	m	I don't know! That moon! That crazy  moon Cosmo sent over!
LORETTA	f	Hi.
RAYMOND	m	Hey there
LORETTA	f	What's the matter with him?
RITA	f	You got me.
RAYMOND	m	You see that moon last night?
LORETTA	f	What about the moon?
RAYMOND	m	Did you see it?
LORETTA	f	No.
RAYMOND	m	Oh.
LORETTA	f	Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the  deposit to the bank but I'll do the  books tomorrow. I gotta go.
RAYMOND	m	You gotta date?
RITA	f	What are you talking about, you fool?  Her fianc�'s in Palermo.
RAYMOND	m	Oh. Right.
LORETTA	f	I got things to do.
RITA	f	Sure you do. You got all that wedding  stuff.
LORETTA	f	Right.
RAYMOND	m	Well, that's romantic, too.
RAYMOND	m	HEY. Make me a bowl of minestrone.
RITA	f	What's the matter? You look crazy.
LORETTA	f	I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
OLD MAN'S VOICE	m	I've got a lot on my mind. Things  are getting bad in my house. My  daughter-in-law is mad at my son  because he will not pay for the  wedding.
OLD MAN	m	At dinner, my daughter-in-law  threatened to kill me. Things are  very bad in my house.
FELIX	m	Hurry up.
LUCY	f	Don't fight.
OLD MAN	m	If I hit the stick too hard, the  apple will split. If I am too timid,  the apple will fall off the stick.
FELIX	m	We're supposed to do fifty apples.  We only got twelve done.
OLD MAN	m	I don't know what to advise my son.  I think he should pay for the wedding,  but it is important that he don't  look ridiculous.
LUCY	f	Don't make yourself sick.
OLD MAN	m	Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at  dinner.
LUCY	f	Talk to him.
OLD MAN	m	I will. But I must find the right  moment.
LUCY	f	Did you see the moon last night?
OLD MAN	m	Yes!
FELIX	m	Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five  minutes.
LORETTA	f	Bye, Aunt Rita.
RITA	f	Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
LORETTA	f	Yeah, I'll be in.
BONNIE	f	So? You want the usual?
LORETTA	f	I want you to get rid of the grey.
BONNIE	f	I've been wanting to do this for  three years! Let me show you some  magazines! You've got to get a  manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila!  I'm gonna need help!
LORETTA	f	Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay.
RONNY	m	Hi.
LORETTA	f	Hi.
RONNY	m	You look beautiful. Your hair...
LORETTA	f	I thought I'd try it. You look good.
RONNY	m	Thank you.
LORETTA	f	I said I'd go to the opera with you.  Nothing else.
LORETTA	f	Who painted that?
RONNY	m	Marc Chagall. A Russian.
LORETTA	f	Kinda gaudy.
RONNY	m	He was having some fun. Yeah, well  he's dead. Come on, let's go in.
RONNY	m	Thank you!
LORETTA	f	For what?
RONNY	m	I don't know. For your hair. For  your beautiful dress. For... you  know, I feel like a man again. You  know I love the Opera. You know it's  been a long time since I've been to  the Opera.
LORETTA	f	So. Where are we sitting?
RONNY	m	Come on.
RONNY	m	Here we go.
JIMMY	m	Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming?
ROSE	f	It's just me. I want to eat.
JIMMY	m	Okay.
JIMMY	m	I got a table for you right now.
JIMMY	m	This alright?
ROSE	f	Fine.
JIMMY	m	Enjoy your meal.
BOBO	m	Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You  eating alone tonight?
ROSE	f	Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a  martini, no ice and two olives.
BOBO	m	Very good.
SHEILA'S VOICE	f	I'm trying to explain to you how I  feel. Every time I try to explain  how I feel, you explain how you feel.  I don't think that's really much of  a response.
UNSEEN MAN'S VOICE	m	Well, its the only response I've  got.
BOBO	m	You wanna see a menu?
ROSE	f	Not yet. I'll wave.
SHEILA'S VOICE	f	I really do hate it though, when you  take that tone with me. Like you're  above it all and isn't it amusing.
MAN'S VOICE	m	But it is, isn't it?
SHEILA'S VOICE	f	Not to me! This is my life, no matter  how damned comical it may seem to  you. I don't need some man standing  above the struggle while I roll around  in the mud!
MAN'S VOICE	m	I think you like the mud and I don't.  That's fair, isn't it? If I don't  care to...
PERRY	m	Sorry about that, folks. She's a  very pretty mental patient.
PERRY	m	Don't mind about me. But could you  do me a favor and clear her place  and take away all evidence of her,  and bring me a big glass of vodka?
SHY WAITER	m	Absolutely!
PERRY	m	I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
ROSE	f	I'm not disturbed. By you.
PERRY	m	My lady friend has a personality  disorder.
ROSE	f	She was just too young for you.
PERRY	m	Thanks, comrade.
SHY WAITER	m	It's nothing!
PERRY	m	Ouch. Too young! I just got that.  You know how to hurt guy. How old  are you?
ROSE	f	None of your business.
PERRY	m	Sorry. That was rude.
ROSE	f	Will you join me for dinner?
PERRY	m	Are you sure?
PERRY	m	Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating  alone, and it's amazing how often I  end up doing just that.
ROSE	f	What do you do?
PERRY	m	I'm a professor. I teach  communications at N.Y.U.
ROSE	f	That woman was a student of yours?
PERRY	m	Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
ROSE	f	There's old saying my mother told  me. Would you like to hear it?
PERRY	m	Yes.
ROSE	f	Don't shit where you eat.
PERRY	m	I'll remember that. What do you do?
ROSE	f	I'm a housewife.
PERRY	m	Then why are you eating alone?
ROSE	f	I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you  a question?
PERRY	m	Go ahead.
ROSE	f	Why do men chase women?
PERRY	m	Nerves.
ROSE	f	I think it's because they fear death.
PERRY	m	Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I  chase women? I find women charming.
PERRY	m	I teach these classes I've taught  for a million years. The spontaneity  went out of it for me a long time  ago. I started off, I was excited  about something and I wanted to share  it. Now it's rote, it's the  multiplication table. Except  sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning  along and I look up, and there's  this fresh young beautiful face, and  it's all new to her and I'm this  great guy who's just brilliant and  thinks out loud. And when that  happens, when I look out among those  chairs and look at a young woman's  face, and see me there in her eyes,  me the way I always wanted to be and  maybe once was, then I ask her out  on a date. It doesn't last. It can  go for a few weeks or a couple of  precious months, but then she catches  on that I'm just a burnt out old  gasbag and that she's as fresh and  bright and full of promise as  moonlight in a martini. And at that  moment, she stands up and throws a  glass of water in my face, or some  action to that effect.
ROSE	f	What you don't know about women is a  lot.
LORETTA	f	They get some turnout for this stuff.
RONNY	m	It's the best thing there is.
LORETTA	f	I like parts of it, but I don't really  get it.
MONA	f	You haven't once said you like my  dress.
COSMO	m	I like your dress. It's very bright.
MONA	f	Why you looking around so much?
COSMO	m	I don't know. I got a feeling.
MONA	f	I'm wearing your bracelet.
PERRY	m	May I walk with you a ways?
ROSE	f	Sure.
PERRY	m	You knew that man?
ROSE	f	Yes.
LORETTA	f	That was just so... awful!
RONNY	m	Awful?
LORETTA	f	Beautiful. Sad. She died!
RONNY	m	Yeah.
LORETTA	f	I couldn't believe it! I didn't think  she was going to die. I knew she was  sick...
RONNY	m	She had TB.
LORETTA	f	I know. She was coughing her brains  out. And still, she had to sing all  the time...
LORETTA	f	Pop?
COSMO	m	Wait for me by the doors, Mona.
LORETTA	f	Pop? What are you doing here?
COSMO	m	Excuse me.
LORETTA	f	Mona?
COSMO	m	What'd you do to your hair?
LORETTA	f	I got it done.
COSMO	m	What are you doing here?
LORETTA	f	What are you doing here?
COSMO	m	Who is this man? You're engaged!
LORETTA	f	You're married.
COSMO	m	You're my daughter. I won't have you  acting like a tramp!
LORETTA	f	You're my father.
COSMO	m	Alright. I didn't see you here.
LORETTA	f	I don't know whether I saw you or  not.
RONNY	m	Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a  drink.
LORETTA	f	That wasn't my mother.
ROSE'S VOICE	f	That's my house.
PERRY'S VOICE	m	You mean the whole house?
ROSE'S VOICE	f	Yes.
PERRY'S VOICE	m	My God, it's a mansion!
ROSE'S VOICE	f	It's a house.
PERRY'S VOICE	m	I live in a one-bedroom apartment.  What exactly does your husband do?
ROSE'S VOICE	f	He's a plumber.
PERRY'S VOICE	m	Well. That explains it.
PERRY	m	Temperature's dropping.
ROSE	f	Yes.
PERRY	m	I guess you can't invite me in?
ROSE	f	No.
PERRY	m	People home.
ROSE	f	No. I think the house is empty. I  can't invite you in because I'm  married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
PERRY	m	I'm a little cold.
ROSE	f	You're a little boy and you like to  be bad.
PERRY	m	We could go to my apartment. You  could see how the other half lives.
ROSE	f	I'm too old for you.
PERRY	m	I'm too old for me. That's my  predicament.
ROSE	f	Good night.
PERRY	m	Good night. Can I kiss you on the  cheek, too?
ROSE	f	Sure.
PERRY	m	I'm freezing
ROSE	f	Good night.
AL	m	Another Old-Fashion?
RONNY	m	Loretta?
LORETTA	f	No thanks.
RONNY	m	I think that's it.
RONNY	m	What do you want to do now?
LORETTA	f	I wanna go home.
LORETTA	f	It's really cold.
RONNY	m	Yeah. It smells like snow.
LORETTA	f	My mother guessed that my father was  seeing somebody and I told her she  was crazy. She looked like a real  piece of cheap goods. But who am I  to talk?
RONNY	m	What's the matter?
LORETTA	f	How can you ask me that?
RONNY	m	You're making me feel guilty again.
LORETTA	f	You are guilty. I'm guilty.
RONNY	m	Of what? Only God can point the  finger, Loretta.
LORETTA	f	I know what I know.
RONNY	m	And what do you know? You tell me my  life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a  wolf? You run to the wolf in me,  that don't make you no lamb! You're  gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna  sell your life short? Playing it  safe is just about the most dangerous  thing a woman like you could do. You  waited for the right man the first  time, why didn't you wait for the  right man again?
LORETTA	f	He didn't come!
RONNY	m	I'm here!
LORETTA	f	You're late!
RONNY	m	We're here.
LORETTA	f	This is your place.
RONNY	m	That's right.
LORETTA	f	This is where we're going!
RONNY	m	Yeah.
LORETTA	f	The deal was if I came to the Opera  with you you'd leave me alone forever.
LORETTA	f	I went with you. Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're  gonna leave me alone. Right? A person can see where they've messed  up in their life, and they can change  how they do things, and they can  change their Luck. Maybe my nature  does draw me to you, but I don't  haveta go with that. I can take hold  of myself and say yes to some things  and no to something that's just gonna  ruin everything! I can do that.  Otherwise, what is this stupid life  that God gave us for what? Ronny? Are you listening to me?
RONNY	m	Yeah.
LORETTA	f	I'm really afraid.
RONNY	m	Why?
LORETTA	f	I'm afraid of who I am.
RONNY	m	I was.
LORETTA	f	And you're not now?
LORETTA	f	Why not?
RONNY	m	I don't know. Everything seems like  nothing now against that I want you  in my bed. I don't care if I burn in  hell. I don't care if you burn in  hell. The Past and Future is a joke  to me now. I see that they're nothing,  I see they ain't here. The only thing  that's here is you. And me. I want  you to come upstairs. Now. I tried  to take everything last night, like  you told me, but I couldn't. I  couldn't take everything in a hundred  years. It's the way we are. We  compound each other.
LORETTA	f	Let me go home.
RONNY	m	No.
LORETTA	f	Let me go home.
RONNY	m	No.
LORETTA	f	I'm freezing to death.
RONNY	m	Come upstairs. I don't care why you  come. No, that's not what I mean.  Loretta, I love you. Not like they  told you love is and I didn't know  this either. But love don't make  things nice, it ruins everything, it  breaks your heart, it makes things a  mess. We're not here to make things  perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The  stars are perfect. Not us. We are  here to ruin ourselves and break our  hearts and love the wrong people and  die! The storybooks are bullshit.  Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't  try to live your life out to somebody  else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't  try to live on milk and cookies when  what you want is meat! Red meat just  like me! It's wolves run with wolves  and nothing else! You're a wolf just  like me! Come upstairs with me and  get in my bed! Come on! Come on!  Come on!
MR. JOHNNY	m	19 Cranberry Street.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Hello. I'm sorry to call so late...
ROSE	f	Moving in?
MR. JOHNNY	m	I came right from the airport.
ROSE	f	Come on in.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Can you wake up Loretta? I need to  talk to her.
ROSE	f	She's not home yet. Take off your  coat and come in the living room.  I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk  to you.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Thank you.
ROSE	f	So.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Where is she?
ROSE	f	Out. I don't know where. I was waiting  up for my husband.
MR. JOHNNY	m	It's late.
ROSE	f	Yes.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Maybe I should go?
ROSE	f	What are you doing here? You're  supposed to be in Palermo.
MR. JOHNNY	m	That's what I came to tell Loretta.  There's been a miracle.
ROSE	f	A miracle. Well, that's news.
MR. JOHNNY	m	My mother's recovered.
ROSE	f	You're kidding?
MR. JOHNNY	m	The breath had almost totally left  her body. She was as white as snow.  And then she completely pulled back  from death and stood up and put on  her clothes and began to cook for  everyone in the house. The mourners.  And me. And herself! She ate a meal  that would choke a pig!
ROSE	f	That's incredible.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Yes.
ROSE	f	Hello Pop.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Who was that?
ROSE	f	That was my father-in-law, who has a  wrong idea in his head. Listen,  Johnny, there's a question I want to  ask you. And I want you to tell me  the truth if you can. Why do men  chase women?
MR. JOHNNY	m	Well. There's the Bible story. God  took a rib from Adam and made Eve.  Maybe men chase women to get the rib  back. When God took the rib, he left  a hole there, place where there used  to be something. and the women have  that. Maybe a man isn't complete as  a man without a woman.
ROSE	f	But why would a man need more than  one woman?
MR. JOHNNY	m	I don't know. Maybe because he fears  death.
ROSE	f	That's it! That's the reason!
MR. JOHNNY	m	I don't know.
ROSE	f	No, that's really it. Thank you for  answering my question.
COSMO	m	Hi. Hi.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Hello, Mr. Castorini.
ROSE	f	Where you been?
COSMO	m	I don't know, Rose. I don't know  where I've been, and I don't know  where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for  you, my friend.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I have my eyes open.
COSMO	m	You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go  on any long trips.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I don't know what you mean.
COSMO	m	I know you don't. That's the point.  I'll say no more.
MR. JOHNNY	m	You haven't said anything.
COSMO	m	And that's how much I'm saying.
ROSE	f	Cosmo?
COSMO	m	What?
ROSE	f	I just want you to know. No matter  what you do. You are going to die,  just like everybody else.
COSMO	m	Thank you, Rose.
ROSE	f	You're welcome.
COSMO	m	I'm going to bed now.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I'm going.
COSMO'S VOICE	m	Good!
ROSE	f	He doesn't like you. Thank you for  answering my question.
MR. JOHNNY	m	You don't know where Loretta is?
ROSE	f	No idea.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Then tell her I'll come by in the  morning. We need to talk.
ROSE	f	Okay, I'll tell her.
ROSE	f	What the hell happened to you?
LORETTA	f	Well. I don't really know where to  start.
ROSE	f	Your hair's different.
LORETTA	f	Everything's different.
ROSE	f	Are you drunk?
LORETTA	f	No. Are you drunk?
ROSE	f	No. But I have a hangover.
LORETTA	f	Where's pop?
ROSE	f	Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up  last night.
LORETTA	f	What? He's in Sicily!
ROSE	f	No more he's not.
LORETTA	f	He's with his dying mother!
ROSE	f	She recovered.
LORETTA	f	WHAT!! She was dying!
ROSE	f	It was a miracle.
LORETTA	f	A miracle? This is modern times!  There ain't supposed to be miracles  any more!
ROSE	f	I guess it ain't modern times in  Sicily. He came right from the  airport. He wanted to talk to you.  You got a love bite on your neck.  He's coming back this morning.
ROSE	f	It's not Johnny.
LORETTA	f	Ronny!
RONNY	m	Is Johnny here?
LORETTA	f	He's coming.
RONNY	m	Good! We can get this out on the  table. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
ROSE	f	Nice to meet you. You've got a love  bite on your neck. Your mother's  recovered from death.
RONNY	m	Oh. Good. We're not close. I'm not  really moved.
LORETTA	f	You've gotta get outta here.
RONNY	m	No. I'm gonna wait.
LORETTA	f	Ronny, please...
ROSE	f	Would anyone like some oatmeal?
RONNY	m	Yes, I would like some oatmeal.
ROSE	f	Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's  brother.
COSMO	m	His brother.
COSMO	m	You're Johnny's brother?
RONNY	m	Yeah.
OLD MAN	m	I am old. The Old are not wanted.  And what they say has no weight.  But, my son, I must speak. You should  pay for the wedding of your only  daughter. You are breaking your house  through pride. There. I've said it.
COSMO	m	It's okay, Pop. If she gets married,  I'll pay for the whole thing.
ROSE	f	Have I been a good wife?
COSMO	m	Yes.
ROSE	f	I want you to stop seeing her.
COSMO	m	Okay.
ROSE	f	And go to confession.
COSMO	m	A man... under stands one day...  that his life is built on nothing.  And that's a bad, crazy day.
ROSE	f	Your life is not built on nothing.  Ti amo.
COSMO	m	Ti amo.
LORETTA	f	It's Johnny. I'll get it.
RONNY	m	I'll get it.
ROSE	f	I'll get it.
RONNY	m	No, I'll tell him.
LORETTA	f	No, I'll tell him. What am I going to tell him?
COSMO	m	Tell him the truth, Loretta they  find out anyway.
LORETTA	f	I love you Pop.
RITA	f	Hi Loretta.
LORETTA	f	Hi.
RAYMOND	m	Hi, Loretta.
LORETTA	f	Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
RITA	f	Is there anything you want to tell  us, honey?
LORETTA	f	You? No.
RAYMOND	m	We just come from the bank.
LORETTA	f	The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO
RITA	f	She's got it.
RAYMOND	m	I knew she had it.
RITA	f	We didn't know what to think. You  were so weird yesterday, and then  this morning, we go to the bank and  no bag.
ROSE	f	Listen. Who wants coffee?
RITA	f	So what are we doing?
ROSE	f	We're waiting for Johnny Cammareri.
RONNY	m	I'm his brother.
TA	?	Nice to meet you. I'm Rita Cappomaggi.
RAYMOND	m	I'm Raymond Cappomaggi. I'm Rose's  brother.
RONNY	m	Nice to meet you.
OLD MAN	m	Somebody tell a joke!
RITA	f	I'll get it.
LORETTA	f	I'm getting palpitations!
RAYMOND	m	I thought he was in Palermo.
RITA	f	It's Johnny Cammareri.
LORETTA	f	Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Loretta...
RONNY	m	Johnny...
MR. JOHNNY	m	Ronny! Our mother has recovered from  death!
RONNY	m	Good.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Have you come to make peace with me?
RONNY	m	Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Of course I want to.
LORETTA	f	I don't know. But Johnny, how did  your mother recover? She was dying.
MR. JOHNNY	m	We should talk alone.
LORETTA	f	I can't. I need my family around me  now.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Well. I told my mother that we were  to be married. And she got well.  Right away.
RONNY	m	I'm sure she did.
MR. JOHNNY	m	It was a miracle!
LORETTA	f	Johnny, I have something to tell  you.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I have something to tell you. But I  must talk to you alone.
LORETTA	f	I have no secrets from my family.
MR. JOHNNY	m	Loretta, I can't marry you.
LORETTA	f	WHAT?
MR. JOHNNY	m	If I marry you my mother will die.
LORETTA	f	What the hell are you talking about?  We're engaged.
RONNY	m	Loretta, what are you talking about?
LORETTA	f	I'm talking about a promise. You  proposed to me!
MR. JOHNNY	m	Because my mother was dying! But now  she's not.
RONNY	m	You're forty-two years old, Johnny,  and Mama is still running your life.
MR. JOHNNY	m	And you are a son who doesn't love  his mother!
LORETTA	f	And you're a big liar! I've got your  ring here!
MR. JOHNNY	m	I must ask for that back.
LORETTA	f	Here! Take your stupid pinky ring. Who needs it? The engagement's off.
MR. JOHNNY	m	In time, you will see that this is  the best thing.
LORETTA	f	In time, you will drop dead, and I  will come to your funeral in a red  dress.
RONNY	m	Loretta?
LORETTA	f	What!
RONNY	m	Will you marry me.
MR. JOHNNY	m	What?
LORETTA	f	Where's the ring?
RONNY	m	Could I a... borrow that ring.
RONNY	m	Thanks.
RONNY	m	Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini  Clark?
LORETTA	f	Before all these people, yes, I will  marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
ROSE	f	Do you love him, Loretta?
LORETTA	f	Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
ROSE	f	Oh God, that's too bad.
COSMO	m	What's the matter, Pop?
LORETTA	f	Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
COSMO	m	Everybody take a glass.
OLD MAN	m	Wait.
OLD MAN	m	Here.
MR. JOHNNY	m	I don't want it.
COSMO	m	To... the family. Right? Ti amo.
ROSE	f	Ti amo.
RAYMOND	m	That's right.
MR. JOHNNY	m	To family.
