CHAPLAIN	m	In accordance with the regulations  of the State of Mississippi, we gather  here today to lay to rest the remains  of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316,  and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to  ashes, dust to dust. May God have  mercy on their souls.
BURKE	m	Go ahead, fellas.
NURSE HUMPHRIES	f	I'll come back for you in a little  while, Willie...
JAKE	m	These two guys friends of yours, old  man?
WILLIE	m	We spent some time together.
LEON	m	Why do I get the feeling when you  say some time, you mean some time.
WILLIE	m	I was already here a good many years  when they came in in 1932.
LEON	m	1932? That's like, that's like...
WILLIE	m	Sixty-five years ago. They always  said the farm couldn't hold 'em  forever. Looks like you're finally  free, boys.
JAKE	m	Hey, the dude's holdin'.
LEON	m	Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers  up.
LEON	m	Hell of a way to get out. Heard they  burned up in that fire yesterday.
JAKE	m	I seen the bodies before they sealed  'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good.  Looked like some shit from the X- Files. Damn, that shit's nasty.
WILLIE	m	Ray's special recipe. He always had  exacting standards where the hooch  was concerned.
LEON	m	What were they, bootleggers?
WILLIE	m	Something like that.
BOUNCER	m	Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's  not happy with you.
RAY	m	Is Spanky here?
BOUNCER	m	No, but...
RAY	m	Then what's the problem?
BOUNCER	m	Do yourself a favor and find another  place where they let you in the front  door.
RAY	m	But this is where the action is and  I have to be where the action is.  Look, when your old lady wanted those  alligator shoes, didn't I come through  for you? Ain't she stepping in style  now?
BOUNCER	m	Yeah...
RAY	m	Well, alright then. What do you think  about this new tie?
BOUNCER	m	Sharp.
RAY	m	I look good tonight. And I feel lucky,  too.
BOUNCER	m	Anyone asks, it wasn't me who let  you in.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS	m	Don't even try it.
RAY	m	When do you get off?
COCKTAIL WAITRESS	m	I get off at two, but you ain't never  getting off.
BARKEEP	m	You can't drink that in here, Ray.
RAY	m	I sure can't drink that watered-down  swill you're serving. Give me a glass  of ice.
BARKEEP	m	I can't give you a glass of ice. I  can't give you anything until you  pay your damn tab.
CLAUDE	m	For the kind of money they charge  here, you'd think they could hire  somebody to actually wash the dishes.
DAISY	f	Claude. Here's to your new job down  at the bank. I always knew you'd  make something of yourself.
CLAUDE	m	Know what I'm going to buy with my  first pay check?
CLAUDE	m	Season tickets to the Yankees. Right  there on the first base line. What's wrong, baby?
DAISY	f	I was hoping you were gonna say an  engagement ring, Claude.
CLAUDE	m	Engagement ring!
DAISY	f	That's what respectable folks do.  Get a job, get married, start having  babies. That's what you want, isn't  it?
CLAUDE	m	Sure it is. I just don't see any  reason to rush into things. Damn,  look at this shirt. I'll be right  back.
BAG MAN #1	m	Congratulations, Claude. We understand  you finally got yourself a job.
BAG MAN #2	m	Guess that means you can pay Mr.  Riley the fifty bucks you owe him.
CLAUDE	m	Now wait a second, guys. I've got a  bill to pay out there.
BAG MAN #1	m	Twenty-two dollars. Not bad for a  start.
CLAUDE	m	Come on, fellas, that's two weeks  pay. I'm here with my girl. You gotta  leave me something.
BAG MAN #2	m	How about your legs?
CLAUDE	m	My legs? Those are good, I'll keep  the legs...
RAY	m	You have any of that French stuff?
ATTENDENT	?	Here you go.
RAY	m	Keep the change.
ATTENDENT	?	Why, thank you, sir!
RAY	m	Don't I know you?
CLAUDE	m	I don't think so.
RAY	m	Sure I do. What's your name again?
CLAUDE	m	Claude Banks.
RAY	m	Claude Banks. How could I forget  that? You've got to remember me. Ray  Gibson. We went to high school  together.
CLAUDE	m	You went to Monroe?
RAY	m	That's right! Good old Monroe...
CLAUDE	m	Well, I went to Jefferson, so you  must have a different Claude Banks  in mind.
RAY	m	Sorry, man. My mistake.
RAY	m	Watch the threads, Bullethead. If  this is about my tab, I've got it  covered.
BULLETHEAD	m	This ain't about your tab, Ray. You've  got bigger problems than that.
BOUNCER	m	Is that Ray Gibson? Who the hell let  him in here?
CLAUDE	m	Come on, honey, let's get out of  here.
DAISY	f	But I'm having a good time...
WAITER	m	Excuse me, sir, I believe you forgot  this.
CLAUDE	m	The bill. Of course, the bill. We  couldn't leave without paying the  bill. Especially such an incredibly  large bill.
RAY	m	Save your energy, Claude. You're  gonna need it.
RAY	m	Here, this belongs to you. It was empty when I found it.
CLAUDE	m	Good old Monroe.
RAY	m	What I want to know is what happened  to your cush between the time that  you got up from the table and when I  caught up with you in the Johnny?
CLAUDE	m	I don't see where that's any of your  business.
RAY	m	Did those two muscle heads shake you  down? Swear I've seen them down at  the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's  it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
CLAUDE	m	Where they taking us, anyway?
RAY	m	Probably to Spanky's headquarters  down at the pier.
CLAUDE	m	Good, I'm looking forward to meeting  this Spanky. Give me a chance to  straighten out this whole mess.
RAY	m	I can't wait to see that. You slay  me, man.
CLAUDE	m	What are they gonna do to us?
RAY	m	You? Dine and ditch, right? Over ten bucks? You're probably looking at a thumb.
CLAUDE	m	A thumb? What do you mean, like cut  it off? For ten bucks? That include the tip?
SPANKY	m	You picked the wrong night to fuck  with me, Ray. I just lost three men  and a truck full of Canadian whiskey.  You know what that kind of thing  does to my business? It makes me  want to lash out and hurt somebody.
SPANKY	m	Who's he? Friend of yours, Ray?
CLAUDE	m	I never saw this man before tonight.  He's a lowlife degenerate who lurks  in bathrooms. I'm a professional  man, an upstanding citizen. I go to  church on Sunday.
SPANKY	m	Then what are you doing here?
BULLETHEAD	m	Failure to pay.
CLAUDE	m	Look, Mr. Johnson, you seem like a  reasonable man. I got a good job  starts Monday. I'll pay you back  with my first pay check. With  interest. I don't want to tell you  how to conduct your business, but if  you cut off my finger you won't get  jack. Working an adding machine, I  gotta be whole. I need my thumbs and all my fingers  for praying and doing good...
SPANKY	m	The choirboy wants to keep his  fingers. Who am I to argue? Drop  him.
CLAUDE	m	Drop him? What does drop him mean?
SPANKY	m	You gotta lotta balls showing your  face around my club. If a man's gonna  run numbers on my side of Broadway,  you think he'd have the common sense  to keep a low profile. But not Ray  Gibson.
CLAUDE	m	No, not down there! That water's  filthy! Help me out here, man!
RAY	m	You don't have to drown that fella,  Spanky. You already scared him half  to death. He didn't know who he was  fucking with.
SPANKY	m	But you do. What does that say about  you, Ray? What does that say about  me? I've given you a lot of leeway  over the years on account of your  father. But he didn't last long enough  to teach you the meaning of the word  respect so I guess I'm gonna have to  school you myself.
RAY	m	Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to  get by here. You remember how it was  when you were starting out.
CLAUDE	m	I was supposed to wear this suit on  Monday!
SPANKY	m	What's that, some of your bathtub  brew?
RAY	m	Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
SPANKY	m	Where'd you get this?
RAY	m	Comes up the Mississippi. I can get  more. A lot more. I was thinking  about going into business for myself,  but under the circumstances, I'd be  willing to take on a partner.
SPANKY	m	I'm interested. Keep talking.
RAY	m	All I need is the front money and a  truck. I could be back in two, three  days tops if I had somebody to share  the driving.
SPANKY	m	If you fuck me on this one, I'll  spare no expense.
RAY	m	Understood.
SPANKY	m	Alright, Ray, you've got a deal.  Pick your man and get going.
RAY	m	I'll take the little choirboy, if  you don't mind.
SPANKY	m	If I was you, I'd want somebody who  can handle himself in a tight spot.
RAY	m	I just want somebody who won't put a  bullet in my back once the truck is  full.
SPANKY	m	For your sake, I hope you can drive.  Somebody give him some dry clothes.
RAY	m	Tell me about that hot sketch you  were hypin' last night. She was a  choice bit of calico. You two been  seeing each other a long time? Gonna  slap the handcuffs on her and stroll  down the aisle one of these days?
RAY	m	Sometimes I wish I could find me a  sheba to settle down with. Suppose  I'm just a tomcat by nature. This little rum run is gonna seriously  improve my relationship with Spanky.  He's a good man to have on your side.  He's got the capital and the  connections. That's what you got to  have in that business. Spanky's place  is pretty plush, but one of these  days I'm gonna open up my own  establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room.  You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room.  That's in the groove, don't you think?
RAY	m	Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a  word since we started. Least you  could do is make some friendly  conversation.
CLAUDE	m	Look, man, I don't want friendly  conversation. I don't want to be  your friend. I've seen your friends  and I don't like them. I just want  to do this thing and get back to New  York in time to start my job.
RAY	m	Start your job? What kind of job?
CLAUDE	m	Well, if you must know, bank teller  at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm  responsible for keeping track of  hundreds, occasionally thousands of  dollars.
RAY	m	That's some long green.
CLAUDE	m	Damn straight, it is. I got my own  set of keys because I'm supposed to  open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m.  Monday morning, there's gonna be  hell to pay.
CLAUDE	m	What?
RAY	m	Nothing.
CLAUDE	m	No, tell me what's so funny.
RAY	m	I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds  like ladies work to me.
CLAUDE	m	Well, maybe I should dig around in  other people's clothes for money.  It's obviously been highly successful  for you.
RAY	m	Hey, you'd be surprised what you  find in other people's pockets. Just  gotta avoid them deadbeat bank  tellers. Get you every time.
CLAUDE	m	I didn't start out to be a bank  teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer.  Even had an offer to play short for  the Newark Eagles.
RAY	m	Why didn't you take it?
CLAUDE	m	The Negro League don't pay so good.  And you're always on the road. That  don't wash with Daisy.
RAY	m	You gave up baseball to be a bank  teller? I can't latch on to that.
CLAUDE	m	At some point a man's got to get  serious about his future. I'm sure  you have no idea what I'm talking  about.
RAY	m	You're talking about giving up  baseball to be a bank teller.
CLAUDE	m	Bank teller's just a start. I got  plans. Real plans. Not opening some  Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year  I'll be a loan officer.
RAY	m	A loan officer?
CLAUDE	m	That's right, a loan officer.
RAY	m	So you mean, if I needed some jack  to get my nightclub up and running,  I'd have to hype some square like  you?
CLAUDE	m	Uh-huh.
RAY	m	How would I get a loan, anyway?
CLAUDE	m	You need collateral.
RAY	m	Like this?
CLAUDE	m	That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
RAY	m	My daddy gave me this watch.
CLAUDE	m	Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
RAY	m	My daddy is dead so watch your mouth.  You can say what you want about me,  but don't be dragging my daddy into  it. This watch means the world to  me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
CLAUDE	m	Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
RAY	m	Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my  business elsewhere. And for future  reference, you are no longer welcome  at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
CLAUDE	m	There is no Boom-Boom Room.
RAY	m	When there is, you can forget about  it. And I swear to God, you ever  talk about my daddy again I'm gonna  kick your bank-telling, loan-denying  ass, you got me?
CLAUDE	m	Oooh...
RAY	m	I think I liked you better when you  kept your trap shut.
RAY	m	Man, something smells good in here.  How's everybody doing?
CLAUDE	m	Maybe we oughta find another place.
RAY	m	Are you kidding? Tell me you don't  want a slice of that pie right over  there.
CLAUDE	m	I must have left my appetite outside,  which is where I think we ought to  be right now.
RAY	m	Good evening, Billy. We'd like some  coffee and a couple of slices of  that homemade pie you've got  advertised.
BILLY	m	How you know my name's Billy?
RAY	m	It says so right there on your shirt.
BILLY	m	That what that says?
MAMA	f	If you boys can read so good, how  come you missed that sign in the  window?
CLAUDE	m	You mean this sign? The one that  says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a  good question. Ray, how come we missed  the sign?
RAY	m	Look, ma'am, we've been driving all  day. We'd just like to purchase one  of those pies and we'll be on our  way.
MAMA	f	Those are whites-only pies.
RAY	m	Got any nigger pies?
CLAUDE	m	Any fool could see those are whites- only, not-for-blacks, come-on-let's- get-the-fuck-outta-here pies. Thank  you very much.
RAY	m	Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle  Claude.
CLAUDE	m	Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a  load of those crackers? Couldn't be  a mouthful of teeth among the bunch  of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight  with people like that for?
RAY	m	You're soft.
CLAUDE	m	What'd you say?
RAY	m	I said you're soft.
CLAUDE	m	Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
RAY	m	I call it like I see it, and what I  see is definitely soft.
CLAUDE	m	Alright. You want some pie?
RAY	m	Yeah, I want some pie.
CLAUDE	m	Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to  that counter and get us some fucking  pie.
CLAUDE	m	Excuse me, ma'am, I bet a brick will  turn that one right there into a  colored pie.
MAMA	f	And I bet this right here will turn  you into a colored pie.
CLAUDE	m	Okay, Ray, I think we can go now.  Much obliged...
MAMA	f	Don't be concentrating so hard, baby.  You're liable to seize yourself again.
RAY	m	How you doing? We're looking for  Slim.
SLIM	m	You found him.
SLIM	m	That's it, fellas. Thirty six cases  of Puerto Rico's finest. At five  bucks a case, that's $180.
RAY	m	Man, that music is hot. What goes on  down there, Slim?
SLIM	m	That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
RAY	m	Blacks welcome there?
SLIM	m	Green's the only color that matters  under the hill. They got gambling,  girls. You oughta check it out.
RAY	m	Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
CLAUDE	m	Nice meeting you? You've been here  before, haven't you?
RAY	m	What gave you that idea?
CLAUDE	m	Oh, I don't know, maybe because our  lives depend on it, I just sort of  thought you knew what you were doing!
RAY	m	Don't get all agitated on me. I bought  a bottle of rum from a couple of  dudes, I heard 'em talking...
CLAUDE	m	Let me get this straight. We drove  all the way down to Klan country  'cause you heard a couple of guys  talking?
RAY	m	What are you complaining about? It  worked out. Everything's cool. Now,  come on, let's head down there and  see what's shaking. We deserve a  little reward.
CLAUDE	m	Reward?
RAY	m	There are people down there having  fun. I want to be one of them. I  want you to be one of them. On Monday  you can be a bank teller if you want,  but tonight you're a bootlegger with  a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and  a fistful of cash.
CLAUDE	m	That's gas money.
RAY	m	There's your gas money. You stay  here and watch the truck. And don't  worry, I've got the keys.
CLAUDE	m	I'm just gonna keep an eye on you,  make sure you don't do nothing stupid.
SYLVIA	f	I've never seen you in here before.
CLAUDE	m	That's because I've never been here  before.
SYLVIA	f	I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
SYLVIA	f	Can't you remember your own name?
CLAUDE	m	I know it begins with a "C"...
SYLVIA	f	Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a  girl a drink? Two bourbons.
CLAUDE	m	I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an  eye on my friend.
SYLVIA	f	He looks like he can take care of  himself.
CLAUDE	m	Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's  never happened before.
SYLVIA	f	You're cute. You have any money,  Claude?
CLAUDE	m	Ten dollars. But I need it to get  home.
SYLVIA	f	Why would you want to go home? It's  so early.
RAY	m	I'll take two.
WINSTON	m	I'll see that...
WINSTON	m	And while we're at it, let's sweeten  the pot.
RAY	m	Looks like my sugar bowl's empty,  Mr. Hancock.
WINSTON	m	That's just too damn bad, ain't it?
RAY	m	Now, hang on, slick. I ain't through  with you yet.
WINSTON	m	That'll cover it.
RAY	m	Full boat, ladies doing the paddling.
WINSTON	m	Four threes.
WINSTON	m	Don't take it too hard, New York.  Have a round on me.
WAITRESS	?	Can I get you something?
RAY	m	Looks like he had a whole lot of  nothing in his hand until you came  along.
WAITRESS	?	You're hurting my arm.
PIKE	m	If it isn't Winston Hancock.
PIKE	m	I thought we agreed that you were  gonna leave town.
WINSTON	m	I tried to leave, Sheriff Pike. But  your wife begged me to stay.
PIKE	m	You just committed suicide, boy.
CLAUDE	m	Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
RAY	m	Here I am.
CLAUDE	m	Guess we better get going, huh?
RAY	m	Still got that ten dollars?
CLAUDE	m	Well, not exactly. See, I met this  girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing  girl. Her name's Sylvia.
RAY	m	That jelly you were talking to right  here?
CLAUDE	m	She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs  this operation, and they ain't got  the money for it. Their church took  up a collection but they were still  short...
RAY	m	So you made a generous contribution.
CLAUDE	m	What can I say? When the spirit moves  me.
RAY	m	That was mighty charitable of you,  Claude. Looks like we both got fucked  tonight.
CLAUDE	m	What are you talking about?
RAY	m	While you were upstairs doing God's  work, I was getting jack-legged by a  fool with four threes.
CLAUDE	m	You lost all our money in a card  game?
RAY	m	He even got my daddy's watch.
CLAUDE	m	Fuck that cheap-ass watch -- I mean, how the hell are we gonna  get home without any money?
RAY	m	We've still got 36 cases of rum.  That's better than money.
CLAUDE	m	You sure the truck's this way? I swear it was back that way.
CLAUDE	m	Ray... Yo, Ray...!
CLAUDE	m	I think he's hurt pretty bad.
RAY	m	He's dead.
CLAUDE	m	Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body  before!
CLAUDE	m	What do you think you're doing?! The  man's been dead for two seconds!  Don't you have any respect?
RAY	m	It ain't here.
CLAUDE	m	What ain't there?
RAY	m	My daddy's watch. This is the dude I  was telling you about --
MAN WITH LANTERN	m	What's going on here?
MAN WITH LANTERN	m	What's wrong with that one?
RAY	m	Him? He's just drunk.
CLAUDE	m	Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old  what's-his-name.
RAY	m	Winston. His name's Winston.
CLAUDE	m	Come on, Ray, better get Winston  back to the truck.
MAN WITH LANTERN	m	This fella looks dead.
CLAUDE	m	Would you look at that, Ray. Winston  up and died on us.
RAY	m	Hell with him then. If he can't share  the driving, he can't ride in the  truck.
MAN WITH LANTERN	m	He can ride with us.
MAN WITH LANTERN	m	So can you.
RAY	m	Man, this is gonna delay everything.  Spanky's gonna be pissed.
CLAUDE	m	Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky.  Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a  name is Spanky, anyway? You're  responsible for this situation. I  blame you for everything. If it wasn't  for you, I'd be home having a hot  meal right now.
RAY	m	If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing  up on the beach at Coney Island right  now. "I need all my thumbs and fingers  for praying and doing good."
PIKE	m	What do we have here?
DEPUTY	m	Billy Bob and the boys found them  down down under the hill with Winston  Hancock. He was dead. Looks like  murder.
PIKE	m	You don't say.
DEPUTY	m	Looks like they was running rum. Got  thirty six cases of evidence out  back. You want I should call in the  federal prosecutor?
PIKE	m	Let's not drag the feds into this. I  can think of better uses for that  rum than letting it collect dust in  some government warehouse up in  Nashville.
PIKE	m	Besides, why bother with bootlegging  when we got us a clear cut case of  murder?
RAY	m	Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained  to your associate here, there's been  a mistake. We didn't kill anybody.  Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen  to work for a very important man in  New York.
CLAUDE	m	That's right. Does the name Spanky  Johnson mean anything to you?
PIKE	m	Afraid not.
RAY	m	Mr. Johnson is very well connected.  If you were to let us go, I guarantee  he would show you his appreciation,  if you know what I mean.
PIKE	m	Are you offering me a bribe?
RAY	m	I'm just trying to pay the toll on  the road to justice.
PIKE	m	You may be able to buy your way out  of trouble up in New York City, but  down here we take murder seriously.
CLAUDE	m	Look, man, how many times we gotta  tell you people, we didn't kill that  guy!
PIKE	m	Well, if that's the case, then you  don't have anything to worry about,  do you?
PIKE	m	Time to get home to the missus. See  y'all in the morning.
CLAUDE	m	The man's gotta point. We're innocent,  after all. I just gotta get a good  night's sleep on this filthy mattress.  Keep our heads on straight, stay  cool, what's the worst thing that  could happen to us?
JUDGE	m	Life!
RAY	m	Life?! How long is life? We were  just walking back to the truck. We  didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
CLAUDE	m	Life?! What's life mean? There's no  way I can do life. I got a job starts  Monday morning!
DILLARD	?	Welcome to the farm. Here you will  be provided with ample opportunity  to repay your debt to society through  the rigors of hard labor...
DILLARD	?	In between harvest and planting season  we got fields need clearing, roads  need building and ditches need  digging. You will eat only what you  can grow. Your crop don't come in,  you'll go hungry. If you die, don't  worry 'bout us none. We'll find  somebody to replace you...
DILLARD	?	This here is Camp 8. Camp 8 is for  incorrigibles, so whatever you've  done to get here, believe me, we're  not impressed. You new men are  probably noticing that we have no  fences here at Camp 8. We don't need  no fences, we have the gun line. It  runs from shack to shack clear around  the yard. You are now inside the gun  line. If you step outside the gun  line without my permission, you will  be shot. If you trip and fall over  the gun line, you will be shot. If  you spit, if you pee, if you stick  your ass out and take a dump over  the gun line, you will be shot.
DILLARD	?	One of my trusties puts a bullet in  you when you're trying to run, I'm  liable to give him a pardon for saving  me the trouble of tracking you down,  so you can bet their aim is true.
DILLARD	?	My name is Sgt. Dillard. In the  unlikely event that you need to  address me, you call me boss. You  already met this handsome fella right  here. Hoppin' Bob's my ace boon coon.  You run afoul of Hoppin' Bob, you  run afoul of me.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	New men, strip down!
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Okay, ladies, got some fresh meat  for ya!
HOPPIN' BOB	m	We ain't got no wallflowers at Camp  8. Everybody gotta dance eventually.  But don't worry, they won't try  nothing tonight. That would take all  of the fun outta the courtship.
DILLARD	?	Got three miles of ditch to clear  today. Let's keep it moving!
CLAUDE	m	I don't believe this before Abe jive.  I didn't go to night school to sing  in no Mississippi Boys Choir!
RAY	m	I wouldn't do that if I was you.
CLAUDE	m	Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do  you know, anyway?
RAY	m	Told ya.
DILLARD	?	Why ain't his pick swinging?
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Why ain't that pick swinging?
CLAUDE	m	It's too hot, boss. I'm tired.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	He says it's too hot, boss.
DILLARD	?	Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that  lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi  ain't interested in his meteorological  assessments.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Listen up, jiggaboo! State of  Mississippi ain't interested in  your... in your... metropolitan assets!
DILLARD	?	Tell him the state of Mississippi is  only interested in getting this ditch  cleared by sundown.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	State of Mississippi wants this ditch  cleared by sundown. You got that?!
CLAUDE	m	I got it... boss.
DILLARD	?	He don't sound like he's from 'round  here.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	He's from New York City. That one,  too.
DILLARD	?	New York. That's up north, ain't it?  They'll find we do things different  down here.
RAY	m	We noticed.
DILLARD	?	Looks like we got a couple of live  ones. How long these boys in for?
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Judge gave 'em the long ride.
DILLARD	?	Life, huh? They step outta line again,  we'll shorten up that sentence real  fast.
BISCUIT	m	Drink it up!
POKER FACE	m	Either of you new fellas know how to  read? I've had this letter four months  now.
CLAUDE	m	You can't read? None of these guys  can read?
WILLIE	m	Last fella who could read made parole  'round Christmas.
POKER FACE	m	I don't even know who this is from.
RAY	m	Here, gimme that.
RAY	m	It's from your mama's neighbor, Mrs.  Tidwell. She thought you oughta know  that your second cousin Bo died.
RAY	m	And your other cousin, Sally, on  your daddy's side, she died.
RAY	m	Apparently, your sister died.
POKER FACE	m	Jenny?
RAY	m	No, it says Marleen here.
RAY	m	Oh, wait, looks like Jenny died,  too.
RAY	m	Then it goes on for a while about  how the crop didn't come in on  accounta the frost. She finishes up with something about  a tornado and how your mama and your  daddy died in that. But don't worry  none. She'll take care of the dog.  That is, if it gets over the worms.
POKER FACE	m	Appreciate it.
RAY	m	Anybody else need anything read?
JANGLE LEG	m	How you doin'?
CLAUDE	m	I'm all right.
JANGLE LEG	m	You ever done time before?
CLAUDE	m	You kidding? I've been in and out of  prison my entire life. Mostly in.  I'm hard-core.
JANGLE LEG	m	Then you won't have no problem making  the adjustment. You need anything,  help of any kind, gimme a holler.  Name's Jangle Leg.
CLAUDE	m	'Preciate it. Claude.
JANGLE LEG	m	Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
CLAUDE	m	I try to moisturize regularly.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Hey, Jangle Leg, what'd I tell you  about pitching woo on the job?
JANGLE LEG	m	Sorry, Cap'n.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Break's over! Back to work!
CLAUDE	m	Why do you think they call him Jangle  Leg?
RAY	m	Somebody just told me he wins the  three-legged race every year.
CLAUDE	m	So?
RAY	m	He does it all by himself.
RAY	m	What is that?
COOKIE	f	Creamed chip beef on toast. Except  we're outta beef, so I had to  improvise.
RAY	m	Can't I get one of those steaks you  got grilling back there?
COOKIE	f	Those are for trusties, unless you  got thirty cents or two packs of  cigs.
CLAUDE	m	Excuse me, I don't like it when the  food touches each other, so if you  could just --
BISCUIT	m	Eyes front, mister!
COOKIE	f	Problem with the toast?
CLAUDE	m	It's fine now.
RAY	m	Stop aggravating people. Just eat  your food.
CLAUDE	m	This fork is filthy.
RAY	m	The fork is the least of your worries,  Claude.
RAY	m	What's your name?
WILLIE	m	Me? Willie Long.
RAY	m	What are you in for, Willie?
WILLIE	m	That's a long story...
RADIO	m	When he was 13 years old he killed a  son-of-a-bitch with a claw hammer.
WILLIE	m	They never proved that.
CLAUDE	m	What a second, you've been in here  since you were thirteen?
RAY	m	What about you, Radio?
RADIO	m	Armed robbery.
JANGLE LEG	m	Damn liar. Bitch killed his sister  with an axe.
RADIO	m	She was my half-sister. Shit, I ain't  the son-of-a-bitch who poisoned my  own parents.
BISCUIT	m	They deserved it. Very strict.
POKER FACE	m	What about you, Biscuit? You nearly  skinned your poor old landlady alive.
COOKIE	f	At least he didn't kill Santa Claus  with his bare hands.
RAY	m	You killed Santa Claus?
BISCUIT	m	On Christmas Eve.
POKER FACE	m	He wasn't the Santa Claus, he was  just wearing the suit and ringing a  bell.
WILLIE	m	What did you guys do?
RAY	m	I kinda lost track of how many people  we killed that night. Must have been  15 or twenty -- not counting women  and children. It was a real bloodbath.  All that screaming...
CLAUDE	m	Pack of lies. Don't listen to him.  We didn't kill nobody. We were  railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
RAY	m	He just blocked it out. Nigger's  crazy. He's the one who did all the  stabbing. He's capable of some heinous  shit. How 'bout him down there?
WILLIE	m	Goldmouth? They say he was born out  back behind the shithouse. That's  what they say.
RAY	m	You all been here a long time. Doesn't  anybody ever escape from this place?
WILLIE	m	They run but they never get too far.
RADIO	m	Couple years back, Cookie made it  clear to Greenville.
RAY	m	Greenville, that the nearest town?
WILLIE	m	It's a two-day walk if you don't get  lost. Take a mighty cagey country  boy to navigate the woods and bayous  between here and there.
BISCUIT	m	Those dogs they got can sniff a skid  mark in your underpants from a half- mile off.
RAY	m	Alright, well, let's say you make it  to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
COOKIE	f	Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
POKER FACE	m	That's where they nabbed him.
COOKIE	f	Didn't even get to have my peach  cobbler.
WILLIE	m	The most important thing they got in  Greenville is a train that heads up  north.
GOLDMOUTH	?	Hey, girl, you gonna eat your corn  bread?
CLAUDE	m	No, man. I want you to have it.
RAY	m	Wait up there, Claude. You give that  guy your corn bread and the next  thing you know you'll be ironing his  shirts and clipping his toenails.
GOLDMOUTH	?	Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
RAY	m	My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I  love corn bread.
RAY	m	I thought my mama made good corn  bread but this is really something  special.
RAY	m	Who knew I'd have to come all the  way down to this here prison, deep  in the asshole of the great state of  Mississippi, to find such a tasty  piece of corn bread?
RAY	m	And who knew that in this great corn  bread-making institution I'd come  face to face with the biggest,  ugliest, stinkiest, ugliest gold- mouthed negro in the entire world.  Now get out of my face before I lose  my appetite!
GOLDMOUTH	?	How you like your corn bread now,  New York?
RADIO	m	Come on, New York, you can do better  than that! Get up and show him how  they do it in Harlem!
COOKIE	f	I appreciate you going to all this  trouble over my corn bread. I don't  get a lot of compliments in my line  of work.
WILLIE	m	Your pal's getting the tar whipped  out of him on your account.
CLAUDE	m	How many times I got to tell you? He  ain't my pal. Besides, he looks like  he knows what he's doing.
CLAUDE	m	Alright, alright...
CLAUDE	m	Hey, Ray, I think you made your point,  whatever that is. Maybe now's a good  time to throw in the towel. You know  what I'm saying?
RAY	m	Shit, Goldmouth. Back in New York, I  know bitches who hit harder than  you.
WILLIE	m	The man's taken enough of a beating.  Let's get him inside.
RAY	m	Got him good, huh, Claude? He won't  be bothering us anytime soon.
BISCUIT	m	Shame, shame, that's your name.
CLAUDE	m	Request permission to go to the tonk,  boss.
DILLARD	?	I don't see no wedding ring, Banks.  Conjugal visits are for married  prisoners only.
CLAUDE	m	You think you could make an exception  just this once, boss? She came all  the way down from New York.
DILLARD	?	I don't need the Baptists on my back,  but I suppose I could issue a  temporary marriage license for a  nominal fee.
DILLARD	?	I now pronounce you man and wife. Claude Banks going to the tonk!
RAY	m	Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle  Leg, you think you could squeeze me  in?
BISCUIT	m	Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit  needs some gravy.
RAY	m	I'm talking about a haircut.
BISCUIT	m	Cost you a pair of nylons.
POKER FACE	m	Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe  me. Ain't it so they got trains up  in New York City that run under the  streets?
RAY	m	They're called subways. A nickel  will take you from one end of  Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride,  too.
RADIO	m	Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton  Club?
RAY	m	Sure I've been to the Cotton Club.  It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold  a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's  where the real action is.
WILLIE	m	What's the Boom Boom Room?
RAY	m	That's my joint. The swinginest  nightclub in town.
COOKIE	f	You got your own nightclub?
RAY	m	Well, not yet. It's still in the  planning stages.
GOLDMOUTH	?	So it don't exist.
RAY	m	Just because it's in my mind,  Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real.  Everything worth anything starts  with a dream.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Gibson! Got yourself a visitor!
RAY	m	Mama?
MAMA GIBSON	f	Rayford!
RAY	m	What are you doing here, mama?
MAMA GIBSON	f	I heard some things so I went to see  Spanky Johnson. He told me what  happened and gave me some money to  get down here. What happened to your  face?
RAY	m	Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas,  this here is my mama. These are some  of my friends. That's Willie, there's  Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth,  Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
WILLIE	m	Mrs. Gibson. Shame on Rayford here  for failing to mention that he had  such a beautiful mama.
MAMA GIBSON	f	Nice to meet you all.
GOLDMOUTH	?	How was your train ride?
MAMA GIBSON	f	Quite comfortable, thank you.
COOKIE	f	Them cookies in there?
MAMA GIBSON	f	Yes, oatmeal.
RADIO	m	'Scuse me, you got any batteries on  you?
MAMA GIBSON	f	No. No I don't.
BISCUIT	m	That's a lovely dress. Make it  yourself?
MAMA GIBSON	f	Yeah...
RAY	m	This is a big surprise, mama. I sure  didn't expect to see you down here.
MAMA GIBSON	f	Rayford, I wanted so much more for  you than this.
RAY	m	Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so  bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard,  but there's plenty fresh air and  sunshine... And you know something  else, I've taken to going to church  regular. They got services every  Sunday right there in the mess hall.
MAMA GIBSON	f	Don't you lie to me, Rayford. You still have your daddy's watch? Well, this is all I can give you. I  wish it was more.
RAY	m	I can't take that, mama.
MAMA GIBSON	f	Don't argue with me. You need it  more than I do. I know how a little  money can help in a place like this.
RAY	m	I can't believe this. I always said  I'd never end up like this. I thought  I'd make something of myself, do  something with my life. You know, be  successful. Have a big house, a  family. Now I'm gonna end up just  like daddy.
MAMA GIBSON	f	Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever  say that. He gave up hope. That's  where you gotta be different.
RAY	m	They gave me life, mama.
MAMA GIBSON	f	I gave you life. And they can't take  it away from you. Remember that.  You'll get outta here someday. I  believe that. You gotta believe it,  too.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Time's up, Banks! We got a crowd  gathering out here!
CLAUDE	m	Woman came all the way from New York,  goddamnit! We'll come out when we're  good and ready!
CLAUDE	m	Did you go see my cousin Maynard  like I asked you in my letter?
DAISY	f	Of course I did. He said he'd file  an appeal right away. You didn't  tell me he was so good looking.
CLAUDE	m	Yeah, that side of the family has  all the looks and none of the brains.  I hope he don't mess things up.
DAISY	f	He seemed like a pretty good lawyer  to me. His offices take up an entire  floor of that big, new building on  125th Street, and he was using all  these words I never heard before. He  even offered me a job.
CLAUDE	m	A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real  nice. You won't have to work long.  I'll be back soon enough. After I  start work at First Federal Bank of  Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in  style. Everything will get back to  normal again. That's a promise.
DAISY	f	Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to  know if he should file the appeal on  behalf of your friend, too.
CLAUDE	m	Ray Gibson? No, no. He's the reason I'm in here,  Daisy. For all I know, he's got a  record a mile long. I got a better  shot of getting out of here on my  own. You tell Maynard to think about  me, concentrate on me. Understand?
DAISY	f	Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
DILLARD	?	We lost yesterday on accounta the  rain. That means we gotta make up  for it today, so put your backs to  it.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	You heard the boss! Let's move!
WILLIE	m	Looks like a scorcher.
RADIO	m	I bet the son of a bitch goes over a  hundred and ten.
POKER FACE	m	I'll take that action.
WILLIE	m	Man down, boss!
DILLARD	?	You two, put him on the truck!
RAY	m	Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
CLAUDE	m	So?
RAY	m	You know what I'm saying.
CLAUDE	m	Yeah, I know what your saying. And  I'm saying if you made it that far,  they'd be watching every train that  pulls out of that station.
RAY	m	That's why we won't take the train.  Cookie showed me where there's a  farm house. They got a boat there.
CLAUDE	m	What do you know about boats? I bet  you can't even swim.
RAY	m	What I know about boats is they take  you to freedom. Come on, man. I think  we can do this.
CLAUDE	m	Why are you always talking about we?  There is no we. There is a me, there  is a you. But there is no we between  us.
RAY	m	You want out of this place, don't  you? Don't tell me you're starting  to like it here.
CLAUDE	m	No, I don't like it here. Look around.  There's nothing but ass. Male ass!  Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm  getting out of here.
RAY	m	What does that mean?
CLAUDE	m	Forget it.
RAY	m	I'm not gonna forget it. What does  that mean? If you've got a plan, I  think I have a right to know about  it. I told you my plan.
CLAUDE	m	Getting a map from a chubby chef  named Cookie? Dragging our asses  through the swamps in search of some  worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan,  that's a vacation for two in the  hole. When you've got a map to New  York City, you get back to me.
JANGLE LEG	m	Sure was hot out there today.
COOKIE	f	Still too hot to sleep.
RADIO	m	Every bone in my body feel like a  big son-of-a-bitch dog got hold of  it.
GOLDMOUTH	?	I can't wait 'til Sunday.
CLAUDE	m	What's so great about Sunday? Monday's  right after it.
RADIO	m	Hey, Ray, what's the name of that  nightclub of yours?
RAY	m	You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
RADIO	m	That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure  would like to see that place when  you get it up and running.
RAY	m	You should have come by last night,  Radio. You woulda had yourself some  fun.
WILLIE	m	Last night? What are you talking  about, Ray?
RAY	m	I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly  blew the roof off the joint.
POKER FACE	m	Who?
RAY	m	Satchmo.
GOLDMOUTH	?	You mean Louis Armstrong?
RAY	m	He's a good friend of mine. Drops by  the club whenever he's in town.
CLAUDE	m	Hey, do we have to listen to this  bullshit? I'm trying to get some  sleep around here.
RAY	m	Yeah, things were hot last night,  but you'll never guess who's playing  tonight.
BISCUIT	m	A tisket a tasket...
RAY	m	That's right, fellas. Catch any cab  heading uptown. All the drivers know  Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
GOLDMOUTH	?	Hey, Ray...
GOLDMOUTH	?	Where am I at, man?
RAY	m	C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta  watch the front door.
WILLIE	m	Hey, Ray, I could get used to this!
COOKIE	f	Ray, my man, this steak is like  butter!
RAY	m	Made just for you, Cookie.
COOKIE	f	How about some steak sauce?
RAY	m	No problem. Oh, boy!
RAY	m	How about some Worchestershire sauce!  And clean that damn table.
POKER FACE	m	Hey, Ray, I know you got some  gambling!
RAY	m	C'mon, Poker Face, what's a club  without some dice?
POKER FACE	m	Lucky seven! My nigger! Let it ride!
JANGLE LEG	m	Sing, girlfriend!
RADIO	m	Hey, Ray, looks like trouble!
HOPPIN' BOB	m	You don't shut up, you're gonna spend  the rest of the night in the hole,  Gibson! That goes for the rest of  you girls, too. I don't want to hear  another peep about no Boom-Boom  fucking Room!
COOKIE	f	Sorry, Cap'n.
RADIO	m	Pretty good story, Ray. Didn't much  care for the ending though.
DILLARD	?	Mail call!
DILLARD	?	Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!...  Banks!
CLAUDE	m	Here!
RAY	m	Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at  law.
CLAUDE	m	Gimme that. That doesn't concern  you.
RAY	m	I'm sure it don't.
CLAUDE	m	What's up, Ray?
RAY	m	Claude.
CLAUDE	m	Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain  later?
RAY	m	What do you want, Claude?
CLAUDE	m	What do I want? What makes you think  I want something?
RAY	m	My daddy always said when a man starts  talking about the weather keep you  hand on your wallet.
CLAUDE	m	Your daddy must have been a helluva  guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure  wish I could have met him --
RAY	m	Cut the bullshit. What do you want,  Claude?
CLAUDE	m	You still got that map?
RAY	m	Yeah.
CLAUDE	m	Well, if you're still thinking about  booking it, I want in. I think we  can make it.
RAY	m	We? Did I hear you say we? As I  recall, you're the one who said there  is no we. Guess we got some bad news  in that letter, huh?
CLAUDE	m	Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer.  He filed an appeal on my behalf --
RAY	m	On your behalf. What happened to we?
CLAUDE	m	The appeal was denied. Then Daisy  went and fell for Maynard. They're  engaged to be married, can you believe  that?
RAY	m	Well, let's just think about that  for a moment. He's a successful lawyer  up in New York City and you're down  here with a bright future in the  cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny,  miney, Maynard.
CLAUDE	m	Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm  telling you, you and me, that map,  we can go places.
RAY	m	You know what, Claude? This whole  time we've been down here, you've  done nothing but think about yourself,  acting like this whole thing is my  fault. That plan with your cousin,  did that include me?
CLAUDE	m	No.
RAY	m	At least you're honest for once. So  now you want to be my friend? Well,  let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a  lot to learn about friendship.
CLAUDE	m	Does that mean I'm in?
RAY	m	I don't think so, Claude. You'd just  slow me down. We'd have to stop every  five minutes so you could polish  your silverware. There's no way around  it, you're soft.
CLAUDE	m	What'd you say?
RAY	m	I said you're soft.
CLAUDE	m	Don't call me that. You know I hate  it when you call me that.
CLAUDE	m	Damn, that felt good. I should have  done that the first time I met you.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Now you girls set aside your  differences and get back to work or  I'll see to it --
RAY	m	-- we'll spend a night in the hole.  We heard this shit before.
CLAUDE	m	What the fuck are you laughing about?
HOPPIN' BOB	m	All in, boss!
DILLARD	?	Move it out.
HOPPIN' BOB	m	Movin' it out, boss.
CLAUDE	m	You did it, man! You got us out!  Next stop, New York City!
RAY	m	New York's a long way's off. Let's  just keep moving, okay?
CLAUDE	m	I know these trees all look the same,  but I'm getting an awful familiar  vibration from this one right here.  You sure you know where we're going?
RAY	m	Absolutely. The map is very clear.
CLAUDE	m	Let me take a look at that map.
CLAUDE	m	You call this a map? What was Cookie  smoking when he drew this?
RAY	m	Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
CLAUDE	m	You drew this?!
RAY	m	I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't  have a map.
CLAUDE	m	That gripes my soul, man. We're out  here in the middle of nowhere. There  is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't  tell me you don't know where we're  going!
CLAUDE	m	Hey, wait up!
CLAUDE	m	Come on, Ray, time to go!
RAY	m	I'm stuck!
MAE ROSE	f	Look, daddy. They caught those two  men who escaped last night.
ABERNATHY	m	They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're  convicts. And nigger convicts to  boot. Can you say nigger?
MAE ROSE	f	Nagger?
ABERNATHY	m	No, nigger.
MAE ROSE	f	Nigger.
ABERNATHY	m	That's my girl.
DILLARD	?	Here they are, Superintendent. We  tracked 'em all the way to the  Tallahachie.
ABERNATHY	m	That's quite a ways. I'm glad you  New York boys could see some of our  lovely countryside while you're down  here. What do you say, Mae Rose? How  should we teach these two a lesson?
MAE ROSE	f	A night in the hole?
ABERNATHY	m	Better make it a week.
DILLARD	?	See you in a week, boys.
RAY	m	Hey, Claude. I just want to say thanks  for coming back for me.
CLAUDE	m	Don't mention it.
RAY	m	Hell, you'd probably be half way to  New York by now...
CLAUDE	m	I'm serious, man. Don't mention it.  Ever.
COOKIE	f	I'll take Claude to die on Wednesday  for fifty cents.
POKER FACE	m	Wednesday for two bits. And don't  forget you already owe me a steak.
BISCUIT	m	I'll take Claude for Friday. That's  my birthday.
RADIO	m	Weatherman says a heat wave's coming.  I say neither one of 'em son of  bitches gonna last past Thursday.
POKER FACE	m	I told you before, I don't take  pennies. Two cigarettes or one nickel  minimum. What about you, Willie?  Gonna get in on this action?
WILLIE	m	I got a crispy new dollar bill says  both of them gonna make it.
POKER FACE	m	Now that's what I call a bet.
GOLDMOUTH	?	It's a mighty long shot, Willie.  Nobody ever made it a week in the  hole.
JANGLE LEG	m	Not in August, anyway.
POKER FACE	m	Who else has some guts around here?
ABERNATHY	m	I don't think these boys have learned  their lesson. Let's give 'em another  week for good measure.
DILLARD	?	Sure you want to do that, sir?
ABERNATHY	m	Don't you ever question me, Sgt.  Dillard. When I give an order, you  jump to it, or I'll kick you and  that first-cousin you call a wife  outta that pretty little house so  fast it'll make your pin-head spin.  You got that?
DILLARD	?	Yes, sir.
POKER FACE	m	Well, they made it a week. Looks  like you win, Willie.
WILLIE	m	Let it ride.
RAY	m	Claude? You alright?!
CLAUDE	m	Can't take it no more, Ray! Die,  motherfucker! Gotta get the fuck  outta here!
RAY	m	Keep it together, Claude. You wake  up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
CLAUDE	m	He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting  outta here one way or the other!  Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
RAY	m	All right, man, just settle down.  We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll  get outta here real soon.
CLAUDE	m	How the fuck are we gonna do that,  Ray?!
RAY	m	We'll just get off at the next stop.
CLAUDE	m	Say what?
RAY	m	That's right, we'll get off at the  next stop. The train's pulling into  the station right now.
CLAUDE	m	The hell you talking about? What  train?
RAY	m	We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred  and Sixty First Street.
CLAUDE	m	Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's  Yankee Stadium.
RAY	m	Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers  are playing a double-header against  the Red Sox.
CLAUDE	m	Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
RAY	m	I don't know. Who do you want?
CLAUDE	m	Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
RAY	m	Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right  here in the program. He's warming up  right now. Man, we're so close to  the field I need cleats. How'd you  get such good seats?
CLAUDE	m	I know people.
RAY	m	They must be the right people. Whoa,  there goes the hot dog man. Let's  get a couple. Damn, that smells good.  Nothing like a ballpark hot dog,  huh?
CLAUDE	m	You get ketchup?
RAY	m	Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot  dog? Mustard's what you want.
CLAUDE	m	I can't eat it with mustard.
RAY	m	Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat  it myself.
CLAUDE	m	What am I gonna eat?
RAY	m	You can starve to death for all I  care. Now shut up, the game's about  to start.
CLAUDE	m	Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup  today?
RAY	m	Of course, he's in the lineup. There  he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
RADIO	m	What's going on? Are they alive or  dead?
GOLDMOUTH	?	Don't look too good.
POKER FACE	m	They're not moving.
CLAUDE	m	Hey, Ray...
ABERNATHY	m	Sergeant Dillard, make sure these  two are out in the fields first thing  in the morning.
DILLARD	?	Go on, get inside.
DILLARD	?	...Camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so  whatever you've done to get here,  believe me, we are not impressed.  You new men are probably noticing  that we have no fences here at Camp  8. We don't need no fences, we have  the gun line. It runs from shack to  shack clear around the yard --
DILLARD	?	What the hell you think you're doing?
OLD GUY	m	Excuse me, boss. That kid don't talk.  Something wrong with his head, just  can't get right, boss.
DILLARD	?	Can't get right, huh? We'll see how  long he last. Now, where was I?
HOPPIN' BOB	m	We don't need no fences at Camp 8,  boss.
DILLARD	?	That's right. We don't need no fences,  we have the gun line. It runs from  shack to shack clear around the yard.  You are now inside the gun line...
RAY	m	If you step outside the gun line  without my permission, you will be  shot. If you trip and fall over the  gun line, you will be shot. If you  spit, if you pee, if you stick your  ass out and take a dump over the gun  line, you will be shot...
CLAUDE	m	I try to teach 'em the finer points  of the game, share my wisdom, but I  don't know why I bother. They don't  listen, they sure don't learn...
RAY	m	What you're dealing with here is a  complete lack of talent.
CLAUDE	m	I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the  championship. Every year they get to  roast the victory pig and we get  dick. This year I want that pig.
CLAUDE	m	Alright, Radio, there you go. Who  wants to hit next?
RAY	m	You want to hit? Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a  shot.
CLAUDE	m	Him?
RAY	m	Can't be worse than any of these  other fools.
CLAUDE	m	All right, grab the bat. Let's see  what you can do.
CLAUDE	m	Jangle Leg's gonna throw the ball  nice and easy. You just go ahead and  take a swing.
CLAUDE	m	Okay. Let's try that again. This  time give it a little juice.
RAY	m	Told ya.
RADIO	m	I heard Camp 12 got themselves a son- of-a-bitch used to pitch for the Mud  Hens.
GOLDMOUTH	?	That boy got a year for jay-walking.
RAY	m	Judge must have money riding on the  championship.
CLAUDE	m	Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the  mound. All I know is when this  season's over Camp 8's gonna have  pork chops.
POKER FACE	m	Looks like little Mae Rose has grown  up.
BISCUIT	m	And out.
COOKIE	f	Mmm-mm, that girl's got gams.
CLAUDE	m	She's got it all. And it's firm and  round and fully packed.
RAY	m	You shred it, wheat. That there is  fresh water.
RAY	m	Be cool, man. You can look, just  don't drool.
ABERNATHY	m	How was the honeymoon? Am I gonna be  a grandaddy soon?
MRS. ABERNATHY	f	Don't pay attention to the  superintendent, Tom. You're going to  stay for supper, aren't you?
TOM	m	Afraid not. I'm shipping out this  afternoon.
POKER FACE	m	Think you can handle something that  big, Cookie?
COOKIE	f	I handled your mama, didn't I? Don't  y'all worry. I got plans for that  bad boy. Ain't none of him going to  waste.
DILLARD	?	Banks! Get over here!
DILLARD	?	This is Stan Blocker. Scout for the  Nigger Leagues.
BLOCKER	m	Negro Leagues, actually. Pittsburgh  Crawfords. Ever hear of us?
CLAUDE	m	We get the games on the radio  sometimes.
BLOCKER	m	We played down in Jackson yesterday.  Heard a rumor you've got a boy up  here who can hit the ball a ton.
CLAUDE	m	You probably mean Can't Get Right.  That's him over there.
BLOCKER	m	Can't Get Right? That's the kid's  name? Can I talk to him?
CLAUDE	m	You can try, but you won't get too  far. Why you interested?
BLOCKER	m	Crawford's are always looking for  new talent.
CLAUDE	m	Maybe you didn't notice, but this is  a prison.
BLOCKER	m	There are ways around that. Right  sergeant?
BLOCKER	m	Nice looking squad. See you after  the game.
MRS. ABERNATHY	f	Of course, the superintendent's hoping  for a boy, but personally, I'd prefer  a girl.
MRS. DILLARD	f	Whatever it is will be a little gift  from heaven. Look at the way she  glows.
CLAUDE	m	You're my boy, just keep what little  mind you have focused on the game.  If you hit that ball the way I know  you can, you might just be our ticket  off this farm.
BLOCKER	m	Mark my words, within five years  there's gonna be a colored man playing  in the majors.
RAY	m	Come on, the world hasn't changed  that much.
BLOCKER	m	Maybe not yet. But it will. And I'll  be out of a job. Damn, that's some  tasty hooch.
CLAUDE	m	It's amazing what Ray here can do  with a couple of pounds of potato  skins and some molasses.
RAY	m	So, Blocker, what do you think of  our boy?
BLOCKER	m	I think that boy could be the next  Josh Gibson. I'm gonna talk to the  front office about him, you can bet  on that. Damn, it's getting late. We  got a game in Memphis tomorrow.
CLAUDE	m	What about us? Don't forget to mention  us.
RAY	m	We're like his handlers. He can't  function without us.
BLOCKER	m	I'll put in a good word for you.  You've done a good job with that  boy. Thanks for your hospitality.
ABERNATHY	m	Uh, doctor...
DOCTOR	m	She'll be fine. She just had a bit  of a shock.
ABERNATHY	m	Is Mae Rose okay?
DOCTOR	m	She's doing just fine.
ABERNATHY	m	And the baby?
DOCTOR	m	He's a big one.
ABERNATHY	m	It's a boy! Well, let's get a look  at him.
ABERNATHY	m	Well, where is he? Where's my new  grandson?
POKER FACE	m	You really think they'll let him out  of here just to play baseball?
WILLIE	m	Why not? Boy's got God-given talent.
CLAUDE	m	God may have given it, but Claude  Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
RAY	m	Damn straight. I expect those  Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
CLAUDE	m	Crawfords.
RAY	m	Whatever.
COOKIE	f	Heads up, here comes trouble.
DILLARD	?	Alright, listen up! I want every man  lined up out here in the yard on the  double! Let's move it!
HOPPIN' BOB	m	You heard what the man said! Move  it!
ABERNATHY	m	I know it was somebody from this  camp. I can feel it in my bones.
ABERNATHY	m	Do you know who the father of that  little chocolated baby is?
ABERNATHY	m	Well, then, who is it?
RAY	m	The baby's mine, boss.
CLAUDE	m	He's lying, boss. I'm the father of  that baby.
WILLIE	m	Actually, it was me, boss. I know I  may look old...
BISCUIT	m	Any fool could see that baby's mine,  boss.
COOKIE	f	I beg to differ. That cute little  rascal belongs to me...
POKER FACE	m	I'm the father...
RADIO	m	I'm the father, boss...
GOLDMOUTH	?	I'm the father...
JANGLE LEG	m	I'm the father...
WILLIE	m	To Superintendent Abernathy. May he  have many more grandchildren!
CLAUDE	m	What I want to know is where? When?  How?
WILLIE	m	Wasting your breath, Claude. He ain't  the type to kiss and tell.
REV. CLAY	m	There's a sweet fragrance in the air  today.
CLAY'S DAUGHTER	f	The magnolias are blooming early  this year, daddy.
RAY	m	Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She  don't mean nothin' to him.
BISCUIT	m	Hell with him. It ain't that.
RAY	m	These are free papers.
BISCUIT	m	What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I  can't go home to my mama like this.  I'll get the strap for sure.
RAY	m	Come on, Biscuit, this is good news.  Your mama's gonna break down in tears  when you show up on her doorstep.
POKER FACE	m	I'll give you three to one she gives  him the strap.
RAY	m	It's 1945. It's a different world  now.
BISCUIT	m	Not for me, it ain't.
RAY	m	Well you can't stay here, Biscuit.  This ain't no life for a man. Any  one of these fellas would give their  right arm to be in your shoes. I  sure know I would.
BISCUIT	m	No life on the inside, no life on  the outside...
RAY	m	Hey, Biscuit...!
TRUSTY	m	Man over the line!
DILLARD	?	Goddamnit, Biscuit, get back here!
RADIO	m	Hey, fellas, I got Chicago.
CLAUDE	m	Hey, Can't Get Right, where you going?  Why you dressed like that?
RAY	m	It's a pardon from the governor.
CLAUDE	m	Let me see that.
CLAUDE	m	Where'd you get this?
CLAUDE	m	Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
BLOCKER	m	Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
CLAUDE	m	Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I  didn't see our names on that pardon.  You said you were gonna put in a  good word for us.
BLOCKER	m	I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I  mentioned you both. But the fact is,  pardons don't come cheap. The kid  can hit. What can you do?
RAY	m	Let it go, Claude.
CLAUDE	m	I'm not gonna let it go. The man  needs to explain himself. Makin'  promises.
BLOCKER	m	Look, I am truly sorry about this.  I'd like to help you...
CLAUDE	m	But you can't.
BLOCKER	m	At least the kid's getting out. Isn't  this what you wanted?
CLAUDE	m	Yeah. Of course it is.
CLAUDE	m	You show them Crawfords how to play  ball.
RAY	m	Make 'em throw strikes.
DILLARD	?	It's alright. You're a free man now.
BLOCKER	m	Don't worry, we'll take good care of  him.
RAY	m	One of the new kids said they're  farming those acres just north of  the swamp. He said he saw a crop  duster flying around the place.
CLAUDE	m	I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
RAY	m	He said they keep it parked out behind  the barn. Can't be that hard to fly  a plane. Lots of people do it.
CLAUDE	m	They're called pilots! I'm serious,  Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of  your stupid, fucked-up plans right  now.
RAY	m	I don't see you coming up with any  plans.
CLAUDE	m	My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh  right now. That congenital idiot  just got himself a pardon signed by  the governor thanks to us, but we  can't seem to do nothing for  ourselves. Don't you feel a little  disgusted right now?
RAY	m	Crop duster.
CLAUDE	m	I ain't getting in no airplane with  you. I'm finally wrapping my mind  around the concept. They threw us in  this shithole for life. Don't you  get it, Ray? We're gonna die here!  Might as well head up to the cemetery,  pick a plot and start digging.
RAY	m	My daddy died in prison. He gave up  hope and hung himself. What you're  talking about is the same damn thing.  That ain't how I'm going.
CLAUDE	m	Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray.  Maybe you're just a chip off the old  block.
RAY	m	Take that back or we ain't friends  no more, Claude Banks.
CLAUDE	m	Here's a news flash, Ray. We never  were friends. We've just been stuck  together for 12 years. It's been  nothing but bad luck since the moment  I ran into you. Every time I look at  you I get sick to my stomach thinking  about what my life could have been  if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
RAY	m	Better watch yourself Claude, before  you say something you regret.
CLAUDE	m	The only thing I regret is the day I  met you.
RAY	m	Well, if that's the way it is...
CLAUDE	m	That's the way it is.
RAY	m	Then I have nothing left to say to  you.
CLAUDE	m	You never said nothing of value  anyway.
RAY	m	Alright Willie, I think I got  everything. I'll talk to Dillard,  see if I can get up to the infirmary  and check up on you. Make sure they're  changing your diapers regular.
WILLIE	m	They'll be sending you up there soon  enough. And not just for a visit,  neither.
RAY	m	I slipped in a couple of bottles of  my latest batch. Help wash down all  them pills they'll be giving you.
YVETTE	f	Are you Claude Banks?
CLAUDE	m	Yeah.
YVETTE	f	My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me.  You look just like she said.
CLAUDE	m	She's alright, isn't she?
YVETTE	f	Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming  today.
CLAUDE	m	Why not?
YVETTE	f	She got married last month.
CLAUDE	m	Married?
YVETTE	f	Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player.  They moved down to New Orleans.
YVETTE	f	She always said that if you were on  the outside...
CLAUDE	m	But I'm not on the outside. I'm in  here.
YVETTE	f	I know she's sorry she won't be seeing  you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me  to take care of you.
CLAUDE	m	Take care of me?
YVETTE	f	You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
CLAUDE	m	I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm  not much in the mood.
YVETTE	f	Want me to come back some other time?
CLAUDE	m	Nice girl like you don't belong in a  place like this. But if you talk to  Sylvia, tell her old Claude said  congratulations.
CLAUDE	m	Whites-only pies...
TRUSTY	m	Man over the line!
DILLARD	?	Comfortable?
CLAUDE	m	As a pair of fur-lined bedroom  slippers, boss.
DILLARD	?	We'll see what those slippers feel  like after, say, 24 hours. And if  you step down off them bottles -- if  one toe so much as touches the dirt --  one of these boys is gonna shoot you  dead. Let's see. We need a special  man for this job.
DILLARD	?	How about it, Ray?
DILLARD	?	I'll make you trusty right now. If  that pie-eatin' son of a bitch falls  off those bottles and you have to  shoot him, I'll see to it you get a  pardon. Hell, I'll personally escort  you out the gate.
RAY	m	You don't want to give me a gun,  boss. I'm liable to use it on you.
CLAUDE	m	You're a sucker. I'd have taken that  deal.
RAY	m	Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
CLAUDE	m	I'd have knocked you off those  bottles, put a bullet in your ass  and be half way to New York right  now.
RAY	m	After all these years of blissful  silence, I almost forgot how annoying  the sound of your voice can be.
CLAUDE	m	I hope you don't think I owe you  anything. Because I don't owe you a  damn thing.
RAY	m	I didn't do if for you, anyway. I  just ain't no boot-licking trusty,  that's all.
CLAUDE	m	I was sorry to hear about your mama  passing.
RAY	m	That was five years ago.
CLAUDE	m	I know, but since we're talking, I  thought I'd mention it.
RAY	m	We're not talking, you're talking,  and doing too damn much of it, if  you ask me.
CLAUDE	m	What?!
RAY	m	You sure looked funny running for  those pies, bullets flying all around  you.
CLAUDE	m	Bullets weren't the problem. That  pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
DILLARD	?	Fourteen acres today and only 12  hours of daylight! Eat up and move  it out! Gibson! Banks! Get your sorry  asses over here!
DILLARD	?	Every morning I wake up praying that  Ray Gibson and Claude Banks have  died in their sleep and every morning  you disappoint me.
RAY AND CLAUDE	m	Sorry, boss.
DILLARD	?	I stand before you a defeated man.  Try as I might, I can't seem to break  you. I swear, if they dropped a  nuclear bomb on this camp, you and  the cockroaches would be the only  things left. But starting today at  least I won't have to endure your  presence any longer. You've got  fifteen minutes to clear out your  footlockers. You're both being  reassigned to the Superintendent's  mansion. And I, for one, will not  miss you.
RAY	m	I always wanted to do that. There is so much love inside of this  man.
CLAUDE	m	Oh, yard boy, these pansies could  use some attention over here. Perhaps  some fertilizer would restore their  exuberance.
WILKINS	m	Damn dentures slipping again.  Everything falls apart when you grow  old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches  on.
CLAUDE	m	Yes, boss.
WILKINS	m	You know, I'm fixing on retiring at  the end of the summer, gonna try to  enjoy what few years I have left.  What do you think of this place?  It's one of those new retirement  communities down on the Gulf.
CLAUDE	m	Ocean views, palm trees, two heated  swimming pools and a golf course --  sounds a damn sight better than that  infirmary across the way where I'm  gonna end up.
WILKINS	m	I apologize, Claude. That was rude  of me.
CLAUDE	m	That's alright, boss. Takes a lot  more than a colorful brochure to  hurt my feelings.
WILKINS	m	You been on the farm for quite a  spell, haven't you?
CLAUDE	m	Over forty years now. Me and Ray  Gibson out there.
WILKINS	m	Forty years. That's a long time for  any crime, even murder.
CLAUDE	m	It's a hell of a lot longer when  you're innocent.
WILKINS	m	Half the men in this prison swear  they're innocent. Don't you think  that's kinda funny?
CLAUDE	m	You have to forgive me if I don't  laugh.
RAY	m	You and Wilkins sure are getting  chummy. You two planning on going  steady, or something?
CLAUDE	m	He's just a lonely old man. He likes  to talk.
RAY	m	Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to  talk, too. So why don't we start by  talking about what kind of a plan  you're working on?
CLAUDE	m	I'm not working on a plan.
RAY	m	You can't fool me, Claude. I know  you got something brewing.
CLAUDE	m	Goodnight, Ray.
RAY	m	What the hell are you doing?
CLAUDE	m	Don't touch that car.
CLAUDE	m	Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he  asked me to fill in for him.
RAY	m	You haven't driven in 40 years, you  ain't even got a license. Man's taking  his life in his hands, putting you  behind the wheel! Where you taking  him?
CLAUDE	m	Greenville. We're picking up the new  Superintendent at the bus station.
WILKINS	m	You know I trust you, Claude.
CLAUDE	m	Yes, sir.
WILKINS	m	I'll be right back.
RAY	m	Damn, it was getting hot in there.
CLAUDE	m	What the hell are you doing in that  trunk?!
RAY	m	You didn't think I was gonna let you  escape alone, did you?
CLAUDE	m	I ain't escaping! We're picking up  the new super just like I told you.
RAY	m	Then you're lucky I came along.  Doesn't take a visionary to spot a  golden opportunity like this. Now  help me out of this trunk.
CLAUDE	m	You ain't getting out of that trunk.
RAY	m	Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp  up here. We have the chance right here, right  now, I say we go!
CLAUDE	m	Go where, Ray?
RAY	m	Back to New York for starters.
CLAUDE	m	And what will we do when we get there?  I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So  are you. What are we gonna do out  here? Get married, have kids, settle  down? That boat sailed without us,  man.
RAY	m	This boat's gonna sail without you,  too. I don't care if I last one day  out here. At least it's one day of  freedom. Now gimme those keys.
CLAUDE	m	Forget about that. You run if you  want to, but you're not taking this  car.
RAY	m	Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me  those keys.
CLAUDE	m	I ain't spending a month in the hole  so you can take a joy ride.
RAY	m	Don't make me take them away from  you.
CLAUDE	m	Hey, there's Wilkins!
CLAUDE	m	Who's driving now, bitch?
PIKE	m	There you go, boy.
WILKINS	m	Come on, Claude, time to go.
RAY	m	You sure it was him?
CLAUDE	m	Some faces you just don't forget.  Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
RAY	m	I don't like it, I don't like it one  bit. We shoulda taken that car when  we had the opportunity. We'd be half  way to New York by now.
CLAUDE	m	We'd be in the hole by now. Hey,  man, you're peeing on my shoe.
RAY	m	I know. Simultaneously, they shake  and zip. Claude bends down and picks  up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a  tray next to an identical one.
WILKINS	m	Lemonade?
PIKE	m	I prefer bourbon.
WILKINS	m	I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor  in the house.
PIKE	m	Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
WILKINS	m	Hunting's been pretty good on the  farm the last few years. It's one of  the perks of the job. If you're  interested, tomorrow I could show  you some of my favorite spots.
PIKE	m	You don't have to twist my arm. Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
WILKINS	m	Thank you, Claude. That'll be all  for tonight.
CLAUDE	m	Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
WILKINS	m	Goodnight, Claude.
PIKE	m	If you don't mind my saying, you  seem mighty familiar with your house  boy.
WILKINS	m	I believe in treating the convicts  with respect, if that's what you  mean.
PIKE	m	Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
WILKINS	m	If somebody deserves respect, Mr.  Pike, they receive it from me, convict  or no convict.
WILKINS	m	Well, that's a pretty good haul.  What do you say, Mr. Pike? Ready to  call it a day?
PIKE	m	Yeah, it's getting late. I could  sure use a bath.
RAY	m	That's a real nice watch you got  there, sir. Fancy old thing even  plays a little tune.
PIKE	m	Yeah, it's special. They don't make  'em like this anymore.
RAY	m	Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you  got it?
PIKE	m	Why, my wife gave it to me on our  anniversary some years back.
RAY	m	Must have been some time ago. Maybe  forty years?
PIKE	m	Something like that, yes.
RAY	m	She give you that scar, too?
PIKE	m	I oughta shoot you for that comment,  boy.
RAY	m	Like you shot Winston Hancock?
WILKINS	m	What's going on here?
PIKE	m	I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach  this uppity nigger a lesson in  manners.
RAY	m	That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you.
CLAUDE	m	Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in  a lot of trouble.
WILKINS	m	He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun  and we'll work this out.
RAY	m	I'm gonna work this man's brains out  the back of his head.
PIKE	m	Shoot him, Wilkins!
CLAUDE	m	Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with  this. Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot  this white man. See, you do that,  they'll kill you for sure. And it's  not that I like you or anything, but  I've kinda gotten used to having you  around.
RAY	m	He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I  always knew whoever took that watch  killed Winston Hancock. And that was  you, Mr. Pike.
PIKE	m	He's crazy. Don't listen to him,  Wilkins.
WILKINS	m	Do you realize what your saying,  Gibson?
RAY	m	That watch was the only thing my  daddy ever gave me. It meant the  world to me.
PIKE	m	Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please  just shoot the nigger!
RAY	m	He shoots me, I swear I'll take you  with me! I just want to hear you say  it.
WILKINS	m	Is there any truth to what he's  saying, Pike?
PIKE	m	What difference does it make? Natchez  was better off without Winston  Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for  his killing? At least the state of  Mississippi got 40 years of cheap  labor out of the deal!
CLAUDE	m	Forty years of cheap labor! Gimme  that gun.
RAY	m	No, I'm gonna kill him --
CLAUDE	m	No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
CLAUDE	m	I can't do it.
RAY	m	That's because you're soft. Gimme  the gun.
CLAUDE	m	What'd you say?
RAY	m	I said you're soft.
CLAUDE	m	Don't call me soft, I hate it when  you call me that.
RAY	m	I believe this is mine.
WILKINS	m	...I was drawing a bead on a bird  when Mr. Pike just stepped into my  line of fire.
DEPUTY #1	m	Where were the two convicts when the  shot was fired?
WILKINS	m	They were busy loading up the truck.  We got him back here as quick as  possible, but... I just feel terrible  about this...
CLAUDE	m	Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
RAY	m	He knows nobody wants to hear the  truth.
WILKINS	m	Well, I think they bought it. One of  the deputies belongs to my church.
WILKINS	m	I realize there's no way... There's  nothing I can say to make up for  forty years... I'll have Charlotte  prepare those pardon papers right  away.
WILKINS	m	Claude, mind helping me to the  bathroom?
CLAUDE	m	Sure, boss.
WILKINS	m	I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
JAKE	m	So Ray and Claude got their pardons,  right?
LEON	m	No, they didn't get their pardons,  you dumb shit! If they'd got their  pardons way back then, we wouldn't  be burying them today, would we?
JAKE	m	Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get  those pardons?
WILLIE	m	Old man Wilkins' never came out of  that bathroom. Died right there on  the crapper.
LEON	m	Just like Elvis.
WILLIE	m	Of course nobody believed Ray and  Claude.
JAKE	m	That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
LEON	m	What happened to 'em after that,  Willie?
WILLIE	m	After that? Well, let's see. After  that they got old. We all got old.
RAY	m	Nurse Humphries was checking my  prostate this morning. I got an  erection.
CLAUDE	m	An erection, huh? Haven't had one of  those in a while.
RAY	m	Tell me about it. Scared me at first.  Then, before I could figure out what  to do with it, it was gone. Imagine  my disappointment.
CLAUDE	m	Sure would like to see the house  that Ruth built one more time.
RAY	m	Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little  better. Damn thing's falling to  pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
CLAUDE	m	What do you expect? It's almost as  old as we are.
RAY	m	They oughta tear that shit down and  ship them Yankees cross the river to  Jersey.
CLAUDE	m	Remember what that place looked like  on a sunny spring day? More beautiful  than any church I was ever in.
CLAUDE	m	Looks like old Jonesy finally got  his walking papers.
RAY	m	Over to the morgue and up the hill  to the cemetery. Never thought I'd  admit it, Claude, but you were right.
CLAUDE	m	'Course I was right. About what?
RAY	m	You're the one who said that  boneyard's the only way we're getting  out of here. We're gonna join all  the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle  Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face,  Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a  plot and start digging...
GANG BANGER #1	m	Two Percodan.
CLAUDE	m	I'll raise you.
GANG BANGER #1	m	What the fuck are those?
CLAUDE	m	Keeps your cholesterol down.
GANG BANGER #1	m	I look like I give a shit about my  cholesterol?
GANG BANGER #2	m	You want a bump, G?
RAY	m	I wouldn't be putting that shit up  my nose. That came in in somebody's  ass. It's like you're sniffin' ass.  Maybe that's your thing, but it ain't  mine.
WILLIE	m	Looks like it's up to you, stinky  ass sniffer.
CLAUDE	m	Thorazine? Well, that's a little  rich for my blood.
CLAUDE	m	Damn fool gonna set this place on  fire one of these days.
RAY	m	I got three stool softeners left. That oughta be right up your alley.
NURSE HUMPHRIES	f	Who wants Jell-O?
RAY	m	Hey, where you going? We got money  on the table here!
CLAUDE	m	You know, Ray, I've been chewing on  what you said this afternoon. I think  I got a plan.
RAY	m	Are you trying to tell me after all  this time you finally have a plan  for busting out of here?
CLAUDE	m	Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
RAY	m	Don't tell me, I don't want to hear  it. It's probably all fucked up,  anyway.
CLAUDE	m	You don't want to hear it, you don't  want to hear it. There's no shame in  that.
RAY	m	It's too late for plans.
CLAUDE	m	Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson  say that. Hell with you then. You'd  only slow me down anyway.
RAY	m	Hey, man, cover that shit up!
NURSE HUMPHRIES	f	Is everyone here?
RAY	m	Hey, where's Claude? I don't see  Claude!
NURSE HUMPHRIES	f	Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him.  Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
RAY	m	He must still be in there.
NURSE HUMPHRIES	f	Wait for the firemen!
RAY	m	It'll be too late.
NURSE HUMPHRIES	f	You can't go in there, Ray! You'll  never make it!
RAY	m	I'm going in for him. He'd do the  same for me.
BURKE	m	How did it start?
FIRE INSPECTOR	m	Probably old wires. The place was a  tinderbox just waiting to go.
BURKE	m	I guess we should have torn this old  building down a long time ago.
FIRE INSPECTOR	m	Gibson made it this far before he  was probably overcome by smoke. From  the look of things, Banks never even  made it out of bed.
LEON	m	Man, you really bummed me out. That's  a terrible story. Nigger, you crying?
JAKE	m	Hell, no! I just got something in my  eye.
WILLIE	m	It's alright for a man to cry once  in awhile. Just don't make a habit  of it.
LEON	m	Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan,  anyway?
WILLIE	m	Nothing to it, really. Claude figured  they could steal a couple of bodies  from the morgue. They got a couple  of crackers working there don't know  their asses from their elbows. Then  they was gonna set fire to the  infirmary and make it look like those  bodies was them that got stuck inside.  Claude figured during the commotion,  it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto  one of the fire trucks and hang tight  until it rolled right on out of here  in the morning.
JAKE	m	What makes you think it didn't work?
WILLIE	m	I never said it didn't work.
LEON	m	You trying to tell us that's not Ray  and Claude in those boxes?
JAKE	m	What do you think about that?
LEON	m	I think that old man lost his marbles  about a hundred years ago. Come on,  let's get this over with.
FIREMAN #1	m	Alright, which of you hambones took  our clothes?
CLAUDE	m	I can't eat this.
RAY	m	Why the hell not?
CLAUDE	m	I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom  urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
RAY	m	Just put some mustard on it and eat  it.
CLAUDE	m	You didn't get ketchup?
RAY	m	Gimme that damn thing.
CLAUDE	m	What am I gonna eat?
RAY	m	Have my ice cream.
CLAUDE	m	Thanks.
RAY	m	Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh,  Claude?
CLAUDE	m	Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on  fire.
CLAUDE	m	No, this ain't gonna work either.  It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
RAY	m	So?
CLAUDE	m	They're touching.
RAY	m	If you don't eat that ice cream right  now, I'm gonna strangle you until  you are completely dead.
CLAUDE	m	Yeah? You and what army?
RAY	m	Next thing, you're gonna be  complaining about the seats.
CLAUDE	m	Well, if you must know, they could  be closer.
RAY	m	Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson  drown you in the river when I had  the chance.
CLAUDE	m	I know you're not talking to me...
RAY	m	I'm sorry, he's on medication...
