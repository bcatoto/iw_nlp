BEN	m	God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap! I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that in all your squandering the best you can do for me is A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on! It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should  fire you and go to ICM.
CATHY	f	Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad  mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as famous as you are today. The least you can do is show me a little god damn respect.
BEN	m	You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect. FUCK YOU! You're fired. Unfucking believable.
BEN	m	Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro.  Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15:
BEN	m	What's up, B.D. with the B.D.
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	Hardly as large as I'd like it to be.
BEN	m	Christine?
CHRISTINE	f	No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
BEN	m	Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly, Eight thirty.
CHRISTINE	f	All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
BEN	m	Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
CHRISTINE	f	I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
BEN	m	Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
CHRISTINE	f	Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.
BEN	m	Jesus. Hello?
VOICE	m	Hello.
BEN	m	Who is this?
VOICE	m	Who is this?
BEN	m	Well what number are you trying to reach?
BEN	m	I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
VOICE	m	Do I?
BEN	m	Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
VOICE	m	Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
BEN	m	Asshole, Can't talk.
VOICE	m	But your voice sounds so familiar.
BEN	m	Does it now?
BEN	m	Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
VOICE	m	Really? You're such a talented actor.
BEN	m	Thanks.
BEN	m	What do you mean?
VOICE	m	I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES  ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend  Christine is in there.  She's all alone.  Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film  to start. I've got my knife.
BEN	m	Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
VOICE	m	More of a game really.
BEN	m	What kind of a game?
VOICE	m	You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question.  You get it right, your girlfriend lives.  You answer wrong, she dies.
BEN	m	I swear to God if you lay a finger on her  I'll fucking kill you!
VOICE	m	Maybe so, but right now, we play the game.  First question, Your girlfriend's counting on  you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
VOICE	m	Come on. Don't you know?
BEN	m	It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character  she plays in the movie!
VOICE	m	Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
BEN	m	What?! But I did everything you said to do!
VOICE	m	That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're  taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me  beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes.  I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
BEN	m	What?!
VOICE	m	Good bye Ben.
RECORDED MESSAGE	m	Due to the high volume of calls this evening, Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is not a real emergency please call another dep-
VOICE	m	You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
BEN	m	I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
VOICE	m	No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
BEN	m	Thank God I decided to do some community service.
BEN	m	Yeah.
VOICE	m	Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
BEN	m	Where are you?
VOICE	m	Closer than you think.
BEN	m	Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
VOICE	m	To see your reaction.
BEN	m	Reaction to what?
BEN	m	OHMYGOD! NO!
THE GHOST	m	You just lost the role Ben. Consider this your parting gift.
GALE	?	Good morning Hollywood. And today officially starts the Summer movie season. Opening the box office this week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins in Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs in American Pastry, and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer in STAB 2, based off my best selling book the WINDSOR MURDERS.
GALE	?	Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed to the occasion. Today we have director of the upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
ROMAN	m	Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
GALE	?	It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
ROMAN	m	Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
GALE	?	Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though,  tell us, what'syour favorite scary movie?
ROMAN	m	Honestly, my life.
GALE	?	Your life?
ROMAN	m	Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with  those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like  I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick  your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to  a Tobe Hooper flick.
GALE	?	Would you excuse me for a moment?
ROMAN	m	Sure.
GALE	?	Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to  introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon,  or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
GALE	?	Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the  second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part  in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Both of them were found brutally murdered this  morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy  reports having come back to me yet but the  bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
GALE	?	So is that why you're here? Is that why you're  holding me from my show, to tell me about some  brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but  there's more. The killer left a note.
GALE	?	A note?
GALE	?	That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	There's more.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
GALE	?	I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is,  not going to talk.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	And who would that be?
TOM	m	Hey Dew, did you hear?
DEWEY	m	No, what?
TOM	m	Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.
DEWEY	m	That's Hollywood Tom. One day you're making movies in the hills, the next day  you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.
SARAH	f	Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
TYSON	m	And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
ANGELINA	f	I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
TYSON	m	Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
ANGELINA	f	Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
TYSON	m	And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety  now.
SARAH	f	What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
TYSON	m	(reading from script)
SARAH	f	Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
TYSON	m	I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
ANGELINA	f	There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
TYSON	m	Melinda McGraw?
ANGELINA	f	No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
SARAH	f	I know who you're talking about. Rebecca something.
ANGELINA	f	Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a stalker. Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one too. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds, Jody Foster, --
TYSON	m	Listen Miss ing�nue, your cheering me up to much, Give it a break.
TOM	m	What? What'd I do? Relax your crack sweetheart I didn't rip those two fucks up last night. Jeez. So what are you doing tonight?
TOM	m	Talk about moody.
TOM	m	And how about you good looking? Got any plans for later?
SARAH	f	Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex with that doesn't look like you.
TYSON	m	Oh no. I ain't into that shit.
GALE	?	D�jr vu-do.
VOICE	m	Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers comes running. What a shock.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you awareof last night's Events?
DEWEY	m	Yeah. A real tragedy.
GALE	?	Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside,  this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
DEWEY	m	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
GALE	?	Show him.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of  Ben and his girlfriend.
DEWEY	m	I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion. I promised her nobody would ever find her. If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to approach her with this on my own and see what she'd like to do about it.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
DEWEY	m	Understood. If you'll excuse me Detective. Gale.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I'm going to have a little chat with the producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.
WOMAN	f	GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God! Shit. Listen, I know we've never met, and  I don't mind you never returning my calls,  but I have to tell you that after two films  I feel like I am in your mind. Well, that would explain my constant headaches.   You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out  on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment'  that's a pretty good fall back. Thank you.  I'm sorry that things didn't work out  with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty  good fall back. Gives me more time for my work.   After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex  character. And to be played by an actress with such  depth and range.   No answer at Sid's. Where'd  the Detective go?
MILTON	m	I can assure you that security on the set will be at an all time high. Again, the deaths are sheer tragedy.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Well, I'd hate to see the production shut down. I myself am a big STAB fan.
BUDDY	m	Really? Have you ever thought about acting? You've got just the right face.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I am kind of dedicated to my job. Although I do enjoy taking acting around these studios anyway. I know my way around. My Uncle was a screenwriter for PARAMOUNT.
MILTON	m	Really, what was his name?
GALE	?	Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
MILTON	m	GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set! No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
SECURITY GAURD	m	Yes, Mr. Milton.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me.
MILTON	m	Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
GALE	?	Oh come on! Why the hostility?
MILTON	m	Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and  all but last month I happened to catch  your little segment on me and how my wife  left me because I'm a sex addict who  enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls.  It was a real eye opener my lawyers are  still thinking about bringing to your  superior's attentions.
GALE	?	They're the ones who approved it.
GALE	?	Alright Kincaid, no where to?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
GALE	?	Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem,  give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
GALE	?	Shit. Can I even get a ride home?
SIDNEY	m	This is Laura in Monterey reporting in for work.
OPERATOR	m	Alright Laura I'll patch you right  in to a call.
SIDNEY	m	Thanks.
WOMAN	f	Hello?
SIDNEY	m	Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
WOMAN	f	Laura I think I just killed somebody.
SIDNEY	m	Are you sure?
WOMAN	f	Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone!
SIDNEY	m	Well then the people you need to call are the police.
WOMAN	f	No I need to call you. Just you.
SIDNEY	m	I'm sorry, your voice.
WOMAN	f	Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh?
SIDNEY	m	Who the fuck is this?
WOMAN	f	It's mother, Sidney, now be a good  girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
REPORTER	m	The mutilated bodies were discovered late  last night by the L.A.P.D, prominent actor  Ben Damon was slated for a role in the  upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO --
VOICE	m	Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
SIDNEY	m	W-what do you want?
VOICE	m	I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
SIDNEY	m	You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
VOICE	m	Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
SIDNEY	m	No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
VOICE	m	Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
SIDNEY	m	The final act? Well let's play asshole!
VOICE	m	No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting  corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set  on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
SIDNEY	m	If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
VOICE	m	Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
SARAH	f	STAB 3. Oh God I've gotta get myself  a better agent.
SARAH	f	Anybody home?
SARAH	f	Doubt that. Anyone here?
TYSON	m	Stan! My man does great work.
STAN	m	Thank you. Thank you very much.
SARAH	f	Fuck you very much! Tyson go to hell! What the hell are you doing here? Where's Roman?
TYSON	m	Roman and everybody else went home for  the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
SARAH	f	Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here?
TYSON	m	No.
SARAH	f	Damn. He called my roommate and told her  he had some important things he wanted to  go over with me in his office tonight.
STAN	m	Yeah I bet.
SARAH	f	For the honorary field of directing and  cinematography in music videos. How to the point.
SARAH	f	Oh shit. Hello? Director's office.
ROMAN	m	Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running  late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10  minutes away.
SARAH	f	Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at  your   music video awards.
ROMAN	m	All right, since I got you on the phone,  let's talk about your character.
SARAH	f	What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who  gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
ROMAN	m	You're not happy with your part.
SARAH	f	I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old.  I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm  not happy that my character is too stupid not to  have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been  cut into McNuggets.
ROMAN	m	Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the  lines.
SARAH	f	Huh, fine.
ROMAN	m	Page 22, Candy's big moment.
SARAH	f	Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
ROMAN	m	Hello.
SARAH	f	Who's this?
ROMAN	m	Who's this?
SARAH	f	This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some  clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have  to start the scene in the shower!  The whole  shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I  mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
ROMAN	m	Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is  that like candy cane or candy apple?
SARAH	f	Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have  the wrong number.
ROMAN	m	But you know my favorite name?
SARAH	f	I'm hanging up right now.
ROMAN	m	It's Sarah.
SARAH	f	Roman that's not the line.
ROMAN	m	It is in my script.
SARAH	f	Has there been another goddamn rewrite?    How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our  lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
ROMAN	m	It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
SARAH	f	What?  What movie?
ROMAN	m	My movie.
VOICE	m	It's called, Sarah gets sliced like a  fucking pig. Still in character, Sarah?
SECURITY GUARD	m	Mr. Bridger?
SARAH	f	Shit.
SARAH	f	No! No! Noooo!
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
GALE	?	Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
GALE	?	Who?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
GALE	?	But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
GALE	?	Please, call me Gale.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	Mark, Bridger's in custody. We traced his phone records. He's the last person to speak to Sarah Darling before she died. Or at least call her home.
GALE	?	Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect?
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here is classified  information. Why don't you go investigate  the bad meat at the A.P. This is police work, not Pulitzer material.
GALE	?	Hey, fuck off.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	No, cool it Wallace. She's working with me.
GALE	?	So, what now?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Mr. Bridger, you didn't tell us you spoke with Sarah Darling before she died.
ROMAN	m	That's because I didn't.
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	The guard said she was there for a meeting with you.
ROMAN	m	What meeting?
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	We talked to her roommate, too.  Says you called Sarah and told her to come down to the studio.  Roommate  answered the phone, says it was you.
ROMAN	m	Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told  her to go   anywhere!
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger.
ROMAN	m	Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did  not call   Sarah Darling!
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Sarah Darling said you did.
ROMAN	m	Someone is trying to ruin my movie.   Someone wants to kill   my movie!
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	Hey, look at it this way, if anything this'll  be something interesting to put on the  director's commentary for when the film hits DVD.
ROMAN	m	been one ensie little murder. God, three people died  during the filming of The Exorcist.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Well I doubt they were stabbed to death and I  strongly doubt the killer of them left messages  on the scene for the police to find.
DEWEY	m	They found another note?
GALE	?	Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one   about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or  not it looks like we're going to have to  go  back into our past.
DEWEY	m	You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
GALE	?	This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's   attention to this shit anyway. I'll be   damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass   on the buck again.
DEWEY	m	Do you really mean it this time Gale?
GALE	?	Yes. Look, let's get something straight   Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police   came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to   make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
DEWEY	m	Why would the police come to you?
GALE	?	Again, I am the author of the definitive book on  the Woodsboro murders.! What about you?
DEWEY	m	What about me?
GALE	?	You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only  place that's real!'  But now you're here.   Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited  until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean,  it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is  like seven everywhere else.
DEWEY	m	So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a  month? L.A Forever?
GALE	?	It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
DEWEY	m	What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers?   I liked her!
GALE	?	It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
DEWEY	m	You used to say that was our strength.
GALE	?	Dewey, you're not just here because of   that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video  version of me, are you?
DEWEY	m	Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not  About you.
GALE	?	All of what Dewey?  You do know something,  don't you?
DEWEY	m	Off the record.
GALE	?	Always.
DEWEY	m	Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to  see the file on Sid, for research.
GALE	?	And?
DEWEY	m	The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name.   A month later, the station gets broken into,  the file room ransacked.
GALE	?	Someone stole Sid's file?
DEWEY	m	I already removed it.  I think someone on the  film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only  reason I came here. To make do a little  private investigating of my own and make sure no  one here was planning anything.
GALE	?	I'm sorry, this is too good!
DEWEY	m	What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
GALE	?	Right. Sorry. Do you think he did it?
DEWEY	m	I've got my suspicions but still,  nothing  you say can ever make me take  my eyes off one person.
GALE	?	And who is that?
DEWEY	m	Jennifer needs me.
GALE	?	Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
DEWEY	m	I'm on duty.
DEWEY	m	Stop following me.
GALE	?	I happen to work for the police god dammit!
DEWEY	m	You're not a detective.
GALE	?	Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
DEWEY	m	Gale, your engine's still running.
GALE	?	Fuck!
TOM	m	Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
GALE	?	Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
TOM	m	Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
GALE	?	Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
TOM	m	Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself! Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
GALE	?	I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
TOM	m	You mean what's left of us. Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
JENNIFER	f	You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
GALE	?	Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now?  What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those  USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly  you suck at acting?
JENNIFER	f	God damn you Gale Weathers!  Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his  victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so  his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's  Candy, and now me!
GALE	?	Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different  versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because  he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the  actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
JENNIFER	f	I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote  a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy.  He wrote Arlington Street.
GALE	?	Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked  with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
ANGELINA	f	What are you talking about? Because of this shit I'll probably never  act in a Hollywood film again.
TOM	m	Hey good looking, if you play your cards right,  I may be able to sit you down on my casting couch  and try you out for a few films my  production  company is working on. How do you feel about a DEEP THROAT remake?
TOM	m	I'll be right back.
TOM	m	Angelina! Hey! Where the hell are you? I was only playing! Hey look, I can really get you a bit part! Just come on out! Ok? Damn it. There goes my chances of getting some head from her.
TOM	m	Aaaangelina?
TOM	m	Angelina?
TOM	m	You fucker!
TOM	m	Fucker!
JENNIFER	f	Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
GALE	?	is that we stick together.
DEWEY	m	What about Sidney?
JENNIFER	f	What about her?
DEWEY	m	Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina. I'll get it.
JENNIFER	f	What if it's the killer?
GALE	?	Oh use your brain drama queen! Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door?  Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in  some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or  Chucky? Huh?
DEWEY	m	Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
GALE	?	Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
JENNIFER	f	Do you smell something?
DEWEY	m	It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.
DEWEY	m	Alright don't panic! Just a fuse.
DEWEY	m	Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!
GALE	?	Who's phone?
JENNIFER	f	Oh shit it's my cell!
DEWEY	m	Answer it!
JENNIFER	f	Hello?
VOICE	m	Hello Jennifer. Wanna play a little game?
JENNIFER	f	It's him! It's the killer!
GALE	?	Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
JENNIFER	f	What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
GALE	?	I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
GHOST	m	I just might!
JENNIFER	f	God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
GALE	?	No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
DEWEY	m	Gale he's dead. Come on. Let's get out of here.
DEWEY	m	OH. OH GOD. GALE --
GALE	?	What?
JENNIFER	f	(screaming)
GALE	?	Come on!
DEWEY	m	OH SHIT! RUN!
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Whoever it is, now is taking credit  for Maureen Prescott's murder.
GALE	?	But we know who killed Maureen Prescott,  Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they  even told Sidney how they did it!
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in  your book that Sidney got it wrong before.   She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother,  and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a  third killer.  Sidney Might know something
DEWEY	m	I told you, I don't know where Sidney is.   And even if there was a third killer,  Sidney doesn't know about it.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press  in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead  celebrities.
GALE	?	Four? There are five.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned  how to count.
DEWEY	m	What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
GALE	?	OK, look.  We all know that this has something to  do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the  killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
DEWEY/GALE	?	What?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Before you jump to conclusions, the man in  the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country  on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
DEWEY	m	What does this have to do with Sid?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
DEWEY	m	Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he  was married to Maureen.
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	What's your problem?  Last night you were almost  charcoal.  You gonna help us or what?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?
DEWEY	m	Is that a threat, Detective?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	When it's a threat, you'll know it.
DEWEY	m	Is that a threat?
GALE	?	Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers  later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either  Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going  to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
SIDNEY'S ANSWERING MACHINE	m	Hi, you've reached the machine. Leave a message,  talk as long as you'd like.
DEWEY	m	Sid it's me, this is the sixth time I've called. Please pick up, I wanna make sure you're Okay. Sid!
SIDNEY	m	DEWEY!
DEWEY	m	What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
SIDNEY	m	Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
DEWEY	m	What?
SIDNEY	m	I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about. Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
DEWEY	m	Follow me.
DEWEY	m	Detective Kincaid?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	What Rielly?
DEWEY	m	There's someone here who wants to help.
GALE	?	Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
SIDNEY	m	Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
GALE	?	Thank you.
DEWEY	m	Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
DEWEY	m	The killer called her.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	What?  When?
GALE	?	What'd he say?
SIDNEY	m	Oh, you know, the usual small talk,  "What's new, how ya been, how do you want  to die?"
DEWEY	m	Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've  gotten your number?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	He could've monitored the calls on a scanner.   Did you call her from the set?
DEWEY	m	No.
GALE	?	Do you have her number stored in your memory? Phone memory!
DEWEY	m	Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
GALE	?	Has anyone else every used your phone?
DEWEY	m	Just Jennifer.   And you.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
SIDNEY	m	Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey.   Why didn't you say something?
DEWEY	m	I was afraid they were bait, something to,  ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
SIDNEY	m	Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Are you sure?
SIDNEY	m	Absolutely.
DEWEY	m	Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
SIDNEY	m	Mm, what a waste of Silicone. What does my mother have to do with this  all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
SIDNEY	m	Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
GALE	?	Who's this.
DEWEY	m	Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
SIDNEY	m	She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
KAREN	f	That's me. First and Last.
SIDNEY	m	It's been a while? You still working  at Bradley's?
KAREN	f	Nope. They opened up a Hollywood Video  down the street. It pays better. Anyway, I'm here because I heard on the news about the murders and well, I found this while rooting through Randy's things.
RANDY	m	Told you I'd make a movie someday, huh?
RANDY	m	Well, if you're watching this tape, it means  as I feared, I did not survive these killings  here at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason  I am here is to help you, so that my death  will not be in vain.  That my life's work, will  help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.   If this killer does come back, and he's for real,  there are a few things that you gotta remember.   Is this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same  rules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you  find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory,  and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel  rules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing  with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding  chapter of a trilogy.
DEWEY	m	A trilogy?
RANDY	m	That's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field,  but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned  with, because true trilogies are all about going back  to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't  true from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed  something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So  if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some  super trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be  super human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him  won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta  cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him  up.   Number two; anyone including the main character can  die.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final  chapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the  time this thing is through.  Number three; the past  will come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you  think you know about the past, forget it.  The past is  not at rest, any sins you think were committed in  the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER  FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off  by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us  anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you,  you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your  back. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed,  and for some of you, I'll see you soon, cause the rules  say, some of you ain't gonna make it.  I didn't, not  if you're watching this tape.
SIDNEY	m	Thanks Karen. You be careful.
KAREN	f	Don't worry Sid. I got tickets to see Family Feud. I did have a somewhat ulterior motive for driving all the way down here.
GALE	?	I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys  later.
DEWEY	m	Do you want us to come with you?
GALE	?	I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
SIDNEY	m	I can see nothing's changed.
DEWEY	m	No.
JENNIFER	f	Geez.
GALE	?	What the hell are you doing?
JENNIFER	f	Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
GALE	?	I am Gale Weathers!
JENNIFER	f	Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie,  no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants  to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you.   So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way,  if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and  since they really want to kill you, they won't  kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
GALE	?	None.
JENNIFER	f	You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
GALE	?	And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
JENNIFER	f	That's funny.
GALE	?	Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
JENNIFER	f	Need to get in that building?
GALE	?	No really?
JENNIFER	f	There a story in that building?
GALE	?	Possibly.
JENNIFER	f	Gale Weathers would find a way.
JENNIFER	f	Basements creep me out.
GALE	?	Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
JENNIFER	f	Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
GALE	?	Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
JENNIFER	f	Bitch.
BIANCA	f	Can I help you?
GALE	?	I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro  and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman  for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
BIANCA	f	I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
GALE	?	Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
BIANCA	f	Nope.
GALE	?	Well can you tell me if the woman in this  picture looks familiar to you.
BIANCA	f	Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those  files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
GALE	?	Well if you won't work for me, will you work  for the president?
BIANCA	f	The president . . . of the studio.
JENNIFER	f	Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew?
JENNIFER	f	Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy. My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story.
BIANCA	f	Follow me.
BIANCA	f	I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
BIANCA	f	Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
JENNIFER	f	Rina Reynolds. What a stage name.
BIANCA	f	You should talk, Judy Jurgenstein.
GALE	?	What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
BIANCA	f	Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
GALE/JENNIFER	?	What?
BIANCA	f	You know, JOHN MILTON, the horror producer? Those were some of his early flicks.
SIDNEY	m	Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
DEWEY	m	Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
SIDNEY	m	No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. These two lethal weapons.
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	Sure you don't need a police escort? That's what we're here for.
SIDNEY	m	No really, I'll be fine.
SIDNEY	m	I'll be right back.
SIDNEY	m	H-hello? Anyone there?
MAN	m	Sidney.
SIDNEY	m	Shit.
DEWEY	m	Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
SIDNEY	m	Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	Wait a second? Killers? There's two of them now? Aw shit!
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	Yeah this is Wallace. We got a problem   down  here on the Sunrise Studios lot. No not another one. At least not yet. Yeah we've had an attack. Do you need medical assistance? No. Oh really. Alright, see you in a minute.
DEWEY	m	What?
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	Well I got some good news in a way. Roman Bridger didn't make those calls To Sarah Darling. Police let him go. Here's the bad news: The cellular was cloned, it's untraceable. We now have no suspects.
GALE	?	Dew!
GALE	?	Sidney, what happened?
DEWEY	m	Nevermind, what'd you two find?
GALE	?	We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
SIDNEY	m	What are you talking about?
JENNIFER	f	We've found out where she went.
GALE	?	She was an actress Sidney. Minor B-Movies. But now we have a new suspect in this twisted fucking web . . . John Milton.
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	The head of the studio?
GALE	?	It makes sense doesn't it? It's his big grandiose swan song from the genre. What a better way to end than with a bloodbath?
JENNIFER	f	Sidney, what happened?
SIDNEY	m	I was attacked in the bathroom.
DEWEY	m	Wallace, shouldn't you be investigating the bathroom?
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	I'm waiting for back-up. I don't carry bullets in my gun unless I know I'm gonna use em.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
DEWEY	m	And what made you think it was Sidney?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Sid, get in my car. You're coming    back to the station with me where it's    safe.
GALE	?	Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay      John Milton a little visit.
DEWEY/JENNIFER	?	Agreed.
MILTON	m	Roman I know you're upset. But there will be other movies. I know. Ah, VARIETY called you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I got a great script on my desk. It's called TRAGIC John Sayles. I'm thinking you for Director. What? Come in. No, not to you Roman. Look I'll talk to you later. Bye.
DEWEY	m	So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
GALE	?	Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
MILTON	m	Who?
JENNIFER	f	Rina Reynolds.
MILTON	m	Do you know how many actors have worked for me? Hundreds, thousands.
GALE	?	Nobody said she was an actor.
JENNIFER	f	Good twist.
MILTON	m	What's your point?
DEWEY	m	No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
MILTON	m	I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple  of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
JENNIFER	f	Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story  of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and  you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
GALE	?	Settle down Beavis. Why don't you tell us the truth?
MILTON	m	What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror  films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me  with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
DEWEY	m	But you know who she was.
MILTON	m	When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd  known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina.   I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
GALE	?	And now? I mean, murders on your set and  still you say nothing?
MILTON	m	Get real, that would make me a suspect!
GALE	?	Just because you knew her?
MILTON	m	Yeah.
GALE	?	I don't think so!  Just what happened to  Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
MILTON	m	Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go.   It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller  out behind the barn and shot him in the head a  long time ago.
GALE	?	Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
MILTON	m	It was in the 70's, everything was different.   I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were.   It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get  them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing  happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or  another, no matter what she said afterwards.
GALE	?	Are you saying she was-
MILTON	m	I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they  did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth  is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges  were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds  wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in  Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
SIDNEY	m	What do you know about trilogies?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	You mean like, movie trilogies?
SIDNEY	m	You seem to like movies, Detective.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep  calling you Sidney.
SIDNEY	m	I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer,  Detective.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one,  all bets are off.
SIDNEY	m	Did you request this case?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal  with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my  way around the studios.
SIDNEY	m	Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	To me Hollywood is about death.
SIDNEY	m	Excuse me?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you    see what I see day in and day out, the violence that  people do to each other, you get haunted.   I think you know about that.
SIDNEY	m	What do you mean?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't   Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head,   whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
SIDNEY	m	Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop  being haunted is to be with people.  You're here,  you're not hiding, you've done the right thing,  Miss Prescott.
SIDNEY	m	Hmm.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	What did you know about your mother?
SIDNEY	m	I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect  family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a  secret life, and I tried to understand that, and  soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't'  know who my mom was. mother for the first time. You know, with TV and  those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel  like I'm just learning about myself for the first  time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage.  That's good news.
SIDNEY	m	How is that good news?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary,  flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle  guys like that.
SIDNEY	m	Oh yeah, how?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Catch him, or kill him.
SIDNEY	m	Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie?
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	My life.
SIDNEY	m	Mine too.
JENNIFER	f	Oh God Gale, Dewey was right. Stop getting so nervous and you might stop causing me to gag!
JENNIFER	f	I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
GALE	?	Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. -off parties he has with his two best friends.
GALE	?	Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. His two hands, dingus.
DEWEY	m	Ssh ladies.
MILTON	m	John Milton.
VOICE	m	Wanna play a game?
MILTON	m	Who is this?
VOICE	m	You tell me. You bankrolled three  movies about me.
MILTON	m	have you killed! I shut down production on that piece of  shit STAB 3! We had a no talent director and the  lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was  besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John  Milton film! And if you ever try and cross me again you'll be sorry. My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up  from this slasher shit! It's a film written and directed  by John Sayles.
VOICE	m	Oh poor John. There's not gonna be another film.  Well, at least not for you.
DEWEY	m	Hold on Gale, I'm a pro at this.
GALE	?	Oh Dewey I'm sorry.
GALE	?	Here. Let me --
JENNIFER	f	Excuse me Gale! What the hell    do you think you're doing?
DEWEY	m	Let's get this drawer open. If it's locked, there must be something   inside he's trying to hide.
GALE	?	Shit. That's gonna leave a mark.
JENNIFER	f	What? What'd you find?
GALE	?	Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never  going to believe who Milton's kid is.
DEWEY	m	Who is it?
JENNIFER	f	Guys! I got a bad feeling.
JENNIFER	f	Guys there's someone else in the fucking room!
DEWEY	m	Huh?
DEWEY	m	Gale run!
GALE	?	Dewey!
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Jesus Gale what happened?
GALE	?	He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God! DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
DETECTIVE KINCAID	m	Alright, calm down. I'm going   to radio in for backup right now.
VOICE	m	Not so fast. We're not finished.
VOICE	m	I wouldn't run if I were you Gale. It's only gonna end up with you getting Skewered like a fucking pig. I need you.
GALE	?	Awfully late time to be doing an interview.
VOICE	m	I need you as bait. For Sidney.
SIDNEY	m	Hello?
SIDNEY'S VOICE	m	Hello?
SIDNEY	m	Who is this?
PHONE SIDNEY	m	Who is this?
SIDNEY	m	Um wh-who's calling?
PHONE SIDNEY	m	Um wh-who's calling?
SIDNEY	m	Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back,  I can only hear myself.
VOICE	m	I only her you too, Sidney.
SIDNEY	m	Who is this?
VOICE	m	The question isn't who I am.  The question is,  who's with me.
GALE	?	Sidney, stay away!
VOICE	m	Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract  attention, one thing, I'll kill them both.    Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
SIDNEY	m	Yes.
VOICE	m	Go there.
VOICE	m	Always hard being friends with you, Sidney.   When you're friends with Sidney, you die!   Well these friends don't have to, Sidney.   It's up to you.
SIDNEY	m	How do I know their voices are --
VOICE	m	Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things?   How do you know I'm not someone in your head?   Somewhere, you know.
DEWEY	m	Don't come here Sidney!
GALE	?	Dewey! No!
VOICE	m	Or do you?
SIDNEY	m	You're dead!
VOICE	m	I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple.  You show yourself, they survive, you run,  they die!
GALE	?	Oh God!  Oh God!
VOICE	m	Don't you want to know Sidney? Don't you want to  know who killed her?  Don't you want to know who  killed your mother?
COP	m	Have you seen Kincaid?
COP 2	m	NO.  But Wallace is around.
SIDNEY	m	Where?
VOICE	m	She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
SIDNEY	m	WHERE?
VOICE	m	I'll call you, when you're on your way.
SIDNEY	m	Fuck!
SIDNEY	m	Yeah?
VOICE	m	You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
SIDNEY	m	Alright, I'm here. Now what?
VOICE	m	You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
SIDNEY	m	I thought you wanted me here?
SIDNEY	m	Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can  finish this.
VOICE	m	It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
SIDNEY	m	Yeah?
DEWEY	m	Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
SIDNEY	m	Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
DEWEY	m	Sid I can see you!
SIDNEY	m	Where are you Dewey?
DEWEY	m	I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
DEWEY	m	Good work Sid.
GHOST	m	You play a good game Sidney. Now it's time to get down to business.
SIDNEY	m	Who are you?
GHOST	m	Your other half.
SIDNEY	m	GALE!
GALE	?	Christ Sidney hurry up! That fucking lunatic is coming!
SIDNEY	m	Gale he's got Dewey!
GALE	?	I know! He killed Kincaid!
SIDNEY	m	I know!
GALE	?	Let's get out of here!
GALE	?	Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here! He can't get us both!
GALE	?	RUNNN!
DEWEY	m	Sidney?
SIDNEY	m	Dewey!
DEWEY	m	Where's Gale?
SIDNEY	m	They've got her!
DEWEY	m	Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
DEWEY	m	OH shit!
SIDNEY	m	Oh God.
ANGELINA	f	Time to sort things out. Whatta you say?
SIDNEY	m	It's you?! All of this is because of you?
ANGELINA	f	No. Not all of it. Sid, someone really   wants to meet you.
ANGELINA	f	Uh-un Sid. You're not gonna run off. Not now.
VOICE	m	You're not going anywhere Sidney. It's time you came to terms with me, and with   mother! Maybe you never knew her at all, Sid. Maybe you can't get past the surface of things.
SIDNEY	m	Who the hell are you?
THE GHOST	m	The other half of you! I searched for a mother too,  an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her  my whole life. And four years ago I actually tracked  her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome  me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a  new name, Maureen Prescott! You were the only  child she claimed Sidney. She shut me out in the cold  forever, her own son!
ROMAN	m	She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was  Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me,  what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little  home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen,  mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one  thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father,  that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing  his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And  once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was  a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case  you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like  her was making a movie.
SIDNEY	m	All the nightmares. All the hell I went through  was because of you, you spineless bastard!
ROMAN	m	I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example,  Angelina over there, She's my partner. I can convince her to do  anything.  We've been dating since I met her in  Woodsboro.
SIDNEY	m	Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
ANGELINA	f	That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney.  I wanted to make you proud.
ROMAN	m	And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.
SIDNEY	m	Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit  before! So lets get on with it!
ROMAN	m	Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part. With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've  been able to steal your voice. Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna  find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
SIDNEY	m	I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to  make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
ROMAN	m	Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that  John Milton, was my daddy? Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run. That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead. Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone in this world. What a good reason to --
ROMAN	m	See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were, they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney, they also set the stage for you! Introducing to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the survivor! Sidney the star!
ROMAN	m	See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
SIDNEY	m	Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
ANGELINA	f	Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's freaking me out!
ROMAN	m	God damn it Sidney!
GALE	?	Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain  Gale Weathers.
GALE	?	I know all the tricks!
SIDNEY	m	Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
SIDNEY	m	DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
DEWEY	m	Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always  superhuman.
SIDNEY	m	He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
GALE	?	WHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!
SIDNEY	m	This shit is really getting repetitive, you know?
DEWEY	m	Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what  if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
GALE	?	Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	Jesus Christ what happened? I leave for two seconds to take my kid to the doctor, I come back and it's the fucking WILD BUNCH.
SIDNEY	m	It was just something that's been itching  to be completed for the past four years.
DETECTIVE WALLACE	m	I guess so.
SIDNEY	m	Take care Detective. Give my regards to the wife and kids.
