ROLFE	m	This is the story of my older  brother's strange criminal behavior  and disappearance. We who loved him  no longer speak of Wade. It's as if  he never existed. By telling his  story like this, as his brother, I  separate myself from his family and  those who loved him. Everything of  importance -- that is, everything  that gives rise to the telling of  this story -- occurred during a single  deer-hunting season in a small town  in upstate New Hampshire where Wade  was raised and so was I. One night  something changed and my relation to  Wade's story was different from what  it had been since childhood. I mark  this change by Wade's tone of voice  during a phone call two nights after  Halloween. Something I had not heard  before. Let us imagine that around  eight o'clock on Halloween Eve,  speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes  a pale green eight-year-old Ford  Fairlane with a police bubble on  top. A square-faced man wearing a  trooper's cap is driving the vehicle.  Beside him sits a child, a little  girl with a plastic tiger mask  covering her face. The man is driving  fast --
WADE	m	I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I  couldn't help it it's too late to go  trick-or-treating now. I couldn't  help it I had to stop at Penny's for  the costume. And you were hungry,  remember.
JILL	f	Who's fault is it then if it's not  yours? You're the one in charge,  Daddy.
WADE	m	Yeah.
JILL	f	Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
WADE	m	Those are the Hoyts.
JILL	f	I don't care. They're out.
WADE	m	Can't you see... look out there.  Nobody's got their porch lights on  anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt  kids are just out to get in trouble.  See, they put shaving cream all over  that mailbox there. They chopped  down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little  bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
JILL	f	Why do they do that?
WADE	m	Do what?
JILL	f	You know.
WADE	m	Break stuff?
JILL	f	Yeah. It's stupid.
WADE	m	I guess they're stupid.
JILL	f	Did you do that when you were a kid?
WADE	m	Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really  mean. Me and my pals, me and my  brothers. It was kind of funny then.  Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows.  Stuff like that.
JILL	f	Was it funny?
WADE	m	To us it was.
JILL	f	But it's not funny now.
WADE	m	It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I  gotta listen to all the complaints  people make. I'm not a kid anymore.  You change.
JILL	f	I bet you did lots of bad things.
WADE	m	What are you talking about?
JILL	f	I just think you used to be bad.
WADE	m	No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir.  Where do you get this stuff? From  your mother?
JILL	f	No. She doesn't talk about you  anymore.
LARIVIERE	?	We're looking for the funniest  costume! And the scariest! And the  most imaginative! And the best costume  of all!
WADE	m	Got here just in time. Go ahead.  Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a  prize.
WADE	m	Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you  still know.
JILL	f	I don't want to.
WADE	m	Why? Why not? You know these kids  from when you went to school here.  It hasn't been that long.
JILL	f	It's not that.
WADE	m	What then?
JILL	f	It's stupid.
WADE	m	It's fun.
JILL	f	I want to go home. I don't like it here.
WADE	m	Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't  mess this up anymore than it's already  been messed up. Join the other kids.  Do that and before you know it you'll  be as happy as a goddamned clam.
LARIVIERE	?	Wade! And who's that tiger? Is that  Jill? Come and join us.
WADE	m	What are you boys up to?
CHICK	?	Same old shit.
FRANKIE	m	You see the damage these little sons- of bitches been raising tonight?
WADE	m	You're going to have to move your  pickup.
JACK	m	I know.
CHICK	?	Take a bite.
WADE	m	Don't mind if I do.
JACK	m	LaRiviere's having a hell of a time  in there. Master of fucking  ceremonies.
WADE	m	Where's that gun you were bragging  on today?
JACK	m	No brag. Just fact.
WADE	m	Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
FRANKIE	m	Nice.
JACK	m	See you got Jill tonight. How'd you  manage that?
WADE	m	Don't forget to move your truck.
WADE	m	Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight  of you. I had to step outside for a  smoke. You find anybody you know  here? There must be some kids you  used to know from school. You want  to go tomorrow? See your old teachers?  Be more fun than hanging out with me  all day.
JILL	f	No.
WADE	m	No what?
JILL	f	No I didn't see anybody I know. No I  don't want to go to school here  tomorrow. I want to go home.
WADE	m	You are home. There are lots of kids  you still know here.
JILL	f	I don't want to be here. Don't worry,  I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want  to go home.
WADE	m	Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what.  Tomorrow morning, you still want to  go home, I'll drive you down. I'll  get off work or something.
JILL	f	I called Mommy.
WADE	m	What? You called Mommy? Just now?
JILL	f	Yes.
WADE	m	Jesus, why?
JILL	f	I... because I want to go home. She  said she'd come and get me.
WADE	m	Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn  half hour drive each way. Why didn't  you talk to me about it first?
JILL	f	See, I knew you'd be mad.
WADE	m	Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd  you tell her, for Christ sake?
JILL	f	I told her I wanted to come home.  Daddy, don't be mad at me.
WADE	m	Well, I guess I am. I planned this,  I planned all this, you know. I mean,  it's sort of pathetic, but I planned  it. You shouldn't have called your  mother. C'mon, we're gonna call her before  she leaves.
WADE	m	She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
JILL	f	Yes.
WADE	m	That's all you got to say? "Yes".
JILL	f	Yes.
WADE	m	She won't be here for a half hour.  Think you can stand it that long?
JILL	f	Yes.
WADE	m	Where do you expect to wait for her?  Obviously downstairs with the other  kids isn't good enough.
WADE	m	Sit right there by yourself if you  want. Wait for her by yourself. That's  fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going  downstairs.
JILL	f	That's fine with me too. When Mommy  comes, tell her I'm up here.
WADE	m	I thought I told you to move that  truck!
JACK	m	Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You  wanna toke?
WADE	m	You gotta be more careful about that  shit. Gordon or one of those guys  sees you smoking that wacky tabacky  around me they'll expect me to bust  you. And I'll be outta a job.
JACK	m	Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be  such a hardass. I know you got  problems, but everybody's got  problems.
WADE	m	Not here.
JACK	m	Well, c'mon, then. Get in and we'll  take a little ride, my man.
JACK	m	Got a job first thing in the morning,  first day of season. Saturday I'll  hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
WADE	m	Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official  from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
JACK	m	Don't know about lucky. The guy's a  full-blown asshole. Pay's good,  though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee  a kill, of course. Which I can do.  There's some monster bucks hiding  out up there.
WADE	m	How'd you get the job?
JACK	m	Gordon, he's always got some angle  working. He wants to keep Twombley  happy, I'm his boy.
HETTIE	f	What's wrong with you?
WADE	m	Toothache. You should get close to him. Make  yourself irreplaceable. Guy's loaded.
JACK	m	Like you and Gordon?
WADE	m	Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get  along without me.
JACK	m	Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you  quit him.
WADE	m	Right!
JACK	m	Bastard's got his high beams on.
WADE	m	Shit.
HETTIE	f	What?
WADE	m	My ex-wife Lillian and her husband.  That was them in the Audi that just  passed us.
JACK	m	Audi's a good car.
HETTIE	f	What's she up here for?
WADE	m	Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me  and Jill had a little argument. Jack,  I got to get back, get back to town.  Move this thing, will you? See if  you can get back to the Town Hall  before they get there, okay?
JACK	m	Piece of fucking cake.
WADE	m	Lillian!
LILLIAN	f	Where's Jill?
WADE	m	Me and Jill, we just had a little  spat. She felt kind of left out, I  guess, from not knowing some of the  new kids --
LILLIAN	f	Where is she now? Is she in the truck  with your friends?
WADE	m	She told me she wanted to wait for  you. Inside.
LILLIAN	f	While you went off for a few beers  with your friends? Is that Hettie  Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
WADE	m	Yeah.
LILLIAN	f	She's grown up some, hasn't she?
WADE	m	Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It  looks like you've won this fucking  round already, so lay off a little,  for Christ's sake.
WADE	m	Horner! Leave her be. This's got  nothing to do with you, so just act  like the chauffeur. Got it?
HORNER	?	Wade. Nobody wants any trouble.
WADE	m	I don't want her to go, Lillian.
LILLIAN	f	Don't cause a scene. No one's trying  to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it  any worse.
WADE	m	I'm not making it any worse. You  are. Me and Jill could've worked  this thing out. It's normal, it's  even normal for me to get a little  touchy about it. Believe it or not.  How do you think this makes me look,  treating her like some tragic victim  or something?
WADE	m	Just wait till we're through,  goddamnit!
WADE	m	Don't you say a word. I didn't hit  him. I'm not going to hit anybody.
MARGIE	f	New hat? Jill's up, I see.
WADE	m	For a while.
MARGIE	f	How's she doing?
WADE	m	Okay. She's fine.
MARGIE	f	You two want to do anything tomorrow  and need a third party, give me a  call, okay? I'm off.
WICKHAM	m	Like hell you are. Tomorrow's first  day of deer season. I'll need you at  least in the morning.
MARGIE	f	Well, that's that.
NICK	m	Take care, Wade.
WADE	m	You be careful of that little bastard.  He's dying to get in your pants, you  know.
MARGIE	f	Don't worry. I can protect my virtue.  I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
WADE	m	See you tomorrow, maybe.
MARGIE	f	You okay?
WADE	m	Yeah.
WADE	m	Tomorrow, Gordon.
LARIVIERE	?	Watch this snow. It's coming down  tonight.
WADE	m	Lugene? Wade. Hoya doin? Look, I was wondering, with the snow  and all, if you got school today? How the hell do I know? You're the  principal. All I'm supposed to do is  direct traffic from 7:30 to 8:30. Yeah, okay, I'm sorry -- I only just  now saw it was snowing, that's all.  My whole day is fucked. I gotta plow  all day. If I don't get over to  LaRiviere's early enough, I'm stuck  with the grader. I was just hoping  you'd have called school off. You check the weather bureau? Okay, I hear you. I'll be over in a  bit.
TWOMBLEY	?	It's not enough snow, not for tracking  the bastards. No advantage there,  kid.
JACK	m	Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know  where those suckers are. Rain or  shine, snow or no snow. I know deer.  We'll kill us a buck today.  Guaranteed. Before ten.
TWOMBLEY	?	Guaranteed, eh?
JACK	m	Yep. Right about now the does are  holing up in the brush piles. The  bucks are right behind them and we're  right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten  o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or  not is more less up to you. I'll put  you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck  the first four hours of the season.  That's what you're paying me for,  ain't it?
TWOMBLEY	?	Damn straight!
JACK	m	Done much shooting with that rifle  yet?
TWOMBLEY	?	Tell you what. You get me close to a  big buck by ten, kid, there's another  hundred bucks in it.
JACK	m	If you get it?
TWOMBLEY	?	Yeah.
JACK	m	You might not kill it.
TWOMBLEY	?	You think so.
JACK	m	You might gut-shoot it or cripple it  for somebody else to find and tag.  Can't guarantee that won't happen,  especially with a new gun. I may  have to shoot it.
TWOMBLEY	?	You take care of your end, kid, I'll  take care of mine.
JACK	m	Mmm.
TWOMBLEY	?	You understand what I'm saying? I  want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple  or whatthefuck.
JACK	m	I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer  and you'll get him dead. And you'll  have him by coffee time.
TWOMBLEY	?	And you'll get your extra hundred  bucks.
JACK	m	Wonderful!
LUGENE	?	Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong?  Why were you holding everyone up?
WADE	m	Did you see that sonofabitch in the  BMW? He could've killed somebody.
LUGENE	?	Did you get his number?
WADE	m	I know who it is.
LUGENE	?	Good. Who?
WADE	m	Mel Gordon.
LUGENE	?	I still don't understand --
WADE	m	From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where  they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway.  The old man's out deer hunting with  Jack Hewitt, so they probably got  some big weekend party planned.
JACK	m	Safety on?
TWOMBLEY	?	I'm okay.
JACK	m	Follow close. We'll cross the next  meadow.
JACK	m	I used to play ball.
TWOMBLEY	?	Yeah?
JACK	m	Drafted by the Red Sox.
TWOMBLEY	?	You played for the Sox?
JACK	m	Double A. New Britain.
TWOMBLEY	?	Oh.
JACK	m	Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come  out of New Hampshire since Carlton  Fisk."
TWOMBLEY	?	Really.
JACK	m	They said.
TWOMBLEY	?	Hmm.
JACK	m	The only difference between me and  that Clemens on TV is luck, shit  luck.
TWOMBLEY	?	What happened?
JACK	m	Ruined my arm. Brought me along too  fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking  arm, I used to think. Then I realized  it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
TWOMBLEY	?	Hey, Hewitt! Slow the fuck down!
JACK	m	Safety on?
TWOMBLEY	?	Yeah.
JACK	m	This way.
TWOMBLEY	?	Sun's gettin high.
JACK	m	Deers have ears too.
LARIVIERE	?	Told you the snow was coming down.  Take the grader.
WADE	m	Where's the plow?
LARIVIERE	?	Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting  with Evan Twombley.
WADE	m	His son-in-law damn near killed me.
LARIVIERE	?	Huh?
WADE	m	At the school crossing. In his BMW.  Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna  bust his ass.
LARIVIERE	?	Don't go playing policeman.
WADE	m	What am I -- a security guard? You  hired me, you and your Selectman  friends.
LARIVIERE	?	You don't want the extra police pay?
WADE	m	I'm not saying that.
LARIVIERE	?	Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's.  Don't let Lillian get to you. She  didn't belong here. That's why she  left.
WADE	m	Fuck you.
LARIVIERE	?	That's what I love about a small  town. You know everybody.
JACK	m	Stay here, stand where I am.
JACK	m	Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck,  Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
TWOMBLEY	?	You only got a little while if you  want your hundred bucks.
JIMMY	m	How's it goin?
WADE	m	Cold. How you think?
JIMMY	m	Sorry about that. Why's it every  year, come first snow, you get stuck  with the grader?
WADE	m	School. Traffic crossing. I gotta quit these things.
JIMMY	m	What we doing after? Wells? Don't work too fast. Business the  way it is, Gordon's probably looking  to lay me off earlier than usual  this year. He's got too much money  as it is. Why's it always the little  guy that gets kicked in the butt in  hard times?
LACOY	m	...That was no pisser. I'll tell you  who was a pisser. Glen Whitehouse.  There was a real pisser. He was mean  normal, but when he drank it was  like he burst on fire. Canadian Club.  Always drank CC. One Christmas there's  this cord of wood out back he forgot  about and he decides to have his two  boys stack it. Except it's been out  back two months and it's snowed and  rained and froze so now the wood's  all iced in. He takes the boys. He  was drunk, of course.
POP	m	Move it! Daylight in the swamps!
ROLFE	m	Pop, the kids are waiting for us.
WADE	m	Rolfe.
POP	m	A lesson in work and its rewards.  You'll thank me for this one day. Sally, turn off that TV!
WADE	m	Just do it.
POP	m	Atta-go.
ROLFE	m	Please, Pop. Let's go back.
POP	m	What are you, a quitter?
LONG-HAIRED LOCAL	m	So what happened?
LACOY	m	Beats me. That's all I heard. Wade  would know more about it. Wade! We were just talking about  your Old Man. "What are you, a  quitter!"
WADE	m	Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better  to do than sit around and tell  stories. Pity is, some college student  will come some day and believe this  shit cause you're the only one dumb  enough to talk to him. Take care.
POP	m	That was some job.
ROLFE	m	We'll work at it everyday, promise.
POP	m	I think we made the point.
WADE	m	You just needed a drink.
POP	m	What was that? You got something to say, say it!  Say it!
WADE	m	Nothing.
POP	m	You no-good pup!
WADE	m	It don't look right.
NICK	m	What?
WADE	m	The sign. It looks like it's spelled  wrong or something.
NICK	m	Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people  like you that keep this fucking town  from prospering. Whatever somebody  does to improve things around here,  you gotta find fault with it.
WADE	m	I'm not finding fault. It's a good  idea, good for you, good for the  town. Real modern too.
NICK	m	This town sucks.
WADE	m	Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's  something wrong with "Home Made  Cooking", that's all. The sign's  fine. What it says is wrong.
MARGIE	f	Who needs it? Everybody who comes  here has been coming for years so  what they need a sign for?
MARGIE	f	You okay?
WADE	m	Yeah.
MARGIE	f	I'm sorry about what I said.
WADE	m	Said what?
MARGIE	f	About you and Jill and needing a  third person. She went back to  Lillian?
WADE	m	Forget it.
MARGIE	f	I'm sorry.
WADE	m	I'm going to start one of those  custody suits. I don't give a fucking  shit. You know?
MARGIE	f	You don't mean that.
WADE	m	Yeah. I mean that.
MARGIE	f	No you don't. You're pissed, that's  all. You ought to cool off for a few  days then have a long talk with  Lillian. You know? Work it out with  her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's  not out to get you.
WADE	m	The hell she isn't. Lillian's been  trying to nail me to a cross since  the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me  a fucking lawyer from Concord and  get this thing, this divorce thing,  rearranged. I've been thinking about  it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or  something. Nobody owns nobody,  especially not kids. And I pay her.
NICK	m	Marg!
WADE	m	That goddamned woman. Thinks she can  cart Jill off and leave me alone  like this. I'm more than pissed,  Margie. I'm a whole lot more than  pissed. I been that plenty and I  know the difference. This is  different.
NICK	m	Marg! You got orders!
MARGIE	f	Call me.
WADE	m	Tonight. Let's get together.
MARGIE	f	Okay.
NICK	m	You talked to Jack?
WADE	m	Not since last night. He took a guy  hunting.
NICK	m	The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang!  That's what it sounds like. Not on  purpose. I assume accidental.
WADE	m	Jack?
NICK	m	The other guy.
WADE	m	Where... how'd you hear that?
NICK	m	CB. Little while ago. One of the  boys on the way in picked up Jack on  the CB calling for state troopers. I  figured you'd know what really  happened. The fucking guy kill  himself? This Twombley, who the fuck  is he, anyhow?
WADE	m	No, I... I've been out on the grader  all morning. Twombley's summer people.  Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's.  It was his idea for Jack to take him  hunting. I gotta go.
NICK	m	He don't care for you.
MARGIE	f	Stop being jealous.
LARIVIERE	?	What's the hurry?
WADE	m	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
LARIVIERE	?	Huh?
WADE	m	I figured you already heard.
LARIVIERE	?	Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving:  I got to get up there. How would I  know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take  my truck.
LARIVIERE	?	Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some  kinda accident?
WADE	m	Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not  Jack. He's okay, I assume.
LARIVIERE	?	Fuck. You don't know how bad or  anything?
WADE	m	You mean Twombley?
LARIVIERE	?	Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out  that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
WADE	m	He more than likely just shot himself  in the foot or something. That's  what usually happens.
LARIVIERE	?	I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
WADE	m	I wish you had. I'd rather be deer  hunting instead of freezing my ass  on that fucking grader.
LARIVIERE	?	You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he  can't drive the grader worth shit.
WADE	m	Like hell.
LARIVIERE	?	That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I  bet that was Twombley.
WADE	m	You want me to follow them to  Littleton?
LARIVIERE	?	Let's get to the top and talk to  Jack first. He'll know what happened.  He fucking better. If this coulda  been avoided, I'll put that kid's  ass in a sling.
JACK	m	You heard the news.
LARIVIERE	?	I hear Twombley got shot.
JACK	m	Yeah.
BROWN	m	Watch the dog, Wade. Takes a mind  to, he'll tear your fucking head  off.
LARIVIERE	?	Bad?
BROWN	m	Thirty-thirty at close range.
LARIVIERE	?	Jesus.
WADE	m	Will he make it?
BROWN	m	D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open.  Had a hole in back you could put  your head into. Pretty big hole in  front too. You could've put your  fist into that one.
LARIVIERE	?	You see it?
JACK	m	Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart.  I spotted this buck, then I heard  the gun go off and Twombley was gone.  I looked over the little cliff we  was using for a stand and there the  fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it  right in.
LARIVIERE	?	This is gonna be one fucking mess to  clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and  daughter are up the weekend. Didn't  you say you'd seen him, Wade?
WADE	m	I seen 'em. Near ran me over.
BROWN	m	You wanna tell 'em, Gordon? You knew  the old man.
LARIVIERE	?	What the fuck. My day's already  ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back  with Jack. You still got a shitload  of plowing to do.
WADE	m	It ain't done, if that's what you  mean.
LARIVIERE	?	Something bugging you?
WADE	m	Yeah. A few things.
LARIVIERE	?	Well, right now we're not too  interested. Finish up what you gotta  do, then you can get bugged on your  own time.
LARIVIERE	?	Might as well take the rest of the  day off. You look sort of fucked up.  You've been paid for the day, anyhow,  right?
JACK	m	Not exactly. I mean, he never paid  me.
LARIVIERE	?	You'll get your money. Don't talk to  any newspapers about this. Twombley's  a big deal down in Massachusetts,  you know. Tell them your lawyer says  you shouldn't comment.
JACK	m	Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do
LARIVIERE	?	No, of course not. Just say it, that's  all.
WADE	m	Where'd Twombley get shot?
JACK	m	In the chest.
WADE	m	No, I mean whereabouts.
JACK	m	A half mile in, along the old lumber  road.
WADE	m	You bring him up yourself? That's a  steep climb.
JACK	m	The ambulance guys lugged him up.
WADE	m	You stayed away?
JACK	m	Yeah.
WADE	m	Where'd you get the blood?
JACK	m	What blood?
WADE	m	On your sleeve.
JACK	m	Musta... How'd I know? What're you  doing, playing cop?
WADE	m	I gotta make a report to Fish and  Game. I was just wondering, that's  all. What'd he do, to shoot himself,  I mean?
JACK	m	Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or  something. I just heard the gun go  off.
WADE	m	I never seen a man shot before. Not  even in the service. Must be  something.
JACK	m	Well, I didn't actually see him do  it. Like I said.
WADE	m	Sure you did.
JACK	m	What?
WADE	m	Saw him do it?
JACK	m	What the fuck you telling me, Wade?  I never seen the guy get shot, I  told you that.
WADE	m	You musta seen him get shot. I know  you did.
JACK	m	Let's get the fuck outta here. You're  not making any sense, man.
WADE	m	There's your old twenty-gauge, and  that there's the new Browning you  was showing me last night. This must  be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very  fancy tooling. Probably fired one  time. It's a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you  deserve it. Right's right.
JACK	m	Yeah.
WADE	m	Twombley sure as hell won't be  shooting it again.
JACK	m	He sure as hell won't.
WADE	m	Rolfe.
ROLFE	m	Wade?
WADE	m	Yeah, brother, look, I was calling  cause -- has there been anything on  TV in Boston about a hunting accident  with a guy named Twombley, Evan  Twombley?
ROLFE	m	There was something. It happened up  your way.
WADE	m	Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was  with him. Maybe you do too. Jack  Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with  me. He's my best friend.
ROLFE	m	Wade, it's late. I know you're  probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed  reading. We got different habits.
WADE	m	No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm  calling because I need you to listen.  You're supposed to be a smart guy.  You're a professor. I got this theory.  Jack says he didn't see Twombley  shot but he did.
WADE	m	It'll come out Jack lied and the  kid'll get hung for it.
ROLFE	m	He was scheduled to testify for a  committee investigating organized  crime in New England and the  construction business.
WADE	m	Who?
ROLFE	m	Twombley.
WADE	m	No shit.
ROLFE	m	You think Jack shot him?
WADE	m	Well, it was an accident.
ROLFE	m	They were out deer hunting, right?  Jack probably heard the gun go off,  then came back and found the body.
WADE	m	Lillian was here. In Lawford.
ROLFE	m	Huh?
WADE	m	The night before the shooting.
ROLFE	m	How was she?
WADE	m	Picked up Jill. She was supposed to  visit for the weekend for Halloween.  She wanted to go home.
ROLFE	m	Who?
WADE	m	Jill. I was thinking of getting a  lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
ROLFE	m	What happened?
WADE	m	A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer.  You know, 'cause of Jill.
ROLFE	m	Don't think about it. You're  exhausted.
WADE	m	Yeah, I guess.
ROLFE	m	Get some sleep.
WADE	m	I get to feeling like a whipped dog  some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm  going to bite back. I swear it.
ROLFE	m	Haven't you already done a bit of  that?
WADE	m	No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've  growled a little, but I haven't bit.
MRS. GORDON	f	Who are you?
WADE	m	I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was  wondering, is your husband here?
MRS. GORDON	f	He's asleep. We were up very late.
WADE	m	Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that  I'm real sorry about your father,  Mrs. Twombley.
MRS. GORDON	f	Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
WADE	m	Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just  had a little business to settle with  Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police  officer.
MRS. GORDON	f	Something about my father?
WADE	m	Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic  thing. No big deal.
MRS. GORDON	f	Can't it wait, then?
MEL GORDON	f	Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
WADE	m	How's that?
MEL GORDON	f	I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
WADE	m	Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I  come all the way to serve somebody a  summons, I don't call ahead for an  appointment.
MEL GORDON	f	What the hell are you talking about?
WADE	m	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving  violation.
MEL GORDON	f	Moving violation! I just got out of  bed and you're telling me you're  giving me a goddamn speeding ticket?  Now? Are you nuts? Is that it,  Whitehouse? You're nuts?
WADE	m	Yesterday morning, you passed a  stopped school bus, which was flashing  its lights, then you--
MEL GORDON	f	Hold on!
WADE	m	Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr.  Gordon.
MEL GORDON	f	You're talking about a goddamned  ticket, from when I passed you at  the school where you were deciding  to hold up traffic while dreaming of  becoming a traffic cop or something?
WADE	m	Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon.  I'm just --
MEL GORDON	f	Doing your fucking job. I know. I  watch television too.
WADE	m	Yes. Here's your ticket.
MEL GORDON	f	You get the hell out of my house  now, asshole. And know this -- you  are going to be a lucky asshole if I  haven't got you fired before the day  is out. I can do it with one phone  call, and I'm pissed enough to do it  now!
MARGIE	f	Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess.  More than most. But he'll be okay in  a few weeks.
WADE	m	There's something funny about that  shooting. There's lots funny about  it, actually.
MARGIE	f	I heard he was drunk at Toby's last  night and got in a fight with Hettie.  He drove off without her...
WADE	m	I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't  happen the way Jack says it did.
MARGIE	f	...Jack's turned into one of those  men who are permanently angry. He  used to be a sweet kid, but it's  like, when he found out he couldn't  play ball anymore, he changed. Now  he's like everyone else.
WADE	m	I've been wondering if maybe Jack  shot Twombley, instead of Twombley  shooting himself. I've been wondering  maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
MARGIE	f	Wade! How can you even think such a  thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that,  shoot Twombley on purpose?
WADE	m	Money.
MARGIE	f	Jack doesn't need money.
WADE	m	Everybody needs money. Except guys  like Twombley and that sonofabitch  son-in-law of his. People like that.
MARGIE	f	Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides,  who would pay him?
WADE	m	Lots of people. Guy like Evan  Twombley, Boston union official,  probably got lots of people want to  see him dead. The Government's been  investigating his links with the  Mafia.
MARGIE	f	The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
WADE	m	No, I just know Jack's lying about  what happened. He just seemed -- I  know that kid, what he's like inside.  He's a lot like I was at his age.
MARGIE	f	You wouldn't have done anything like  that, shot someone for money.
WADE	m	No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd  given me half a damned excuse -- I  was pretty fucked up, you know.
MARGIE	f	But not now.
MARGIE	f	When you gonna get that tooth fixed?
WADE	m	I can see what you looked like as a  kid.
MARGIE	f	You knew me as a kid.
WADE	m	Yeah, but never what you looked like.  Not really. Never really studied  your face, like now. I was never  able to see you as a kid when you  were a kid until now, this way.
MARGIE	f	What way?
WADE	m	After making love. I like it. It's  nice to see that in a grown-up person.
MARGIE	f	It's nice.
MARGIE	f	Don't you think, do you still think  it's a good idea to press this custody  thing -- just now?
WADE	m	I'm her father -- supposed to be,  but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am.  It may be the only thing in my life  I've been so clear about wanting.  Even if it takes a big fight.
MARGIE	f	Then... I guess you have to.
WADE	m	There's another thing I've been  thinking about. I don't know how you  feel about the idea, Margie, because  we've never talked about it. But  I've been thinking lately, I've been  thinking we should get married  sometime. You and me.
MARGIE	f	Oh, Wade.
WADE	m	I've been thinking about it, that's  all.
MARGIE	f	You've been married twice --
WADE	m	It was to the same woman. I was just  a kid... It's not like a marriage proposal or  anything, just a thought. Something  for you and me to talk about and  think about. You know?
MARGIE	f	Alright. I'll think about it.
WADE	m	Good.
POP	m	I've got sons, Goddamnit, oh my God,  have I got sons! Wade? Rolfe?  Elbourne? You love me boys? Do you  love your Pop? Of course you do!
SALLY	f	Glen, stop --
POP	m	Oh, Jesus, Sally, you are such a  Goddamned good person! Capital G.  You are so much better than I am, I  who am no good at all, you who are a  truly good person, like a fucking  saint! Beyond fucking com-pare.
POP	m	My big boy bursting out of the seams  of his jeans!
SALLY	f	Don't!
POP	m	You little prick!
SALLY	f	Glen, stop!
MARGIE	f	Did you tell them? That we were coming?
WADE	m	Don't you think it's proper for a  fella to introduce his girl to his  parents?
MARGIE	f	I know your parents.
WADE	m	I just want to pick up my divorce  papers. For the lawyer. It won't  take long.
MARGIE	f	Are you sure they're home? Did you  call?
WADE	m	The truck's here. Looks like they've  stayed inside since the snow started.
WADE	m	Strange.
MARGIE	f	Think they're alright?
WADE	m	Of course! I would've heard.
MARGIE	f	How?
WADE	m	I don't know for Christ's sake!
WADE	m	Pop, Pop, you okay?
WADE	m	Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the  cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
POP	m	Sleeping.
WADE	m	You remember Margie Fogg?
POP	m	From Wickham's. Been a while. Like  some coffee?
WADE	m	How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen  you in town for a while.
POP	m	We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping.  You want me to get her?
WADE	m	Yeah.
WADE	m	Jesus. Nothing's changed around here.
WADE	m	Where's Ma?
POP	m	She's coming.
MARGIE	f	Have you been heating the house? Not  just with the stove.
POP	m	There's a furnace.
MARGIE	f	You're not using it today?
POP	m	It's broke I guess. There's an  electric in the bedroom.
MARGIE	f	Maybe Wade should take a look at it.  Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
WADE	m	Ma? It's Wade. Can I come in?
WADE	m	Oh, Lord.
POP	m	Coffee's perked.
MARGIE	f	When did she die?
POP	m	Is...? She's dead then?
WADE	m	Yeah.
POP	m	I checked on her. She had the electric  heater. Cold don't bother her as  much as me. Which is why I give her  the heater.
WADE	m	Is there something wrong with the  phone?
POP	m	In the living room.
WADE	m	Why didn't you call and have the  furnace fixed?
POP	m	Wade. I thought she was alright.  Till this morning she was.
POP	m	It makes me sad.
MARGIE	f	Can --?
POP	m	Makes me sad it was her. Instead of  me. I shoulda froze.
ROLFE	m	Wade called me, as usual, late at  night. I knew it was Wade -- no one  else calls me at that hour -- and I  was ready to listen to another chapter  in one of his ongoing sagas. There  was the detective story concerning  the shooting of Evan Twombley and  the family melodrama about Wade's  custody fight with Lillian. But not  this time.
ROLFE	m	Wade was telling a different story,  or so it seemed then, one in which I  myself was a character. He had called  to tell me that sometime the previous  night our mother had died, and he  had discovered the body when he'd  gone over to visit her and our father  with Margie Fogg. Pop was okay, but  kind of out of it. Worse than usual,  maybe, though no drunker than usual.
WADE	m	Shouldn't we get this show on the  road, now that Rolfe's here?
WADE	m	Pointless to stand around in church  with nothing to do, I guess.
ROLFE	m	What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing  her?
MARGIE	f	They'll be at the church and the  cemetery.
WADE	m	Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
ROLFE	m	No thanks. I don't drink.
WADE	m	Yeah. I forgot.
LARIVIERE	?	How you holding up, Wade?
WADE	m	I'm fine, fine.
LARIVIERE	?	You Rolfe? I remember you from high school.  You're a teacher now? Harvard?
ROLFE	m	B.U.
LARIVIERE	?	I haven't seen you around. I don't  suppose there's much reason for you  to come this way.
REV. DOUGHTY	f	Come, Glen, join us. Let's kneel for  a moment of prayer before the service.  Wade? Rolfe?
ROLFE	m	Well...
WADE	m	This is nuts.
MARGIE	f	Wade.
REV. DOUGHTY	f	Dear Heavenly Father, Lord of Hosts,  we come to Thee to beseech Thy  blessings and commend to You the  soul of our beloved wife and mother,  Sally Whitehouse, to be one with You  and walk with You --
POP	m	...goddamned hair on her head.
POP	m	Not a one of you is worth a goddamned  hair on that good woman's head!
WADE	m	Pop! Don't do this now, Pop.
LARIVIERE	?	Maybe I'll head on over to the church.
REV. DOUGHTY	f	This is a difficult time.
WADE	m	Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
POP	m	Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no  big deal. Tell me how a single one  of you is worth a single hair on  that woman's head.
REV. DOUGHTY	f	Give up this demon.
POP	m	Go fuck yourself!
ROLFE	m	Wade, just leave it.
POP	m	Listen to your little brother. 'Wade,  just leave it.' Candy-asses. All of  you. That's what I've got for  children. Candyasses. 'Wade, just  leave it.' Praise the Lord! 'Just  leave it!'
WADE	m	If you ever touch her again, I'll  kill you. I swear it.
ROLFE	m	The day of the funeral was almost  springlike. The snowline crossed New  Hampshire west to east, retreating  northward to Concord where it melted  by midmorning.
JILL	f	Dad.
WADE	m	I'm glad you're here. Can you stay  for a while?
WADE	m	You ever come to your father's grave  anymore?
LILLIAN	f	No, not anymore. It's too... it's  too far.
WADE	m	We should talk.
LILLIAN	f	We've done all our talking, Wade.
WADE	m	It's just...
LILLIAN	f	Let the past be. I'm sorry about your mother. I liked  her. You never know how much women  like that suffer. It's like they  live their lives with the sound turned  off -- and then they're gone.
JILL	f	Mom.
LILLIAN	f	She has an ice-skating lesson at  four.
JILL	f	I'm taking ice-skating, Daddy!
WADE	m	Let's dig out Pop's truck before the  skin of the snow freezes up.
ROLFE	m	What about Margie?
WADE	m	What about her?
ROLFE	m	Well, do you still plan to get  married?
WADE	m	Yeah. She'll probably quit her job  and stay out here with Pop. We can't  leave him alone here, he'll set the  damn place on fire. With Jill here a  lot, it'll be good to have Margie  around. Things are going to change  in that department, by the way. I  got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm  gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's  gonna break loose, but it's worth  it.
WADE	m	I want to let the gas run out. I  don't want the bastard driving drunk,  and he's always drunk now. After,  we'll hide the keys.
ROLFE	m	Anything new about the shooting?  Twombley?
WADE	m	I guess it was an accident, like  everybody thinks.
ROLFE	m	Want to know what I think happened?
WADE	m	Find them everywhere.
ROLFE	m	I think your first response to the  Twombley shooting was the correct  one.
WADE	m	Which is?
ROLFE	m	That it wasn't an accident.
WADE	m	Then who shot him?
ROLFE	m	Well, your friend, I think. Jack  Hewitt.
WADE	m	Motive. You gotta have a motive.
ROLFE	m	Money.
WADE	m	Who'd pay him that kind of money?  Not the mob. They got their own guys.  Specialists.
ROLFE	m	They wouldn't deal with a guy like  Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley  is suddenly dead?
WADE	m	I don't know. You tell me.
ROLFE	m	Okay. It's likely there are people  in the union who don't want Twombley  to testify. They probably include  his son-in-law who's vice-president  and will probably be the next  president. I read that in the papers.  What's his name, Mel Gordon?
WADE	m	Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told  you about. I did, didn't I?
ROLFE	m	Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware  of illegal union loans or whatever,  starts nosing around cause of the  investigation and finds out. Finds  out his son-in-law is involved.
WADE	m	So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a  professional hit. That'd make the  feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
ROLFE	m	A hunting accident is perfect.
WADE	m	Shit, around here, you shoot somebody  in the woods, you say it was an  accident, you get fined fifty bucks  and your hunting license lifted.  Jack's probably saying the guy shot  himself cause he ain't got his deer  yet and don't want his license pulled.
WADE	m	It's too neat. Things ain't that  neat. It makes me mad. That somebody  can pay to kill somebody, his own  father-in-law, and not be punished  for it. Don't that piss you off?
ROLFE	m	Not particularly.
WADE	m	Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you  care what's right?
ROLFE	m	I care about what happened. The truth.  I'm a student of history, remember?
ROLFE	m	I was thinking about that story you  told me, about Pop and chopping the  firewood out of the ice and after.
WADE	m	Yeah.
ROLFE	m	I hate to disappoint you, but I don't  think it happened.
WADE	m	Of course it happened. Why would I  lie about it?
ROLFE	m	It may have happened, but not the  way you said.
WADE	m	You think I wouldn't remember a thing  like that?
ROLFE	m	It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I  heard about it. When I heard about  it, it was about Elbourne.
WADE	m	We'd have to go digging in Vietnam  to ask him.
ROLFE	m	And Elbourne and Mom took you to the  doctor and told him you fell from  the hay loft.
WADE	m	Well, I never heard that one.
ROLFE	m	I remember clearly cause when I heard  I became real careful around Pop. I  was a careful child and I became a  careful adult, but at least I wasn't  afflicted by that man's violence.
WADE	m	That's what you think.
ROLFE	m	I gotta head back. It's a long drive.
LARIVIERE	?	Put out that fucking cigarette!
LARIVIERE	?	Not there, asshole. Flush it!
WADE	m	Morning, Gordon.
JACK	m	I'm fucking out of here.
WADE	m	Lawford?
JACK	m	Out of this fucking job. This job  sucks. Working outside in the winter  sucks.
JACK	m	Open the door, will ya?
WADE	m	Why don't you quit now, you want out  so bad?
JACK	m	Open the door. We're late.
WADE	m	I mean it -- you got enough money  now. Head out for California. Surf's  up, Jack, and you're digging wells  in the snow.
JACK	m	What do you mean I got money? I'm as  broke as you.
WADE	m	Looney Tunes, Jack. Fucking Looney  Tunes!
ELAINE	f	Mr. Gordon!
MEL GORDON	f	The boss in?
ELAINE	f	Yes indeedy!
WADE	m	I screwed up the divorce. I agreed  with everything she said. I wanted  her to like me. I just want to be a  good father.
HAND	m	It would help if you were married,  if there was someone at home while  you work.
WADE	m	I plan to. Soon.
HAND	m	How soon?
WADE	m	This spring.
HAND	m	Good. It would help if there were  some drug or alcohol abuse on the  part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems  upsetting to the child.
WADE	m	It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
HAND	m	No, not exactly. I'll look at the  divorce decree, see if we can get it  redrawn. Interview your daughter.  Jill, right?
WADE	m	Yes.
HAND	m	Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You  can mail it.
WADE	m	Jesus. How much... how much will the  whole thing cost?
HAND	m	Hard to say. If we go for custody,  depositions, psychiatric evaluations,  it could drag on. Ten or twelve  thousand dollars. She could win on  appeal. If we just want to get the  visitation rights redrawn, assuming  they're unduly restrictive, it  wouldn't be more than twenty-five  hundred.
WADE	m	Oh.
HAND	m	You might be better off legally as  well as financially to just go for  the --
WADE	m	Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing  was just my getting back at her. I'm  not as dumb as I look. Whatever you  say. I love my daughter. I'll send you the five hundred.
WADE	m	Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch  is going out again.
LARIVIERE	?	You ever think of getting a new car,  Wade?
WADE	m	On what you pay me?
LARIVIERE	?	Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have  him pick up Wade's car, fix the  clutch.
ELAINE	f	What!
LARIVIERE	?	Use the pickup. I'll bill it to the  town. You're the town police officer  and the town police officer should  have a decent car. You want a new  car or not?
WADE	m	What do I have to do for it?
LARIVIERE	?	Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking.  You don't get enough appreciation  around here and it's time we changed  things a little.
WADE	m	I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
LARIVIERE	?	So?
WADE	m	He say anything about the summons I  tried to give him? Sonofabitch  wouldn't accept it.
LARIVIERE	?	Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out  right after the man's father-in-law  shot himself. Let it go. Call it a  favor to me.
WADE	m	You? Why?
LARIVIERE	?	Mel's doing some business with me.  It's nice to do favors for people  you do business with. He was in a  hurry. No big deal.
WADE	m	That was before Twombley was shot.  Before he knew.
LARIVIERE	?	What's the difference? Take my truck,  take a rest -- stop worrying about  Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to  do with your old man's place -- he  going to stay there?
WADE	m	Want to buy?
LARIVIERE	?	Don't light that in here. I'm  allergic.
WADE	m	I won't. You interested?
LARIVIERE	?	Maybe.
WADE	m	You and Mel Gordon?
LARIVIERE	?	Could be.
WADE	m	Always count on old Wade for a good  screwing. Why should I always pay  more, sell cheap? Why should you  guys make all the money. You and Mel  and Jack. Right's right.
LARIVIERE	?	Out! Out!
JACK	m	You crazy sonofabitch! You'll sink  us both! Get off the fucking ice!  Get off!
JACK	m	I'll shoot you, Wade, I swear it!  I'll fucking shoot you dead if you  don't move away from that truck!
JACK	m	Don't move! I'll shoot you dead if  you move!
NICK	m	Your father's in back, Wade. Marg  had to babysit him. She moved in  with you, huh? What happened?
POP	m	Ah, the prodigal son.
NICK	m	About fucking time.
POP	m	Look, got me a new job, second cook  and bottle washer!
MARGIE	f	What happened?
WADE	m	Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I  got waylaid. Sorry.
POP	m	The fuck you got waylaid. You follow  your prick around like it was your  nose.
NICK	m	Can it, Whitehouse. Get him out of here. It was funny at  first, but I'm tired.
MARGIE	f	There's clothes in the back.
POP	m	Let's go home? What home is that?  Your home? My home? Let's have a  talk about that. You're fucking sly,  Wade. Your mother's dead so she can't  make any excuses for you anymore!  You gotta deal with me! No more sugar  tit, asshole.
WADE	m	Pop, for Christ's sake!
POP	m	You think you can take me now? Come  on, try.
NICK	m	Marg, get out of this. Fast.
MARGIE	f	I can't.
WADE	m	I wish you would die.
MARGIE	f	Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it!
WADE	m	No shit, Rolfe, I glanced up and  there he was, only it was me. But it  was like I had never seen myself  before. It was a stranger's face.  Hard to explain. You fly on automatic  pilot, like I was doing all night,  and you disappear.
WADE	m	Then you accidentally see your body,  or your face, or whatever, and you  don't know who the hell it belongs  to. Strange. It's the business with  the old man, I know, and how  incredibly pissed I was at him, and  also chasing Jack Hewitt like that,  and the Goddamned truck going through  the ice, not to mention Margie's  being so upset -- one thing on top  of another.
ROLFE	m	Wade, are you alright?
WADE	m	But you gotta hear this. You won't  believe it. Mel Gordon had come by  to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in  his office.
LARIVIERE	?	He's on to us!
JACK	m	Shit! What are we gonna do?
LARIVIERE	?	Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta  talk to Mel.
JACK	m	You can't buy Wade off.
LARIVIERE	?	We bought you.
JACK	m	That was me.
ALMA	f	Wade! Come in! Have a cup of coffee.
WADE	m	You got yourself a computer, Alma.
ALMA	f	Been putting my files into it. You  take sugar and milk?
WADE	m	No. Black.
ALMA	f	Are you alright, Wade?
WADE	m	Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned  tooth, I got a few things bugging  me, like everybody else. But I'm  okay.
ALMA	f	Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't  mean to pry. I'm sorry about your  mother. It was a nice funeral.
WADE	m	Alma, I think there's some dirty  business going on in this town.
ALMA	f	Always has been.
WADE	m	This is maybe worse than you and I  are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking  about murder. Among other things.
ALMA	f	Who?
WADE	m	Evan Twombley, the union boss who  got shot. Somebody murdered him.
ALMA	f	Who?
WADE	m	You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work  with?
WADE	m	...if Jack told the truth, he could  be free by the time he's my age.
ALMA	f	Sometimes things are simpler than  you think. Let me ask you a question.
WADE	m	You don't believe me?
ALMA	f	About Jack? No. Have you checked out  the tax bill on your father's farm  lately?
WADE	m	I know he's due for the last two  years. I was thinking of paying it  when the insurance comes in.
ALMA	f	Has anybody offered to buy it?
WADE	m	As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
ALMA	f	This is all the real estate  transactions in this town the last  year. Most of it unused land. Most  of it for little more than the back  taxes owed.
ALMA	f	This is from three years ago. Some  difference, huh?
WADE	m	What is the Northcountry Development  Association?
ALMA	f	I went down to Concord to check it  out. The president is Mel Gordon.  The vice-president and treasurer is  Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are  buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000  this year. I believe that's out of  LaRiviere's league.
WADE	m	Twombley involved?
ALMA	f	No.
WADE	m	He musta found out. They had to get  rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
ALMA	f	All the figures show is that Gordon  LaRiviere is going to be a very rich  man using his position as Selectman.  In a year or two, you won't recognize  this town.
WADE	m	You sneaky sonofabitch! I've got  your number now, Gordon! All these  years I actually thought you were a  decent man. Can you believe that?
LARIVIERE	?	Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys.
WADE	m	You two, don't you get it? He's using  you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see  that?
LARIVIERE	?	The key, Wade.
WADE	m	Yeah, you can have the key. It's the  key that's kept me locked to you all  these years. I give it to you with  pleasure. Now I'm free. See how easy it is,  Jack? All you got to do is give back  what the man gave you, and you're  free of him. I've got to call my brother.
WADE	m	I know what it means. I'm just running  out of ways to use it.
ROLFE	m	For what?
WADE	m	To help, Jack, of course -- and to  nail those sonsofbitches, the Two  Gordons. That's what Alma calls them.  Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
ROLFE	m	Take care of the little things first,  the things that are distracting you  from taking care of the big things.  Call Chub Merritt, get your car back,  call a dentist, for God's sake, and  get your tooth pulled, don't trust  the locals, get your facts straight  and go straight to the state police.  Let them work on this.
CHICK	?	The good news is we haven't got to  your car yet. The bad news --
WADE	m	Just tell me when you'll have it  fixed.
CHICK	?	-- the bad news is there's a problem  with Gordon's truck what somebody  drove through the ice last night.  Figured you'd know something about  that, Wade.
WADE	m	Yeah. I know about that.
CHICK	?	LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay  for the fixin' of your car. A couple  hundred for the clutch. I got some  more bad news. Wanna hear it?
WADE	m	Tell me.
CHICK	?	Chub says you're fired.
WADE	m	He can't fire me. LaRiviere already  did that this morning.
CHICK	?	He's a Selectman. The town. He said  to tell you to turn your badge in  and clean out your office. I'm  supposed to pull the CB and police  light out of your car. They're town  property.
WADE	m	What do you mean, you can't take me  today? I told you --
MARGIE	f	What on earth is happening to you?  Why are you acting this way?
WADE	m	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I  can't even think anymore because of  it.
MARGIE	f	I heard you talking. You got fired  this morning, didn't you?
WADE	m	Look, that's temporary, believe me.  There's so much shit gonna hit the  fan the next few days, my getting  fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't  matter a bit.
WADE	m	I'll get another job. People are  going to need me. After this is over,  they'll make me into a Goddamned  hero. You wait: you'll see, I'll  deliver. I'll be the best father who  ever lived. You need me, even Pop,  for Christ's sake, he needs me. This  town needs me. Maybe now they think  they can send me howling into a corner  like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll  be different soon.
WADE	m	Leave the bottle out!
ROLFE	m	You will say I should have known  terrible things were about to happen,  and perhaps I should have. But even  so, what could I have done by then?  Wade never went inside. He lived  almost wholly out there on his skin,  with no interior space to retreat  to, even in a crisis.
LILLIAN	f	Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in  Lawford?
WADE	m	Yeah, lots.
LILLIAN	f	See. Get your boots.
WADE	m	Hi honey.
JILL	f	Hi.
LILLIAN	f	Have her back tomorrow night by six.
WADE	m	No problem. Look, I...
LILLIAN	f	You make me sick. I can't believe  you've sunk so low.
WADE	m	Low as what? What have I done? It's  bad to want to see your own daughter?
LILLIAN	f	You know what I'm talking about. For  what you're doing to me and to the  child you say you love so much. Love.  You won't get away with it.
LILLIAN	f	Bye, honey! Call me tonight if you  want.
JILL	f	Are we going in this?
WADE	m	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll  be fine.
JILL	f	It's pretty old.
WADE	m	It belongs to Pop.
JILL	f	Pop?
WADE	m	Grandpa. My father. It's his.
JILL	f	Oh.
WADE	m	How about a Big Mac?
JILL	f	Mommy won't let me eat fast food.  You know that. It's bad for you.
WADE	m	C'mon, we can always sneak a Big  Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your  favorite. What do you say?
JILL	f	No.
WADE	m	What do you want, then?
JILL	f	Nothing.
WADE	m	You can't have nothing, Jill. We  need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
JILL	f	Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
WADE	m	I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge  today, though.
JILL	f	Okay. So we'll get what you want.  What do you want?
WADE	m	Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait  till we get home. Maybe we'll stop  by Wickham's for a hamburger when we  get to Lawford. That suit you? You  always like Wickham's.
JILL	f	Okay.
WADE	m	Fine.
WADE	m	Oh, Jesus, Jill, I'm sorry. What's  the matter, honey?
WADE	m	Please don't cry. Please, honey.
JILL	f	What are you sorry for?
WADE	m	I don't know. For the food business.  I guess. I just thought, you know,  we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like  we used to.
JILL	f	I want to go home.
WADE	m	You can't.
JILL	f	That's illegal, you know.
WADE	m	I know.
JILL	f	You're a policeman.
WADE	m	Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing  anymore.
JILL	f	Oh.
WADE	m	Jillie, you want a cheese grilled  sandwich?
NICK	m	It's called a grilled cheese sandwich,  you dub.
WADE	m	Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing  happened.
JILL	f	I want to go home.
WADE	m	Okay, let's go home, then.
NICK	m	Wade, I got a message for you. Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you.  Wants you to clear your stuff out of  his office in Town Hall.
WADE	m	His office. You mean my old office.
NICK	m	Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
WADE	m	He got his deer yet?
NICK	m	No, he's out now. Somewhere on the  mountain. I'd stay away from him if  I were you. He's real pissed.
WADE	m	Going somewhere, Margie?
MARGIE	f	I'm just cleaning out some of this  stuff that's built up. For the rummage  sale. And some things for the  cleaners. And the laundromat.
WADE	m	Don't lie to me. You're leaving me,  I can see that.
MARGIE	f	Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
WADE	m	Marg.
MARGIE	f	Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
JILL	f	Leave her alone! Leave her alone!
MARGIE	f	Get in.
JILL	f	I want to go home. Will you take me  home?
MARGIE	f	Yes.
POP	m	You! By Christ, you -- I know you. Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I  know you. You're a goddamn fucking  piece of my heart!
WADE	m	You don't know me. You don't know  me! So fuck you. Fuck you.
POP	m	Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally  done it! Like a man done it. Done it  right. I love you, you mean  sonofabitch!
WADE	m	Love! What the fuck do you know about  love?
POP	m	Love! I'm made of love!
WADE	m	Call it what you want.
POP	m	Everything you know is from me.
WADE	m	Yeah.
POP	m	Bang!
WADE	m	You and me.
POP	m	Where the Christ you going? You  sonofabitch, you leave my fucking  truck where it is! I need... Give me  the Goddamn keys! I need to get me  to town!
WADE	m	Crawl!
POP	m	Nothing in the fucking house to drink.  Not a fucking thing. My house, my  money, my truck -- stolen!
WADE	m	I don't know you. My goddamn father  and I don't know you.
WADE	m	I know you now. I love you too.
WADE	m	Joke. You scared me.
ROLFE	m	The historical facts are known by  everyone -- all of Lawford, all of  New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts.  Facts do not make history. Our  stories, Wade's and mine, describe  the lives of boys and men for  thousands of years, boys who were  beaten by their fathers, whose  capacity for love and trust was  crippled almost at birth and whose  best hope, if any, for connection  with other human beings lay in an  elegiac detachment, as if life were  over.
ROLFE	m	It's how we keep from destroying in  turn our own children and terrorizing  the women who have the misfortune to  love us; how we absent ourselves  from the tradition of male violence;  how we decline the seduction of  revenge.
ROLFE	m	Jack's truck turned up three days  later in a shopping mall in Toronto.  Even without the footprints, the  bullet, Wade's utter disappearance  seemed evidence enough of his guilt.
ROLFE	m	LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed  in business. The Parker Mountain Ski  Resort is now advertised all across  the country. Jimmy Dame tends bar at  the lodge. Chub Merritt opened a  snowmobile dealership, Nick Wickham  runs the new Burger King. Margie  Fogg moved to Littleton, nearer her  mother; Lillian and Jill went with  Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle.
ROLFE	m	We want to believe Wade died, died  that same November, froze to death  on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot  understand how a man, a normal man,  a man like you and me, could do such  a terrible thing. Unless the police  happen to arrest a vagrant who turns  out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe  he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will  have turned himself into one of those  faceless fellows working at the video  store and lives in a town-house  apartment at the edge of town until  his mailman recognizes him from the  picture at the post office -- unless  that happens, there will be no more  mention of him and his friend Jack  Hewitt and our father. The story  will be over. Except that I continue.
