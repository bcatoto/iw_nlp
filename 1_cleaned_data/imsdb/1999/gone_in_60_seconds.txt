DONNY	m	Problem, Officer?
POLICEMAN	m	Yes. You're under arrest -- ?
DONNY	m	For running a stop sign?
POLICEMAN	m	For Grand Theft Auto -
HAWKINGS	m	Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of Raines...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Well, then it's all for naught, ain't it, Hawkings?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	I know you --
MEMPHIS	m	You know my back -
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	You want to come along quiet?
MEMPHIS	m	How's Atley -- ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
MEMPHIS	m	Let them go --
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	How's that?
MEMPHIS	m	Let them go. And I'll leave ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	You'll leave -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at  it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	I don't golf... I do this. And I see you again. I'll come after you with everything I got. you won't be able to steal a glance at a blind man without me by your side ...
MEMPHIS	m	You have my word...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Get out of here, then. Now.
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Leave the car, Randall ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Arright, let lim go. Cite him for rolling the stop ... And cite old Atley for driving to endanger ...
HAWKINGS	m	What are you talking about, Rollie? We're springing 'em? Just like that?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Just like that. Quit your bellyaching, Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...
MEMPHIS	m	You know what you got here?
TOM	m	Not really -
MEMPHIS	m	There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
TOM	m	Not really --
MEMPHIS	m	You have any other answers besides "not really"?
TOM	m	Not --
MEMPHIS	m	Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
BUDGY	m	Just can't find good help these days --
MEMPHIS	m	Those things'll kill ya, Budgy --
BUDGY	m	They won't have a chance. The bourbon and bacon'll get me first... That one -
MEMPHIS	m	1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ... Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell; they modified the chassis, but didn't improve its performance... The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof positive of a single all-powerful Deity. The first bargain-priced muscle car ever. They even tuned the horn to resemble the "beep beep" sound of the cartoon Road Runner ...
BUDGY	m	Damn, you're good You got to bingo last night?
MEMPHIS	m	That I did, Budgy. That I did --
TOM	m	Uh ... Randall -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Excuse me --
FREB	m	The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
KIP	m	He didn't mess up. There it is ...
FREB	m	That -- ?
MIRROR MAN	m	You're shittin', right? Kip?
FREB	m	How are we supposed to--
KIP	m	Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
MIRROR MAN	m	What tool -- ? Oh, no --
MIRROR MAN	m	Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a stolen car
KIP	m	Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Can you stop that, for Chrissake?
TUMBLER	m	What's your problem, bro ?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Where are they -- ?
TUMBLER	m	They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in them veins ... What happened -- ? Relax and enjoy --
MIRROR MAN	m	Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car, stolen car ...
KIP	m	Stolen fast car... It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see if these British boys are full of shit or not --
MIRROR MAN	m	No way, man --
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Something wrong, Tumbler -- ?
TUMBLER	m	Yeah. I'm missing Springer --
ATLEY JACKSON	m	She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --
MIRROR MAN	m	I can vouch for that.
TUMBLER	m	Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
KIP	m	No problem -
THUGGISH MAN	m	Let's get outta here -- !
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Now you gone and done it, Raines And they flee ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	m	They're gone...
MEMPHIS	m	What's going on -- ?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Well, well, well ... Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc. Are you kidding me, man -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Hello, Atley ... L.N. ORR. I get it. Clever ...
MEMPHIS	m	How's the leg?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
MEMPHIS	m	What are you doing here?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Is there someplace we can talk?
MEMPHIS	m	What about?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
WAITRESS	?	There you go --
MEMPHIS	m	Thanks, Donna --
ATLEY JACKSON	m	It's been a long time, Memphis --
MEMPHIS	m	Six years ...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
MEMPHIS	m	What kind of job... ?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	A boost. A big boost ...
MEMPHIS	m	A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	You're shittin', right? Kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left. He's been working a low-rent ring for two years now. You don't talk to your Ma?
MEMPHIS	m	It seems she neglected to mention it
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
MEMPHIS	m	Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
MEMPHIS	m	Who was the job for?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Who do you think? Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter" Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ... I just thought you should know, man. I kind of had a feeling you didn't. But I should tell you: I'm working for him now - The Carpenter - so if you see him, you won't mention me coming to get you... Like I said: I just thought ... I owed you ... And that it was the right thing to do ...
KID	m	Can I get some more coffee -- ?
HELEN RAINES	f	Sure, hon ...
MEMPHIS	m	Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint -- ? Hello, Ma -- Oh, Randall ...
COOK	m	What's the word, Memphis -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	How ya doing, Ruby -- ?
HELEN RAINES	f	Come, come, come ... Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone, extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate milk... Lots of syrup... Right?
MEMPHIS	m	Right ...
HELEN RAINES	f	You look good...
MEMPHIS	m	You, too, Ma...
HELEN RAINES	f	What are you doing back?
MEMPHIS	m	How's Kip?
HELEN RAINES	f	Have you seen him?
MEMPHIS	m	No.
HELEN RAINES	f	oh.
MEMPHIS	m	Atley Jackson came to see me ...
HELEN RAINES	f	Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
MEMPHIS	m	Why didn't you tell me?
HELEN RAINES	f	I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
MEMPHIS	m	He's in some trouble ...
HELEN RAINES	f	I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
MEMPHIS	m	You getting my checks ... ?
HELEN RAINES	f	Of course ...
RUBY	f	Detective Castlebeck... It's me ... Yeah... You ain't never gonna guess who just come in to visit his Ma --
MEMPHIS	m	He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
HELEN RAINES	f	Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
TUMBLER	m	... so ... It's my new move ... It's called "The Stranger." What I do is, I sit on my hand for 10 minutes.  Till it falls asleep. Till it's good and numb. No feeling. And then I jerk off.
GIRL	f	That's disgusting -
FREB	m	What's the point, man -- ?
TUMBLER	m	Cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger ... It rocks ... It's the power move of the New Millennium...
TOBY	m	Hey, Kip, what's up?
KIP	m	What do you say, Toby?,
TOBY	m	I'm cool -
TUMBLER	m	What do you want, shithead?
TOBY	m	Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
TUMBLER	m	Why don't you leave him alone?
TOBY	m	I known Kip longing than you, man ...
TUMBLER	m	Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
FREB	m	Any word, Kip -- ?
KIP	m	No ... And they won't take my calls ...
FREB	m	What does that mean -- ?
KIP	m	It ain't what you'd call a "good sign" Look - we managed to get 13 in a week. We just gotta step it up ...
FREB	m	But we only got till Friday. That's four days. And we lost the 13. So's we gotta start over ...
KIP	m	That, too ... Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool.
KIP	m	It can be done, man. We just gotta step it up... It's a challenge ...
MIRROR MAN	m	The challenge is not to get our nuts cut-off and shoved down our throats ...
TUMBLER	m	Can I help you, pal -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Hey, Kip ...
KIP	m	Hello, Memphis --
TUMBLER	m	"Memphis?" You're Memphis?
MEMPHIS	m	That's right...
TUMBLER	m	Damn. Damn, damn, damn ...
FREB	m	Memphis. Holy shit. It's an honor, man --
KIP	m	It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
MEMPHIS	m	You, too
FREB	m	What are you doing back, Memphis?
MEMPHIS	m	Little visit. Check on the family.
KIP	m	It's nice to see ya, man -
TOBY	m	Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
MEMPHIS	m	Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
TOBY	m	Yeah, I'm cool ...
KIP	m	Who's got next game -- ?
MIRROR MAN	m	I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius: Memphis come back to save our bacon!
TUMBLER	m	Shut-up, Mirror Man --
FREB	m	Izzat true? You come back to save our bacon?
MIRROR MAN	m	Of course it's true. He come to save his brother's dangling ass --
KIP	m	That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
FREB	m	We don't -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	He give you an advance -- ?
MIRROR MAN	m	Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
MEMPHIS	m	You just give 'im back the money. All's well...
KIP	m	"Give lim back the money." "Give 'im back the money..." Be nice. If only we didn't drink the money. And smoke the money. And buy Nikes with the money. And Sony Play Stations with the money. And dirty girls with the money...
KIP	m	But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
TUMBLER	m	Things are all leafy and suburban ...
MIRROR MAN	m	The hell they are --
KIP	m	Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled... And it was nice to see you -- -
MEMPHIS	m	You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a poundcake. But I remember the days when you used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em... So you can't stop me from saving your "dangling ass' if that's what I feel like doing...
TUMBLER	m	Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ...
DOG-FACE	?	Yeah -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...
CALITRI	m	Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ... 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	How ya doing?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Good to see you, Memphis --
CALITRI	m	So. What do we owe the honor -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	It's about my brother ... Kip...
CALITRI	m	Yes ... Kip ...
CALITRI	m	Excuse me one moment, Randall ...
CALITRI	m	You bring this to me in this condition? Blood and guts all over it? You make me complicit? On my property? Who taught you how to think? And worst of all: weren't there supposed to be two Hondas?
THIEF	m	Please ...
CALITRI	m	Stupid sonuvabitch...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
MEMPHIS	m	Jesus ...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	The business has changed...
CALITRI	m	Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
MEMPHIS	m	I don't want him hurt...
CALITRI	m	I'm proud of this work. The bird feeder. The wagon wheel planter. The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable server... Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood is warm. Clean. Provided by nature. To see a piece of furniture take shape. It's like watching a child grow ...
MEMPHIS	m	I'm sure you're working your way to the point.  I'll wait right here ...
CALITRI	m	My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
MEMPHIS	m	I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
CALITRI	m	Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ... No, no. You don't kill me, because you can't. You don't take your brother and run, because we'd find him. You don't go to the-police, because we have friends there, too. You do nothing: except deal with me.
MEMPHIS	m	I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
CALITRI	m	Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled... On that list, you'll find fifty cars. Fifty. Five-zero. They range in age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in expense from the 1993 Volkswagen Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero. There is a container ship in Long Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be loaded with 4-car-per shipping containers, false-walled and customsprofiled as motor oil designated. The ship leaves in four days for South America and the men who've tendered me this contract ...
MEMPHIS	m	They gave you only four days?
CALITRI	m	They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ... Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200 thousand dollars ...
MEMPHIS	m	I'm not interested --
CALITRI	m	I knew you'd say that.
MEMPHIS	m	I'm just here about my brother.
CALITRI	m	I knew you'd say that, too --
MEMPHIS	m	Sound it out for me.
CALITRI	m	Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
MEMPHIS	m	And if he doesn't make it -- ?
CALITRI	m	I made this, too. My first one. Brass extension handles, not plated. The coverings are silk, not rayon. Expensive hardwood. And lined with spray green Lorraine crepe ... Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty ... Kip will take up permanent residence in this box ... Come here for a second, boys --
DIGGER	m	Evenin', Mr. C. --
CALITRI	m	Digger, Butz: let me introduce you to Randall Raines. Used to head up the dandiest ring in Southern Cal. Left us for parts unknown. Randall, this is Digger. And that's Butz -
DIGGER	m	Hi, Randall --
CALITRI	m	Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial. They're good boys ...
MEMPHIS	m	I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
CALITRI	m	"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things... "Nothing that's forced can ever be right." Old woodworking expression. I really don't care how the 50 get onto my ship ... I just care that they do. You decide.
REPORTER	m	... the car-jacking, which left Ramona Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of three, dead, occurred last night at ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	I know you.
MEMPHIS	m	You know my back.
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	m	When'd you get to town, Raines?
MEMPHIS	m	The other day....
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	m	What for?
MEMPHIS	m	No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	m	Where you been, anyway?
MEMPHIS	m	Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	m	You seem a little hinked-up ...
MEMPHIS	m	Not at all ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
MEMPHIS	m	A little family emergency --
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
MEMPHIS	m	No...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Or your baby brother. What was his name?
MEMPHIS	m	Kip.
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ... I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is making noise. We recovered a big take - last week...
MEMPHIS	m	And this has what to do with me?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	m	By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
TOBY	m	You goin' home?
KIP	m	Yeah... You want a ride...
TOBY	m	Sure -
KIP	m	How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
TOBY	m	Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
KIP	m	You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
TOBY	m	I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
KIP	m	Damn crooks is everywhere -- Memphis seemed weird, huh? What's with them clothes? He a farmer now or something?
KIP	m	Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing is old... What do you want -- ?
KIP	m	Don't you do that! You leave him alone!
GOON	m	Shaddup, Raines
KIP	m	He's got nothing to do with this --
GOON	m	Get him in the car
CALITRI	m	Hello, Kip --
KIP	m	Lemme out of this --
CALITRI	m	Were it only that easy --
KIP	m	We can still do it --
CALITRI	m	No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you remind me of. Because just being attracted to something, doesn't mean you belong...
KIP	m	Listen, Calitri --
CALITRI	m	Call me "Ray." Better yet: call me "asshole." Cos that's how you've treated me --
KIP	m	I get out of this I'm gonna fuck you up -- Calitri -- !
MEMPHIS	m	Kip -- ?
KIP	m	Yeah ...
MEMPHIS	m	You all right -- ?
KIP	m	I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
MEMPHIS	m	Just hold-on there -- So you want to run that part by me again about things being "all sweetness and light..."
KIP	m	This has nothing to do with any of that --
MEMPHIS	m	Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
KIP	m	All my enemies own car crushers.  It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
MEMPHIS	m	Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
MEMPHIS	m	You okay -- ?
KIP	m	Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Sure --
KIP	m	you like Kobe's game? I do. You think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do. He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's got that going for him --
MEMPHIS	m	You sure you're okay -- ?
KIP	m	Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
KIP	m	Cool. So you're living up North?
MEMPHIS	m	Yeah -
KIP	m	I heard you were pumping gas -
MEMPHIS	m	Something like that -
KIP	m	You're kind of cultivating a new look.
MEMPHIS	m	Yeah -- Maybe you need a stitch --
KIP	m	Nah. It's a scratch.
MEMPHIS	m	Okay --
KIP	m	Hey, you want something to eat ?
MEMPHIS	m	What do you got ... ?
KIP	m	Not much. I got olives. You like olives? Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes the Calabrese. It's more mellow
MEMPHIS	m	There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
KIP	m	Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
MEMPHIS	m	So what are you gonna do?
KIP	m	About what?
MEMPHIS	m	"About what?"
KIP	m	About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
MEMPHIS	m	I can see that - You have everything ... under control?
KIP	m	Yeah. He just wants to know I'm still on it. He needs reassurance. All these big swinging dicks do. No worries. I won't let him get into our Kool-Aid... What -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	What happened to you?
KIP	m	What?
MEMPHIS	m	You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
KIP	m	C'mon, man... My "demise..." Overreaction
MEMPHIS	m	"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
KIP	m	Hey, now -
MEMPHIS	m	He's gonna kill you -- !
KIP	m	I can handle it --
MEMPHIS	m	You can handle it?
KIP	m	I can handle it --
MEMPHIS	m	You can handle it?
KIP	m	I can handle it --
MEMPHIS	m	You?
KIP	m	Me.
MEMPHIS	m	You?
KIP	m	Me... Why? You think you can help me? What can you do? You haven't done anything in six years but pump gas  and go overall shopping. And  the cars, they've changed ... There's new shit. Computer chip keys and sophisticated alarms and I don't think, an old guy, could much bypass 'em...
MEMPHIS	m	You don't think so, huh?
KIP	m	Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?
FISHERMAN	m	Very nice, Atley. Very nice ...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	You can't get it any fresher than this, Memphis ... From the sea to my skillet ... Nothing in between...
MEMPHIS	m	What's with the fish thing -- ?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
MEMPHIS	m	Fish.
ATLEY JACKSON	m	And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
MEMPHIS	m	Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
ATLEY JACKSON	m	I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
MEMPHIS	m	You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
ATLEY JACKSON	m	I do ... Christ, what happened to us ?
MEMPHIS	m	Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
ATLEY JACKSON	m	No, but you dress like an asshole ...
MEMPHIS	m	I think about that night a lot...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Me, too. Every time I walk...
MEMPHIS	m	How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ... Yeah, you know: I just. I just never really thanked-you. I meant to. I just want you to know... Tell him it's on ...
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Yeah -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
ATLEY JACKSON	m	Any idea how you're gonna go at it?
OTTO	m	Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell? And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Hello, Otto ...
OTTO	m	You remember Junie?
MEMPHIS	m	Of course. Hi, Junie --
JUNIE	f	Hello, Memphis -
MEMPHIS	m	What happened here -- ?
OTTO	m	Whatever do you mean?
MEMPHIS	m	The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
OTTO	m	What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to... It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black acrylic lacquer before laying out the flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ... Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look splendid ...
MEMPHIS	m	You, too, Otto
OTTO	m	I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
MEMPHIS	m	He's gotten involved --
OTTO	m	I can't concentrate. Play something, my sweetness; my reason to rise ... The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear how they got the engine up? Hear those exhaust notes? That's a very wide rev range... Here, it peaks at 5500 RPM... Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much sorrow on these streets ...
MEMPHIS	m	You think it can be done?
OTTO	m	Are you considering a comeback tour?
MEMPHIS	m	Tell me...
OTTO	m	It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
MEMPHIS	m	The hard part ...
OTTO	m	"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
MEMPHIS	m	Is he still working here ?
OTTO	m	The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
MEMPHIS	m	I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
OTTO	m	I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
MEMPHIS	m	And the moral of that story is -- ?
OTTO	m	Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh... ... 8.8:1 compression...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Pull over! Pull her the hell over! Put it in PARK. Remember how to do that? It's the big "Pff. "Objects May Appear Closer Than They Seem." Can you say that for me?
JENNY	f	I'm sorry.
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	You ain't sorry. You're a horrible driver... You can't strap into your seat belt, without almost getting creamed by a bus ... Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal. You can't drive. You can't. Time to acknowledge it and move on. I can't swim. I know I can't. So you know what I do? I stay the fuck outta the pool ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
MEMPHIS	m	How you doing, man?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	You know where the others are?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro and Frankie Fish are moving weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was killed in Denver... Atley Jackson's on the gimp and runnin' errands for Calitri; The Sphinx is still around, I guess ... Then of course, there's ...
MEMPHIS	m	Forget that ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Most of 'em are late-model...
MEMPHIS	m	That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
OTTO	m	Some crew you got ...
MEMPHIS	m	If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
OTTO	m	Dignity...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Yeah...
MEMPHIS	m	Well, the three of us don't'exactly inspire confidence...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	I know. Weird, huh -- ?
WORKER	m	Otto, there's someone here to --
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Lookit Kip. All grown up...
KIP	m	Hey, Donny --
MEMPHIS	m	What are you doing here?
KIP	m	Otto called -
OTTO	m	You need him...
MEMPHIS	m	No we don't -
OTTO	m	I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
MEMPHIS	m	His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
OTTO	m	The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
MEMPHIS	m	We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
KIP	m	I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
MEMPHIS	m	You hear me?
KIP	m	I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	You guys have any skills at all?
KIP	m	Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
MEMPHIS	m	How old are you now, Toby?
TOBY	m	Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	What about him?
KIP	m	Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
FREB	m	People gotta eat ...
MEMPHIS	m	Okay, then... Otto?
OTTO	m	In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
TUMBLER	m	One night? Are you nuts?
MEMPHIS	m	You got maybe a better plan?
KIP	m	You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit
MEMPHIS	m	"Shadow games?"
KIP	m	Shadow games ...
MEMPHIS	m	You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail. Go on, Otto -
OTTO	m	We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	There's no one left ...
OTTO	m	We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
MIRROR MAN	m	You know of one -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
DRUNK	m	One more, girl -
SWAY	?	I think you've had enough, Billy...
DRUNK	m	Enough? I haven't even started, girl. Gimme another --
SWAY	?	If you leave now, Billy, you can get a head-start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit...
DRUNK	m	Listen, you little cooze--
SWAY	?	Come back when you've learned how to drink, Billy --
MEMPHIS	m	See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
SWAY	?	What are you doing here?
SWAY	?	What's with the look?
MEMPHIS	m	The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
SWAY	?	You look like you lost your sheep ...
MEMPHIS	m	You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
SWAY	?	Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
MEMPHIS	m	Buy you a drink?
SWAY	?	Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend. Mitch.
MEMPHIS	m	"Mitch?"
SWAY	?	Mitch.
MEMPHIS	m	So I was replaced by Mitch?
SWAY	?	No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
MEMPHIS	m	Wow. And to think all I accomplished these past six years was the "LORD OF THE RINGS" trilogy... You look great --
SWAY	?	Yeah, well, you always were a sucker for flawed existences ... You should leave --
MEMPHIS	m	On account of Mitch?
SWAY	?	On account of me.
MEMPHIS	m	I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
SWAY	?	No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
MEMPHIS	m	I left town. I didn't leave you.
SWAY	?	A distinction worth noting ...
MEMPHIS	m	And here I am...
SWAY	?	Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
MEMPHIS	m	Kip's in trouble
SWAY	?	What kind of trouble -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
SWAY	?	And you got some Italians -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Six or seven...
SWAY	?	I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
MEMPHIS	m	I understand -
MITCH	m	Another round, Sara -
SWAY	?	Sure, Mitch -
MITCH	m	How you doing, pal? She's hot, right?
MEMPHIS	m	I'd go so far as to say "lovely."
MITCH	m	You should her face when she's having sex --
MEMPHIS	m	Really?
MITCH	m	Really...
MEMPHIS	m	What's it look like? Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted face? Agonized and writhing and ugly? Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!
SWAY	?	What the hell are you doing -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
MITCH	m	Who was that guy, Sara?
SWAY	?	Good question ...
TUMBLER	m	Freb's here. Open the gate.
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	We sent him out on a solo boost. See what he could do ...
FREB	m	How do I look in this one?
MIRROR MAN	m	Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac.
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	How'd it go?
FREB	m	Keys were in it ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Well, that defies the point, don't it?
MIRROR MAN	m	You should ask him how he got the name "Freb."
FREB	m	Shaddup, man ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Get the damn thing in there and get it cleaned up -
KIP	m	This is loaded with crap - get a duffel. Holy shit ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Lemme see that - Heroin.
KIP	m	No shit?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	There's gotta be a million bucks worth here -
TUMBLER	m	We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich!
MEMPHIS	m	Where'd you pick her up?
FREB	m	In front of one of them poker parlors in Chinatown ...
MEMPHIS	m	Well, take it back --
KIP	m	Take it back? What do you mean take it back? Are you crazy, man?
MEMPHIS	m	Take it back, Freb --
MIRROR MAN	m	Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man - Now, see what you--
OTTO	m	Who is it -- ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Castlebeck.
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
OTTO	m	one minute -- !
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	I know you.
MEMPHIS	m	You know my back.
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	What are you still doing here, Randall?
MEMPHIS	m	Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	What's this -- ?
OTTO	m	Cadillac.
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	What's wrong with it -- ?
OTTO	m	Needs brightening ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.
OTTO	m	No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
RADIO	m	329 HRO. There's no want on the license at this time...
MEMPHIS	m	You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Something like that -
MEMPHIS	m	Let her rip ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
OTTO	m	Double-meaning intended, right?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Right ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
MEMPHIS	m	I don't think so, Detective ... Take her back to where you found her, Freb --
MEMPHIS	m	Hey - Kip - What do you got there?
HELEN RAINES	f	The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
MEMPHIS	m	What time of year?
HELEN RAINES	f	Tuesdays ...
MEMPHIS	m	You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
HELEN RAINES	f	Every day. I wonder about that every day...
MEMPHIS	m	Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership... Imagine us selling cars? Imagine that -- ?
HELEN RAINES	f	And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
MEMPHIS	m	Mother -- ! I remember, every day, he'd come home in a different car. That was the greatest thing ... And we'd climb all over it ... Examine every inch of every different car ...
HELEN RAINES	f	I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
MEMPHIS	m	You remember that, Kip?
KIP	m	I was six ...
MEMPHIS	m	After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ... And he started showing me the things ... It was a way to kill two birds ... Put food on the table for you and Kip ... And ... Ride in different cars every night ... Just like when Dad was here.
KIP	m	Ancient history's two things. "Ancient." And "history!" We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.
HELEN RAINES	f	I know...
MEMPHIS	m	We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost. No skill. No finesse. Can only take the car if the key is in it. That's not thieving. That's parking ... Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...
TOBY	m	They're just cars, man ...
MEMPHIS	m	This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
TOBY	m	Who's "Eleanor?"
MEMPHIS	m	The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
TOBY	m	Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
MEMPHIS	m	All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
MEMPHIS	m	And there she is -- Hello, Eleanor --
TOBY	m	It looks just like a regular Mustang --
KIP	m	Don't go there, Toby --
MEMPHIS	m	She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
TOBY	m	So she flies -
MEMPHIS	m	She soars -
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Grade-A unicorn ...
TOBY	m	What's a "unicorn?"
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Fabled creature. You know - the horse with the horn? Impossible to capture? We all got one. The single car that, no matter how many times you try to boost, something happens... Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner comes back. It's voodoo...
TOBY	m	You guys and the car thing, man --
MEMPHIS	m	See you in a few days, Eleanor --
MIRROR MAN	m	And you just stick it in the lock. Hit this little button ... And ...
OTTO	m	We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ... Can I try -- ?
MIRROR MAN	m	Knock yourself out --
TOBY	m	I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
MEMPHIS	m	So what's in there -- ?
TOBY	m	I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
KIP	m	Good work, Toby --
FREB	m	It just ain't happening --
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
FREB	m	What's that?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	On boost night? Always take along a good mix tape ... You bring a woman back to your crib for some lovemaking, the song you put on, depends on the woman, the type of lovemaking you intend to do, right?
FREB	m	I guess ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
FREB	m	okay ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
FREB	m	Got it ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Good. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out and got some big game ... Hello, Sway. I was just telling the lads about mix tapes --
SWAY	?	Janis Joplin. Billie Holliday. Ella Fitzgerald...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Gender bias ...
OTTO	m	I've missed you, Sara Wayland --
SWAY	?	Good to see ya, Otto --
KIP	m	How ya doing, Sway -- ?
SWAY	?	Kip...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	What do you think about all this?
SWAY	?	Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's Errand", right -- ?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	That's my girl --
MEMPHIS	m	That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
SWAY	?	Hey - No questions. I'm here. I need the dough.
MEMPHIS	m	Of course ...
SWAY	?	Good. Just so we understand... Oh, shit. You didn't --
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Well, well, well. The original crash test dummy...
FREB	m	Who's that -- ?
OTTO	m	That's The Sphinx.
FREB	m	The Sphinx?
OTTO	m	He never says a word. And he's got a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx. He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like time ... Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !
MEMPHIS	m	Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
MIRROR MAN	m	Where we going -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	We're going shopping -- !
MEMPHIS	m	How's it going -- ?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	It's arright ... Check it out: 173 Firebird. Know who drove one of those ... ?
OTTO	m	Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
MEMPHIS	m	Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
MIRROR MAN	m	For real?
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
KIP	m	Peugot convertible ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	What color?
KIP	m	Gray.
FREB	m	How you know that?
KIP	m	Remember who my brother is?
OTTO	m	DUKES OF HAZARD?
MIRROR MAN	m	Fuck that cracker shit --
TUMBLER	m	I know that one. General Lee, I believe, was a ... Dodge Charger ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	You ever notice how it had a different interior every week? That bugged me.
MIRROR MAN	m	Three words: Get A Life.
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	I'd like the names and addresses of the owners of these 20 cars please...
WOMAN	f	It'll take me about 15 minutes.
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	I can wait.
FREB	m	Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
KIP	m	Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
OTTO	m	Yes, but what was on the license plate?
MIRROR MAN	m	The license plate?
TUMBLER	m	I know. "ROBIN 1."
OTTO	m	Very good. But what was the significance of "ROBIN 1"?
FREB	m	Was that his first name?
OTTO	m	His first name was Thomas. Thomas Magnum...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be exact.
TUMBLER	m	Robin 1 ...
MIRROR MAN	m	I know! Robin was the name of that faggy guy who hung with him...
KIP	m	No. That was Higgins ....
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
MIRROR MAN	m	You're like a serial killer, ainchoo?
WOMAN	f	It's two dollars per car. That'll be 40 dollars please...
OTTO	m	Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
MEMPHIS	m	Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
OTTO	m	Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
SWAY	?	I don't know that
KIP	m	Stumped -- !
FREB	m	Thank-God, Sway, you ain't all freaky- deaky, too
SWAY	?	How about: a Corvette in MAGICIAN; a Ford pick-up truck in INCREDIZLE HULK, and...
OTTO	m	Here's where it gets tricky ...
SWAY	?	... he walked in THE COURTSHIP OF
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
OTTO	m	That's a good one, Donny...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	I think so too --
MIRROR MAN	m	Ya'll really need to get the fuck out of the house more...
MEMPHIS	m	Hello -- ?
SWAY	?	Hey.
MEMPHIS	m	What's wrong with her -- ?
SWAY	?	The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...  You know Annie's trouble
MEMPHIS	m	Annie -- ?
SWAY	?	You haven't been studying -- 137 Roadster. Custom. Lives at 1443 Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes ...
MEMPHIS	m	Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
SWAY	?	She was the only "Annie" you could find?
MEMPHIS	m	They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
SWAY	?	Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
SWAY	?	... and he keeps "Annie' in his living room... Like a work of art ...
SWAY	?	She's got 27 miles on her o-dom. Which is exactly how far away the custom shop was in 1979 when he bought her... He drove her home, never drove her again ...
SWAY	?	The man's a freak...
SWAY	?	She's trouble --
MEMPHIS	m	I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
SWAY	?	I go with you --
MEMPHIS	m	That what you want?
SWAY	?	That's what I want ...
MEMPHIS	m	Okay. I missed you, you know -
SWAY	?	You mentioned that in your letters
MEMPHIS	m	I always thought you'd follow me up.
SWAY	?	We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
MEMPHIS	m	Very good...
SWAY	?	Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
MEMPHIS	m	No way ...
SWAY	?	No ... ?
MEMPHIS	m	No ...
SWAY	?	Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
MEMPHIS	m	Oh. Okay. Right.
MEMPHIS	m	I'm on the move -
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Your girl works in there ...
MEMPHIS	m	Not my girl anymore
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
MEMPHIS	m	What do you want from me?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
MEMPHIS	m	This one ... What's that thing -- ?
KIP	m	Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
MEMPHIS	m	How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
KIP	m	After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
MEMPHIS	m	Thank-you ...
KIP	m	De nada ...
MEMPHIS	m	Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
KIP	m	The family that steals together, deals together...
MEMPHIS	m	Dad'd be proud --
KIP	m	Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
MEMPHIS	m	What era was that -- ?
KIP	m	The era when crime didn't pay --
MEMPHIS	m	As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
KIP	m	Price of doing business...
MEMPHIS	m	What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
KIP	m	It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
MEMPHIS	m	We've got to shake them tomorrow night. I'm making that your problem. That's called delegation of duties. You like it -- ?
MIRROR MAN	m	Sure, man --
MEMPHIS	m	Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each team has been assigned their ladies. The teams are: me and Sway. Donny and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror Man, you and The Sphinx ...
MIRROR MAN	m	Aw, c'mon, man ...
TOBY	m	What about me?
MEMPHIS	m	You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
TOBY	m	How come ... ?
MEMPHIS	m	Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
TOBY	m	Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
KIP	m	There's no talkin' to him --
OTTO	m	To a safe and successful session of bumping fenders and trading paint.
BEACH BOYS	m	"Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put me down But I got the fastest set of wheels in town, etc."
CALITRI	m	This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
MEMPHIS	m	Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
CALITRI	m	Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
OTTO	m	So saith the God of Scumbags --
CALITRI	m	Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no cars have yet to be delivered. And there's only one more night ...
OTTO	m	Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I wonder, if delivery isn't made?
CALITRI	m	With all the free time I've had not counting cars as they're loaded onto my ship, I've managed to sand the cedar inside your box, Kip. This  will protect you from the anaerobic bacteria, that normally thrives in an airless; environment. Thus prolonging decay ...
MEMPHIS	m	Get out of here, Ray --
CALITRI	m	One more night --
MEMPHIS	m	Get out --
CALITRI	m	I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
DRYCOFF	m	Oh, this is a good time --
HAWKINGS	m	How much can one man smoke?
DRYCOFF	m	It's a crime, ain't it? Cos Castlebeck's got a bug up his ass over this guy, I gotta get lung cancer ...
DONNY	m	What are you doing?
TUMBLER	m	Watch and learn, old-timer --
DONNY	m	The hell are you doing?
MIRROR MAN	m	Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.
TUMBLER	m	The Hemi Has Landed --
DONNY	m	Big deal. Now what?
MIRROR MAN	m	What we call: fun and shit.

FREB	m	Yeah.
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
MIRROR MAN	m	This is some state-of-the-art shit, kid. The drill breaks the sockets, which force back the spindle and release the lock ...only it doesn't seem to be working... And The Sphinx is getting impatient ...
MEMPHIS	m	Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
SWAY	?	Deodorant.
MEMPHIS	m	Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown --
SWAY	?	So, you seeing anybody?
MEMPHIS	m	No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
SWAY	?	She was so great, why'd you leave her?
MEMPHIS	m	Her parole officer strongly recommended  it ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	What's the matter?
FREB	m	It's all microchips and shit ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Yeah? I don't care what kind of car it is. How fancy; how expensive; how new. You pop the collar - it's 1966 all over again ... !
FREB	m	Cool ...
KIP	m	So we loaded all of the keyed cars up and dropped 'em ... It was cake ... 8 cars, ba-da-bing ...
MEMPHIS	m	Having fun, Kip?
KIP	m	Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ... I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
MIRROR MAN	m	Just give me another --
MIRROR MAN	m	Oh, I get it: old school.
MEMPHIS	m	How's it going?
MIRROR MAN	m	It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
SWAY	?	It's just... so... beautiful ...
MEMPHIS	m	C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
SWAY	?	I think so... They're just... So ...
MEMPHIS	m	I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good -- Let's go, people --
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
FREB	m	C'mon, man ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	We're partners here --
FREB	m	My names "Fred." You know: Frederick? One drunk night, I decided to give myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I used a mirror to guide me ... The mirror messed me up with the "b" and the "d"... Everything's reversed, you know? Now, I'm "Freb."
DONNY ASTRICKY	m	Glad to know you, "Freberick." Let's roll -
MEMPHIS	m	You okay -- ?
KIP	m	I'm cool. We gonna make it?
MEMPHIS	m	Too early to tell. Nervous?
KIP	m	Nah.
MEMPHIS	m	That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
KIP	m	I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
MEMPHIS	m	That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ... Showtime --
MEMPHIS	m	Hello, Tracy... Shit.
MIRROR MAN	m	Gina -- ! Check it -- Oooh. "Snake." Tough guy. "Snake." Homeboy wants you to call him: Snaake-! No whistles ... That's weird... This shit's on point. Check it: 200. Halfway there, we switch. I drive.
MIRROR MAN	m	Say goodbye to your ride, Snake...
MEMPHIS	m	What's this guy up to -- ?
SWAY	?	It's 1:30 on a Tuesday. Is that any time to pick a girl up for a date? What, are they gonna mack -- ? Maybe she's got a roommate...
JUNIE	f	... that's right. They'll be in the lobby of the Riviera Building. 2206 Beacon Street. Palos Verdes ...

MEMPHIS	m	... okay, check with you soon ... Otto says 22 ladies have reported for work... Man, they're going at it
SWAY	?	They're in love ...
MEMPHIS	m	What about you?
SWAY	?	You remember my Gramma? Yeah. I was thinking. If she were alive. And she asked me. If she came down, right now. Asked me. "What do you do, Sara? What's your life?" Innocently. Nonjudgemental. I think it would break her heart if I said I was a thief. I steal cars, Gramma. And even though, hey, I learned it all from her son. My Uncle Eddie. Who taught me the basics.  Which you refined. (You remember Randall, Gramma? You thought he was neat. Well, he refined the basics ... ). I don't think that's what she hoped for me... But ... That said... Car thieves are my weakness ... It's all so terribly Loretta Lynn or something, I know... But ... I don't wanna be a thief anymore ... I don't wanna love a thief anymore ... I want to wear a dress maybe once in a while... Maybe have a kid... Watch a lot of Audrey Hepburn movies.. And think about my Gramma without also thinking "shame on me. Shame on me. Shame on me... "
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	m	It's an epidemic, Rollie ... I'm getting reports every five minutes ...
SWAY	?	Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
MEMPHIS	m	Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness. I approach you. It's quiet. I look this way. That. No one around ...
SWAY	?	Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
MEMPHIS	m	I take out my slim-jim...
SWAY	?	Oh, God...
MEMPHIS	m	Slip it in ...
SWAY	?	You're going high-cheese, dude --
MEMPHIS	m	Unlock your button ...
SWAY	?	"Unlock my button" ... ?
MEMPHIS	m	The alarms go off ...

SWAY	?	You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ... Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
MEMPHIS	m	And Tracy's on the move ...
SWAY	?	Wham, bam, thank-you, Ma'am, point- five ...
MIRROR MAN	m	What do I do? What do I do? Aw, man. He's gonna swallow my shit whole  Let's go to a hospital or something! C'mon, you creepy no-nosed motherfucker. Take me to a hospital!
MIRROR MAN	m	What are you doing? I'm gonna die!
FREB	m	You ever feel bad about any of this?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	m	I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...

OTTO	m	She left...
MIRROR MAN	m	Poor Toby, man...
THE SPHINX	m	If his premature demise has, in some way, enlightened the rest of you as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired you to change your ways, then his death carries with it an inherent nobility. And a supreme glory. We should all be so fortunate. You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."
FREB	m	You spoke
TUMBLER	m	Say something else, man
MEMPHIS	m	You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
KIP	m	Sure, man --
MEMPHIS	m	She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
KIP	m	You want me to buy her?
MEMPHIS	m	Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
OTTO	m	Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
MEMPHIS	m	I'll see you soon --
KIP	m	Where you off to -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	Thought I'd go for a ride -
KIP	m	Hey, Memphis -- ? I'll see you, right?
MEMPHIS	m	You'll see me ...
SWAY	?	What are you doing... ?
MEMPHIS	m	Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
SWAY	?	I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and-- Where to -- ?
MEMPHIS	m	I dunno. I know a place.
SWAY	?	This time it's for real?
MEMPHIS	m	Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
BUTZ	m	Do you believe this?
DIGGER	m	What should we do?
BUTZ	m	We gotta do what we gotta do --
DIGGER	m	Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why can't he finish the freakin' job?
BUTZ	m	Forget about it. Occupational hazard, Digger. C'mon...
MEMPHIS	m	What -- ?
SWAY	?	Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
MEMPHIS	m	She does have one thing you don't.
SWAY	?	What's that?
MEMPHIS	m	Bench seats.
MEMPHIS	m	You like bingo -- ?
