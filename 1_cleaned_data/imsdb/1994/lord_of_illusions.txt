BUTTERFIELD	?	Swann...?
BUTTERFIELD	?	Master?
NIX	m	And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix, you're my instrument. From now on, you'll be called the Puritan...
CULTISTS	?	Puritan...
CULTISTS	?	Yes...
BUTTERFIELD	?	Master?
BUTTERFIELD	?	Swann's here.
NIX	m	We'll come back to this. Get about your business.
NIX	m	Hush...
NIX	m	I said hush.
GIRL	f	Please.  Let me go.
NIX	m	What is it?
NIX	m	I think he's in love.
GIRL	f	Keep it away from me.
GIRL	f	Please... please...
BUTTERFIELD	?	eyed) Want me to shoot Swann?
NIX	m	You don't like him, do you?
BUTTERFIELD	?	He wants your magic.
NIX	m	Maybe.  Go fetch him.
GIRL	f	What are you going to do?
SWANN	m	Are we ready?
JENNIFER	f	Say the word.
PIMM	f	Look, maybe we should think this over.
SWANN	m	No.  He's gone too far.
PIMM	f	So he took a child.
JENNIFER	f	He'll kill her.
PIMM	f	No he won't.
SWANN	m	He's not going to get the chance.
QUAID	m	If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.
SWANN	m	So stay out here.
BUTTERFIELD	?	He's expecting you.
SWANN	m	Look around.  If you find 'the child, yell.  She's got blonde hair, that's all I know.
1ST MAN	m	Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you weren't coming back.
QUAID	m	I changed my mind.
1ST WOMAN	f	Come and join us.
SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST	?	Don't do that!
JENNIFER	f	Don't be afraid.
BARBARA	f	I'm not... want to see?
PIMM	f	He's going to kill us all...
JENNIFER	f	Where did Swann go?
QUAID	m	Stay the fuck away! Pimm!  Get over here!
SWANN	m	You're going to be okay.
NIX	m	I knew you'd come.
NIX	m	I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
SWANN	m	Fuck you.
NIX	m	You don't think I've got it to give?
SWANN	m	No!
NIX	m	You're wrong.
NIX	m	I could eat your fucking soul, Swann.
JENNIFER	f	Fuck!
NIX	m	You want to know what the world really looks like?
NIX	m	Want to see flesh with a god's eyes?
SWANN	m	Aah!
QUAID	m	Get away from the door!
QUAID	m	Swann?
NIX	m	Here he is.
NIX	m	Take a look, Swann!  These are your friends.
JENNIFER	f	What have you done to him?
QUAID	m	Swann.  It's okay.
SWANN	m	Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
NIX	m	You want to be like that, Swann?  Mud and shit?
NIX	m	Come here.  Share the power.
NIX	m	Swann!  Swann!
NIX	m	Help me!
SWANN	m	Jesus-
1ST CULTIST	?	confidence) You can't kill him.
2ND CULTIST	?	He'll just rise up again!
NIX	m	Help me!
JENNIFER	f	Quickly!
NIX	m	Swann?  What are you doing?
SWANN	m	Binding you.
NIX	m	Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!
NIX	m	Swï¿½
GIRL	f	Is it finished?
SWANN	m	It's finished.
PIMM	f	Dead?
QUAID	m	Dead.
PIMM	f	What now?
SWANN	m	We bury him so deep no one will ever find him.
BLONDE GIRL	f	How'd you spell that again?
HARRY	m	D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
BLONDE GIRL	f	D'Amour.
HARRY	m	Right.
BLONDE GIRL	f	Isn't that French for something?
BELLBOY	m	Mister D'Amour?
HARRY	m	Yeah.  It's French.
BLONDE GIRL	f	For love, right?
BELLBOY	m	Mister D'Amour?
HARRY	m	Right.
BLONDE GIRL	f	That's so cool.
BELLBOY	m	Mister D'Amour?
HARRY	m	Yeah?
BELLBOY	m	You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
HARRY	m	How much?
BELLBOY	m	Thirty-five bucks.
HARRY	m	Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
HARRY	m	Just kidding.
HARRY	m	I've got my life in there.
HARRY	m	Hello, L.A.
BELLBOY	m	Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
HARRY	m	You bet.
HARRY	m	Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either got a great sense of humour or he's paying her to laugh. disgust) Jesus.
HARRY	m	He's finished.
HARRY	m	Nine twenty-six p.m.  He's off again.
HARRY	m	Superstitious?
TAPERT	m	Oh my God!
QUAID	m	Ahh. . .
MILLER	m	Fuckhead.
HARRY	m	What the fuck!?
HARRY	m	Shit!
HARRY	m	Don't touch him."
BUTTERFIELD	?	What are you going to do about it?
BUTTERFIELD	?	Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping.  And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
QUAID	m	Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
BUTTERFIELD	?	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
BUTTERFIELD	?	So do you.  You've seen the future.  Haven't you?
QUAID	m	Yes.
BUTTERFIELD	?	And are you afraid?
QUAID	m	Yes.
QUAID	m	Don't leave me.
HARRY	m	You need an ambulance.
QUAID	m	Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
HARRY	m	NO ... I...
QUAID	m	My God.
HARRY	m	What?
QUAID	m	You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
HARRY	m	Yeah.  You could say that.
QUAID	m	You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you. You don't like that.
HARRY	m	Not much.
QUAID	m	You can't change it.  You have to walk... ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
HARRY	m	Hold on.
QUAID	m	I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
HARRY	m	The Puritan?
QUAID	m	Yes...
HARRY	m	Who is he?
HARRY	m	Shit.
EDDISON	m	What were you doing up there?
HARRY	m	I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
EDDISON	m	Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
HARRY	m	Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
EDDISON	m	What makes you so sure?
HARRY	m	I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
EDDISON	m	New one on me. Okay.  Let's see him.
EDDISON	m	Where the fuck is he?
HARRY	m	He got up and walked.
EDDISON	m	After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
HARRY	m	I don't think he'd have given a shit.
BUTTERFIELD	?	D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
MILLER	m	I know him.  I saw him.
MILLER	m	I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
BUTTERFIELD	?	He's a priest?
MILLER	m	No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you.
BUTTERFIELD 	?	I don't want him getting in the way.
MILLER	m	He won't.
BUTTERFIELD	?	We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
MILLER	m	What do you mean, "all of us?"
BUTTERFIELD	?	You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
MILLER	m	About?
BUTTERFIELD	?	Death.
MILLER	m	What about death?
BUTTERFIELD	?	It's an illusion.
RADIO	m	"I really want to see you, Lord, And it won't take long, my Lord, My sweet Lord..."
CLEMENZIA	f	Coffee, Mrs. Swann?
DOROTHEA	f	Thank you.
DOROTHEA	f	Where's Mr. Swann?
CLEMENZIA	f	In his study. He got something on his mind?
DOROTHEA	f	Why?
CLEMENZIA	f	Bad mood today.
DOROTHEA	f	Hey...
DOROTHEA	f	Bad show last night?
SWANN	m	The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
DOROTHEA	f	... they believe you.
SWANN	m	Yeah. Remember Quaid?
DOROTHEA	f	Sure.
SWANN	m	Somebody killed him.
DOROTHEA	f	Oh God.
SWANN	m	I just saw him.
SWANN	m	I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
DOROTHEA	f	Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
SWANN	m	No. I'm not going near him.
VALENTIN	m	Higher.  Another inch.  The left hand side's too low.
DOROTHEA	f	Valentin?
VALENTIN	m	Good.  There. Yes?
DOROTHEA	f	You saw this?
DOROTHEA	f	I want you to find this man D'Amour for me.
HARRY	m	What...?
HARRY	m	Shit.
VALENTIN	m	Mr. D'Amour?
HARRY	m	Go away.
VALENTIN	m	It's one in the afternoon.
HARRY	m	What are you, my mother?
VALENTIN	m	I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
HARRY	m	Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
VALENTIN	m	We've never met.
HARRY	m	Then what do you want?
VALENTIN	m	I'm here to offer you a job.
HARRY	m	I'm going back to New York in-- Shit!  I'm outta here.
VALENTIN	m	Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
HARRY	m	Do I get lunch?
HARRY	m	Whose is the car?
VALENTIN	m	Mine.
HARRY	m	Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
VALENTIN	m	Maybe I just bought it.
HARRY	m	Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
HARRY	m	Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
VALENTIN	m	You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world.
HARRY	m	Philip Swann?
VALENTIN	m	You know of him?
HARRY	m	I saw him in Vegas once.
VALENTIN	m	Are you a gambling man?
HARRY	m	When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
VALENTIN	m	Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
HARRY	m	What's the difference?
VALENTIN	m	Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
HARRY	m	Any movie stars buried here?
VALENTIN	m	Probably.
HARRY	m	It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
VALENTIN	m	I don't think the dead much care.
HARRY	m	Are you sure?
VALENTIN	m	Are you a believer, then?
HARRY	m	I've signed on for them all in my time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't have too many saviours.
HARRY	m	Who is she?
VALENTIN	m	Swann's wife.
DOROTHEA	f	I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
HARRY	m	Did your husband know Quaid?
DOROTHEA	f	Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
HARRY	m	You don't?
DOROTHEA	f	I think we make our own futures.
HARRY	m	What's the connection?
DOROTHEA	f	I don't exactly know.  Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
HARRY	m	Why not?
DOROTHEA	f	He's a secretive man.
HARRY	m	And you don't ask questions?
DOROTHEA	f	We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
HARRY	m	Does that mean...?
DOROTHEA	f	We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
HARRY	m	But obviously you still care what happens to him.
DOROTHEA	f	We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
DOROTHEA	f	You don't believe me.
HARRY	m	He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
HARRY	m	Sorry.  You asked.
DOROTHEA	f	No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
HARRY	m	Where do I sign?
DOROTHEA	f	Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
HARRY	m	Harry.
DOROTHEA	f	Harry.
HARRY	m	I'm no bodyguard.
DOROTHEA	f	That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards.  And stop it from happening.
HARRY	m	When do you want me to start?
DOROTHEA	f	Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
HARRY	m	Do you?
DOROTHEA	f	I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
HARRY	m	Sure.
HARRY	m	You're not listening to me, Loomis.
LOOMIS	m	The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
HARRY	m	No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
LOOMIS	m	You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
HARRY	m	I got to go.  I'm late.
LOOMIS	m	Call me tomorrow.
HARRY	m	There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
LOOMIS	m	Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
HARRY	m	A couple of weeks.
LOOMIS	m	One question.
HARRY	m	What?
LOOMIS	m	Who is she?
LOOMIS	m	I thought so.  'Night, Harry.
DOROTHEA	f	I'm glad you could make it.
HARRY	m	Hey, this is a big deal for me. You know what seats like this cost in New York?
SWANN	m	Valentin!
SWANN	m	Valentin!
VALENTIN	m	I'm here.
SWANN	m	The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who I think it is?
SWANN	m	He's young.
1ST TECHNICIAN	m	Ready?
SWANN	m	Ready.
1ST TECHNICIAN	m	How the fuck does he do that?
2ND TECHNICIAN	m	It's wires, man.
1ST TECHNICIAN	m	I never seen no wires.
2ND TECHNICIAN	m	So what is it?  Magic?
SWANN	m	Ladies and gentlemen.  You are standing on the threshold of a miracle...
SWANN	m	My friends ... come with me...into the Great Beyond.
HARRY	m	He's good.
DOROTHEA	f	You haven't seen anything yet.
DOROTHEA	f	This is the new illusion.
HARRY 	m	There's something wrong...
DOROTHEA	f	No. . .
1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER	m	What happened?
2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER	m	It's a trick.
3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER	m	Somebody help him.
DOROTHEA	f	I've got to get to him!
HARRY	m	Out of the way!  Out of the way!
VALENTIN	m	Get then out of here, for God's sake --
STAGE MANAGER	m	You heard him!  It's not a fucking show!
STAGE MANAGER	m	Who are you?
MILLER	m	Psst!
DOROTHEA	f	Swann...
DOCTOR 	m	I'm a doctor.  Let me through.
DOCTOR	m	I'm sorry...
HARRY	m	Hey!
MILLER	m	Got you, fucker!
BUTTERFIELD	?	Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed Swann?
HARRY	m	You did. Didn't you?
BUTTERFIELD	?	Why would I do that?
HARRY	m	Beats me.
BUTTERFIELD	?	You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
HARRY	m	Deep shit?
BUTTERFIELD	?	Who did this?
HARRY	m	I told you --
BUTTERFIELD	?	Who did this?
HARRY	m	All right.  It was...
HARRY	m	... it was...
BUTTERFIELD	?	Aah!
HARRY	m	Deep shit...
EDDISON	m	And this Butterfield guy--
HARRY	m	--vanished.
EDDISON	m	Another fucking magician. Jesus.
HARRY	m	Are you finished with me?
EDDISON	m	For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
HARRY	m	No.  Not yet...
HARRY	m	Are they treating you okay?
DOROTHEA	f	I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
HARRY	m	I'm sorry I got into this too late.  But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
DOROTHEA	f	I don't know where you'd start.
HARRY	m	Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
DOROTHEA	f	They won't tell you anything.
HARRY	m	I can be very persuasive.
DOROTHEA	f	Yes.  I think you probably can. We'd need to talk about your fee.
HARRY	m	Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't... ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
HARRY	m	Where'd you learn that?
WILDER	m	What?
HARRY	m	That.
WILDER	m	At birth.  I don't know you --
HARRY	m	Harry D'Amour.
WILDER	m	I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
HARRY	m	I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
WILDER	m	What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
HARRY	m	Was he taking a lot of risks?
WILDER	m	You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
HARRY	m	Not the Walter Wilder?
WILDER	m	The one and only.
WILDER	m	Want to try?
WILDER	m	You know Vinovich?
HARRY	m	Sure.  Vivovich.
WILDER	m	He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
HARRY	m	I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
WILDER	m	People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
HARRY	m	For what?
WILDER	m	For an introduction.
HARRY	m	Well... nobody.
WILDER	m	You do now.
HARRY	m	I only wear ties for funerals.
WILDER	m	You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
WILDER	m	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
WILDER	m	That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
HARRY	m	Have you been in?
WILDER	m	No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. He's a little crazy, by the way.  And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
VINOVICH	?	It's more than entertainment. We're opening people's heads up.  Putting miracles back into their boring little lives.
BILLY	m	But they're fake miracles.
VINOVICH	?	Houdini believed he had spirit guides.
HARRY	m	You believe that?
VINOVICH	?	I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
HARRY	m	Heaven and Hell?
VINOVICH	?	Trickery and divinity.
HARRY	m	Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
VINOVICH	?	No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
HARRY	m	So could you walk on water?
VINOVICH	?	I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
HARRY	m	What about Swann's miracles?
VINOVICH	?	They weren't worth a damn.
HARRY	m	I heard he was the best.
VINOVICH	?	If he was so good why's he so dead?
HARRY	m	You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
VINOVICH	?	Oh, I've got plenty.
HARRY	m	I'd like to hear them.
VINOVICH	?	I'm not saying another word. You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
HARRY	m	Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
VINOVICH	?	He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
HARRY	m	With what?
VINOVICH	?	Evil.  He was evil. Come on.
VINOVICH	?	Say nothing to this man if you wish to keep my company.
HARRY	m	Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
VINOVICH	?	Fuck you.
BILLY	m	Harry!
BILLY	m	I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
HARRY	m	They go together.
BILLY	m	I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
HARRY	m	Who?
BILLY	m	Nix.
HARRY	m	Nix?
BILLY	m	Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
HARRY	m	Who is he?
BILLY	m	I think maybe he taught Swann. This is me.  See ya around.
DOROTHEA	f	... I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards...
BUTTERFIELD	?	Ever watched a man die?
QUAID	m	Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
BUTTERFIELD	?	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
QUAID	m	I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
HARRY	m	Shit!
HARRY	m	This is D'Amour.
DOROTHEA	f	Harry... I know it's late.
HARRY	m	That's okay.
DOROTHEA	f	How did it go today?
HARRY	m	I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
DOROTHEA	f	They were jealous of him.
HARRY	m	Why?  Because he had you?
DOROTHEA	f	He... didn't have me..  I told you-
HARRY	m	You didn't marry him for love.
HARRY	m	So why did you marry him?
DOROTHEA	f	That's my business. Harry.
HARRY	m	Just curious. Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea?
DOROTHEA	f	Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
HARRY	m	What about Jennifer Desiderio?
DOROTHEA	f	It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
HARRY	m	Okay.  I'll keep digging.
DOROTHEA	f	Yes.  You do that.
BUTTERFIELD	?	If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping.
HARRY	m	Yes...
HARRY	m	Desiderio...
HARRY	m	What the fuck are you doing here?
VALENTIN	m	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
HARRY	m	Why'd you come here?
VALENTIN	m	You're a detective, with no clues.  Where else are you going to look?  I'm going to keep this brief. Here's thirty thousand dollars.
HARRY	m	What for?
VALENTIN	m	A ticket home,
HARRY	m	You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
VALENTIN	m	She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
HARRY	m	Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
VALENTIN	m	Yes.  It's regrettable
HARRY	m	Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
VALENTIN	m	What for?  You need to stay busy?
HARRY	m	I like to know why things happen.
VALENTIN	m	Why people die? Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
HARRY	m	No.
VALENTIN	m	Don't try and see her, D'Amour. Just leave her alone.  Let her heal.
HARRY	m	Lock up, will you?
TOFFLER	m	Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
HARRY	m	A Mister Quaid?
TOFFLER	m	Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
HARRY	m	I won't say anything.
TOFFLER	m	Jennifer's been with us four years.  She was coming on nicely.  But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
HARRY	m	What's her problem?
TOFFLER	m	She has no real grip on reality.
HARRY	m	Does anybody?
TOFFLER	m	Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
HARRY	m	And what does Jennifer think's real?
TOFFLER	m	Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming for her. Jennifer?
JENNIFER	f	Have we met before?
HARRY	m	No.
JENNIFER	f	Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
HARRY	m	Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
JENNIFER	f	Maybe... I... don't...
HARRY	m	What about Philip Swann?
JENNIFER	f	I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar.
HARRY	m	Why's that?
JENNIFER	f	He said he knew how to protect us.  But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
HARRY	m	What is?
JENNIFER	f	I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me.  He'll find me.
HARRY	m	Swann?
JENNIFER	f	I told you.  I don't --
JENNIFER	f	God no!  Oh God no!
NURSE	f	Calm down!
JENNIFER	f	He's not going to get me!
JENNIFER	f	He's not!  He's not!
HARRY	m	Who's not?
JENNIFER	f	Nix! Nix!
HARRY	m	Is he the Puritan?
JENNIFER	f	Yes! Yes!
HARRY	m	And he's dead?
JENNIFER	f	No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
NURSE	f	I'll take care of her now.
NURSE	f	Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!
HARRY	m	Jennifer!
HARRY	m	Jesus.
HARRY	m	Jesus.
HARRY	m	I want to speak to Dorothea.
VALENTIN	m	I'm afraid she's not in.
HARRY	m	When will she be in?
DOROTHEA	f	Who is it?
VALENTIN	m	Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
DOROTHEA	f	No word from D'Amour?
VALENTIN	m	It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
DOROTHEA	f	Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
VALENTIN	m	I left three messages already.
HARRY	m	Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I wanted to get into the repository at the Magic Castle?
HARRY	m	You've done this before.
BILLY	m	I've had my moments.
BILLY	m	I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
HARRY	m	How?
BILLY	m	It'll be something hokey.
BILLY	m	Houdini'd been proud of you.
BILLY	m	Whoa...
BILLY	m	I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
HARRY	m	You heard right.
BILLY	m	You ever been married?
HARRY	m	Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
BILLY	m	Why?
HARRY	m	My life was too weird for her.
BILLY	m	I love weird.
HARRY	m	Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
BILLY	m	Nope.
BILLY	m	What did I tell you?  So fucking hokey.
HARRY	m	What have we got here?
HARRY	m	Grab the files!
BILLY	m	Jesus!
BILLY	m	I could have lost my fucking hands.
HARRY	m	That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle. Which was presumably the idea. These are about Nix.
HARRY	m	You go through these.  Go on!
HARRY	m	Wait a minute...
HARRY	m	That's Butterfield...
BILLY	m	doorway) And who's that?
HARRY	m	At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.
BILLY	m	Take a look at this.
HARRY	m	A Nix specialty?
BILLY	m	I don't know any of these tricks...
HARRY	m	Maybe they're not tricks.
BILLY	m	I mean, there's no instructions-- What do you mean, they're not tricks?
HARRY	m	What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
BILLY	m	Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
HARRY	m	That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
BILLY	m	Knew what?
BILLY	m	Harry!
BILLY	m	Where the fuck are you?
HARRY	m	Okay.  Hold it right there.
BILLY	m	Get it off me!
HARRY	m	Hokey enough for you?
BILLY	m	I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
HARRY	m	I'm coming.
HARRY	m	Ah, shaddup!
HARRY	m	Thanks, Billy.
BILLY	m	Hey, anytime. Actually, no.  This was enough.
VALENTIN	m	I can't let you in.
HARRY	m	Yeah, I know.
VALENTIN	m	You want more money, is that it?
HARRY	m	Dorothea?
VALENTIN	m	Leave her alone --
HARRY	m	Shut up!
DOROTHEA	f	This is the way he wanted it... no autopsy, no embalming. Nobody meddling with his body...
DOROTHEA	f	Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. Why did you come back?
HARRY	m	I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
DOROTHEA	f	What did you find?
HARRY	m	Jennifer Desiderio, for one. response) She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
DOROTHEA	f	Oh Christ.
HARRY	m	Why don't you tell me the truth?
HARRY	m	Nix ran some kind of cult, right?  Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
DOROTHEA	f	It was more than that, I think.
HARRY	m	He was the real thing, right?
DOROTHEA	f	Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
HARRY	m	Stuff?
DOROTHEA	f	He could get into people's heads.  Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate.  Juggle fire.
HARRY	m	He taught all this to Swann?
DOROTHEA	f	Some or it.
HARRY	m	So Swann was performing magic. not illusions? And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
DOROTHEA	f	I told you --
HARRY	m	Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
DOROTHEA	f	No.
HARRY	m	You said you weren't with him for love.
DOROTHEA	f	I wasn't.
HARRY	m	 What then?
DOROTHEA	f	I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
HARRY	m	He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
DOROTHEA	f	Shit!
HARRY	m	It's okay.
DOROTHEA	f	No it isn't.  You can't help me.
HARRY	m	I'm here, aren't I?
HARRY	m	Nothing's going to happen to you.
DOROTHEA	f	Nothing?
HARRY	m	Nothing you don't want.
DOROTHEA	f	I was so afraid.
HARRY	m	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
DOROTHEA	f	Are you sure?
HARRY	m	I'm sure. He's dead.
DOROTHEA	f	I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
DOROTHEA	f	I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
HARRY	m	And they all came...
DOROTHEA	f	Yes.
HARRY	m	Quaid and Jennifer--
DOROTHEA	f	And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
DOROTHEA	f	What was that?
HARRY	m	It's okay.
HARRY	m	Valentin?
DOROTHEA	f	Harry?  Wait!
HARRY	m	What the hell-?
HARRY	m	Aah!
DOROTHEA	f	It's him!  It's Nix!
HARRY	m	Valentin!  Get some lights on!
HARRY	m	Somebody you know?
DOROTHEA	f	Oh my God!
HARRY	m	Which goes first?  My face or your heart?
DOROTHEA	f	Who in God's name are you?
DOROTHEA	f	Are you all right?
HARRY	m	Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
VALENTIN	m	What are you doing?  This is sacrilege.
VALENTIN	m	Are you satisfied now?
HARRY	m	No.
DOROTHEA	f	Harry?
HARRY	m	It's all right.  It's not hurting...
HARRY	m	...plaster doesn't bleed.
HARRY	m	It looks like you're not a widow after all.
HARRY	m	You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
VALENTIN	m	Yes.
HARRY	m	You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
VALENTIN	m	Yes.
HARRY	m	And then... because I was getting too close to something -- --or someone, you called Swann
VALENTIN	m	I tried to pay you off.
HARRY	m	Was that Swann's idea?
VALENTIN	m	No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
HARRY	m	Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
VALENTIN	m	Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
HARRY	m	I want to see Swann face to face.
VALENTIN	m	Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
DOROTHEA	f	What about me?
VALENTIN	m	Nix was never interested in you.  It was always Swann.
HARRY	m	Maybe Valentin's right.  We should let it alone.
HARRY	m	He went to all that trouble to be dead.  Maybe we should let him stay that way.
1ST WORKER	m	Watch out!
VALENTIN	m	Who's there?
BUTTERFIELD	?	I've sometimes thought, if I'd had another profession, I would have been a surgeon.
BUTTERFIELD	?	To be able to heal with one little cut.
VALEMTIN	m	No. . .
BUTTERFIELD	?	Let's say those eyes of yours were giving you trouble.
VALENTIN	m	Please.
BUTTERFIELD	?	I could scoop them out.
VALENTIN	m	Don't.
BUTTERFIELD	?	So tell me where Nix is buried.
VALENTIN	m	I don't know.
VALENTIN	m	Wait!
VALENTIN	m	I'll tell you.
BUTTERFIELD	?	You'll do more.than that.
HARRY	m	I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay away.
HARRY	m	You had to see who wept for you the most.
HARRY	m	A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
SWANN	m	They'll never find out.
HARRY	m	Look, Ma, no wires.
SWANN	m	You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
HARRY	m	How the fuck do you do that?
SWANN	m	Now I'm going to have to kill you.
HARRY	m	I don't think so.  You need me alive.
SWANN	m	Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
HARRY	m	Be careful.  Funerals make me trigger-happy.
HARRY	m	You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
SWANN	m	Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
HARRY	m	Or murdered, like Nix.
SWANN	m	He deserved it.
HARRY	m	Maybe he doesn't see it that way.  Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
SWANN	m	I did it for Dorothea.
HARRY	m	Oh yeah?
SWANN	m	Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
HARRY	m	So Nix won't come looking for her?
SWANN	m	It's me betrayed him.
HARRY	m	And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
SWANN	m	I don't know what else to do.
HARRY	m	Help me.
HARRY	m	Listen.  If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god.  And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are.  And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history.
SWANN	m	Is this the best brandy you've got?
CASHIER	m	If that's what's on the shelves.
SWANN	m	Can you change a thousand for me?
CASHIER	m	You're shittin' me.
HARRY	m	Can we go?
HARRY	m	Oh Jeez.
SWANN	m	Will that do?  No?
SWANN	m	That better?
DOROTHEA	f	Who's there?
VALENTIN	m	I'm sorry.
DOROTHEA	f	Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
BUTTERFIELD	?	It was me.
BUTTERFIELD	?	Guess who we're going to see?
SWANN	m	You think I'm an asshole.
HARRY	m	Didn't know you read minds.
SWANN	m	I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour.  But you know that. So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
HARRY	m	Is that all?
SWANN	m	I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
HARRY	m	And you're not?
SWANN	m	Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
HARRY	m	And he didn't have them?
SWANN	m	He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
HARRY	m	Is that all?
SWANN	m	No. At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly.  Shit...
HARRY	m	And you believed him?
SWANN	m	I saw it with my own fucking eyes!  See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth. Are you ready for that?
SWANN	m	Hey!
SWANN	m	Thought not.
HARRY	m	Dorothea?
SWANN	m	She's not here.
HARRY	m	Did she know where Nix was buried?
SWANN	m	No.
HARRY	m	Who else did?  Did Valentin?
SWANN	m	Yes.
HARRY	m	Jesus!
BUTTERFIELD	?	Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
DOROTHEA	f	Why did you wait so long?
BUTTERFIELD	?	I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
DOROTHEA	f	And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
BUTTERFIELD	?	If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
DOROTHEA	f	What is he?
BUTTERFIELD	?	Maybe he'll show you.
NORMAN	m	He will come!  He will come! He will come!
BUTTERFIELD	?	Anything?
VALENTIN	m	Not yet.
BUTTERFIELD	?	If you've lied to me to me --
VALENTIN	m	I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
BUTTERFIELD	?	Five more minutes.  Hear me? And you'd better not --
BUTTERFIELD	?	What the fuck are you playing at?
BUTTERFIELD	?	Aah!
VALENTIN	m	Butterfield!
VALENTIN	m	In the corner...
BUTTERFIELD	?	Keep away from it.
VALENTIN	m	Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
BUTTERFIELD	?	It's him... it's him.
HARRY	m	They got here before us.
SWANN	m	Looks that way.
HARRY	m	Shit!
HARRY	m	Swann?  Swann!
VALENTIN	m	D'Amour --
HARRY	m	Shit...
VALENTIN	m	Help me.
HARRY	m	Swann!
HARRY	m	Swann!
HARRY	m	Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.
VALENTIM	m	He's got Dorothea.
SWANN	m	And Nix?
VALENTIN	m	Him too.
HARRY	m	We've got to get you to a hospital.
VALENTIN	m	Don't bother.
HARRY	m	Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
VALENTIN	m	I'm sorry, D'Amour...
HARRY	m	What about?
VALENTIN	m	... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
HARRY	m	... no...
SWANN	m	He's better off this way.
HARRY	m	Nobody's better off this wav!
SWANN	m	You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
SWANN	m	That's where we're all going.
HARRY	m	In my time, and nobody else's.
BUTTERFIELD	?	Do you wish him to be amongst us?
CULTISTS	?	Yes...
BUTTERFIELD	?	Will you come to him on your knees?
CULTISTS	?	Yes...
BUTTERFIELD	?	Be ready.
DOROTHEA	f	Listen.  You've got everything you want.  You don't need me. ..
BUTTERFIELD	?	No, but he will.  After what you did to him.
BUTTERFIELD	?	He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS that.
BUTTERFIELD	?	Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...
CULTISTS	?	He's coming home... he/s coming home...
DOROTHEA	f	Christ in Heaven.
BUTTERFIELD	?	He's with us...
CULTISTS	?	He's with us... He's with us...
DOROTHEA	f	Oh God!
BUTTERFIELD	?	Hold her!
NIX	m	Aaarrrgh!
HARRY	m	Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
SWANN	m	At a guess... they just resurrected him.
HARRY	m	Fuck.
NIX	m	Children...
NIX	m	Will you suffer to come unto me?
NIX	m	I've come back to share the wisdom of the grave.  Will you hear it?
CULTISTS	?	Yes... yes...
NIX	m	Follow me then.
NIX	m	Do I know you, child?
NIX	m	Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun this time, child? Where's Swann?
DOROTHEA	f	I don't know where he is.
NIX	m	He'll come.  We've got unfinished business, he and I.
NIX	m	Something terrible's going to happen.  But if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little longer.
NIX	m	Are you ready for my wisdom?
CULTISTS	?	Tell us... tell us...
SWANN	m	This is where we killed him.
HARRY	m	You didn't try hard enough.
SWANN	m	I can't... I can't go any further...
NIX	m	Here is my wisdom.
BARBARA	f	Show us. Puritan.
NORMAN	m	Yes, show us!
ALL	m	Show us!  Show us!
SWANN	m	Whatever he's doing to her, stop him!
NIX	m	You see, I escaped the grave. So I have to give something to the grave in return.
NORMAN	m	What's happening?
NIX	m	I have to give something back. So I'm giving you.
BARBARA	f	Why?  Why?
NIX	m	You're not worthy.  None of you.  Only Swann was worthy. You just waited like lambs.
NIX	m	Well I'm not your shepherd.
SWANN	m	Aah!
BUTTERFIELD	?	Go on, bleed. again) Go on!  Go on!
BUTTERFIELD	?	No!
NIX	m	You're not Swann.  Who are you? Oh... I know what you want. He lets Dorothea slip from his arms.
DOROTHEA	f	Oh God!
HARRY	m	Hang on!
SWANN	m	Nix!
NIX	m	There you are.
NIX	m	I've had a lot of time to think about you.  Where I went wrong...
SWANN	m	And?
NIX	m	I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
NIX	m	You could still help me do that.
SWANN	m	Why would I want to?
NIX	m	Because you've got nothing else to live for.
SWANN	m	Not true.
NIX	m	The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
HARRY	m	I've got to help him.
DOROTHEA	f	You can't.
HARRY	m	Nix has got to have a weak spot.  Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
BUTTERFIELD	?	Bastard!
NIX	m	Will you help me?
SWANN	m	Yes.
NIX	m	You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
SWANN	m	Yes.
NIX	m	But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
SWANN	m	Yes.
NIX	m	Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
SWANN	m	No!
NIX	m	Liar!
NIX	m	Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?
NIX	m	She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy. I'll show you!
SWANN	m	Harry!
SWANN	m	Harry!  Stop him!
NIX	m	Where is she?
NIX	m	Where did she go?
NIX	m	You've got Swann's disease. You think a little courage, a little love, and it'll all be all right.  Wrong!
HARRY	m	Oh God!
NIX	m	Tell me where she is... and I'll make it go away...
HARRY	m	Oh God... oh God...
WOMAN           	f	Help me.
HARRY	m	Dorothea!
HARRY	m	Dorothea!  Dorothea!
HARRY	m	No!  No!  No!
DOROTHEA	f	Harry...
DOROTHEA	f	It's not real, Harry-
DOROTHEA	f	Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's good between us, believe it.
HARRY	m	... oh... God...
DOROTHEA	f	I'm here, Harry.
HARRY	m	...yes?
DOROTHEA	f	Yes.
NIX	m	There you are, child.
DOROTHEA	f	Don't look.
HARRY	m	I... have... to.
NIX	m	Come on, child.  I want Swann to see you die.
NIX	m	What are you looking at?
HARRY	m	There... there!
DOROTHEA	f	Harry?
HARRY	m	I'm okay.  I'm okay.
NIX	m	One... last... illusion...
DOROTHEA	f	Oh my God.
SWANN	m	... D'Amour...
NIX	m	I am the purest of the pure.  I am the darkest of the dark...
SWANN	m	Harry.  You can't kill him.
HARRY	m	He did something with the ground.
SWANN	m	Yes?
HARRY	m	Can you do it?
SWANN	m	I don't know.
HARRY	m	Try.
NIX	m	I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond Hell.
HARRY	m	Get out of here!
NIX	m	No!  No!  No!
DOROTHEA	f	Harry!
DOROTHEA	f	Is it finished?
HARRY	m	I think so.
DOROTHEA	f	Come on...
HARRY	m	What the fuck?
DOROTHEA	f	Harry-?
HARRY	m	Out!  Out!
HARRY	m	It's finished.
