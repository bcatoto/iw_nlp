MERLIN	m	Lord Uther! Lord Uther!
MERLIN	m	It's done. A truce. We meet at the  river.
UTHER	m	Talk. Lovers murmuring to each  other...
DUKE OF CORNWALL	m	I spit on your truce, Uther. If you  want peace, throw down your swords.
UTHER	m	I should butcher all and every one  of them. Merlin, what is this wagging  of tongues?
MERLIN	m	Just show the sword.
MERLIN	m	Behold the sword of power, Excalibur.  Before Uther, it belonged to Lud,  before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf  to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to  Thor himself and that was when the  world was young and there were more  than seven colors in the rainbow. Speak the words.
UTHER	m	One land, one king! That is my peace!
DUKE OF CORNWALL	m	Lord Uther, if I yield to the sword  of power, what will you yield?
UTHER	m	Me, yield!?
MERLIN	m	He has given. Now you must.
UTHER	m	The land from here to the sea is  yours if you will enforce the King's  will.
DUKE OF CORNWALL	m	Done!
DUKE OF CORNWALL	m	My Lord King Uther, let us feast  together. To my castle. Lord Merlin,  you must join -
DUKE OF CORNWALL	m	I would wish you such a wife, Lord  Uther, as my Igrayne. So innocent,  but in bed, a furnace...
UTHER	m	I must have her.
LOT	?	What? You're mad! What about the  alliance?
UTHER	m	I must have her.
LOT	?	And risk all you've won? This castle  commands the sea gate to the kingdom.
UTHER	m	You will be mine. Wife and queen,  bed and crown.
IGRAYNE	f	I want no other crown and no other  bed than those I have.
UTHER	m	Merlin! Where are you!?
UTHER	m	Have you found him?
ULFIUS	?	No--
HAG	m	What a hurry you were in this morning,  good sir. You forgot to give this  old woman a coin.
ULFIUS	?	I saw you half a day's gallop from  here. I asked you if you had seen  Merlin. I returned here straight  away. How did -
HAG	m	--I heard. I have come. I am also  Merlin.
MERLIN	m	I have walked my way since the  beginning of time. Sometimes I give,  sometimes I take. It is mine to know  which, and when.
UTHER	m	Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
MERLIN	m	I know the storm inside you, and  what it has wrought. The alliance I  forged is wrecked.
UTHER	m	For Igrayne. One night with her. Do  it. Use the magic.
MERLIN	m	You will swear by your true kingship  to grant me what I wish. Then you  shall have it.
UTHER	m	I swear it. By Excalibur and the  holy--
MERLIN	m	--What issues from your lust will be  mine. Swear it again.
UTHER	m	I swear it.
DUKE OF CORNWALL	m	It's Uther and all his best knights.  He leaves behind little more than  fledglings to guard his camp.
MERLIN	m	Come.
MERLIN	m	I hold the balance of all things in  my summoning. Arise mists. Come fog.
MERLIN	m	Mount your horse.
MERLIN	m	Ride straight to the castle, across  the sea of fog.
UTHER	m	But the cliff, the sea...
MERLIN	m	Ride across! Across the bridges of  desire. Your lust will hold you up.  For I have just woven it into the  fabric of the world. This is magic -  making solid what is in the mind,  and unsolid, that which is already  solid.
RIDER	m	Wake up in there. It is I.
'DUKE' OF CORNWALL	m	Have the horse ready. I ride out  before sunrise.
MORGANA	f	Papa... Papa...
MORGANA	f	My father is dead...
IGRAYNE	f	Look, here is your father. It was  just a dream, little one.
'DUKE' OF CORNWALL	m	Come Igrayne.
MERLIN	m	It is done. The future has found  root in the present.
IGRAYNE	f	When did it happen? Where?
LIEUTENANT	m	In the camp of Uther, my lady, just  after nightfall.
IGRAYNE	f	It can't be. He came to me, to his  bed, last night.
LADY	f	It was his spirit, yearning for you  in his hour of death, that visited  you.
IGRAYNE	f	His spirit?
IGRAYNE	f	Tintagel Castle falls to Uther. But  what shall become of me, and the  child I bear?
UTHER	m	I want her, Merlin. I cannot be  without her. Tintagel is mine. Can I  take her now? Tell me!
UTHER	m	Three horses died under me, so hard  did I spur them here. Is it born? Is  it alive?
UTHER	m	Out!
UTHER	m	What is it, lady?
IGRAYNE	f	A boy, sir. Rest yourself.
UTHER	m	Send the girl away.
IGRAYNE	f	She is just a child -
UTHER	m	Out!
IGRAYNE	f	Go now. Come back later.
UTHER	m	She watches me with her father's  eyes.
UTHER	m	Igrayne, is he mine, or -
IGRAYNE	f	The night he died, a man loved me  with great fierceness. He looked  like my husband, spoke like, smelled  like, felt like my own husband. But  it was not he, for he was already  dead. It wasn't his spirit, for this  child, who was conceived that night,  is flesh and blood. I know nothing  more.
IGRAYNE	f	No--
UTHER	m	Through him, I will learn to love  them, for I am tired of battle. I  will stay by his side and his mother's...
UTHER	m	Here. It's hungry.
UTHER	m	Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at  last.
MERLIN	m	Doing what I did for you, it wasn't  easy, you know. It takes it's toll.  It took nine moons to get back my  strength.
MERLIN	m	Now you must pay me.
UTHER	m	I?
MERLIN	m	The child is mine, Uther. I have  come for him.
UTHER	m	The oath. You didn't say--
MERLIN	m	You didn't ask!
IGRAYNE	f	Uther, is it true? Don't let him  take the child.
UTHER	m	I swore an oath, Igrayne. I made a  pact with Merlin.
IGRAYNE	f	It was you? You came to me that night.  You are the father.
MERLIN	m	It's not for you, Uther, hearth and  home, wife and child.
UTHER	m	To kill and be king, is that all?
MERLIN	m	Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought  once that you were the one to unite  the land under one sword. But it'll  take another, a greater king...
UTHER	m	You strike me with words as hard as  steel.
MERLIN	m	They are not weapons, my friend, but  truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole  his wife and took his castle, now no  one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your  allies will turn against you. Give  me the child, Uther, I will protect  him. Go back to your war tent.
UTHER	m	By the oath, take the devil child.  Take him!
IGRAYNE	f	WHY?... Why must he have the baby?
MORGANA	f	Merlin, are you now the father, and  the mother, of the baby?
URYENS	?	The King's sword. I must have it.
UTHER	m	Merlin, where are you? To weave a  mist, to hide us...
UTHER	m	No one shall have the sword. No one  shall wield Excalibur but me.
MERLIN	m	Into the spine of the dragon! Uther... I loved you, mighty child.
LOT	?	Let me.
SIR ECTOR	m	It is a dark hour... everywhere  lawlessness and destruction, and no  one to lead us out of it.
SIR ECTOR	m	Listen all. I am Sir Ector of Morven  and these are my sons. You would  wrong me, for I have never stolen  from others, or destroyed the fruit  of the land.
SIR ECTOR	m	The people's anger is just. It is  sad that for our own safety, we will  have to ride to the tournament with  these robber knights.
BISHOP	m	This is Easter day, when Christ rose  again. Who will find strength in  victory of arms? Who will draw the  sword?
SIR ECTOR	m	Arthur, where is Kay's sword? A good  squire doesn't forget his knight's  sword.
ARTHUR	m	I left it in the tent, sir.
SIR ECTOR	m	Well hurry then, and get it.
ARTHUR	m	It's been stolen....
SIR KAY	m	Father, I'll go and see what's keeping  him.
ARTHUR	m	If only Kay could have it...
ARTHUR	m	Your sword was stolen, Kay, but here  is Excalibur. Is it too late? I  hurried--
SIR KAY	m	Look, Father. Excalibur. Does that  mean that I am to be king?
SIR ECTOR	m	Did you free the sword, boy?
SIR KAY	m	I... did, Father.
SIR ECTOR	m	We must go to the stone at once.
SIR ECTOR	m	Draw it, son!
SIR KAY	m	Sir, I didn't draw the sword. Arthur  gave it to me.
SIR ECTOR	m	Arthur ?! How did you get the sword, child?
ARTHUR	m	Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was  stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I  took it.
SIR ECTOR	m	You freed it, son?
ARTHUR	m	I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
SIR ECTOR	m	Try the sword, Arthur.
URYENS	?	Stand back, Sir Ector, and take your  children.
LOT	?	We will try again.
SIR ECTOR	m	Let the boy try the sword.
BISHOP	m	Let the boy try...
SIR ECTOR	m	Go ahead, boy. Don't be afraid.
BISHOP	m	We have our King, thanks be to God.
ARTHUR	m	Please, Father, rise up. I was your  son before I became your King... if  I am King.
SIR ECTOR	m	My Lord, you are King, all the more  because you are not my son, and I am  not your father.
ARTHUR	m	Who is, then?
SIR ECTOR	m	I don't know. Merlin brought you to  me when you were newly born and  charged me to raise you as my own.  At first, I did so because I feared  Merlin, later because I loved you.
ARTHUR	m	Who is Merlin?
MERLIN	m	Speak of the devil!...
MERLIN	m	I am Merlin. Counselor to kings.  Wizard and beggar. Prophet and... I have feasted on thunderbolts, I  savored my death before I got myself  born. I--
ARTHUR	m	Whose son am I?
MERLIN	m	You are the son of King Uther, and  the fair Igrayne... you are King  Arthur.
LOT	?	Merlin, we haven't forgotten you.  This is more of your trickery.
URYENS	?	You're trying to foist a boy of  dubious birth upon us. You want to  shame us?
LOT	?	Lord Leondegrance, join us against  the boy. Surely you can see he is  only Merlin's tool.
LEONDEGRANCE	?	No. I, Leondegrance, Lord of  Camelyarde, saw the drawing of Uther's  sword, and witnessed no trickery. If  a boy has been chosen, a boy shall  be king.
ARTHUR	m	...Merlin... Merlin...
ARTHUR	m	Merlin!
MERLIN	m	You called, sir?
ARTHUR	m	You saved me from the arrow...
MERLIN	m	But not from your destiny.
ARTHUR	m	I want to thank you.
MERLIN	m	That's not why you came.
ARTHUR	m	Merlin, help me. I need your help. I  don't know how--
MERLIN	m	'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
MERLIN	m	I'm tired. Doing magic takes its  toll, you know. My arms ache  terribly... Once--or is it yet to happen--I stood  exposed to the Dragon's breath so  that a man could lie one night with  a woman. It took me ten moons to  recover. I'm sure that story would  interest you, since... Well, we'll  have to talk about it another time.  You're too busy now.
MERLIN	m	It is whispered in the forest that... ...Leondegrance's castle is under  siege by Lot and Uryens.
ARTHUR	m	Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody  does. Lord Leondegrance is my only  ally among the barons and the great  knights. I can't lose him.
MERLIN	m	Well there. You don't need me half  as much as you think you do. You  already know what must not happen.
ARTHUR	m	I must find the means to save him,  then. I was hoping I could ask you  for a little magic help, but if it  makes you so tired...
MERLIN	m	Thank you.
ARTHUR	m	It's just that I have no experience,  and no men to speak of. How can I--
MERLIN	m	Because you must! You and only you.  Have you forgotten that it was you  who freed Excalibur?
MERLIN	m	Besides, it will be a good lesson. The best, if it's not the last.
MERLIN	m	Maybe you'd like to meet the power  that gave you the sword?
ARTHUR	m	How? Where?
MERLIN	m	In the great book.
ARTHUR	m	What book is that?
MERLIN	m	The book without pages. Open before  you, all around us. You can see it  in bits and pieces, for if mortal  men were to see it whole and all  complete in a single glance, why, it  would burn him to cinders.
ARTHUR	m	What?!
MERLIN	m	The dragon! There...
MERLIN	m	Coiled in the unfathomed depths, it  emerges...
MERLIN	m	...It unfolds itself in the storm  clouds...
MERLIN	m	...it washes its mane sparkling white  in the blackness of seething  whirlpools...
MERLIN	m	...its claws are the forks of  lightning... its scales glisten in  the bark of trees...
MERLIN	m	...its voice is heard in the  hurricane...
MERLIN	m	...it is so much more than a scaly  monster. It is Everything!
ARTHUR	m	And if I am to be King of everything,  lord and commoner, beast, leaf and  rock, I must use its voice, its claws,  its power.
GUENEVERE	f	Father, it's the boy King.
LEONDEGRANCE	?	It is. I will fight my way to his  side.
URYENS	?	War-wise fighters, grown gray in  battle, checkmated by a boy.
LOT	?	It's Merlin's trickery, nothing more.  I won't swear faith to that wizard's  brat.
ARTHUR	m	Let's finish this with a show of  force. We have no more tricks and no  more advantages.
GUENEVERE	f	No...
SIR ECTOR	m	No... Arthur--
ARTHUR	m	You are in my hands, to slay or spare.  I need battle lords such as you.  Swear faith to me and you shall have  mercy.
URYENS	?	Noble knights swear faith to a mere  squire?
ARTHUR	m	You are right. I'm not yet a knight. You, Uryens, will knight me.
ARTHUR	m	Then as knight to knight I can offer  you mercy.
MERLIN	m	What's this, what's this?!
MERLIN	m	I never saw this...
URYENS	?	In the name of God, of Saint Michael  and Saint George, I give you the  right to bear arms, the power to  mete justice.
ARTHUR	m	That duty I will solemnly obey as  knight and King.
URYENS	?	Rise, my King. I am your humble  knight, and I swear allegiance to  the courage in your veins, for so  strong it is, it's source must be  Uther. I doubt you no more.
ARTHUR	m	Owww...
GUENEVERE	f	It didn't hurt too much, did it?
ARTHUR	m	Ye...
GUENEVERE	f	--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've  sewn my father's wounds more than  once.
GUENEVERE	f	Careful! You'll have to stay still  for a few days or you'll tear them  open.
ARTHUR	m	But I have to leave tomorrow. The  forests are thick with rebels,  invaders plunder our shores...
GUENEVERE	f	--And damsels in besieged castles  are waiting to be rescued?
ARTHUR	m	I didn't know Leondegrance had a  daughter.
GUENEVERE	f	Well, then, I shall tell you which  knights have maiden daughters, so  you can avoid their castles.
GUENEVERE	f	No, I think it's better if you just  stay here to heal. At least a week.
ARTHUR	m	I'm going.
GUENEVERE	f	Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth  too.
GUENEVERE	f	Would you rescue me from a fiery  dragon, sir?
GUENEVERE	f	It's just a furry little rabbit that  took the bait and sprung the trap.
GUENEVERE	f	You'll find him served up to you  tonight, cooked in a most excellent  sauce...
MERLIN	m	A king must marry, after all.
ARTHUR	m	...of course...
ARTHUR	m	I love her. If she would be my queen,  my dreams would be answered.
MERLIN	m	There are maidens as fair, and fairer  than Guenevere. If I put my mind to  it, I could see them now, many of  them, weeping for love of you,  watching the hills for you coming  from the high towers of their castles.  Offering you their every favor. Rich,  clever--but if it is to be Guenevere,  so be it.
ARTHUR	m	Who will it be? Put your mind to it,  then.
MERLIN	m	Guenevere. And a beloved friend who  will betray you.
ARTHUR	m	Guenevere...
MERLIN	m	You're not listening. Your heart is  not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
GUENEVERE	f	They are only for you, for in them I  mixed things that heal, but not too  quickly; and things that make limbs  sleepy, preventing escape, but keep  one's mind sharp.
ARTHUR	m	What's in them?
GUENEVERE	f	It is an ancient mixture, containing  only soft, unborn grains, and flavored  with roses. The rest is secret.
MERLIN	m	Looking at the cake is like looking  at the future. Until you have savored  its bitterness and its sweetness,  its texture and its perfume, what do  you really know? And then, of course,  it will he too late.
MERLIN	m	Too late...
SIR ECTOR	m	He is the mightiest and fairest of  knights.
ARTHUR	m	We fought and won battles, and now  one man defeats all my knights? I  will go.
SIR KAY	m	A king must not engage in single  contest. I'll go again.
ARTHUR	m	Where is Merlin?
ARTHUR	m	I should have left you to fend for  yourself.
MERLIN	m	I had to weave a little enchantment  on the bees so I could get some honey,  and I didn't feel up to using any  more magic just yet. Anyway, I was  in less danger than you'll be in  today.
ARTHUR	m	So you were stealing their honey.  They should have killed you.
MERLIN	m	Come now. So much anger for such a  little crime? Are you sure there is  nothing else troubling you?
ARTHUR	m	You know full well there is, and I  go to meet it now. Come witness my  revenge.
LANCELOT	m	Good day to you, sir.
ARTHUR	m	Move aside. This is the King's road,  and the knights you joined arms  against were his very own.
LANCELOT	m	I await the King himself. His knights  are in need of training.
ARTHUR	m	I am King, and this is Excalibur,  sword of kings from the dawn of time.  Who are you, and why do you block  the way?
LANCELOT	m	I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from  across the sea. I am the best knight  in the whole of Christiandom, and I  look for the king who is worthy of  my sword's service.
ARTHUR	m	--That is a wild boast. You lack a  knight's humility.
LANCELOT	m	Not a boast, sir, but a curse. Never have I met my match in joust  or duel.
ARTHUR	m	Move aside!
LANCELOT	m	I will not. You must retreat or prove  your kingship in the test of arms,  under the eyes of God.
ARTHUR	m	Then may He give me the strength to  unhorse you and send you with one  blow back across the sea.
LANCELOT	m	Hold! I offer you another lance.
LANCELOT	m	You joust well, sir. Battle learnt,  but tournament fancy. You should  ride more forward in the saddle,  though.
LANCELOT	m	Yield. I have the advantage.
ARTHUR	m	I will not.
ARTHUR	m	Fight me from your horse or on foot,  but fight me. Your avoidance mocks  me.
LANCELOT	m	I sought only not to harm you, sir.
LANCELOT	m	Sir, your rage has unbalanced you.  It seems you would fight to the death  against a knight who is not your  enemy, for a length of road you can  ride around.
ARTHUR	m	So be it, to the death.
LANCELOT	m	It is you, sir, who knows not the  virtue of humility, as a true king  must.
ARTHUR	m	What horror is this? Merlin!
MERLIN	m	The sword is broken. Hope is broken...
ARTHUR	m	My pride broke it, my rage broke  it... Humiliation and defeat lie in  ambush even for a king. This excellent knight who fought  with fairness and grace was meant to  win. With Excalibur, I tried to change  that verdict.
ARTHUR	m	I have lost for all time the ancient  sword of my fathers whose power was  meant to unite all men, to serve the  vanity of a single man.
ARTHUR	m	I am nothing.
ARTHUR	m	Excalibur! Is it true?
MERLIN	m	The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take  it, quickly!
MERLIN	m	There are infinite worlds within the  infinite coils of the Dragon. In one  of them, which I have not traveled,  the sword was forged. I only know  that the King is returned to us  through the instrument of his power.  The game continues!
ARTHUR	m	Thanks to God, you are alive.
LANCELOT	m	I, the best knight in the world,  bested! This is a great day, for my  search is over. I love you, my King.
ARTHUR	m	You are still the best knight in  Christiandom. You gained a hundred  advantages over me. It is I who must  love you, for through your courage  and patience you taught me a bitter  lesson.
LANCELOT	m	Then make me your champion and I  will always fight in your place.
ARTHUR	m	But your life and lands are far from  here.
LANCELOT	m	I gave up my castles and my lands!
LANCELOT	m	My domain is here, inside this metal  skin. And I would pledge to you all  that I still own: muscle, bone, blood  and the heart that pumps it.
ARTHUR	m	And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot,  you will be my champion.
LANCELOT	m	In the name of Jesus Christ and His  holy blood, I swear eternal faith to  Arthur, King.
KNIGHT	m	...We killed every one of them. Burnt  their ship...
ARTHUR	m	Lancelot, how did you fare in the  North?
LANCELOT	m	We spared the lives of a few, so  they could sail home and tell their  fellows what fate they met at the  hands of King Arthur's knights...
ARTHUR	m	And you, Uryens?
URYENS	?	Victory!
ARTHUR	m	Lot, and you?
LOT	?	We drove the invaders into the sea.
ARTHUR	m	You, Gawain, the East?
GAWAIN	m	The East is ours again.
ARTHUR	m	The war is over. One land, one King.  Peace.
KNIGHT	m	Let me through. I fought the King's  battle too. He must know my story.
MERLIN	m	Chaos... confusion... brutes...  savages... troglodytes... Stand  back... make space.
MERLIN	m	The moon... the sun... the stars...  they spin... they turn... they  circle... around us... us...
MERLIN	m	You, and you, and you, take up your  place. Be wedded to the world. Respect  its perfection. All of you, together,  be one.
ARTHUR	m	Your ancient wisdom and infinite  sight have forged this circle, Merlin.  Hereafter we shall come together in  a circle, to tell and hear of deeds  good and brave. I will build a table  where this fellowship shall meet.  And a hall around the table. And a  castle about the hall.
ARTHUR	m	And I will marry.
ARTHUR	m	And the land will have an heir to  wield Excalibur.
ARTHUR	m	Knights of the Round Table, good  friends, brothers in arms. I send  you on a quest harder by far than  the battles we have fought together,  a quest to uphold always, and  everywhere, justice, honor, and truth.  Each day shall bring forth a cause,  and may each cause bring forth a  knight.
LANCELOT	m	I swear never to rest twice on the  same pillow till all men live at  peace.
KNIGHT	m	Good day, sir.
LANCELOT	m	Good day to you.
LANCELOT	m	I hear the stifled cry for help, I  smell the reek of fear...
LANCELOT	m	These men repented before God for  their evil deeds. Those who would  not, met their fate at the end of my  sword. Accept the fruit of my first quest  as my wedding gift.
ARTHUR	m	I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
ARTHUR	m	Sit beside me, Lancelot.
ARTHUR	m	Your deeds set an example for all  other knights. For your gift, ask a  gift of me.
LANCELOT	m	Only give me leave to ride out again,  to do what I am most able to do, and  happiest doing.
GUENEVERE	f	He must stay for the feasting days  of our wedding, and tell his deeds  himself.
ARTHUR	m	I grant you your wish if you grant  Lady Guenevere hers.
LANCELOT	m	I will stay Madame.
MERLIN	m	The knights of Galys approach the  camp. It would be politic...
ARTHUR	m	...to ride out and meet them.
ARTHUR	m	I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot,  rest here.
GUENEVERE	f	Don't start a war on my wedding day!
ARTHUR	m	Without Lancelot?!
GUENEVERE	f	Look Lancelot. The maids and ladies  whisper about you. They all dream of  winning you, young and old, fair and  ugly.
GUENEVERE	f	But surely that's no secret to you,  dear Lancelot. You're the bravest  and strongest knight they've ever  seen, and beauty has kissed your  brow.
GUENEVERE	f	The well-kept secret is whether any  of them has won your heart.
LANCELOT	m	No.
GUENEVERE	f	Why?
LANCELOT	m	I am a fighting man and I am married  to the quest. That is enough.
GUENEVERE	f	And there is no maiden in the whole  world who inspires you?
LANCELOT	m	There is one.
GUENEVERE	f	Who?!
LANCELOT	m	You.
GUENEVERE	f	Me?
LANCELOT	m	Yes. I would swear my love to you.
GUENEVERE	f	To me? But why?
LANCELOT	m	I cannot love as a woman the lady  who will be wife to my King and my  friend. And, in pledging my love to  you, I cannot love any other woman.
LANCELOT	m	I will see you in all women, and I  will defend them as I would defend  you.
LANCELOT	m	Lord Merlin, are you ill?
MERLIN	m	No, no, I need air.
URYENS	?	Merlin, don't you join the  celebration?
URYENS	?	My wife, Merlin. Lady Morgana of  Cornwall.
MORGANA	f	I remember you, Merlin. I was a child.  You took my brother away.
MERLIN	m	You left your husband's side? You  left your brother's wedding?
MORGANA	f	Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
MERLIN	m	It is.
MORGANA	f	Can it truly be used for magic?
MERLIN	m	Yes... sometimes...
MERLIN	m	...There are many powers in this  world.
BISHOP	m	Drink this the blood of Jesus Christ  our Lord.
PERCEVAL	m	Sorry. Hungry.
PERCEVAL	m	Have I taken too much?
PERCEVAL	m	I had rabbit yesterday. Today I'll  eat fish... No?
LANCELOT	m	Don't be afraid.
PERCEVAL	m	You're an angel! Not a devil...
LANCELOT	m	Just a man. A knight in the King's  service.
PERCEVAL	m	You're a man?! ...with metal skin!
PERCEVAL	m	Can I grow metal skin?
LANCELOT	m	You've got a lot to learn.
PERCEVAL	m	I'll learn... take me... to the  King... What's a... King?
LANCELOT	m	Very well. Climb up.
PERCEVAL	m	I will run.
LANCELOT	m	Listen, boy, it's more than twenty  days from here.
PERCEVAL	m	Twenty days!? The world is that big?
PERCEVAL	m	Who will give me my sword?
KAY	?	Kitchen knives and greasy spits will  be your weapons, boy.
ARTHUR	m	Enough!... What is a fair price for  the smell of your ale?
FAT MAN	m	That's why we have come to you, sir  There's no one else who can tell us.
ARTHUR	m	What does it cost to get drunk on  your ale?
FAT MAN	m	At least three shillings, sir.
ARTHUR	m	Give me three shillings.
ARTHUR	m	For the smell of your ale, the jingle  of his coins.
MORGANA	f	What did I see today in the wizard's  eyes? Censure, because I enjoy a few  words with a young handsome knight?
MERLIN	m	No, no, of course not. You are  young...
MERLIN	m	I'm not jealous!
MORGANA	f	It's clear you are, and it irks me.
MERLIN	m	No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want  to write poems about you with  moonbeams, make the sea sing your  name...
MORGANA	f	A lovestruck page!
MERLIN	m	Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me,  please... Morgana.
MORGANA	f	A steamy, panting, lovestruck page.  But what good are songs and poems to  me? They are the barter of ordinary  love. A gift that reflected your  greatness is the only one worthy of  your love.
MERLIN	m	I showed you all my conjuring  tricks...
MORGANA	f	The deepest secrets, the forbidden  formulas...
MERLIN	m	Maybe... maybe...
ARTHUR	m	Merlin, are you counselor to the  King, or to my sister?
MERLIN	m	At your service, sir.
ARTHUR	m	Then answer me this. For years peace  has reigned in the land. Crops grow  in abundance, there is no want. Every  one of my subjects enjoys his portion  of happiness and justice, even those  whose tiresome misunderstandings we  must resolve here each day. Tell me,  Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it  seems?
MERLIN	m	Good and evil; there is never one  without the other.
ARTHUR	m	Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
MERLIN	m	Never where you expect it, that's  all I know.
SIR GAHALT	m	If we have peace and justice, why is  Lancelot never with us? Why is he  always riding out on his quests? He  must know where this evil is.
SIR GAWAIN	m	Could there be evil within Lancelot  himself? To live above human folly,  as is his aim, is to be overly proud.
SIR GAHALT	m	He pays no heed even to the Queens  longing for his company.
GUENEVERE	f	What is it you would have your words  mean, Sir Gahalt?
MORGANA	f	Don't listen to him. You are the  Queen.
ARTHUR	m	Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
GUENEVERE	f	No. I meant not to be angry with  you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness  that comes with peace gossip has  bread its own evil. You merely repeat  it. Please, sir, have one of those  apples that Lancelot loves, and in  that gesture partake of its goodness.
GUENEVERE	f	Take one, Sir Gahalt.
SIR GAHALT	m	I am most honored, my lady.
SIR GAWAIN	m	Hear me, Lord Arthur, and knights  and chieftains: I charge Guenevere  with the murder of my brother.
GUENEVERE	f	I didn't... I am innocent.
SIR GAWAIN	m	I champion this truth: That Queen  Guenevere murdered Sir Gahalt with  the aid of sorcery.
ARTHUR	m	The Queen will be in my charge till  a champion steps forward to fight on  her behalf.
GUENEVERE	f	Not you, my husband?
SIR GAWAIN	m	She must be burnt at the stake. That  is the sentence for murder done with  magic.
ARTHUR	m	It is. Lords and knights of the Round  Table, as her husband I say that  this deed was not done by Guenevere.  Who among you will champion this  truth?
ARTHUR	m	Sir Caradoc! You!
CARADOC	m	I am torn.
PERCEVAL	m	I will champion you, my lady.
GUENEVERE	f	I thank you, but you are not yet a  knight.
PERCEVAL	m	I will find Lancelot! He will come!
MERLIN	m	Boys!... boys will be boys...
PERCEVAL	m	I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
LANCELOT	m	--It must wait, child. These good  ladies, for whom I intervened once,  will honor me with a meal. I am  beholden to them now as I was when  they begged my protection.
GUENEVERE	f	Why can't you be my champion?
ARTHUR	m	If I am your judge, I cannot be your  champion. When I act as your King, I  cannot be your husband.
GUENEVERE	f	And you cannot love me...
ARTHUR	m	The laws, my laws, must bind everyone,  high and low, or they are not laws  at all. Lancelot will come...
GUENEVERE	f	And if he cannot be found, no other  knight will champion me, though you  beseeched each and every one of them.  Why be king if there is no one you  can call loyal subject but an eager  boy?
LANCELOT	m	Guenevere, I fight against myself...
ARTHUR	m	Is he coming?
PERCEVAL	m	He heard Lady Guenevere's request  and he said nothing. That is all.
SIR GAWAIN	m	My Lord, the sun is upon the field.  The Queen has no champion. I demand  justice, as is my right.
ARTHUR	m	So it is.
PERCEVAL	m	Let me champion the Queen!
SIR GAWAIN	m	Since no knight comes forward, I  demand justice--
ARTHUR	m	Boy, kneel.
ARTHUR	m	In the name of God, of St. Michael,  and St. George, I make you a knight.  Rise, Sir...
PERCEVAL	m	...Perceval!
LANCELOT	m	It's my task to prove the Queen's  innocence.
SIR GAWAIN	m	The Queen is innocent. I yield to  your mercy, Sir Lancelot.
MERLIN	m	Flesh on flesh. You must press on  the wound, Guenevere, hold it, and  it will begin to bind.
ARTHUR	m	Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere  is returned to me...
MERLIN	m	What is it my child?
ARTHUR	m	Will I have a son?
MERLIN	m	Yes.
ARTHUR	m	Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles,  nothing but a simple yes? That  frightens me.
MERLIN	m	A king should be afraid, always. The  enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush  in the dark corridors of his castle,  on the deer paths of his forest, or  in the gray and winding paths of a  more tangled forest, in here.
GUENEVERE	f	Flesh on flesh. I will heal you.
ARTHUR	m	They miss the battlefield. I think  we do too.
LANCELOT	m	But one can still keep a sword sharp  riding out in the name of the King's  law.
ARTHUR	m	It is not easy for the young ones to  learn knightly virtues without the  hard teaching of war and quest. It  is only your example, Lancelot, that  binds them now.
ARTHUR	m	Which is the greatest quality of  knighthood? Courage? Compassion?  Loyalty? Humility? What do you say,  Merlin?
MERLIN	m	What? The greatest? They blend together  like the metals we mix to make a  good sword.
ARTHUR	m	I didn't ask for poetry. Which is  it?
MERLIN	m	All right. Truth. It must be truth,  above all. When a man lies he murders  some part of the world.
LANCELOT	m	Conversation and court life don't  suit me. I must take my rest in the  forest.
ARTHUR	m	Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
LANCELOT	m	It is deep...
ARTHUR	m	You will be sorely missed. Heal  yourself and come back.
LANCELOT	m	Why? You will destroy Arthur, and  us...
LANCELOT	m	The law forbids it.
GUENEVERE	f	Love demands it.
LANCELOT	m	There are things about love--
GUENEVERE	f	--Nothing!
LANCELOT	m	By my knight's sword, I swore faith--
LANCELOT	m	Guenevere...
ARTHUR	m	I am alone and betrayed. By my wife,  by my beloved friend, by my knights.  And by you. Perhaps most of all by  you. For you made me, you forged  this wretched life. And like a child  tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a  babbling lecher trotting after my  sister...
MERLIN	m	That is my destiny. I have a destiny,  too...
ARTHUR	m	With all your powers, you are content  to be ridiculed, laughed at...
MERLIN	m	My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to  cheap tricks... Yes! I enjoy every moment of my  foolishness, I join in the making of  it, so no one can betray me. But  you! You betray yourself.
ARTHUR	m	Me? I have lived by the oath of king  and knight.
MERLIN	m	You betray the boy who drew the sword,  the boy who saw the Dragon... the  Dragon who moves close by, coiling  and uncoiling, restless, looking  down, waiting for the King to be a  king...
ARTHUR	m	I must do it myself. I must kill  them both. Lancelot and Guenevere.  Will you ride with me, Merlin?
MERLIN	m	I cannot. I must not. Here I must  stay.
MORGANA	f	Crazy old fool. You think yourself a  kingmaker. Ha! A meddler, more likely.  Look what a mess you've made of  things.
MERLIN	m	I? Perhaps, perhaps. I'm losing  interest, Morgana... I have helped  men--or meddled in their affairs, if  you would have it that way--since  the dawn of time. Now let them live  by their own laws. Let them stand on  their own feet. The gods of once are  gone forever, it is time for men...  Morgana, make a man out of me. Kiss  me.
MORGANA	f	You know what I want. I want the  secret of true magic, how to thicken  the stuff of dreams and wishes with  the flesh of the world.
MERLIN	m	That I cannot.
MORGANA	f	Then I will not.
LANCELOT	m	Why didn't he kill us?
GUENEVERE	f	He has given up.
LANCELOT	m	The King without his sword, the land  without a king...
GUENEVERE	f	We are to blame.
MERLIN	m	When Arthur built the castle, I carved  out a place for myself, where I could  laugh or sleep, and no one would  bother me.
MORGANA	f	People make you laugh?
MERLIN	m	They do.
MORGANA	f	Why?
MERLIN	m	They don't know how close they live  to the edge of delight or disas...
MERLIN	m	Happiness or horror.
MERLIN	m	In the folds of the earth where the  forces that hold the world together  are more alive, my power is strongest.  Here I will possess you, as a man  possesses a woman. And the god, the  eunuch, the mule that I was, will be  no more.
MORGANA	f	You are truly magnificent!
MERLIN	m	Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant  of your stupid little games? Preying  on you weakness of others. That's  your power, a petty evil. Mine is  great. Great plans. Impossible dreams.  Laughable endings...
MORGANA	f	Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the  true Name of the charms of Doing and  Undoing. Show me!
MERLIN	m	I won't. You would misuse such power.  I have paid enough for you, and I  will have you.
MORGANA	f	Make magic, my foolish wizard. For  our love. Weave a marvelous room  around us, a room worthy of our  coupling.
MERLIN	m	What do you want? You must desire it  for me to weave it.
MORGANA	f	Walls of shining crystals, burning  with red fire, furnishings of metals  and jewels never seen by man...
MERLIN	m	Desire it and it will be as you  desire.
MORGANA	f	It's only a semblance. You disappoint  me.
MERLIN	m	Don't touch the walls. Come close to  me.
MORGANA	f	Do it, Merlin, the deepest secret.  Fix it with the charm of Making, for  our endless pleasure.
MERLIN	m	For you...
ARTHUR	m	Has no one seen Merlin?
KNIGHT	m	Did you see? The King was without  Excalibur...
MORGANA	f	I'll weep for you, brother, for a  King must not weep.
MORGANA	f	Do you know what Guenevere's maids  have whispered?
MORGANA	f	That when the King returned from  battle...
MORGANA	f	...Guenevere would unlace his armor  and massage the burns where metal  rubbed on flesh...
MORGANA	f	...She would prepare a bath for you,  mixing special ointment in the  water...
ARTHUR	m	Guenevere! You are--
"GUENEVERE"	?	--Don't speak. A thousand words, a  hundred thousand words, would only  be prologue to the truth that must  be. That you, King, and I, your Queen,  beget a son to bond our love and to  strengthen our weak kingdom with a  successor. Come, my lord...
MORGANA	f	The moon flows in my blood to meet  your seed. And already I bear him  who will be King.
MORGANA	f	I could easily kill you, brother.  But I want you to live to see our  son be King. In me, the blood of  Cornwall will have its revenge; in  me, the blood of Uther will show its  dark side.
MORGANA	f	Stand back, all of you. Through my  own body I have nurtured him with my  potions. I made him. I alone can  give him life.
ARTHUR	m	Who will ride the labyrinths of the  forest, to the very root of his soul,  to the very ends of the earth, to  find the secret that will redeem us  from the evil that has fallen upon  us, and make this chalice, and  ourselves, whole again?
SIR GAWAIN	m	I will ride forth in the name of  that quest, and commit my strength  and my soul to it.
PERCEVAL	m	I will go.
ARTHUR	m	Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me,  that we may never meet again, that  the fellowship will be no more...
PERCEVAL	m	We will find the secret or die.
ARTHUR	m	Kay, I know your heart yearns to go,  but I am prisoner to my duties, and  you must be to yours, at my side.
MORGANA	f	The blood of this knight will feed  the god in the earth, he is weak  with hunger, and he will be made  strong by this blood. Then he will  plant his seed, and the land will be  fertile once again.
GAWAIN	m	Arthur, forgive me. I die without  the secret. I have failed.
MORGANA	f	Look, Mordred, a true prize for the  giant. The lamb rides into our jaws.
MORGANA	f	You must kill him, for this knight  is dear to your father. You must do  it and learn to enjoy your father's  pain.
MORGANA	f	Have you found what you search for?  Have you found what Arthur seeks?
MORGANA	f	You haven't, or you would be smiling  now in the face of death. Your quest  is an impossible one.
PERCEVAL	m	That it might be impossible makes it  all the more necessary.
MORGANA	f	Fool! Uncover him. I'll show you the mystery  of life. It's death... Do it, Mordred!
MORGANA	f	Feel the life through the dagger,  child. It belongs to you.
MORDRED	m	I feel it, Mother. I will give his  blood to the giant.
MORGANA	f	You didn't kill him! You didn't kill  him!
MORGANA	f	My dear, sweet boy...
PERCEVAL	m	We'll become good friends.
LANCELOT	m	Where are you going, Lancelot, in  your iron tomb? Still trying to save  the world? The best... the bravest... the  greatest... fool that ever lived.  Now the world rots. Death is king of  the earth. And it is you who make it  so, Lancelot.
FIGURE	m	What is the secret of the chalice?  Who does it serve?
PERCEVAL	m	The chalice. The secret was in my  grasp. I let it slip, afraid for  myself. A question was asked. I didn't  understand. I didn't try. I failed...
KAY	?	Your son Mordred is at the gate.
ARTHUR	m	At last...
KAY	?	Don't recognize him. You were trapped  by Morgana's sorcery.
ARTHUR	m	...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and  Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all  the others--lost to me. Only the  echo of their voices remains in this  empty hall. All I have left is the  memory of their fellowship. Echoes  and memories. I am a ghost of the  King that once was... ...Mordred is real, alive, my own  flesh and blood. I will see him, I  must.
MORDRED	m	Father...
ARTHUR	m	Rise, Mordred.
MORDRED	m	I have come to claim what is mine,  Father.
ARTHUR	m	I recognize you only as my son, no  more.
MORDRED	m	And you are the great King? The lords  have rebelled. Invaders attack the  coasts. Crops don't grow. There is  nothing but plague and hunger in the  land. Only I am feared. I will be  king. You may have lost Excalibur,  but I have found my own weapon of  power. There.
MORDRED	m	The very spear that pierced the side  of Christ as he died on the cross.
ARTHUR	m	Your mother told you that?
ARTHUR	m	I cannot offer you the land, only my  love...
MORDRED	m	And I offer only this, Father. To  commit with passion and pleasure all  the evils that you failed to commit,  as man and king.
MORDRED	m	We will embrace only in battle.  Father, and I will touch you only  with the blade of my spear.
MORDRED	m	I will muster a great force of  knights, and I will return to fight  for what is mine.
ARTHUR	m	So be it.
PERCEVAL	m	Illusions. I will never find it  again... I am sorry, woman, that I  frightened you.
PERCEVAL	m	Good woman, do you have any food?  Some water?...
PEASANT	m	The little we had, we gave to  Mordred's knights. He has taken this  land. Tell the King that now we must  look to Mordred.
SECOND PEASANT	m	But we will give you some water...
PERCEVAL	m	I have lost my horse, my armor, my  sword. I have lost my way. I have  lost my strength. I have lost  everything... I will not lose hope.
FIGURE	m	Who does it serve?
PERCEVAL	m	You, my lord.
FIGURE	m	I have waited long for you. Once you  almost saw, but fear blinded you.  Why am I served from the chalice?
PERCEVAL	m	Because you and the land are one.
FIGURE	m	I am wasting away and I cannot die.  And I cannot live.
PERCEVAL	m	You and the land are one. Drink from  the chalice. You will be reborn and  the land with you.
FIGURE	m	But who am I?
PERCEVAL	m	You are my lord and King. You are  Arthur.
ARTHUR	m	I didn't know how empty was my soul  until it was filled.
KAY	?	Perceval, you have returned!
ARTHUR	m	Ready my knights for battle; they  will ride with their King once more.  I have lived through others far too  long! Lancelot carried my honor and  Guenevere my guilt. My knights have  fought my causes. Mordred carries my  sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
NUN	f	Go away. No man is allowed beyond  these doors.
ARTHUR	m	I am Arthur.
ARTHUR	m	Guenevere, accept my forgiveness,  and put your heart to rest. We have  suffered to long. I have always loved  you, and I still love you.
GUENEVERE	f	I loved you much, as King, and  sometimes as husband, but one cannot  gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
ARTHUR	m	Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I  was not born to live a man's life,  but to be the stuff of future memory.  The fellowship was a brief beginning,  a fair time that cannot be forgotten;  and because it will not be forgotten,  that fair time may come again. Now  once more I must ride with my knights  to defend what was, and the dream of  what could be.
GUENEVERE	f	I have kept it.
ARTHUR	m	I never dared to hope all these years  that it was in your keeping.
ARTHUR	m	I have often thought that in the  hereafter of our lives, when I owe  no more to the future and can be  just a man, that we may meet, and  you will come to me and claim me as  yours, and know that I am your  husband. It is a dream I have...
ARTHUR	m	Guenevere...
KNIGHT	m	It is only me and my son. All other  knights of the dukedom have rallied  to Mordred.
ARTHUR	m	What horror is that?
KNIGHT	m	Mordred, sir. He digs for precious  metals, with which he buys the loyalty  of men at arms, binding them to his  side.
ARTHUR	m	I am outnumbered ten to one by  Mordred's forces. Merlin, I need you  at my side as you were once, my  friend, to give me courage. There  are no war tricks that will fool  Mordred. He was weaned on blood.
ARTHUR	m	More than I ever did, I need you  now. Where are you, Merlin? Is it  true that Morgana has trapped you?
ARTHUR	m	...If only you could be at my side,  Merlin, to see me wield Excalibur  once more...
ARTHUR	m	What is this place? It is rumored  Merlin, that you drew your power  from these circles...
ARTHUR	m	Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they  must fight tomorrow for their very  lives.
MERLIN	m	I know. I have heard noises and echoes  through the stones...
ARTHUR	m	What is this place, Merlin?
MERLIN	m	It is like a tree. The roots of the  stones spread out across the land  and they draw on the thoughts and  actions of men. Like sap those human  matters course through the stones  feeding the stars that are the leaves  of the tree. And the stars whisper  back to men the future course of  events. But the earth is being torn apart,  its metals stolen, and the balance  is broken and the lines of power no  longer converge. In fact, I nearly  didn't make it in one piece.
MERLIN	m	But, I'm here.
ARTHUR	m	Where have you been these many years?  Is it true that Morgana--
MERLIN	m	--Stories... You brought me back.  Your love brought me back. Back to  where you are now, in the land of  dreams...
ARTHUR	m	Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
ARTHUR	m	Merlin?!
KAY	?	Merlin, will I live...? ...I was dreaming...
ARTHUR	m	Of Merlin?
KAY	?	Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would  fight bravely tomorrow. I have never  dreamed of Merlin before.
ARTHUR	m	I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives!  He lives in our dreams now, in that  dark and shadowy place that is as  strong and real as this more solid  one. He speaks to us from there.
MERLIN	m	I have returned, enchantress. You  are beautiful, magnificent. Have you  used up all the magic you stole from  me to keep yourself young? Have you  any magic left to do battle with  Merlin?
MORGANA	f	You provoke me, Merlin.
MERLIN	m	What's behind that beauty? A wizened,  cold-hearted snake.
MERLIN	m	You are a snake about to strike!
MERLIN	m	And I am the staff that drives the  snake back.
MORGANA	f	Burning with the fire of desire, I  am the flames that consume the staff  to ashes.
MERLIN	m	I am the cloudburst that quenches  the flames.
MORGANA	f	I am the desert, where water  disappears--
MERLIN	m	--I am the sea, which covers the  desert forever under its weight.
MORGANA	f	--I am the fog and mists that rise  up from the sea, escaping...
MERLIN	m	Fog and mist! You couldn't be that.  You don't have enough magic.
MORGANA	f	...I have the desire and I have the  magic...
MERLIN	m	You are mine at last. I am the sea  and you will never escape me. Fog  and Mist...!?
LIEUTENANT	m	A fog is rising, sir.
MORDRED	m	That cannot be.
MORDRED	m	My mother has a sense for such things.  She said there would be no fog.
MORDRED	m	...Mother?
ARTHUR	m	Kay, you will lead the attack.  Perceval, you will stay with me.
ARTHUR	m	Be cautious, my brother.
ARTHUR	m	In this battle there is one thing I  must do, that no one else can. Find  Mordred and kill him.
PERCEVAL	m	There are too many on Mordred's side.  We cannot hold out much longer.
KAY	?	He can be no other.
ARTHUR	m	Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
PERCEVAL	m	No, my lord. We seek Mordred.
KAY	?	I will join him.
ARTHUR	m	Has anyone seen Lancelot?
SQUIRE	m	He lies over there, sir.
ARTHUR	m	Squire! Here!
LANCELOT	m	Arthur.
ARTHUR	m	Lancelot, I will save you... Don't  die.
LANCELOT	m	My salvation is to die a Knight of  the Round Table.
ARTHUR	m	You are that and much more. You are  its greatest knight, you are what is  best in men. Now we will be together--
LANCELOT	m	--It is the old wound, that has been  opened. I have always known it would  be the gateway to my death, for it  has never healed. Let my heart do  its job, my King, and pump me empty...
LANCELOT	m	Guenevere, has she come to you, is  she Queen again?
ARTHUR	m	She is, Lancelot.
PERCEVAL	m	The fog is lifting. Only we remain  alive.
ARTHUR	m	But for Mordred. Where is Mordred?
MORDRED	m	Where is Arthur?
ARTHUR	m	No, Perceval. Now it is time for me  to raise my sword. Mordred, prepare to meet your death.
MORDRED	m	I wait for you, Father.
ARTHUR	m	Draw the spear from me. Do it.
ARTHUR	m	There is one thing left to do...  Excalibur... And you must do it,  Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command  you.
PERCEVAL	m	I cannot--
ARTHUR	m	--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of  calm water and throw the sword into  it.
ARTHUR	m	Obey me, Perceval. You must act for  me. It is my last order as your King.  Do it, and be back!
PERCEVAL	m	It is too precious a thing. I can't...
ARTHUR	m	When you threw it in, what did you  see?
PERCEVAL	m	...I saw nothing.
PERCEVAL	m	My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur  cannot be lost. Other men--
ARTHUR	m	--By itself it is only a piece of  steel. Its power comes from he who  wields it. For now there is no one.  Do as I have ordered!
PERCEVAL	m	Arthur!
PERCEVAL	m	Arthur! Will you return?
PERCEVAL	m	All the knights of the Round Table  are dead. Excalibur is returned.  Arthur is gone. Maybe he lives, maybe  he will return...
PERCEVAL	m	Only I remain, and this...
