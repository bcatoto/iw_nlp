FUNERAL DIRECTOR	m	Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a  very good friend of ours, and a very  fine attorney. 
GALVIN	m	It's a shame about your husband,  Mrs. Dee. 
GALVIN	m	I knew him vaguely through the Lodge.  He was a wonderful man. It was a crime what happened to him.  A crime. If there's anything that I  could do to help... 
GALVIN	m	Well...  
SON	m	What is that...? 
GALVIN	m	I... 
SON	m	What the hell is that... 
GALVIN	m	...I was a friend of your fa... 
SON	m	You never knew my father. You get out of here, who the hell do  you think you are... 
GALVIN	m	I'm talking to this man... 
FUNERAL MANAGER	m	Excuse me, Mrs. Cleary... 
SON	m	Who the hell do you think you are? 
FUNERAL MANAGER	m	I don't want you coming back here.  Ever. Do you understand? 
GALVIN	m	I was just talking to... 
FUNERAL MANAGER	m	Those are bereaved people in there. 
GALVIN	m	Pat says, 'Mike... there's a new  bar, you go in, for a half a buck  you get a beer, a free lunch, and  then take you in the back room and  they get you laid.' 
JIMMY	m	Another, Frank...? 
GALVIN	m	...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you  mean to tell me for a buck you get a  free lunch and a beer, and then you  go in the back and get laid?' 'That's  correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you  been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No,  but my sister has...' Everyone. Buy yourself one too. 
MICKEY	m	Get up. Get up. 
GALVIN	m	Hi, Mickey... 
MICKEY	m	What the hell do you think you're  doing...? What's going on here...? 
GALVIN	m	Uh... 
MICKEY	m	Fuck you. I got a call today from  Sally Doneghy... 
GALVIN	m	...now who is that...? 
MICKEY	m	...You're 'sposed to be in court in  ten days and she's telling me you  haven't even met with them... 
GALVIN	m	Sally Doneghy, now who is that? 
MICKEY	m	One lousy letter eighteen months  ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case  your way... 
GALVIN	m	...hey, I don't need your charity... 
MICKEY	m	...I get these people to trust you --  they're coming here tomorrow by the  way -- I get this expert doctor to  talk to you. I'm doing all your  fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen  months. You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file. 
GALVIN	m	Hey, what are you, my nanny? 
MICKEY	m	Listen to me. Listen to me... listen  to me, Frank, 'cause I'm done fuckin'  with you. I can't do it any more.  Look around you: You think that you're  going to change? What's going to  change it? You think it's going to  be different next month? It's going  to be the same. And I have to stop.  This is it. I got you a good case,  it's a moneymaker. You do it right  and it will take care of you. But  I'm through. I'm sorry, Frank, this  is the end. Life is too short, and I'm too old. 
GALVIN	m	I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank  Galvin... why didn't you go in? 
SALLY	f	It's locked. 
GALVIN	m	It's locked? 
GALVIN	m	I'm terribly sorry... I hope we didn't  put you out. Won't you come in...? I'd offer you some coffee, but it  looks like my girl just went out. 
GALVIN	m	It's not a good case. It's a very  good case. 
GALVIN	m	A healthy young woman goes into the  hospital to deliver her third child,  she's given the wrong anesthetic... 
SALLY	f	...we, we love her, Dick and me... 
GALVIN	m	...I'm sure you do... 
SALLY	f	But what can we do? She don't know  who's visiting her... 
GALVIN	m	...I know. I went... 
SALLY	f	...You saw her? 
GALVIN	m	Yes. Yes, I have. 
SALLY	f	You know how beautiful she was? Her husband left her, and he took  her kids... They, they, they'd let  you die in there. They don't care.  Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the  Chronic Care... in Arlington...?  They'd take her in. Perpetual care.  They'd take her. Fifty thousand  dollars they want. An endowment. 
GALVIN	m	...fifty thousand dollars? 
SALLY	f	I don't want to leave her. Dick...  the, the... and Father Laughlin, he  said that it was God's will... 
GALVIN	m	...I understand... 
SALLY	f	My doctor told me that I got to move  out West... that's when we filed in  court. We didn't want to sue... 
GALVIN	m	...I understand... 
SALLY	f	...But Dick, he's looking for two  years in Tucson... and they called  him up and said to come out. He's a  good man. He's only trying to do  what's right. 
SALLY	f	This is my husband. 
GALVIN	m	Please sit down. I told your wife.  I'm sorry that we have to meet out  here. I've got a case coming in two  days in the Superior Court and my  office is a mess of papers. 
DONEGHY	?	...that's all right. 
GALVIN	m	I was telling your wife, we have a  very good case here. 
SALLY	f	He saw her at the Northern Care... 
GALVIN	m	...and I have inquiries out to  doctors, experts in the field...  there is, of course, a problem getting  a doctor to testify that another  doctor's negligent... 
DONEGHY	?	...the Archdiocese called up, they  said who was our attorney, 'cause  the case is coming to trial... 
GALVIN	m	I doubt we'll have to go to trial... 
DONEGHY	?	...we told them we didn't want it to  come out this way. 
GALVIN	m	I completely understand... 
DONEGHY	?	We just... 
SALLY	f	We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away. 
GALVIN	m	I'm going to see you get that chance. 
DONEGHY	?	What is this going to cost? 
GALVIN	m	It's completely done on a contingency  basis. That means whatever the  settlement is I retain one-third...  that is, of course, the usual  arrangement... 
ALITO 	m	His name is Frank Galvin. B.U. Law,  class of 'fifty-two. Second in his  class. Editor of the Law Review.  Worked with Mickey Morrissey twelve  years. Criminal Law and Personal  Injury...' 
ALITO	m	'Married Patricia Harrington, nineteen  sixty...' 
ALITO	m	'Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce  nineteen sixty as a full partner.  Resigned the firm nineteen sixt-ynine  over the Lillibridge case...' Do  you...? 
BISHOP	m	He was accused of jury tampering. 
ALITO	m	Accused. Not indicted. He resigned  the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey  until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his  own. Four cases before the Circuit  Court. He lost them all. He drinks. 
BISHOP	m	Four cases in three years... 
ALITO	m	The man's an ambulance chaser... 
BISHOP	m	...tell me about this case. 
ALITO	m	This is a nuisance suit. He's looking  for small change. He's asking for  six hundred thousand and betting we  don't want to go to court. 
BISHOP	m	No -- we don't want this case in  court. 
ALITO	m	Neither does he. That's where he  loses. This man's scared to death to  go to court. We only have to call  his bluff. 
BISHOP	m	I want to settle this thing and be  done with it. I don't want the  Archdiocese exposed. 
ALITO	m	No. Absolutely, and we're going to  see that it is not. 
BISHOP	m	So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer. I  want to do it myself. I want it to  come from me. 
ALITO	m	All right. But let's keep the price  down. I've called Ed Concannon. He  recommends that we continue to respond  as if we're going to trial. 
BISHOP	m	If we were to go to trial, would we  win the case? 
ALITO	m	Well, of course, it's always  dangerous... 
BISHOP	m	I know that answer. If we went to  trial would we win? 
ALITO	m	Yes. 
CLAIRE	f	Thank you very much. 
GALVIN	m	What are you doing here? 
CLAIRE	f	Mickey told me to come back to work. 
CLAIRE	f	...here's your mail, call Mrs.  Doneghy... 
GALVIN	m	...yes. Get her on the phone... 
CLAIRE	f	...that was a Dr. David Gruber's  office... 
GALVIN	m	Gruber... 
CLAIRE	f	Mickey told him to call. 'He's some very hotshot surgeon at  Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet  with you at seven tonight re testimony  in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You  meet him at the hospital.' 
GALVIN	m	...he wants to testify...? 
CLAIRE	f	It looks that way. 
GALVIN	m	You know what that would mean? 
GALVIN	m	To get somebody from a Boston hospital  to say he'll testify? 
CLAIRE	f	...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told  you that. 
GALVIN	m	This is going to drive the ante up. 
CLAIRE	f	Frank Galvin's... who's calling  please? Bishop Brophy's office... 
CLAIRE	f	I'm sorry, he's not in... may I take  a mess... tomorrow when, two  o'clock... I'll check my book... 
CLAIRE	f	Yes. Mr. Galvin's clear at that  time... the Bishop's office, tomorrow,  the fifth at two p.m. Thank you... 
GALVIN	m	That's the call that I'm waiting  for. 
CLAIRE	f	What does it mean? 
GALVIN	m	They want to settle. It means a lot of money. 
CLAIRE	f	Does that mean I'm back for awhile? 
GALVIN	m	Dr. Gruber...? 
GALVIN	m	Dr. Gruber... 
GRUBER	m	Yes? Galvin, right? 
GALVIN	m	I appreciate -- a man as busy as -- 
GRUBER	m	That's perfectly all right. I'm kind  of rushed. Do you mind if we walk  while we talk? 
GRUBER	m	I read the hospital report on your  client. 
GALVIN	m	...Deborah Ann Kaye... 
GRUBER	m	...Deborah Ann Kaye... 
GALVIN	m	They called, they're going to settle,  what I want to do is build up as  much... 
GRUBER	m	Right. Who called? 
GALVIN	m	The Archdiocese called, they want to  settle... her estate... 
GRUBER	m	...and you're going to do that? 
GALVIN	m	Yes. 
GRUBER	m	You're going to settle out of court? 
GALVIN	m	Yes. 
GRUBER	m	Why? 
GALVIN	m	Uh... in the, well, in the interests  of her family... you, Dr. Gruber,  you know, you can never tell what a  jury is going to do. St. Catherine's  a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors... 
GRUBER	m	Her doctors killed her. 
GALVIN	m	I'm sorry...? 
GRUBER	m	Her doctors murdered her. They gave  her the wrong anesthetic and they  put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her. 
GALVIN	m	Do you know who her doctors were? 
GRUBER	m	I read the file. Yeah. Marx and  Towler. I know who they were. 
GALVIN	m	The most respected... 
GRUBER	m	Whose side are you arguing...? I  thought that you wanted to do  something. I don't have any interest  in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense,  but we all know where the money's  going to... I have an interest in  the Hospital; and I don't want those  bozos working in the same shop as  me. They gave her the wrong  anesthetic. They turned the girl  into a vegetable. They killed her  and they killed her kid. You caught  'em. Now: how many others did they  kill? 
GRUBER	m	You want a cigar? 
GALVIN	m	The hospital is owned by the  Archdioceses of... 
GRUBER	m	What are they going to do? Not invite  me to their Birthday party...? Look, I gotta go. I have to be in  Cambridge... 
GALVIN	m	Well, well, when can we meet again. 
GRUBER	m	Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday  night... I gotta go. You going my  way? 
GALVIN	m	We have to... we... we have to keep  you under wraps. Please don't, don't  discuss... 
GRUBER	m	I understand. 
GALVIN	m	...the case with anyone. And I'll  meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over  your testimony... 
GRUBER	m	Right. Seven o'clock. Here. 
GALVIN	m	Thank you... 
GRUBER	m	...that's perfectly all right. 
GALVIN	m	Uh, why, why are you doing this? 
GRUBER	m	To do right. Isn't that why you're  doing it? 
GALVIN	m	I want to buy you a drink. 
JIMMY 	m	Thanks, Franky. 
GALVIN	m	Would you like a drink? 
WOMAN	f	I'd like an apartment. 
GALVIN	m	Settle for a drink? 
WOMAN	f	No. Thank you. 
GALVIN	m	I had a very good day today. 
WOMAN	f	I'm glad you did. Thank you. Good  night. 
GALVIN	m	You're very welcome. 
GALVIN	m	Well, well, well. Huh? 
JIMMY	m	Yeah. 
GALVIN	m	It's a long road that has no turning. 
JIMMY	m	That's for sure, Frank. 
GALVIN	m	I'm going to the Archdiocese tomorrow  at two. I know you don't. I know you  don't... no, you're just following  your life. You have a life too...  you have to move out West. It doesn't  help you to stay here. Well... I'm  sure she knows you care for her. 
GALVIN	m	Well. Well. Well. Finally we're none  of us protected... we... we just  have to go on. To seek help where we  can... and go on... I know that you  love her... I know you're acting out  of love. 
GALVIN	m	As soon as I know... you give him my  respects too. Not at all. Not at  all... Good night. Well, bless you, too. Good night. 
IRISH NURSE #1 	f	Jimmy, I said, don't you go in your  pocket if there's nothing there... 
IRISH NURSE #2 	f	...and what did he say...? 
IRISH NURSE #1 	f	...Sir, you aren't allowed to be in  here... 
NURSE	f	You can't be in here. 
GALVIN	m	I'm her attorney. 
BISHOP	m	It's a question of continuing values.  St. Catherine's -- to do the good  that she must do in the community  has to maintain the position that  she holds in the community. So we  have a question of balance. On the  one hand, the reputation, and, so,  the effectiveness of our hospital,  and two of her important doctors --  and, on the other hand, the rights  of your client. 
BISHOP	m	A young woman. In her prime...  deprived of... ...life... sight... her family...  It's tragic. It's a tragic accident. 
BISHOP	m	...nothing, of course, can begin to  make it right. But we must do what  we can. We must do all that we can. 
BISHOP	m	Yes. We must try to make it right. 
BISHOP	m	It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...  but we try to compensate... to make  a gesture... 
GALVIN	m	How did you settle on the amount? 
BISHOP	m	We thought it was just. 
GALVIN	m	You thought it was just. 
BISHOP	m	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	Because it struck me how neatly  'three' went into the amount. Two  Hundred Ten Thousand. That would  mean I keep seventy. 
BISHOP	m	That was our insurance company's  recommendation. 
GALVIN	m	Yes. It would be. 
BISHOP	m	Nothing that we can do can make that  woman well. 
GALVIN	m	And no one will know the truth. 
BISHOP	m	What is the truth? 
GALVIN	m	That that poor girl put her trust in  the hands of two men who took her  life, she's in a coma, her life is  gone. She has no family, she has no  home, she's tied to a machine, she  has no friends -- and the people who  should care for her: her Doctors,  and you, and me, have been bought  off to look the other way. We have  been paid to look the other way. I  came in here to take your money. I brought snapshots to show you. So  I could get your money. I can't take it. If I take it. If I  take that money I'm lost. I'm just  going to be a rich ambulance chaser. I can't do it. I can't take it. 
YOUNG PRIEST	m	If we may discuss money, Mr. Galvin.  How is your law practice? 
GALVIN	m	It's not too good. I've only got one  client. 
GALVIN	m	I have to talk to you. 
MICKEY	m	What do you want? 
GALVIN	m	Come on. Let's get a drink. 
MICKEY	m	Don't touch anything. 
MICKEY	m	Are you out of your mind...? 
GALVIN	m	...I'm going to need your help... 
MICKEY	m	You need my help...? You need a  goddamn keeper... are you telling me  that you turned down two-hundred-ten  grand? Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you  nuts. What are you going to do, bring  her back to life? 
GALVIN	m	I'm going to help her. 
MICKEY	m	To do what...? To do what, for  chrissake...? To help her to do what?  She's dead... 
GALVIN	m	They killed her. And they're trying  to buy it... 
MICKEY	m	That's the point, you stupid fuck.  Let them buy it. We let them buy the  case. That's what I took it for. You  let this drop -- we'll go up to New  Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer... 
GALVIN	m	Mick. Mick. Mick... 
MICKEY	m	What? 
GALVIN	m	You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if  not now, when...' 
MICKEY	m	I know what I said but not now. You  won it. Franky. You won it. When  they give you the money, that means  that you won. We don't want to go to  court -- is this getting to you...? 
GALVIN	m	...he's a good man... 
MICKEY	m	...he's a good man...? He's the Prince  of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have  people in there testifying that the  broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday  on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't  fuck with this case. 
GALVIN	m	...I have to stand up for her... 
MICKEY	m	Frank, but not now. Frank. You're  trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now. I understand. But you  go call 'em back. You call the Bishop  back. 
GALVIN	m	I have to try this case. I have to  do it, Mick. I've got to stand up  for that girl. I need your help. Mick, will you help me...? Will you help me...? 
CONCANNON	?	Anybody ever hear, 'For want of a  shoe a horse was lost?' Who's going  on vacation tomorrow? 
CONCANNON	?	Friedman. St. Barts. is that right? 
FRIEDMAN	m	Yessir. 
CONCANNON	?	Send Mrs. Friedman a dozen roses  tomorrow morning please, Sal. I tell  you what, send her a sunlamp. I'm sorry, but you'll have to stay.  No vacations till this thing is  cleared. 
CONCANNON	?	Our court date is January twelfth.  You're all acquainted with this case.  It's been scheduled for eighteen  months. We have the attorney for the  Plaintiff, Frank Galvin -- and I  trust you are all familiar with his  record -- and we have been expecting  him to call us to negotiate. As he  did not, and five days before we're  supposed to go to court we made him  a rather generous offer, which he  refused. Five days before the trial.  What does this mean? I want to find  out. Acquaint yourselves again with the  depositions. Don't rely on the fact  that we did it last year. Do it again.  We're going to review them here, and  you do it at home. You each have a  full file. Know the deps, and I want  you all to be here when we work with  the defendants... when is that,  Billy...? 
YOUNG LAWYER 	m	Tuesday evening, Sir. 
CONCANNON	?	I want an article in the Globe As  Soon As Possible, 'St. Cat's...  Neighborhood Giant serving the  community' etc. We've got it in the  files. I want something in Monday's  Herald: 'Our Gallant Doctors,'  something... Be inventive, I want  television... ...talk to our man at GBH. And to  belabor the obvious for a moment... Our clients are: the Archdiocese of  Boston; St. Catherine Laboure  Hospital, and Drs. Marx and Towler,  two of the most respected men in  their profession. The thrust of this  defense will be to answer in court,  in the press and in the public mind --  to answer the accusation of negligence  this completely: not only that we  win the case, but that we win the  case so that it's seen that the attack  on these men and this institution  was a rank obscenity. All right. Let's get the cobwebs  off. Billy...? 
YOUNG LAWYER	m	Please turn to your Page Four. 
YOUNG LAWYER	m	We're going to start with a review  of the depositions of the Operating  Room Team: the nurse-anesthetist,  the scrub-nurse, the... 
MICKEY	m	Who have we got? 
GALVIN	m	We've got her sister. Testifies she  had a meal one hour before she was  admitted to the hospital. This is  the point. 
MICKEY	m	You got the admittance form says  patient ate nine hours prior to  admittance. 
GALVIN	m	Admittance form is wrong. 
MICKEY	m	Forget it. You can't prove it.  Sister's testimony is no good. Jury  knows we win she gets the cash. 
GALVIN	m	I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her  heart condition means they gave her  the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus  she came in complaining of stomach  pains... 
MICKEY	m	...Gruber's not bad. 
GALVIN	m	Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare,  the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right? Their  guy, Towler's, the author of the  book, 'Methodology and Practice,  Anesthesiology.' ...and they got depositions from the  nurses, everybody in the operating  room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these  guys are God. I saw them walk on  water...' They had an obstetrical nurse in  there. We got a deposition from the  obstetrical nurse? 
MICKEY	m	No. 
GALVIN	m	'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in  Arlington, still working at the  hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up. 
MICKEY	m	Right. 
GALVIN	m	Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State  of Michigan. 
MICKEY	m	Right. 
GALVIN	m	Brindisi versus Electric Boat. 
MICKEY	m	You got a good memory, Franky. 
GALVIN	m	I had a good teacher. McLean versus  Urban Transport... 
GALVIN	m	Jimmy? Bushmills. Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you  a drink tomorrow. 
MICKEY	m	Yeah? And what are you going to do  tonight? 
GALVIN	m	I'm going to get laid. 
MICKEY	m	Don't leave your best work in the  sheets. 
GALVIN	m	D'you find an apartment? 
LAURA	f	Still looking. 
GALVIN	m	I changed my life today. What did  you do? 
LAURA	f	I changed my room at the Hotel. 
GALVIN	m	Why? 
LAURA	f	The TV didn't work. 
GALVIN	m	What Hotel are you staying at? 
LAURA	f	And what are you? A cop? 
GALVIN	m	I'm a lawyer. 
LAURA	f	My ex-husband was a lawyer. 
GALVIN	m	Really. How wonderful for you. 
LAURA	f	Yes. It was, actually. 
GALVIN	m	Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you  call it off? 
LAURA	f	Who says I'm the one that called it  off? 
GALVIN	m	A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you  a hundred dollars against you join  me for dinner. And I'll take your  word for it. Now you tell me the  truth. Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name? 
LAURA	f	Laura. 
GALVIN	m	My name's Frank. And furthermore,  you came back to see me tonight. 
LAURA	f	What if it wasn't you that I came  back to see? 
GALVIN	m	You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on. 
GALVIN	m	Jesus, you are one beautiful woman. 
GALVIN	m	The weak, the weak have got to have  somebody to fight for them. Isn't  that the truth? You want another  drink? 
LAURA	f	I think I will. 
GALVIN	m	Jimmy! That's why the court exists. The  court doesn't exist to give them  justice, eh? But to give them a chance  at justice. 
LAURA	f	And are they going to get it? 
GALVIN	m	They might. Yes. That's the point...  is that they might... you see, the  jury wants to believe. They're all  cynics, sure, because they want to  believe. I have to go in there  tomorrow to find twelve people to  hear this case. I'm going to see a  hundred people and pick twelve. And  every one of them it's written on  their face, 'This is a sham. There  is no justice...' but in their heart  they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...' 
LAURA	f	Maybe what? 
GALVIN	m	Maybe I can do something right. 
LAURA	f	And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...? 
GALVIN	m	That's what I'm going to try to do. 
LAURA	f	That's all right. 
JUDGE 	m	You're late, Mr. Galvin. 
GALVIN	m	Yessir. I'm sorry. 
JUDGE	m	Why is that? 
GALVIN	m	I was held up. 
CONCANNON	?	Ed Concannon. 
GALVIN	m	Frank Galvin. We've met before. 
JUDGE	m	Let's do some business. 
JUDGE 	m	They tell me that no bargain ever  was completed other than quickly  when both parties really cared to  make a deal. 
JUDGE	m	Now, have you boys tried to resolve  your little difficulty because that  certainly would save the Commonwealth  a lot of time and bother. 
GALVIN	m	This is a complicated case, your  Honor... 
JUDGE	m	I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me  tell you something. If we find it so  complex, how in the hell you think  you're going to make a jury understand  it? See my point? Let's talk a minute.  Frank: what will you and your client  take right now this very minute to  walk out of here and let this damn  thing drop? 
GALVIN	m	My client can't walk, your Honor. 
JUDGE	m	I know full well she can't, Frank.  You see the Padre on your way out  and he'll punch your ticket. You  follow me? I'm trying to help you. 
CONCANNON	?	Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the  Archdiocese have offered plaintiff  two hundred and ten thousand dollars. 
JUDGE	m	Huh! 
CONCANNON	?	My doctors didn't want a settlement  at any price. They wanted this cleared  up in court. They want their  vindication. I agree with them. But  for today the offer stands. Before  we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only. When I walk out that door the offer  is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way. 
GALVIN	m	We are going to try the case. 
JUDGE	m	That's it...? Come on, guys... life is too short... You tell me if you're playing  'chicken,' or you mean it. Frank: I don't think I'm talking out  of school, but I just heard someone  offer you two hundred grand... and  that's a lot of money... and if I  may say, you haven't got the best of  records. 
GALVIN	m	...things change. 
JUDGE	m	...that's true. Sometimes they change,  sometimes they don't. Now, I remember  back to when you were disbarred... 
GALVIN	m	I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the  pro... 
JUDGE	m	And it seems to me, a fella's trying  to come back, he'd take this  settlement, and get a record for  himself. I myself would take it and run like  a thief. 
GALVIN	m	I'm sure you would. 
JUDGE	m	Hm. We have the date set? Next Thursday.  Good. See you boys in court. 
GALVIN	m	Mr. Abraham... 
ABRAMS	m	Abrams... 
GALVIN	m	Abrams. Yes. How are you today? 
ABRAMS	m	I'm fine. 
GALVIN	m	Good. You ever been inside a hospital? 
ABRAMS	m	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	Ah. How did they treat you? 
ABRAMS	m	I don't know what you mean. 
MICKEY	m	Been a long time, huh...? 
GALVIN	m	I'm getting it back. Don't worry  about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find  the obstetric nurse? 
MICKEY	m	Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I  tried her at the hospital. I'm going  to try her back at home. Read this. 
GALVIN	m	So what? 
MICKEY	m	So what...? The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr.  Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday:  'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.' 
GALVIN	m	They still have to take it to a jury. 
MICKEY	m	What I'm saying, they're getting  some help. 
GALVIN	m	So what do you want me to do?  Concannon's going to try the case  his way, I'm going to try it mine.  You want me to go wee wee wee all  the time because he's got some flack,  got stories in the newspaper. I'm  going to win this case. 
MICKEY	m	John: gimme a cuesta-ray. 
GALVIN	m	Oh shit, what's today? 
MICKEY	m	Today is Tuesday. What? 
GALVIN	m	I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have? 
MICKEY	m	Give 'em a box of Macanudos. 
GALVIN	m	Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody  at O'Rourke's, I can't make it. 
JOHN	m	Here you are, Franky. 
GALVIN	m	Thanks. Can you go over and meet  her...? Tell her I'll stop by when  I'm through... Laura Fischer... 
MICKEY	m	Sure. Who is she? 
JOHN	m	That's thirty-three bucks. Can you  believe that...? 
MICKEY	m	Oh, yeah. Your broad from last night. 
JOHN	m	Thanks, Franky. 
GALVIN	m	Tell her that I'll meet her there,  okay? See you tomorrow in the office. 
GALVIN	m	We're doing fine. 
DONEGHY	?	You said you're gonna call me up.  You didn't call me up. Who do you  think you are? Who do you think you are...? 
GALVIN	m	Hold on a second. 
DONEGHY	?	I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm  going to have your ticket. You know  what you did? Do you know what you  did? 
GALVIN	m	It's all right, Mickey. 
DONEGHY	?	You ruined my life, Mister... Me and  my wife... and I am going to ruin  yours... You don't have to go out there to  see that girl. We been going four  years. Four years... my wife's been crying  herself to sleep what they, what,  what they did to her sister. 
GALVIN	m	I swear to you I wouldn't have turned  the offer down unless I thought that  I could win the case... 
DONEGHY	?	What you thought!? What you thought...  I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get  my wife out of town, we hired you,  we're paying you, I got to find out  from the other side they offered two  hundred... 
GALVIN	m	I'm going to win this case... Mist...  Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury  with a solid case, a famous doctor  as an expert witness, and I'm going  to win eight hundred thousand dollars. 
DONEGHY	?	You guys, you guys, you're all the  same. The Doctors at the hospital,  you... it's 'What I'm going to do  for you'; but you screw up it's 'We  did the best that we could. I'm  dreadfully sorry...' And people like  me live with your mistakes the rest  of our lives. 
GALVIN	m	If I could accept the offer right  now, I would. They took it back. 
DONEGHY	?	I understand. I went to the Bar Association. They  tell me you're going to be disbarred. 
MICKEY	m	Franky can't make it. He had an  appointment he forgot, he's going to  see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey,  we're supposed to get to know each  other. 
LAURA	f	How'm I doing so far? 
MICKEY	m	So far you're great. You got a  cigarette? 
LAURA	f	What are you drinking? Jimmy...? 
GALVIN	m	Dr. Gruber. 
NURSE	f	Dr. Gruber's not here today, Sir. 
GALVIN	m	No... No... 
NURSE	f	Yes, Sir. He hasn't been in all day...  He's not on the chart... 
MAID	m	What is it? 
GALVIN	m	Dr. Gruber. 
MAID	m	Dr. Gruber's not in. 
GALVIN	m	I had an appointment at his office,  I think I must have got it wrong. We  had a meeting... 
MAID	m	He's not in, Sir. 
GALVIN	m	Where is he? 
GALVIN	m	I... please. My wife... my wife's  prescription has run out. If I can  call him... 
MAID	m	Dr. Halpern's taking all his... 
GALVIN	m	No, no, no. I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him... 
MAID	m	He's... you can't reach him, Sir.  He's in the, on some island in the  Caribbean, they don't have a phone. He'll be back in a week... If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number... 
MICKEY	m	Stearns, Harrington, you know who  that is? 
LAURA	f	Should I? 
MICKEY	m	A huge law firm. Okay? They put him  in the firm, he's married,  everything's superb. Franky, he's  starting to talk like he comes from  Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place,  'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...? 
LAURA	f	Yes. 
MICKEY	m	...and he's making a billion dollars  every minute working for Stearns,  Harrington, and he bought a dog, and  everything is rosy. Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a  case. 
LAURA	f	The Big Boy did...? 
MICKEY	m	That Frank was working on. Yeah. He  thought Franky needed some help, so  they bribed a juror. So Franky finds  out. He comes to me in tears. He  thinks that anybody who knows what a  'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I  told him 'Franky, wake up. These  people are sharks. What do you think  they got so rich from? Doing good?'  He can't be comforted. He tells the  boys at Stearns and Harrington they've  disappointed him, he's going to the  Judge to rat them out. 
LAURA	f	Huh. 
MICKEY	m	Before he can get there here comes  this Federal Marshal, and Franky's  indicted for Jury tampering, they  throw him in jail, he's gonna be  disbarred, his life is over. Jimmy, gimme another drink. How are you? 
LAURA	f	Me, too. 
MICKEY	m	Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He,  finally, he gets to see the light,  he calls up Harrington, he says he  thinks he made a mistake. As if by  magic, charges against him are  dropped, he's released from jail. P.S. He's fired from the firm, his  wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half  years. You like that story? 
JUDGE 	m	Yes? 
JUDGE	m	What is it? 
GALVIN	m	Thank you for seeing me. 
JUDGE	m	That's perfectly all right. 
GALVIN	m	I need an extension for my case. 
JUDGE	m	You should have taken their offer.  Especially if you were unprepared. 
GALVIN	m	I had a witness disappear on me. 
JUDGE	m	That happens. 
GALVIN	m	I could subpoena him if I had a week. 
JUDGE	m	I don't have a week. This case never  should have come to trial. You know  better. You're Mr. Independent. You  want to be independent? Be independent  now. I've got no sympathy for you. 
VOICE	m	Continental Casualty... 
GALVIN	m	Mr. Alito, please. 
VOICE	m	Business hours are over, Sir. This  is the switch... 
GALVIN	m	I have to reach him. This is an  emergency. Could you give me his  home number? 
VOICE	m	I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed... 
GALVIN	m	...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask  him... 
VOICE	m	I can't guarantee that... 
GALVIN	m	I understand. Thank you, my name is  Galvin. I'll be at the following  number in a half an hour. It's urgent. 
GALVIN	m	Hello. Yes. Thank you for calling.  Frank Galvin... I'm representing  Deborah Ann Kaye...? I'd like to  discuss your firm's offer of the two  hundred th... In the sense that I  feel that we'd like to accept it. Well, it's rather a shock to me,  too; but it's my client's wishes...  She's changed her mind as of this  evening... I must say that I tried  to dissuade her... 
GALVIN	m	...Well, she, on the eve of the  case... You understand... I think  quite frankly she's come down with  nerves and she'd like... 
GALVIN	m	When was that arrived at...? I, I know what Mr. Concannon said,  but... I... Well, I think you're  making a mistake... I think that you  should reconsider; why don't you  check with your principals, and I'll  call you in the... No?... you... uh. All right. No.  That's fine. I understand. Sorry to  bother you at home. 
MICKEY	m	What happened...? 
MICKEY	m	What happened, Joey...? 
GALVIN	m	I can't talk now. 
MICKEY	m	D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...? 
GALVIN	m	Concannon got to my witness. I can't breathe in here... Hello Doctor...? Dr. Thompson. This is Joseph Galvin,  attorney for a Deborah Ann Kaye, we  had some correspondence some time  ago...? That's right. I'm sorry that  we never got back, the case was  postponed, and I've had a changeover  in staff... I'm sorry to call you so  late... 
GALVIN 	m	...but we have had a change of  strategy, and we were wondering, I  know this is short notice, but... 
LAURA	f	Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time -- ? 
GALVIN	m	What...? 
LAURA	f	Is this a bad time. 
GALVIN	m	We, we... No... we just had a small  reversal in the case... I have some, uh... I have some work  to do... 
LAURA	f	What happened...? 
GALVIN	m	They, uh, they got to my witness. 
LAURA	f	...and is that serious? 
GALVIN	m	I've got to work... 
LAURA	f	Do you want me to go...? 
GALVIN	m	No, no, I'm just... 
LAURA	f	Why don't you get some rest? 
GALVIN	m	I've got to work. 
LAURA	f	You can't work if you can't think.  You get in bed. It's all right. I'll  stay here with you. It's all right.  Come on... 
GALVIN	m	You're going to stay here...? 
LAURA	f	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	I'm only going to rest a little while. 
CONCANNON 	?	What is your name, please? 
TOWLER	?	Dr. Robert Towler. 
CONCANNON 	?	You were Deborah Ann Kaye's doctor...? 
DR. TOWLER	?	No, actually, she was referred to  me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient... 
CONCANNON	?	Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just  tell the truth. 
CONCANNON	?	Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear  that. You were her doctor. 
DR. TOWLER	?	Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	Say it. 
DR. TOWLER	?	I was her doctor. 
CONCANNON	?	You were the anesthesiologist at her  delivery May twelfth, nineteen  seventy... 
DR. TOWLER	?	...I was one of a group of... 
CONCANNON	?	Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep  those answers to three words. You  weren't 'part of a group,' you were  her anesthesiologist. Isn't that  right? 
DR. TOWLER	?	Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	You were there to help Dr. Marx  deliver her baby. Were you not? 
DR. TOWLER	?	Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	Anything special about the case? 
DR. TOWLER	?	When she... 
CONCANNON	?	When 'Debby'... Thank you. 
DR. TOWLER	?	Thank you. When Debby... 
CONCANNON	?	Dr. Towler, who was in the operating  room with you? 
DR. TOWLER	?	Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.  Marx, of course... 
DR. TOWLER	?	Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse... 
CONCANNON	?	What did these people do when her  heart stopped? 
DR. TOWLER	?	We went to Code Blue... 
CONCANNON	?	'Code Blue,' what does that mean...? 
DR. TOWLER	?	It's a common medical expression,  it's a crash program to restore the  heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in  her trachea, to get her oxygen, her  and the baby... Ms. Nevins... 
CONCANNON	?	Why wasn't she getting oxygen...? 
DR. TOWLER	?	Well, many reasons, actually... 
CONCANNON	?	Tell me one? 
DR. TOWLER	?	She'd aspirated vomitus into her  mask... 
CONCANNON	?	She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut  the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP  
DR. TOWLER	?	She threw up in her mask. 
CONCANNON	?	...and her heart stopped and she  wasn't getting oxygen. 
DR. TOWLER	?	That's right. 
CONCANNON	?	And what did your team do... 
DR. TOWLER	?	Well, we... 
CONCANNON	?	...You brought thirty years of medical  experience to bear. Isn't that what  you did? 
DR. TOWLER	?	Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	...A patient riddled with  complications, questionable  information on her, on her admitting  form... 
DR. TOWLER	?	...We did everything we could... 
CONCANNON	?	...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that... 
DR. TOWLER	?	Yes! 
CONCANNON	?	You reached down into death. Now,  isn't that right? 
DR. TOWLER	?	My God, we tried to save her... You  can't know... You can't know... 
CONCANNON	?	Tell us. 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Mr. Galvin? 
GALVIN	m	Dr. Thompson...? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	It was good of you to meet... 
GALVIN	m	Thank you for coming. 
GALVIN	m	I have some errands to run, and then  I thought we'd spend the evening... 
DR. THOMPSON	m	That's what I'd planned to... 
GALVIN	m	I'm going to take you to the home to  see the girl... 
DR. THOMPSON	m	From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you  have a very good case... 
GALVIN	m	Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll  be comfortable. I'm putting you up  at my... 
DR. THOMPSON	m	...I made a reservation at... 
GALVIN	m	...apartment. No, no. Please. You don't know who  we're dealing with, I, please believe  me, they... 
DR. THOMPSON	m	...What difference would... 
GALVIN	m	These people play very rough. They  don't want to lose this case. There's  a lot of pressure they can bring to  bear, I... 
DR. THOMPSON	m	There's nothing they can do to me. 
GALVIN	m	Please, Sir. Please. Humor me. 
GALVIN	m	We'll spend the evening together,  I'll put you up, you'll be very  comfortable. Please. That's my address. The key is in it. 1225 Commonwealth. Treat the place as your own. Please  don't tell anyone you're here, I'll  see you this evening. Thank you, and  thank you for coming. 
VOICE	m	Mr. Galvin's... 
GALVIN	m	Let me talk to Mickey. 
MICKEY	m	Yeah? How's our new witness? 
GALVIN	m	D'you find the obstetric nurse? 
MICKEY	m	She's workin' the late shift at the  Hospital. She's at home now, I'm  going over there to talk to... 
GALVIN	m	Gimme the address. I'm gonna go.  We're going to need her. 
GALVIN	m	I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing  Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St.  Catherine Laboure. 
MARY ROONEY	f	I told the guy I didn't want to talk  to... 
GALVIN	m	I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann  Kaye. You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief  witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you  know who he is? 
MARY ROONEY	f	No. 
GALVIN	m	He's the Assistant Chief of  Anesthesiology, Massachusetts  Commonwealth. He says your doctors,  Towler and Marx, put my girl in the  hospital for life. And we can prove  that. What we don't know is why.  What went on in there? In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong. And you know  what it was. They gave her the wrong  anesthetic. What happened? The phone  rang... someone got distracted...  what? 
MARY ROONEY	f	...you got your doctor's testimony.  Why do you need me? 
GALVIN	m	I want someone who was in the O.R.  We're going to win the case, there's  no question of that. It's just a  matter of how big... 
MARY ROONEY	f	I've got nothing to say to you. 
GALVIN	m	You know what happened. 
MARY ROONEY	f	Nothing happened. 
GALVIN	m	Then why aren't you testifying for  their side? 
GALVIN	m	I can subpoena you, you know. I can  get you up there on the stand. 
MARY ROONEY	f	And ask me what? 
GALVIN	m	Who put my client in the hospital  for life. 
MARY ROONEY	f	I didn't do it, Mister. 
GALVIN	m	Who are you protecting, then? 
MARY ROONEY	f	Who says that I'm protecting anyone? 
GALVIN	m	I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What  do you owe them? 
MARY ROONEY	f	I don't owe them a goddamn thing. 
GALVIN	m	Then why don't you testify? 
MARY ROONEY	f	You know, you're pushy, fella... 
GALVIN	m	You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I  get you on the stand... 
MARY ROONEY	f	Well, maybe you better do that, then. You know you guys are all the same.  You don't care who gets hurt. You're  a bunch of whores. You'd do anything  for a dollar. You got no loyalty...  no nothing... you're a bunch of  whores. 
YOUNG ATTORNEY	m	His name is Dr. Lionel Thompson.  City College of New York, Class of  twenty-six. Bachelor of Science; New  York College of Medicine; sixteenth  in a class of twenty-two. Nineteen  seventy-six got a courtesy  appointment, staff of anesthesiology,  Easthampton Hospital for Women. Never  married. Has no honors or degrees of  any weight. Since nineteen seventy- five he's testified in twenty-eight  court cases, twelve malpractice. And he's black. 
CONCANNON	?	I'm going to tell you how you handle  the fact that he's black. You don't  touch it. You don't mention it. You  treat him like anybody else. Neither  better or worse. And you get a black lawyer to sit at  our table. Okay...? 
YOUNG ATTORNEY	m	Yessir. 
CONCANNON	?	Good. What else do you do? 
YOUNG ATTORNEY	m	...get the records of his testimony  in the twelve malpractice cases. 
CONCANNON	?	Do it. We'll be at Locke-Obers. 
DR. THOMPSON	m	They gave her the wrong anesthetic. 
MICKEY	m	Why is that? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Her sister said she ate one hour  prior to admittance... she... 
MICKEY	m	...that's what the sister said. The  chart said she ate nine hours prior  to... 
DR. THOMPSON	m	...she went in complaining of stomach  cramps. Good doctor would have doubted  the information on the chart. 
MICKEY	m	Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I am seventy-four years old. 
MICKEY	m	What qualifies you as an expert in  anesthetics? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I am on the staff of... 
MICKEY	m	Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse  me, what is that, a joke? Let me  tell you something, Doctor, those  men at Catherine Laboure. Men who  are known not only in this city, but  the world, were trying to save a  woman's life. They were there, and  here you are, four years later, read  some hospital report, and say... 
DR. THOMPSON	m	...I made a detailed physical  examination of the patient, Sir,  yesterday evening, I... 
MICKEY	m	She getting good care over there? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Actually, yes. It's by no means bad,  
MICKEY	m	Then what good would it do to ruin  the reputation of two men, to help a  girl whose life's not going to be  changed in the least? You know what  CODE BLUE means? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	'Code Blue'... 
MICKEY	m	It's a common medical term. 
GALVIN	m	We're going to lose. 
GALVIN	m	Do you think it's my fault? 
LAURA	f	Isn't there something you... 
GALVIN	m	That's not the question. It's over. Do you think that it's my fault? If  I'd... if I'd... I never should have  taken it. There was no way that I  was going to win. 
LAURA	f	You're talking like a drunk. 
GALVIN	m	That's what I am. 
LAURA	f	And it's over...? 
GALVIN	m	Yes. 
LAURA	f	Well, then what are you doing here? 
GALVIN	m	I... do you want me to leave? 
LAURA	f	You do what you want. You want to  leave... You want to go kill yourself? 
GALVIN	m	I... 
LAURA	f	You want me to tell you it's your  fault? It probably is. What are you  going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the  jury comes in. 
GALVIN	m	Who told you that? 
LAURA	f	You told me so. Maybe you'd get some  sympathy. You came to the wrong place. 
GALVIN	m	And what makes you so tough? 
LAURA	f	Maybe I'll tell you later. 
GALVIN	m	Is there going to be a later...? 
LAURA	f	Not if you don't grow up... 
GALVIN	m	If I don't 'grow up...' 
LAURA	f	You're like a kid, you're coming in  here like it's Saturday night, you  want me to say that you've got a  fever -- you don't have to go to  school... 
GALVIN	m	You, you don't under... 
LAURA	f	Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You  say you're going to lose. Is it my  fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't  start until tomorrow and already  it's over for you! 
GALVIN	m	It's over! 
LAURA	f	What is your wife's picture doing by  the side of your... 
GALVIN	m	What is that to you...? 
LAURA	f	What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure. 
GALVIN	m	Excuse me, I've... 
LAURA 	f	Joe... Joe... 
GALVIN	m	Stop pressuring me... 
LAURA	f	You're pressuring yourself... 
GALVIN	m	No... no... 
LAURA	f	Yes. We've all got to let go. 
GALVIN	m	I'm going to do the best I can for  you and your sister. I know what it  means to you. Believe me... It means that much to me. 
MICKEY	m	How are you holding up? 
GALVIN	m	I'm swell. 
MICKEY	m	And all we've got is a witch doctor! 
GALVIN	m	Yeah. 
MICKEY	m	Look at it this way: it's refreshing  every time a Doctor takes the stand  he's not a Jew. 
BAILIFF	?	Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons  having anything to do before the  Honorable, the Justices of the  Superior Court now sitting at Boston  within and for the County of Suffolk,  draw near, give your attendance and  you shall be heard. God save the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
CLERK	m	Deborah Ann Kaye versus St. Catherine  Laboure, Robert S. Towler, M.D. and  Sheldon F. Marx, M.D. 
JUDGE	m	Is the Plaintiff ready? 
GALVIN	m	Ready, your Honor. 
JUDGE	m	Defense...? 
CONCANNON	?	Ready for the Defense, your Honor. 
JUDGE	m	Let's begin. 
GALVIN	m	It's a terrible thing to sit in  judgment. So much rides on it. I  know that you've thought, 'How can I  be pure. How can I be impartial  without being cold. How can I be  merciful and still be just?' And I  know that most of you have said some  sort of prayer this morning to be  helped. To judge correctly. We have  the reputation of two men. Two well  respected doctors and a renowned  hospital before us. And with those  two respected men we have my client,  Deborah Ann Kaye... ...who was deprived of sight, of  locomotion, hearing, speech, of  everything, in short, which  constitutes her life. We are going to prove she was deprived  through negligence. Through the negligence of those  respected men. We will show: One... 
ALITO	m	Why did he go to see Mary Rooney? 
YOUNG LAWYER	m	She's the only nurse who isn't  testifying for the Doctors. 
ALITO	m	What did he find? 
YOUNG LAWYER	m	Nothing. 
ALITO	m	How good's your intelligence? 
YOUNG LAWYER	m	Very good. 
ALITO	m	And so what is the rest of his case  aside from Dr. Thompson? 
YOUNG LAWYER	m	As far as we know, nothing. 
ALITO	m	Thank Mr. Concannon for me. Please  tell him I'll see him at his office. 
CONCANNON	?	Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows,  you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	That is correct. I was engaged to  render an opinion. 
CONCANNON	?	Engaged to render an opinion. For a  price. Is that correct? You're being  paid to be here today? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Just as you are, Sir... 
CONCANNON	?	Are you board-certified in  anesthesiology, Doctor? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	No, I am not. It's quite common in  New York State... 
CONCANNON	?	...I'm sure it is, but this is  Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in  Internal Medicine? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	No. 
CONCANNON	?	Neurology? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	No. 
CONCANNON	?	Orthopedics? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I'm just an M.D. 
CONCANNON	?	Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I know of him. 
CONCANNON	?	How is that? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Through, through his book. 
CONCANNON	?	What book is that? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Meth... Methodology and Technique... 
CONCANNON	?	...of Anesthesiology? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	'Methodology and Techniques of  Anesthesiology.' Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	How old are you? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I am seventy-four years old. 
CONCANNON	?	Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of  medicine? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I'm on the staff of... 
CONCANNON	?	Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you  testify quite a bit against other  physicians? Isn't that right? You,  you're available for that? When you're  paid to be there? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong...  as in this case, I am available. I  am seventy-four years old, I am not  board-certified. 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I have been practicing medicine for  forty-six years and I know when an  injustice has been done. 
CONCANNON	?	Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do.  Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the  time. We will admit the Doctor as an  'expert witness,' fine. 
JUDGE	m	Do we have time this morning to... All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to  continue now, or we can resume with  Dr. Thompson this afternoon. 
GALVIN	m	Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah  Ann Kaye last night at The Northern  Chronic Care Facility? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I did. 
CONCANNON	?	Objection. 
JUDGE	m	Sustained. Yes. The witness will  confine his testimony to review of  the hospital records. 
GALVIN	m	What? 
JUDGE	m	I believe that's the law... is it  not, Mr. Galvin...? 
GALVIN	m	Dr. Thompson. From your review of  the hospital records of May twelfth  nineteen seventy-six. 
GALVIN	m	In your opinion, what happened to  Deborah Ann Kaye? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Cardiac arrest. During delivery her  heart stopped. When the heart stops  the brain's deprived of oxygen. You  get brain damage. That is why she's  in the state she's in today. 
GALVIN	m	Now, Dr. Towler's testified that  they restored the heartbeat within  three or four minutes. In your opinion  is his estimate correct? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	It's my opinion it took him much  longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's  too much brain damage. 
JUDGE	m	Are you saying that a failure to  restore the heartbeat within nine  minutes in itself constitutes bad  medical practice? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	Well... 
GALVIN	m	Your Honor! 
JUDGE	m	Yes, Mr. Galvin? 
GALVIN	m	If I may be permitted to question my  own witness in my own way... 
JUDGE	m	I'd just like to get to the point,  Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these  people's time. Answer the question,  Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine  minute lapse in restoring the  heartbeat in and of itself be  negligence? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I... in that small context I would  have... I would have to say 'no.' 
JUDGE	m	Then you're saying there's no  negligence, based on my question? 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I... given the limits of your  question, that's correct. 
JUDGE	m	The Doctors were not negligent. 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I... um... 
JUDGE	m	Thank you. 
GALVIN	m	I'm not through with the witness,  your Honor. With all due respect if  you are going to try my case for me  I would appreciate it if you wouldn't  lose it. 
JUDGE	m	Thank you. I think that's enough for  this morning. I'll see the Plaintiff's  Counsel in my chambers. Now, please. 
JUDGE	m	I got a letter from the Judge  Advocate's office on you today, fella,  you're on your way out... They should  have kicked you out on that  Lillibridge case. Now this is it  today. 
GALVIN	m	I'm an attorney on trial before the  bar. Representing my client. My  client, do you understand? You open  your mouth and you're losing my case  for me. 
JUDGE	m	Listen to me, fella... 
GALVIN	m	No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted  in this case is an even shake. You  rushed me into court in five days...  my star witness disappears, I can't  get a continuance, and I don't give  a damn. I'm going up there and I'm  going to try it. Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I  don't care. I said, the hell with  it. The hell with it. I'll take my  chances he'll be fair. 
JUDGE	m	Galvin, look, many years ago... 
GALVIN	m	And don't give me this shit, 'I was  a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who  you were. You couldn't hack it as a  lawyer. You were Bag Man for the  Boys and you still are. I know who  you are. 
JUDGE	m	Are you done? 
GALVIN	m	Damn right I'm done. I'm going to  ask for a mistrial and I'm going to  request that you disqualify yourself  from sitting on this case. I'm going  to take a transcript to the State  and ask that they impeach your ass. 
JUDGE	m	You aren't going to get a mistrial,  boy. We're going back this afternoon,  we're going to try this case to an  end. Now you get out of here before  I call the Bailiff and have you thrown  in jail. 
SALLY	f	What does it mean? I... I mean we, you have other  tactics... 
GALVIN	m	We, yes. Yes. They, they present  their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to... 
SALLY	f	Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics,  though... 
GALVIN	m	Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	No further questions. 
GALVIN	m	Dr. Towler... 
TOWLER	?	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	You have a record of what happened  in the operating room... 
TOWLER	?	Yes, that's correct. 
GALVIN	m	...there are notations every thirty  seconds... 
TOWLER	?	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	...of the procedures... 
TOWLER	?	Yes, the roving nurse... 
GALVIN	m	But those notations stop... ...Four-and-one-half minutes after  Deborah Ann Kaye's... 
TOWLER	?	We, we were rather busy... 
GALVIN	m	Four-and-one-half minutes after her  heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes... 
TOWLER	?	As I've said we had some more... 
GALVIN	m	...they start again three minutes  earlier... 
TOWLER	?	We had rather more important things  on our mind than taking notes. We were trying to restore her... 
GALVIN	m	What happened in those three... 
TOWLER	?	...we were trying to restore her  heartbeat. 
GALVIN	m	What happened in those three  minutes...? 
TOWLER	?	We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were  administering electro... 
GALVIN	m	Why did it take that long to get her  heartbeat... 
CONCANNON 	?	Objection, we've... 
GALVIN	m	...to get her heartbeat back...? 
CONCANNON 	?	We've touched on this, his own witness  has said... 
GALVIN	m	...almost nine minutes... causing  brain damage. 
CONCANNON	?	Your Honor...! Your Honor... 
TOWLER	?	Brain damage could have been... it  didn't necessarily take nine minutes,  it could have been caused in two... 
GALVIN	m	Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that  her brain damage could have been  caused by her being deprived of oxygen  for two minutes...? 
TOWLER	?	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	Huh. And why is that? 
TOWLER	?	Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her  brain was getting less oxygen  anyway... 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I didn't do too well for you. 
GALVIN	m	No, you did fine. 
DR. THOMPSON	m	I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till  Monday? 
GALVIN	m	No. No thank you, Doctor. You go  home. 
DR. THOMPSON	m	You know... sometimes people can  surprise you. Sometimes they have a  great capacity to hear the truth. 
GALVIN	m	Yes... I... yes. 
DR. THOMPSON	m	You sure you don't want me to stay  on. 
GALVIN	m	No. No. Thank you. You go home. 
MICKEY	m	I'm going back to the office. 
LAURA	f	Is it over? 
GALVIN	m	No. 
LAURA	f	What are you going to do? 
GALVIN	m	I don't have a goddamned idea. 
GALVIN	m	Okay. What do you do when you don't  have a witness? 
MICKEY	m	You use their witness. 
GALVIN	m	That's right. 
MICKEY	m	I think we tried that. The case is  over. 
MICKEY	m	And how the fuck... You broke the  first law that they taught you in  law school. You never ask a question  you don't know the answer to. Frankie, wake up. You got your own  expert witness says there was no  negligence. It's over. Period.  There'll be no other cases... 
GALVIN	m	There are no other cases. This is  the case. Now you decide... Are you in or out...? 
CONCANNON	?	I know how you feel. I know you don't  believe me, but I do. I'm going to  tell you something I learned when I  was your age. I had prepared a case.  Mr. White asked me, 'How did you  do.' I said, 'I've done my best.' He said,  'They don't pay you to do your best.  They pay you to win.' That's what pays for this office. And that's what pays for the pro  bono work that we do for the poor.  And for the kind of law that you  want to practice. And that's what  pays for your clothes and my whiskey,  and the leisure that we have to sit  back and discuss philosophy. As we're doing tonight. We're paid to win the case. 
CONCANNON	?	You finished your marriage. You wanted  to come back and practice law. You  wanted to come back to the world. 
CONCANNON 	?	Welcome back. 
GALVIN	m	Why doesn't Mary Rooney testify? 
GALVIN	m	Are you with me... are you awake...? 
MICKEY	m	Yeah. I'm awake. 
GALVIN	m	Rooney's protecting someone. Who is  she protecting? 
MICKEY	m	The Doctors. 
GALVIN	m	She's protecting the Doctors she'd  be up there on the stand... 
MICKEY	m	Read me what she said. 
GALVIN	m	'You guys are a bunch of whores...  uh... loyalty... you don't care who  gets hurt... you don't have any  loyalty...' 
MICKEY	m	...one of the other nurses? 
GALVIN	m	Who? They're all testifying. Everybody  who was in the O.R.'s going to take  the stand. 
MICKEY	m	All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.? 
GALVIN	m	What difference can that make...?  All right... 
GALVIN	m	Uh... the admitting nurse... 
MICKEY	m	What did she do? 
GALVIN	m	She didn't do anything. She took the  patient's history and signed the  charts. 'K.C.' 'Kathy Costello...' 
MICKEY	m	The 'History'...? 
GALVIN	m	How old are you, how many children...  when did you last eat... 
GALVIN	m	Miss Rooney. Oh. Listen. I understand what you are doing. And  I want you to know it's all right. 
ROONEY	m	What are you talking about? 
GALVIN	m	About Kathy Costello. I understand, and I don't blame you  for shielding her. 
GALVIN	m	I spoke to her, and everything is  all right. 
ROONEY	m	I, what are you talking about? I  talked to her this morning, and she  said... 
GALVIN	m	She told me. 
ROONEY	m	She did? 
GALVIN	m	I just saw her. 
ROONEY	m	In New York? 
GALVIN	m	What? 
ROONEY	m	You saw Kat in New York... ...or is she in town? Is she in  town...? 
GALVIN	m	Thank you. I'm sorry. 
GALVIN	m	We don't have anything from the Nurse  Association? 
MICKEY	m	The broad has disappeared... 
GALVIN	m	The Hospital...? 
MICKEY	m	No records since she quit in '76.  She quit two weeks after the incident. 
GALVIN	m	Thank you. 
LAURA	f	I have to talk to you. 
GALVIN	m	Call the A.M.A. ...I can't talk now. ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...  you have to find this nurse... 
MICKEY	m	...yeah... good... 
GALVIN	m	...you need some old forms that she  had... somebody's dying... 
GALVIN 	m	Hello, Mrs. Costello... 
GALVIN	m	Sorry to bother you so late. 
GALVIN	m	This is Mr. Goldberg in Accounting.  We have some money here for you...  This is the Mrs. Costello that used  to be a nurse? I'm sorry. I think we have our records  mixed up. 
GALVIN	m	Are you related to Kathy Costello,  the R.N.?... I'm sorry... 
MICKEY 	m	Hello, this is Dr. Dorchester in  Boston. This is an emergency. A nurse  left my employ... 
MICKEY	m	...four years ago... 
GALVIN	m	Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in  Records. We're looking for Kathy  Costello... 
MICKEY	m	I need a cigarette! She left my office four years ago,  we're looking for a chart... I need a cigarette... 
GALVIN	m	Thank you. I'll hold. 
GALVIN	m	Hello. This is Ross Williams. I'm  calling from California. I'm sorry.  I know it's late in the East, but  this is an emergency. May I please  speak to Kathy Costello? I'm sorry. My records must be  confused. This is the family of Kathy  Costello...? Please excuse it. 
FEMALE	f	Hello. 
GALVIN	m	Hello, I'm calling from... 
VOICE	m	If you're selling something, I'm  late for work... 
GALVIN	m	I'm calling from Professional Nurse  Quarterly... 
VOICE	m	From the magazine? 
GALVIN	m	This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions? 
VOICE	m	How come you're calling me from...? 
GALVIN	m	This is Miss Costello...? 
VOICE	m	Yes. Price... 
GALVIN	m	Pardon? 
VOICE	m	Kathy Price. 
GALVIN	m	We find that your subscription  lapsed... 
VOICE	m	My subscription lapsed three years  ago... 
GALVIN	m	That's why I'm calling, Miss Price... 
VOICE	m	Missus... 
GALVIN	m	We have a renew-your-subscription  offer... 
VOICE	m	We get it at work. We get the magazine  at work. 
GALVIN	m	Yes, we know that you do. I have it  in my files. That's at the Manhattan  Health Center... 
VOICE	m	No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look,  call me Monday, hey? I'm late for  work. 
LAURA	f	Hello? Mr. Gal... where are you...? 
LAURA	f	You're going to New York? I... you're  kidding... Because I'm going to New  York. I just got a call. I have to go sign  papers. About my divorce. I... good.  Frank. We'll meet there. All right? 
LAURA	f	Can we meet there, Joe? 
MICKEY	m	You got a cigarette...? 
LAURA	f	At the Beacon. On Fifty-third  Street... we can spend the night. 
LAURA 	f	At around four...? 
LAURA	f	I feel the same way, Joe... I'll see  you this afternoon? 
MICKEY	m	You got any cigarettes? 
KATHY	f	Hi. 
GALVIN	m	Hi. How are you doing? 
GALVIN	m	I've been meaning to come in a long  time. 
KATHY	f	You live in the neighborhood? 
GALVIN	m	Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be  staying with us in a few months, so  I stopped by. 
KATHY	f	How old is he? 
GALVIN	m	Four. You're great with these kids. 
KATHY	f	Thank you. 
GALVIN	m	You're really... You, are you the one they told me  was the nurse? 
KATHY	f	Who told you that? 
GALVIN	m	Mrs... 
KATHY	f	Mrs. Simmonds. 
GALVIN	m	Yes. 
KATHY	f	I used to be a nurse. 
GALVIN	m	That's a wonderful profession. My  daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did  you do, stop? 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	How come you stopped? 
GALVIN	m	Will you help me? 
GALVIN	m	What the hell are you doing here? 
MICKEY	m	We got to talk. 
GALVIN	m	What are you doing in New York...? 
MICKEY	m	Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee... 
LAURA	f	It's all right... it's all right...  it's all right... it's all right... 
MICKEY	m	I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar  Association. The broad used to work for one of  Concannon's partners in New York  awhile ago. She wanted to move to Boston. How badly did she hurt us, Joe? 
GALVIN	m	I don't know. 
MICKEY	m	We got a mistrial, you know. Joe --  did you hear what I said...? 
GALVIN	m	I don't want a mistrial. 
MICKEY	m	He's not here. Yeah. I don't know when. All right. 
ANNOUNCER 	f	The Knicks are pressing hard... 
GALVIN	m	Dr. Towler; page 406,  'Contraindications to general  anesthetic. Ideally a patient should  refrain from taking nourishment up  to nine hours prior to induction of  general anesthetic.' Does that sound  familiar? 
DR. TOWLER	?	Yes. I wrote it. 
GALVIN	m	'Practice and Methodology in  Anaesthesia.' General textbook on  the subject. Is that correct? 
DR. TOWLER	?	I. Yes. It is. 
GALVIN	m	And you wrote that... 
DR. TOWLER	?	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken  nourishment within one hour prior to  inducement, general anesthetic should  be avoided at all costs because of  the grave risk the patient will  aspirate food particles into his  mask.' Is that what happened to  Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into  her mask? 
DR. TOWLER	?	She threw up in her mask, yes. But  she hadn't eaten one hour prior to  admission. 
GALVIN	m	If she had eaten, say one hour prior  to admission, the inducement of a  general anesthetic... the type you  gave her... would have been  negligent...? 
DR. TOWLER	?	Negligent. Yes... it would have been  criminal. But that was not the case. 
GALVIN	m	Thank you. 
JUDGE	m	Mr. Concannon...? 
CONCANNON	?	Nothing further, your Honor. 
JUDGE	m	Mr. Galvin, rebuttal? 
GALVIN	m	Katherine Price. 
BAILIFF	?	Katherine Price... 
BAILIFF 	?	State your name please. 
KATHY 	f	Katherine Lynn Price. 
BAILIFF	?	D'you swear that the evidence you  are about to give will be the truth,  the... 
BAILIFF	?	...whole truth and nothing but the  truth, so help you God? 
KATHY	f	I do. 
BAILIFF	?	Be seated. 
GALVIN	m	Kathy Price... 
KATHY	f	Yes... 
GALVIN	m	You were the Admitting Nurse at St.  Catherine Laboure Hospital on May  twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the  night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted... 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	You signed this form? 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	These are your initials, 'K.C.'? 
KATHY	f	Kathy Costello. That's my maiden  name. 
GALVIN	m	D'you ask the patient when did she  last eat? 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	What did she say? 
KATHY	f	She said she had a full meal one  hour before coming to the hospital. 
GALVIN	m	One hour. 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	And did you write the numeral 'one'  down on the record, standing for one  hour? 
KATHY	f	I did. 
GALVIN	m	A single hour. 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
GALVIN	m	Your witness. 
CONCANNON	?	You are aware of the penalties for  perjury...? 
KATHY	f	It's a crime. 
CONCANNON	?	Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime. 
KATHY	f	I wouldn't do it. 
CONCANNON	?	You would not...? 
KATHY	f	No. 
CONCANNON	?	In fact, you've just taken an oath  that you would not commit perjury.  You've just sworn to that. Isn't  that right? 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	Just now... 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	...sworn before God you would tell  the truth? 
KATHY	f	Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	Now. I'd like to ask you something:  four years ago, when you were working  as a nurse, are you aware that Drs.  Towler and Marx based their treatment  of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart  that you signed...? 
KATHY	f	I... 
CONCANNON	?	And wasn't that an oath...? These  are your initials here: K.C. When  you signed this chart you took an  oath. No less important than that  which you took today. Isn't that right? Isn't that right...? 
KATHY	f	I... yes. 
CONCANNON	?	Then, please, which is correct? You've  sworn today the patient ate one hour  ago. Four years ago you swore she  ate nine hours ago? Which is the  lie. When were you lying? 
KATHY	f	I... 
CONCANNON	?	You know these doctors could have  settled out of court. They wanted a  trial. They wanted to clear their  names. 
GALVIN	m	Objection! 
CONCANNON	?	And you would come here, and on a  slip of memory four years ago, you'd  ruin their lives. 
KATHY	f	They lied. 
CONCANNON	?	'They lied.' Indeed! When did they  lie? And do you know what a lie is? 
KATHY	f	I do. Yes. 
CONCANNON	?	You swore on this form that the  patient ate nine hours ago. 
KATHY	f	That's not my handwriting. 
CONCANNON	?	You've just said you signed it. 
KATHY	f	Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But  I, I didn't write that figure. 
CONCANNON	?	You didn't write that figure. And  how is it that you remember that so  clearly after four years? 
KATHY	f	Because I kept a copy. I have it  right here. 
CONCANNON	?	Objection! This is ri... expect us  to accept a photocopy, we have the  original right... 
JUDGE	m	I'll rule on that presently. Proceed. 
JUDGE	m	Please proceed. 
CONCANNON	?	...what in the world would induce  you to make a photocopy of some  obscure record and hold it four years?  This is a... why? Why would you do  that? 
KATHY	f	I thought I would need it. 
CONCANNON	?	And why, please tell us, would you  think that? 
KATHY	f	After, after the operation, when  that poor girl, she went in a coma.  Dr. Towler called me in. He told me  he had five difficult deliveries in  a row and he was tired, and he never  looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a  nine. Or else, or else, he said... He said he'd fire me. He said I'd  never work again... Who were these  men...? Who were these men...? I  wanted to be a nurse... 
CONCANNON	?	No further questions. 
JUDGE	m	You may step down. 
JUDGE	m	Mr. Galvin...? 
GALVIN	m	Nothing further, your Honor... 
JUDGE	m	Mr. Concannon...? 
JUDGE	m	Mr. Concannon. 
CONCANNON	?	Thank you, your Honor. We object to  the copy of the admissions form as  incompetent and essentially hearsay  evidence and cite McGee versus State  of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216  through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The  admission of a duplicate document in  preference to an existing original  must presuppose the possibility of  alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the  Plaintiff the leeway we would like  your ruling on this issue now: we  object to the admission of the Xerox  form. 
JUDGE	m	...one moment, Mr. Concannon... 
JUDGE	m	The document is disallowed, the jury  will be advised not to consider the  testimony of Kathy Costello regarding  the Xerox form. It's unsubstantiated and we can't  accept a copy in preference to the  original... 
CONCANNON	?	Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms.  Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a  'Surprise Witness' she may only serve  to rebut direct testimony. As her  only evidentiary rebuttal was the  admitting form, which has been  disallowed I request that her entire  testimony be disallowed and the jury  advised that they must totally  disregard her appearance here. 
JUDGE	m	I'm going to uphold that. 
GALVIN	m	I object, your Honor... 
JUDGE	m	Overruled... 
GALVIN	m	Exception! 
JUDGE	m	Noted. Thank you. Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed... 
JUDGE 	m	Her entire testimony must be stricken  from the record. You shouldn't have  heard it, but you did. Now, that was  my mistake... and you must strike it  from your minds, give it no weight. 
ALITO	m	Legally it's over. Concannon was  brilliant. 
BROPHY	m	Tell me about Kaitlin Costello. 
ALITO	m	There's nothing to tell. It's been  stricken from the record. 
BROPHY	m	I know. Did you believe her? 
JUDGE SWEENEY	m	Mr. Galvin...? 
GALVIN	m	You know, so much of the time we're  lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us  what is right. Tell us what's true.  There is no justice. The rich win,  the poor are powerless...' We become  tired of hearing people lie. After a  time we become dead. A little dead.  We start thinking of ourselves as  victims. And we become victims. And we become weak... and doubt  ourselves, and doubt our  institutions... and doubt our  beliefs... we say for example, 'The  law is a sham... there is no law...  I was a fool for having believed  there was.' But today you are the law. You are  the law... And not some book and not  the lawyers, or the marble statues  and the trappings of the court...  all that they are is symbols. Of our desire to be just... All that they are, in effect, is a  prayer... ...a fervent, and a frightened prayer. 
GALVIN	m	In my religion we say, 'Act as if  you had faith, and faith will be  given to you.' If... If we would have faith in  justice, we must only believe in  ourselves. And act with justice. And I believe that there is justice  in our hearts. Thank you. 
JUDGE	m	Have you reached a verdict? 
FOREMAN 	m	We have, your Honor. 
FOREMAN	m	Your Honor, we have agreed to hold  for the Plaintiff... but on the size  of the award, are we bound... 
JUDGE	m	You are not bound by anything, other  than your good judgment, based on  the evidence. 
FOREMAN 	m	Are we permitted to award an amount  greater than the amount the Plaintiff  asked for? 
JUDGE	m	Yes. You are. 
JUDGE	m	Please retire and... 
MICKEY	m	The jury might be out for awhile. You want to run across the street  and get a drink?
