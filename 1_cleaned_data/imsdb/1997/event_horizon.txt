WEIR	m	I miss you.
WEIR 	m	This is Weir.
LYLE 	m	Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like  to see you as soon as possible.
WEIR	m	You wanted to see me, Admiral?
HOLLIS	m	I apologize for the short notice,  Bill, but we've had something come  up that requires your immediate  attention. Lyle?
LYLE	m	At oh-three-hundred this morning,  TDRSS picked up an automated  navigation beacon broadcasting at  two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.
WEIR	m	Incredible... These are the same  coordinates before the ship  disappeared... this, this happened?  This isn't some kind of hoax?
HOLLIS	m	I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax.  Houston confirms the telemetry and  I.D. codes.
WEIR	m	It's the Event Horizon. She's come  back.
HOLLIS	m	That ship was lost in deep space,  seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed  into New York harbor, I'd find it  more plausible. Houston wants Aerospace to send out  a search and rescue team, investigate  the source of the transmission. If  it really is the Event Horizon,  they'll attempt a salvage. We need you to prepare a detailed  briefing on the ship's systems for  the salvage crew...
WEIR	m	A written briefing can't possibly  anticipate the variables on a mission  like this. I have to go with them.
LYLE	m	Dr. Weir, you have no experience  with salvage procedures.
WEIR	m	I designed the ship's propulsion  system. I am the only person capable  of evaluating the performance of the  gravity drive. You can't send a Search  and Rescue team out there alone and  expect them to succeed. That would  be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
LYLE	m	I can understand your desire to redeem  your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it  doesn't factor into this.
WEIR	m	This is not about my reputation!  This is not about me at all! The Event Horizon was created for  one reason: to go faster than light.  Imagine mankind exploring new solar  systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven  years ago, we didn't just lose the  ship and the crew. We lost the dream. I have to go.
HOLLIS	m	It's not that simple. Lyle, play the recording for Dr.  Weir.
LYLE	m	Navigation Control tried to hail the  vessel. This was the only response.
LYLE	m	Since the initial transmission,  there's been no further contact.  Just the beacon, every two minutes.
WEIR	m	The crew? Could they still be alive?
LYLE	m	The ship had life support systems  for eighteen months. They're been  gone seven years.
WEIR	m	Someone sent that message. Admiral,  you have to put me on that ship.
HOLLIS	m	It's against my better judgement,  but I'll run this by the Man  downstairs. You'll know my decision  by the end of the day.
WEIR	m	Thank you.
HOLLIS	m	Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing  you any favors.
LYLE	m	You're not seriously considering  sending him?
HOLLIS	m	You don't just dismiss Bill Weir.  The man held Oppenheimer's chair at  Princeton. If the Event Horizon had  worked, he would have gone down in  history as the greatest mind in  physics since Einstein.
LYLE	m	The official inquiry blamed Weir's  design for the ship's loss.
HOLLIS	m	That doesn't mean a damn thing. They  were looking for a scapegoat and  Weir fit the bill. But he's not  responsible for what happened to the  ship.
LYLE	m	Does he know that?
HOLLIS	m	What's on your mind?
LYLE	m	He doesn't belong on this mission.  Responsible or not, he blames himself.  He's too close to it. And then there's his wife.
HOLLIS	m	It's been two years since she died.  He's over it.
LYLE	m	Some things you don't get over.
HOLLIS	m	I want our best people on this.  Where's Miller?
LYLE	m	The Lewis and Clark just returned  from patrol in the asteroid belt,  she's docked in bay four.
SMITH	m	I can't believe this, I haven't gotten  more than my hand in six weeks and  now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap,  Mars has women...
STARCK	m	Smith's right. Neptune? There's  nothing out there. If something  happens, we'll be on our own.
MILLER	m	I don't like it either, but you know  the rules: we get the call, we go.  Is the course locked in?
SMITH	m	Locked and cocked.
STARCK	m	We're past the outer marker, we can  engage the ion drive whenever you're  ready.
MILLER	m	Justin?
JUSTIN	m	Everything green on my boards,  Skipper.
MILLER	m	Start the countdown.
STARCK	m	Ion drive will engage in... T-minus  ten minutes.
MILLER	m	Let's go.
MILLER	m	Kill it.
COOPER	m	Time to play Spam in the can.
MILLER	m	Don't start with me, Cooper.
WEIR	m	Captain Miller, I just want to say...
MILLER	m	The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If  you'll follow the rest of the crew,  they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
MILLER	m	What's the hold up?
PETERS	m	Just loading the last of the CO2  scrubbers. Good for four months.
MILLER	m	I put in for a replacement for you  but no one...
PETERS	m	No, no, its alright. I talked to my  ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas  and I'll get him this summer. Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen  him in two months.
MILLER	m	I am sorry. But now we have to go to  work.
COOPER	m	Is that an offer?
STARCK	m	It is not.
WEIR	m	Captain Miller, I appreciate this  opportunity...
MILLER	m	Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on  your mission because we want to. We  were pulled off a well deserved leave,  to be sent out to the middle of  nowhere, and no one's even told us  why.
WEIR	m	I've been authorized to brief you  and the crew once we reach Neptune  space.
MILLER	m	Until then, do what you're told and  stay out of my way.
PETERS	m	First time in a grav couch?
WEIR	m	Yes.
PETERS	m	Don't worry about it. He's hard, but  he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping  out with him. He's one of the few  Captains in the service with  experience in the Outer Reach.
WEIR	m	He's been past Mars?
PETERS	m	He served on the Goliath.
WEIR	m	Wasn't that ship destroyed?
PETERS	m	They attempted to rescue a supply  shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's  oh-two tanks ruptured during the  rescue, flooded both ships with pure  oxygen. There was a spark and both  ships were incinerated. The Skipper  and three others just made it to a  lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
DJ	m	He doesn't like to talk about it.
DJ	m	You didn't eat anything in the past  twelve hours?
DJ	m	When the Ion drive fires, we'll be  taking about 30 gees. Without a tank,  the force would liquefy your skeleton.
WEIR	m	I've seen the effect on mice.
MILLER	m	Five minutes.
DJ	m	Put this on.
PETERS	m	You'll be fine. You'll wake up and  we'll be there. Watch your fingers.
DJ	m	Heart-rate decreasing... body temp  dropping to 80... 70... 60... 50...  40 degrees Fahrenheit. He's in stasis.
VOICE	m	Billy...
VOICE	m	I'm so cold...
VOICE	m	I'm so cold...
WEIR	m	Claire?
WEIR	m	Claire? I'm sorry. Claire?
CLAIRE	f	I'm so cold...
WEIR	m	Claire...
PETERS	m	DJ!
WEIR	m	I'm alright now. I'm alright...
DJ	m	Move slowly. You've been in stasis  for fifty-six days. You're going to  experience a little disorientation.
COOPER	m	Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like  that. Coffee?
WEIR	m	What?
COOPER	m	Coffee.
WEIR	m	No, thank you.
COOPER	m	Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back?
STARCK	m	Maybe when you finish puberty.
MILLER	m	Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
STARCK	m	I just finished drying...
MILLER	m	Then what are you doing here? Come  on, people, let's go! And Cooper... Put some pants on.
DENNY	m	Play horsey, Mommy, play horsey...
PETERS	m	Want to play horsey, do you...
SMITH	m	30 hours to Neptune orbit.
STARCK	m	All boards are green, everything's  five by five.
MILLER	m	That's good to know. Justin, you  wanna stow that?
MILLER	m	Okay, listen up. As you all know by  now, we have an addition to our crew.  Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation;  Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
COOPER	m	You can call him Baby-bear, he loves  that...
MILLER	m	This is Cooper, what the hell do you  do on this ship, anyway?
JUSTIN	m	Ballast.
COOPER	m	I am your best friend. I am a  lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
MILLER	m	He's a rescue technician. Peters,  medical technician. DJ...
DJ	m	Trauma.
MILLER	m	And this is mission specialist Dr.  William Weir. We all know where we're  going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us  why.
WEIR	m	What I am about to tell you is  considered code-black by the NSA.
JUSTIN	m	That means top-secret, Cooper.
COOPER	m	I heard it.
WEIR	m	The USAC intercepted a radio  transmission from a decaying orbit  around Neptune. The source has been  identified as the Event Horizon.
STARCK	m	That's impossible! She was lost with  all hands, what, seven...
JUSTIN	m	Seven years ago, the reactor blew...
PETERS	m	How can we salvage...?
SMITH	m	Let the dead rest, man...
COOPER	m	...cancel our leave and send us out  on some bullshit mission...!
MILLER	m	EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
WEIR	m	What was made public about the Event  Horizon, that she was a deep space  research vessel, that its reactor  went critical, that the ship blew  up... None of that is true. The Event Horizon was the culmination  of a secret government project to  create a spacecraft capable of faster- than-light flight.
SMITH	m	You can't do that.
STARCK	m	The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
WEIR	m	Relativity, yes. We can't break the  law of relativity, but we can go  around it. The ship doesn't really  move faster than the speed of light;  it creates a dimensional gateway  that allows the ship to  instantaneously "jump" from one point  in the universe to another, light  years away.
STARCK	m	How?
WEIR	m	Well, in layman's terms, you use a  rotating magnetic field to focus a  narrow beam of gravitons; these in  turn fold space-time consistent with  Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely  large and you have a singularity...
COOPER	m	Laymen's terms.
SMITH	m	Hey...
WEIR	m	Say this paper represents space-time,  and you want to get from "point A"  here... ...to "point B," here. Now: what's the shortest distance  between two points?
STARCK	m	A straight line.
WEIR	m	Wrong. The shortest distance between  two points...
WEIR	m	...is zero. That's what the  singularity does: it folds space, so  that point A and point B coexist in  the same space and time. After the  ship passes through this gateway,  space returns to normal. It's called a gravity drive.
JUSTIN	m	How do you know all this?
WEIR	m	I built it.
COOPER	m	I can see why they sent you along.
JUSTIN	m	So if the ship didn't blow up, what  happened?
WEIR	m	It was the ship's maiden voyage, to  test the drive. The Event Horizon  moved to safe distance using ion  thrusters. They received the go-ahead  to activate the gravity drive. And the ship vanished from all our  scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced  optical, no radio contact of any  kind. They disappeared without a  trace. Until now.
MILLER	m	Where has it been for the last seven  years?
WEIR	m	That's what we're here to find out.
WEIR	m	We haven't been able to confirm any  live contact, but TDRSS did receive  a single transmission from the Event  Horizon.
SMITH	m	What the hell is that?
PETERS	m	It doesn't sound like anything human.
WEIR	m	Houston has passed the recording  through several filters and isolated  what appears to be a human voice.
SMITH	m	Jesus...
MILLER	m	What is that?
DJ	m	It sounds like Latin.
COOPER	m	Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin?
STARCK	m	No one. It's a dead language.
DJ	m	Mostly dead.
MILLER	m	What does it say?
WEIR	m	NSA encryption specialists have  deciphered some of the message...
WEIR	m	There: "...liberatis me..." They  haven't been able to translate the  rest, it's too distorted.
DJ	m	"Liberatis me." "Save me."
COOPER	m	From what?
MILLER	m	You're convinced the crew could still  be alive? After seven years?
WEIR	m	The Event Horizon only had life  support for eighteen months. It seems  impossible, but in light of the  transmission... I have to think that  someone has managed to endure until  now.
COOPER	m	Skipper, do we get hazard pay for  this?
MILLER	m	You heard the tape, Smith. We're  looking for survivors.
STARCK	m	Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach  angle is fourteen degrees.
MILLER	m	Come around to three-three-four...
SMITH	m	Heading three-three-four...
MILLER	m	...Make your approach vector negative  fourteen degrees...
SMITH	m	One-four degrees...
SMITH	m	We have a lock on the Event Horizon's  navigation beacon. It's in the upper  ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
MILLER	m	Bring us in tight. Starck, get on  the horn, see if anyone's listening...
STARCK	m	This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel  Lewis and Clark, hailing Event  Horizon, Event Horizon, do you  read...? This is the Lewis and Clark,  hailing...
SMITH	m	Matching speed... now. Range to target  ten thousand meters and closing...  Skipper, I got a bad feeling about  this...
MILLER	m	We're all on edge, Smith. We're a  long way out...
SMITH	m	That's not it. That ship was built  to go faster than light... That's  just wrong, it goes against everything  we know...
MILLER	m	What are you trying to say? "If God  had intended Man to fly, he would  have given us wings?"
SMITH	m	Something like that, yeah.
MILLER	m	I guess we're about to find out.  Keep us slow and steady.
SMITH	m	Yes, sir.
MILLER	m	Dr. Weir...!
MILLER	m	I think you want to see this.
WEIR	m	Where is she?
SMITH	m	Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
SMITH	m	We've got some weather.
MILLER	m	I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
STARCK	m	If they are, they're screening their  calls.
SMITH	m	Range 3000 meters and closing.
WEIR	m	I can't see anything...
SMITH	m	1500 meters. We're getting too  close...
MILLER	m	Where is it?
STARCK	m	The scope is lit, it's right in front  of us...
SMITH	m	1000 meters...
SMITH	m	Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters,  700... we're right on top of it,  we're gonna hit!
MILLER	m	Starck...
STARCK	m	It should be right there...
STARCK	m	My God.
MILLER	m	Reverse thrusters full!
SMITH	m	Jesus, that is one big ugly fat  fucker...
WEIR	m	She's not ugly.
SMITH	m	Range 500 meters and holding.  Turbulence is dropping off...
STARCK	m	Picking up magnetic interference.
MILLER	m	Put it through TACS. Smith, you up  for a flyby?
SMITH	m	Love to.
STARCK	m	Look at the size of that thing.
WEIR	m	Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge,  medical and science labs, hydroponics,  what have you. That central section  connects the forward decks to the  Engineering containment area. Can we  move in closer?
SMITH	m	Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna  need a rubber...
MILLER	m	Do it.
WEIR	m	That's the engineering containment.  And there's the main airlock. We can  dock there.
MILLER	m	Smith, use the arm and lock us onto  that antennae cluster.
WEIR	m	Be careful. It's not a load bearing  structure...
SMITH	m	It is now. We're locked in.
MILLER	m	Starck, give me a read.
STARCK	m	The reactor's still hot. We've got  several small radiation sources,  leaks probably. Nothing serious.
WEIR	m	Do they have pressure?
STARCK	m	Affirmative. The hull's intact...  but there's no gravity and the thermal  units are off line. I'm showing deep  cold. The crew couldn't survive unless  they were in stasis.
MILLER	m	Find 'em, Starck.
STARCK	m	Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
MILLER	m	Radiation interference?
STARCK	m	There's not enough radiation to throw  off the scan. I'm picking up trace  life forms, but I can't get a lock  on the location.
WEIR	m	Could it be the crew? If they were  in suspended animation, wouldn't  that effect the scan?
STARCK	m	If they were in stasis, I'd get a  location, but these readings, they're  all over the ship. It doesn't make  any sense.
MILLER	m	Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by  deck, room by room. Starck, deploy  the umbilicus. I believe you're up  for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your  bonnet on.
JUSTIN	m	Yes, sir!
MILLER	m	Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
WEIR	m	Captain, I didn't come out here to  sit on your bridge, I need to be on  that ship...
MILLER	m	Once the ship is secured, we'll bring  you on board --
WEIR	m	That is not acceptable --
MILLER	m	-- once we've secured the ship, that's  the way it is! I need you to guide us from the comm  station. This is where I need you.  Help us to do our job.
WEIR	m	Very well.
COOPER	m	...come on, Skipper, I already put  my shoes on...
MILLER	m	You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's  Justin's turn. Stay on station. If  anything happens...
COOPER	m	I'll be all over it.
PETERS	m	Opening inner airlock door.
COOPER	m	You still need the rope? I thought  you were one a those spacemen with  ice in ya veins.
JUSTIN	m	I'd rather be on the rope and not  need it than need it and not have  it. Now step aside, old man.
COOPER	m	You just keep your nose clean, Baby  Bear. Clear the door.
WEIR	m	You've reached the outer airlock  door.
PETERS	m	We've got pressure.
MILLER	m	Clear and open on my mark. Three...  two... one... mark.
PETERS	m	Jesus its huge.
MILLER	m	Ice crystals everywhere. This place  is a deep freeze.
WEIR 	m	You're in the central corridor. It  connects the personnel areas to  Engineering.
MILLER	m	Peters and I will search the forward  decks. Justin, take Engineering. No  hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
JUSTIN	m	Not a chance, sir.
MILLER	m	Dr. Weir, what's this?
PETERS	m	Here's another one. They're all over  the place.
WEIR 	m	They're explosive charges.
MILLER	m	I can see that, what're they for?
WEIR	m	In an emergency, the charges detonate  in series, destroying the central  section and separating the personnel  areas from the rest of the ship.  That way, if the gravity drive  malfunctions, the crew could use the  foredecks as a lifeboat.
PETERS	m	That means they didn't abandon ship.
MILLER	m	So where are they? Starck, any luck  with the bio-scan?
STARCK	m	I'm running diagnostics now,  Skipper... Nothing's wrong with the  sensor pack, I'm still getting trace  life readings, all over the ship.
PETERS	m	There's no one in the corridor but  us.
STARCK 	m	Not according to the computer.
MILLER	m	Peters is right, no one's here.
PETERS	m	I don't know, this place is really  dark, I can't see a thing...
MILLER	m	Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay.  Let's finish the sweep.
WEIR 	m	Captain Miller, the foredecks are  just ahead.
PETERS	m	I can see the hatch.
MILLER	m	Starck, you still showing those  readings?
STARCK 	m	That's an affirmative.
MILLER	m	Keep your eyes open.
PETERS	m	We found the gravity couches.
WEIR	m	Any survivors?
MILLER 	m	Negative.
WEIR	m	No one?
MILLER	m	They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving  forward.
WEIR 	m	You've reached the First Containment  Seal. The engineering decks are on  the other side.
JUSTIN	m	We still have pressure. The radiation  count's steady at 7 millirads an  hour.
WEIR 	m	Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
PETERS	m	Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
WEIR 	m	You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters.  You still haven't seen any crew?
MILLER	m	If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd  know about it. I'm in Medical. No casualties, it  looks like this place has never been  used.
PETERS	m	I found something.
WEIR	m	Yes, we can see some kind of mist.  What is that?
PETERS 	m	Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
WEIR	m	Can you see a body?
PETERS	m	There's no one here.
MILLER 	m	The blood came from somewhere,  Peters...
PETERS	m	There's no one here, Skipper.
PETERS	m	Come on...
PETERS	m	Okay. I'm on the bridge.
MILLER 	m	What you got, Peters?
PETERS	m	Everything's been shut down.  Conserving power, I guess. Green  light on the hull, it's intact.
MILLER	m	The science workstation has power,  I'll see if I can find the crew from  here.
WEIR	m	Ms. Peters, turn back and to your  left, please.
STARCK	m	What is it?
WEIR	m	Ship's log.
PETERS 	m	I see it.
PETERS	m	It's stuck.
JUSTIN	m	I've reached another containment  door. This thing's huge...
WEIR 	m	That's the Second Containment Seal.  Beyond that, engineering.
JUSTIN	m	I'm going in.
PETERS	m	It's really jammed in there.
PETERS	m	I found one.
MILLER 	m	Alive?
PETERS	m	Frozen.
STARCK	m	What happened to his eyes?
SMITH	m	Explosive decompression.
STARCK	m	Decompression wouldn't do that.
STARCK	m	You okay?
COOPER	m	Hey, Baby Bear, Mama Bear got a  corpsicle for ya...
COOPER 	m	Baby Bear, you copy?
COOPER	m	Justin, do you copy?
COOPER 	m	...do you copy?
JUSTIN	m	Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
COOPER 	m	Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck  are you?
JUSTIN	m	I'm in the Second Containment area.  It's pitch black in here. There must  have been a coolant leak. Man, this  shit is everywhere. I can't see a  damn thing.
JUSTIN	m	The reactor's still hot. Coolant  level is on reserve, but still in  the green.
JUSTIN	m	I got it...
JUSTIN	m	Holy shit...
COOPER	m	Justin?
JUSTIN	m	I think I found something...
SMITH	m	What the hell is that?
WEIR	m	That's the Core: the gravity drive.  The heart of the ship.
MILLER 	m	Justin, check the containment for  radiation leaks. Peters...
MILLER 	m	...how's the client?
PETERS	m	Crystallized.
MILLER 	m	Justin, finish your sweep.
JUSTIN	m	Almost done, I just gotta check one  thing...
STARCK	m	Justin, hold on a sec, you're breaking  up...
STARCK 	m	Justin...?
STARCK	m	Justin, come in...
WEIR	m	What is it?
STARCK	m	I don't know. The life readings just  went off the scale.
SMITH	m	Something's wrong...
MILLER	m	What the hell...
MILLER	m	Oh shit...!
STARCK	m	Miller, do you read me, Peters --
SMITH	m	Get them back --
STARCK	m	I'm trying, goddammit --
COOPER	m	What's happening?
STARCK 	m	I don't know, the screens are dead...!
COOPER	m	350 meters... 400 meters...
DJ	m	He's in trouble. Go!
COOPER	m	I'm gone!
MILLER	m	Boarding party, sound off... Peters,  do you read me... . Peters...
PETERS	m	Denny...
MILLER	m	...Peters, do you read me...
VOICE	m	Don't leave me...
MILLER	m	Justin? Justin, sound off...  Justin...!
COOPER	m	Hold on, Baby Bear...
COOPER	m	Oh my God...
COOPER	m	Justin, do you read me? Justin... .
COOPER	m	Baby Bear, don't do this. Don't do  this...
STARCK	m	Here comes another one! Hold on!
STARCK	m	We lost the starboard baffle! The  hull's been breached!
SMITH	m	The safety circuit's failed!
WEIR	m	We're losing atmosphere...
STARCK	m	There are pressure suits in the  Airlock. Go!
MILLER	m	Can anybody hear me...
PETERS 	m	Skipper...
MILLER	m	Peters...
MILLER 	m	...you okay?
PETERS	m	Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
COOPER 	m	We have a man down...
MILLER	m	Coop, where are you...
COOPER 	m	The containment, Second Containment...
MILLER	m	Hold on, Coop...
SMITH 	m	Captain Miller...
MILLER	m	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
SMITH	m	We have a situation here...
SMITH	m	We lost the starboard baffle and the  hull cracked. Our safety seals didn't  close, the circuit's fried --
MILLER	m	Do we have enough time for a weld?
SMITH 	m	We don't have time to fart.
SMITH	m	We're losing pressure at 280 liters  a second and our oxygen tanks are  cracked. In three minutes, our  atmosphere will be gone. We are  fucking dead.
MILLER	m	No one's dying on my watch, Smith!  What about the reserve tanks?
SMITH 	m	They're gone.
WEIR	m	The Event Horizon.
SMITH	m	What?
WEIR	m	It still has air and reserve power,  we can activate gravity and life  support.
STARCK	m	What if the air has gone bad? We  can't wear these suits forever.
SMITH	m	I don't think this is a good idea,  we don't even know what happened on  that ship...
WEIR	m	It beats dying, Mister Smith.
MILLER	m	Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the  Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the  airlock.
SMITH 	m	But...
MILLER	m	You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you  with me?
PETERS	m	I'm ahead of you. Bringing the thermal  units on line...
PETERS	m	Hold tight and prep for gees.
MILLER	m	Everybody okay?
STARCK	m	We're all here.
MILLER	m	Okay. Let's find out how much time  we just bought.
DJ	m	We haven't tested the air yet. It  could be contaminated...
MILLER	m	No time. We need whatever's left in  our suits to repair the Clark. Like  it or not, this is the only oxygen  for three billion kilometers.
STARCK	m	It tastes bad.
MILLER	m	But you can breathe it.
STARCK	m	The antennae array's completely fried,  we've got no radio, no laser, no  highgain... No one's going to be  coming to help us.
MILLER	m	How much oh-two do we have?
STARCK	m	Oxygen is not the problem.
MILLER	m	Carbon dioxide?
STARCK	m	It's building up with every breath  we take. And the CO2 filters on the  Event Horizon are shot.
MILLER	m	We can take the filters from the  Clark...
STARCK	m	I thought of that, with the filters  from the Clark, we've got enough  breathable air for twenty hours.  After that, we'd better be on our  way home.
MILLER	m	What about the life readings you  picked up?
STARCK	m	The Event Horizon sensors show the  same thing: "Bio-readings of  indeterminate origin." Right before  that wave hit the Clark, there was  some kind of surge, right off the  scale, but now it's back to its  previous levels.
MILLER	m	What's causing the readings?
STARCK	m	I don't know, but whatever it is,  it's not the crew.
MILLER	m	So where is the rest of the crew?  We've been over every inch of this  ship and all we've found is blood.  Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
MILLER	m	What happened here?
SMITH	m	Captain Miller, you copy?
MILLER 	m	I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
SMITH	m	I've found a six inch fracture in  the outer hull. We should be able to  repair it and re-pressurize, it's  gonna take some time.
MILLER 	m	We don't have time, Smith. In twenty  hours we run out of air.
SMITH	m	Understood.
MILLER	m	How is he?
DJ	m	His vitals are stable, but he's  unresponsive to stimuli. He might  wake up in fifteen minutes. He might  not wake up at all.
PETERS	m	What happened to him?
MILLER	m	DJ, take samples from these stains,  compare them to medical records, I  want to know whose blood this is.
MILLER	m	Okay, people, there's been a change  in the mission. In less than eighteen  hours, we will run out of breathable  air. Our primary objective is now  survival. That means we focus on  repairing the Lewis and Clark and  salvaging whatever will buy us more  time. Our secondary objective is finding  out what happened to this ship and  its crew. Two months from now, I  fully intend to be standing in front  of the good Admiral giving my report,  and I'd like to have more than my  dick in my hands.
MILLER	m	Peters, I want you to go through the  ship's log, see if we can't find  some answers.
PETERS	m	I can use the station in Medical,  keep an eye on Justin...
MILLER	m	Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat  the bio-scan...
STARCK	m	What's the point? I'll just get the  same thing...
MILLER	m	Not acceptable. I want to know what's  causing those readings. If the crew  is dead, I want the bodies, I want  the crew found.
STARCK	m	I can reconfigure the scan for C-12,  amylase proteins.
MILLER	m	Do it. Dr. Weir...
WEIR	m	Yes.
MILLER	m	One of my men is down. I want to  know what happened to him.
COOPER	m	I told you. He was inside the Core...
COOPER	m	It was like... nothing was there...  and then Justin appeared and the  Core... became metal...
WEIR	m	No, he didn't.
COOPER	m	You weren't there. I saw it.
WEIR	m	Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you  really see, because what you're  describing is not physically  possible...
MILLER	m	Cooper! Enough!
MILLER	m	Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever  happened to him could happen to all  of us.
WEIR	m	I don't know what happened to Justin.
COOPER	m	I'm telling you, I saw it...
WEIR	m	What you saw could have been an  optical effect caused by gravitational  distortion.
COOPER	m	I know what I saw and it wasn't a  fucking "optical effect!"
MILLER	m	Hold on, what's this "gravitational  distortion?"
WEIR	m	It's possible that a burst of gravity  waves escaped from the Core,  distorting space-time. They could be  what hit the Lewis and Clark.
MILLER	m	What could cause them? What's in the Core?
WEIR	m	It's complicated...
MILLER	m	How much time do you need? We have  seventeen hours and forty-two minutes.  Now: what is in the Core?
WEIR	m	A black hole.
WEIR	m	That's how the gravity drive works,  you see: it focuses the black hole's  immense gravitational power to create  the gateway. That's how the Event  Horizon travels faster than light.
STARCK	m	I can't believe we built this.
MILLER	m	It's insane.
WEIR	m	"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought  to be posted to this ship. It would  take the Lewis and Clark a thousand  years to reach our closest star. The  Event Horizon could be there in a  day...
MILLER	m	If it worked.
WEIR	m	If it worked, yes.
MILLER	m	I want this room sealed. The Second  Containment is off limits.
WEIR	m	There's no danger. The black hole is  contained behind three magnetic  fields, it's under control.
MILLER	m	Your black hole damn near ripped my  ship apart. It may have killed one  of my men. No one goes near that thing.
PETERS	m	Justin...?
DENNY	m	Mommy...
DJ 	m	Peters?
DJ	m	What's wrong?
PETERS	m	Nothing. It's nothing.
COOPER	m	You been out there a long time. Trying  to break my record?
SMITH	m	I'd rather spend the next twelve  hours Outside than another five  minutes in this can. This ship is  bad. It watches you.
COOPER	m	What?
SMITH	m	You heard me. This ship, it's crazy:  trying to go faster'n light, that's  like the Tower of Babel.
COOPER	m	Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical  on me.
SMITH	m	You know what happened to the Tower  of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
COOPER	m	You're sucking too much nitrogen in  your mix.
STARCK	m	Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
WEIR	m	Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved  the Event Horizon more than I loved  her. I told her that wasn't true, I  just knew the Event Horizon better,  that's all.
STARCK	m	Claire is your wife?
WEIR	m	Yes.
STARCK	m	It must be hard, being so far away  from her.
WEIR	m	Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years  now.
STARCK	m	I'm sorry.
WEIR	m	These things happen. Wait a minute, that's not right...
MILLER	m	You have something, Dr. Weir?
WEIR	m	The date.
MILLER	m	What about it?
WEIR	m	The Event Horizon's computer think's  it's 2034.
MILLER	m	It's 2041...
WEIR	m	Exactly. The ship's internal clock  is off by seven years.
STARCK	m	Maybe a power interruption crashed  the system...
WEIR	m	No, there's no evidence of a surge  or spike of any kind. It's as if  time just... stopped for seven years.
MILLER	m	Explanation?
WEIR	m	Intense gravitational fields effect  the passage of time, it's possible... Black holes make sense on paper,  it's all math, you see, but as to  what really happened... The Event Horizon has passed beyond  our plane of reality, and like  Lazarus, returned from the dead.
PETERS 	m	Captain Miller, Dr. Weir? I found  the final log entry.
KILPACK 	?	We have reached safe distance and  are preparing to engage the gravity  drive and open the gateway...
PETERS	m	The speaker is the mission  commander...
WEIR	m	John Kilpack.
KILPACK 	?	When you get this message, God  willing, we will reach the solar  system of Proxima Centauri...
MILLER	m	I wonder if they ever made it.
KILPACK	?	I just want to say how proud I am of  my crew. I'd like to name my station  heads Chris Chambers, Janice Rubin,  Dick Smith, Tom Fender and Stacie  Collins. And to Bill Weir and all  the scientists that got us here.
KILPACK	?	I... uh, I had something historic to  say, and I wrote it down but I... I  can't find it. Ave, atque, vale.  Hail and farewell.
MILLER	m	What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
WEIR	m	I don't know.
PETERS	m	I can run the image through a series  of filters, try to clean it up.
MILLER	m	Do it.
PETERS	m	What's happening...?
DJ	m	A power drain --
MILLER	m	We barely have enough power for life  support as it is, if we can't stop  the drain, we're not gonna make it.
WEIR	m	The Core...!
MILLER	m	Wait!
MILLER	m	The rest of you, stay here, I don't  want anyone else going near that  thing.
MILLER	m	No radiation. What's causing the  drain?
WEIR	m	The magnetic fields are holding.  Maybe a short in the fail-safe  circuit. I'll check it out.
MILLER	m	We don't get the power back, our  air's gonna go bad.
WEIR	m	Check the Core for radiation. Carbon  dioxide may be the least of our  worries.
WEIR	m	E-three... E-five... E-seven... where  are you...
STARCK	m	What the hell...
STARCK	m	Skipper, the bio-scan just went off  the scale...
DJ	m	Justin! Can you hear me? Justin!
JUSTIN	m	THE DARK IS COMING...
WEIR	m	There you are.
WEIR	m	Um. Captain Miller? I, uh, I seem to  have a problem with my light.
WEIR	m	Captain Miller?
VOICE	m	Billy.
CLAIRE 	f	Billy. Help me. I'm so cold.
MILLER	m	We just lost all power in here. Dr.  Weir...?
BURNING MAN	m	Don't leave me...
WEIR	m	Claire...?
CLAIRE 	f	Help me. I'm so cold.
CLAIRE	f	So cold.
DJ	m	Carbon dioxide poisoning produces  hallucinations, impaired judgement...
MILLER	m	Goddammit, DJ, it was not a  hallucination! I saw a man, he was  on fire. And then he disappeared.
STARCK	m	Maybe one of the original crew?
MILLER	m	No. It was someone else.
STARCK	m	Who?
MILLER	m	Dr. Weir, you were right there, you  must have heard something, seen  something...
WEIR	m	No. I saw nothing.
PETERS	m	I did.
PETERS	m	About an hour ago. In medical. I saw  my son. He was lying on one of the  examination tables and his legs  were...
WEIR	m	Isn't it possible that you were  traumatized by finding the body on  the bridge?
PETERS	m	I've seen bodies before. This is  different.
MILLER	m	Peters is right. Its like something  reaching into your mind. Seeing your  thoughts and making them real. Smith,  did you or Cooper experience anything  unusual?
SMITH	m	I didn't see anything and I don't  have to see anything. This ship is  fucked.
WEIR	m	Thank you for that scientific  analysis, Mister Smith.
SMITH	m	Hey! You don't need to be a scientist  figure it out...
MILLER	m	Smith...
SMITH	m	...you break all the laws of physics,  you think there won't be a price?  You already killed the first crew...
MILLER	m	That's enough!
MILLER	m	DJ!!
DJ	m	I'm sorry, I... I don't know why I  did that.
WEIR	m	Carbon dioxide.
SMITH	m	He's fucking lying, you know  something...!
MILLER	m	That's it, that's enough for one  day, Smith! I need you back on the  Clark, I need you calm, I need you  using your head, you make a mistake  out there, none of are getting home,  you understand?
SMITH	m	Sir.
MILLER	m	Get outside, go back to work. I'll  join you shortly.
MILLER	m	We're a long way from home and we're  in a bad place. Let's not make it  worse. If anyone has any constructive  suggestions, now is the time.
WEIR	m	I think I can stabilize the fields  around the singularity, that should  prevent another power drain.
MILLER	m	Do it.
DJ	m	To conserve our oxygen, we should  severely restrict our activity. Anyone  who can should get some sleep.
MILLER	m	I don't need sleep, DJ. I need  answers.
STARCK	m	Miller...
MILLER	m	What is it, Starck?
STARCK	m	...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA  filter. The results were bio-readings  of indeterminate origin...
MILLER	m	"...bio-readings of indeterminate  origin," don't you have anything  useful to tell me?
STARCK	m	I've got a theory.
MILLER	m	Go ahead.
STARCK	m	There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw  what you saw. We picked up a similar  readings right before the Clarke was  damaged. What if there were a  connection between the two? The  gravity waves, the hallucination,  all part of an defensive reaction,  like an immune system...
MILLER	m	I don't need to hear this.
STARCK	m	You've got to listen...
MILLER	m	To what? What are you saying? This  ship is alive?
STARCK	m	I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened  to you, the ship is reacting to us...
MILLER	m	We're hanging on by our fingernails  and you're giving me bullshit  stories...
STARCK	m	It's not bullshit, it's the only  conclusion the data supports...
MILLER	m	Starck, do you know how crazy that  sounds? It's impossible.
STARCK	m	I know that.
MILLER	m	If you knew it was impossible, then  why'd you waste my time?
STARCK	m	I thought you wanted an answer. And  that's the only one I have.
MILLER	m	What I want is to survive the next  ten hours.
STARCK	m	Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
MILLER	m	I'm going outside to work on the  Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone  what you just told me. We've got  enough to worry about.
PETERS	m	Justin...?
PETERS	m	Justin!
DJ	m	What's wrong?
PETERS	m	You didn't hear it? You must have  heard it!
STARCK	m	Heard what?
PETERS	m	Oh... nothing...
DJ	m	Sit down...
PETERS	m	Stop it! Stop it!
DJ	m	What is it?
STARCK	m	What are you doing?
WEIR	m	It wants me. I have to go.
STARCK	m	No...!
STARCK	m	In our current environment, Dr. Weir,  self-control is an asset.
WEIR	m	I'm alright. Please.
STARCK	m	What is it?
WEIR	m	The forward airlock.
STARCK	m	Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in  the airlock?
MILLER 	m	That's a negative, Starck.
PETERS	m	Justin.
PETERS	m	Justin, no!
COOPER	m	We'll have to re-route through the  port conduit to the APU.
SMITH	m	What about the accumulator...?
STARCK 	m	Miller, come in...
MILLER	m	What's going on in there, Starck?
STARCK 	m	Justin's in the airlock.
MILLER 	m	What?
STARCK	m	He's awake, he's in the airlock,  he's not wearing a suit.
MILLER	m	Stay here! Don't stop working!
COOPER	m	But Justin...
MILLER	m	I'll get him.
STARCK	m	He's engaged the override.
PETERS	m	Can you shut it down?
STARCK	m	I'll try. DJ, you better get your  bag of tricks.
PETERS	m	Justin! Open the door!
PETERS	m	Open the door!
MILLER	m	I'm on my way, Starck.
STARCK 	m	You better hurry. He's engaged the  override, we can't open the inner  door.
PETERS	m	The door, Justin! Open the door!
JUSTIN	m	Did you hear it?
PETERS	m	Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
STARCK	m	Keep him talking.
PETERS	m	Do you know what it was?
JUSTIN	m	It gets inside you. It shows you  things... horrible things...
JUSTIN	m	...can't describe it... there are no  words...
PETERS 	m	What, Justin, what shows you?
JUSTIN 	m	It won't stop, it goes on and on and  on...
PETERS 	m	What does?
JUSTIN 	m	The dark inside me.
JUSTIN 	m	...It's inside and it eats and eats  until there's nothing left.
PETERS 	m	"The dark inside..."? I don't  understand.
JUSTIN 	m	From the Other Place...
JUSTIN	m	The other crew, they're there, they're  waiting for me. They're waiting for  you. I won't go back there... I  won't...
PETERS	m	Justin, look at me. Look at me. Open  this door.
STARCK	m	I don't think she can talk him down.  We need a sedative.
DJ	m	If he opens the outer door he'll  turn inside-out.
STARCK	m	Almost got it.
PETERS 	m	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
JUSTIN	m	If you could see the things I've  seen, you wouldn't try to stop me.  You'd come with me.
COMPUTER	m	Stand-by for decompression. Thirty  seconds...
JUSTIN	m	Hey, Mama-Bear... what are doing...?
JUSTIN	m	Oh my god OH MY GOD...
PETERS	m	Starck!
STARCK	m	I can't! The inner door can't open  once the outer door has been  triggered, it would decompress the  entire ship!
JUSTIN	m	You gotta open, you gotta stop it,  please...
PETERS	m	We have to do something, oh God...
STARCK	m	Skipper, Justin just activated the  door. It's on a thirty second delay...
MILLER	m	Patch me through to him.
MILLER 	m	Justin.
JUSTIN	m	Skipper, you gotta help me...
COMPUTER	m	Twenty seconds.
JUSTIN	m	...tell them to open the door...
MILLER 	m	They can't do that Justin, now listen  carefully...
JUSTIN	m	...I don't want to die...!
MILLER	m	You're not going to die! Not today!  I want you to do exactly as I say  and I'm gonna get you out of there,  alright?
JUSTIN	m	But I can't... I gotta get out of  here... Skipper, please...
MILLER	m	Justin. I won't let you die.
JUSTIN	m	Okay... okay...
MILLER	m	Tuck yourself into a crouched  position, shut your eyes as tight as  you can!
STARCK	m	Five seconds.
MILLER	m	Exhale everything you got, Baby Bear,  we can't have any air in those lungs,  blow it all out...
JUSTIN	m	Oh god --
PETERS	m	Oh God... Justin...
PETERS	m	I've got a pulse, he's alive...
DJ	m	Pressure?
PETERS	m	90 over 50 and falling... .
DJ	m	He's crashing...
DJ	m	He can breathe. That's good. Let's  get him to Medical, go, go!
DJ 	m	Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the  nitrogen out of his blood...
PETERS 	m	His peritoneum has ruptured...
DJ 	m	One thing at a time, let's keep him  breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's  fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding  out...
DJ	m	He'll live... if we ever make it  back.
MILLER	m	We'll make it.
STARCK	m	CO2 levels will reach toxic levels  in four hours.
MILLER	m	Peters. We need to know what happened  to the crew. Before it happens to  us.
PETERS	m	I'll get back to the log. But on the  bridge, I won't go back, back in  there...
MILLER	m	Thanks.
STARCK	m	Justin said something about, "The  dark inside me..." What did he mean?
WEIR	m	It means nothing.
MILLER	m	Is that your "expert opinion?" The  only answer we've had out of you is  "I don't know."
WEIR	m	Justin just tried to kill himself.  The man is clearly insane.
DJ	m	How would you explain your own  behavior?
WEIR	m	What?
STARCK	m	On the bridge. You said "it" wanted  you.
WEIR	m	I said that?
DJ	m	Yes. You did.
WEIR	m	I don't remember saying that. Maybe I'm insane, too.
MILLER	m	I want to know what caused that noise.  I want to know why one of my crew  tried to throw himself out of the  airlock.
WEIR	m	Thermal changes in the hull could  have caused the metal to expand and  contract very suddenly, causing  reverberations --
MILLER	m	That's bullshit and you know it! You  built this fucking ship and all I've  heard from you is bullshit!
WEIR	m	What do you want me to say?
MILLER	m	You said this ship creates a  gateway...
WEIR	m	Yes...
MILLER	m	To what? Where did this ship go?  Where did you send it?
WEIR	m	I don't know...
MILLER	m	Where has it been for the past seven  years?
WEIR	m	I don't know...
MILLER	m	The "Other Place," what is that...?
WEIR	m	I DON'T KNOW!
MILLER	m	That's exactly what we don't have,  Doctor.
VOICE 	m	Don't leave me...!
MILLER 	m	Any change?
DJ	m	No. No change. I've analyzed Justin's blood samples.  There's no evidence of excessive  levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything  else out of ordinary.
MILLER	m	Of course not. Justin just climbed  into the airlock because he felt  like it. Just one of those things. I swore I'd never lose another man.  I came close today. Real close.
DJ	m	"Another man?" Who?
MILLER	m	It was on the Goliath. There was  this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a  lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick,  from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught  when the pressure doors sealed, one  closed on his arm. Severed it at the  wrist. The pain of that must have  been... He passed out and...
MILLER	m	I, I tried to go back for him, to  save him, but I couldn't get to him  in time. The fire... Have you ever  seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like  a liquid, it slides over everything.  It was like a wave breaking over  him, a wave of fire. And then he was  gone. I never told anyone until now. But  this ship knew, DJ. It knows about  the Goliath, it knows about Corrick.  It knows our secrets. It knows what  we're afraid of. And now you're going to tell me it's  carbon dioxide.
DJ	m	No.
MILLER	m	What is it?
DJ	m	I've been listening to the  transmission. And I think Houston  made a mistake in the translation.
MILLER	m	Go on.
DJ	m	They thought it said, "Liberatis  me," "Save me," but it's not "me."  It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
MILLER	m	It's not a distress call. It's a  warning.
DJ	m	It gets worse.
DJ	m	It's very hard to make out, but listen  to this final part.
DJ	m	Do you hear it? Right there.
MILLER	m	Hear what?
DJ	m	It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex,"  from; "infera," the ablative case of  "inferi." "Hell."
MILLER	m	"Save yourself. From Hell." What are you saying, are you saying  that this ship is possessed?
DJ	m	No. I don't believe in that sort of  thing. But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship  has passed beyond the boundaries of  our universe, of reality. Who knows  where this ship has been... What  it's seen... And what it's brought back with it.
COOPER 	m	Captain Miller, we're ready to  repressurize the Clark.
MILLER	m	On my way.
MILLER	m	Alright, Cooper.
COOPER	m	Cross your fingers.
SMITH 	m	It's holding... She's holding...!
COOPER 	m	We're still venting trace gasses,  gimme twenty minutes to plug the  hole.
MILLER	m	You got it, Coop.
MILLER	m	Back in business.
PETERS	m	You got any coffee?
STARCK	m	It's cold.
PETERS	m	I don't care.
PETERS	m	Starck...
PETERS	m	Sweet Jesus. Miller... MILLER!
KILPACK	?	Liberatis tutemet ex infera...
MILLER	m	We're leaving.
WEIR	m	You can't, your orders are specific...
MILLER	m	"...to rescue the crew and salvage  the ship." The crew is dead, Dr.  Weir. This ship killed them. And now  it's killing us.
WEIR	m	You're insane. You've lost your mind.
MILLER	m	Maybe you're right. But it's still  my command, and I have leeway to  abort when I feel there is an  unacceptable threat to my crew. And  I think there is. Starck, download all the files from  the Event Horizon's computers. Coop,  Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers  back onto the Clark.
WEIR	m	Don't... don't do this...
MILLER	m	It's done.
SMITH	m	What's going on, sweethearts?
PETERS	m	CO2 scrubbers for the Clark. Miller  pulled the plug on the mission.
SMITH	m	About goddam time.
WEIR	m	What about my ship?
MILLER	m	We will take the Lewis and Clark to  a safe distance and then launch tac  missiles at the Event Horizon until  I am satisfied that she has been  destroyed. Fuck this ship.
WEIR	m	You... You can't do that!
MILLER	m	Watch me.
WEIR	m	You can't kill her, I won't let you!  I lost her once, I will not lose her  again...!
STARCK 	m	Miller, come in ...
MILLER	m	Starck, what the hell is going on?
STARCK	m	We just lost main power again.
MILLER	m	Goddammit! Starck, get those files  and vacate. I want off this ship.
WEIR	m	You can't leave. She won't let you.
MILLER	m	Just get your gear back onto the  Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll  find yourself looking for a ride  home.
WEIR 	m	I am home.
MILLER	m	Weir? WEIR!
MILLER	m	All hands. Dr. Weir is missing. I  want him found and restrained.
SMITH	m	Let's go, let's go, this place freaks  me out...
PETERS	m	Last one.
PETERS	m	Denny?
PETERS	m	Smith.
DENNY 	m	Mommy...
PETERS	m	Denny...?
MILLER	m	Thank you.
SMITH 	m	Captain, we got a problem.
MILLER	m	Now what?
SMITH	m	She was right behind me, I turn  around, she's gone. She could be  anywhere.
MILLER	m	Alright. Prep the Clark for launch.  I'll find her.
PETERS	m	Denny? Denny, come to Mommy...
PETERS	m	Hold on, Denny, Mommy's coming...
PETERS	m	Denny?
PETERS	m	Denny...?
DENNY	m	Mommy...
PETERS	m	You can walk... Denny, you can walk...  oh, my baby...
DENNY	m	Wanna show you, Mommy, wanna show  you something...
PETERS	m	Denny...
WEIR	m	I won't. I won't leave. This is my  ship.
WEIR	m	Oh no. Peters...?
WEIR	m	Why did you do that? You didn't have  to do that...
CLAIRE 	f	Billy.
COOPER	m	Solid as a rock. Hey, Smith...
COOPER 	m	Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm  coming in.
SMITH	m	Roger that.
SMITH	m	Dr. Weir! Hey, get your ass back on  board! Dr. Weir!
SMITH	m	Skipper, come in...
SMITH 	m	Skipper...
MILLER	m	What is it, Smith?
SMITH 	m	I just saw Weir, I think he was  messing around on the Clark.
MILLER	m	Smith, get out of there...
SMITH 	m	Come again, Skipper?
MILLER	m	One of the explosives is missing  from the corridor. I think Weir may  have put it on the Clark.
MILLER 	m	Get off the Clark now and wait for  me at the airlock.
SMITH	m	No, no, we just got her back  together...
MILLER 	m	Get out of there now!
SMITH	m	Where is it, where is it...
MILLER	m	Smith? Smith! Fuck!
SMITH	m	I gotcha... I gotcha...
SMITH	m	I gotcha.
MILLER	m	NOOO!
MILLER	m	DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper  are dead.
DJ	m	What happened?
MILLER 	m	Weir. He used one of the explosives  from the Corridor.
MILLER	m	DJ, you read me?
MILLER 	m	DJ? DJ, come in...
MILLER	m	Peters...
MILLER 	m	Peters, are you there?
MILLER	m	Starck, do you read me? Starck...?
WEIR 	m	I told you... She won't let you  leave...
MILLER	m	Son of a bitch!
MILLER	m	Oh my God.
DJ	m	Please...
MILLER	m	Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do
DJ	m	Please... kill...
MILLER	m	Oh God...
MILLER	m	Weir.
MILLER	m	Hold on... Get you outta these...
MILLER	m	Your eyes...
WEIR	m	I don't need them anymore. Where  we're going, we won't need eyes to  see.
MILLER	m	What are you talking about?
WEIR	m	Do you know what a singularity is,  Miller? Does your mind truly fathom  what a black hole is? It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal  NOTHING. And if God is Everything,  then I have seen the Devil. It's a liberating experience.
COMPUTER	m	Gravity drive primed. Do you wish to  engage?
MILLER	m	What are you doing?
COMPUTER	m	Gravity drive engaged. Activation in  T-minus ten minutes.
MILLER	m	If you miss me, you'll blow out the  hull. You'll die too.
WEIR	m	What makes you think I'll miss?
STARCK 	m	Don't leave me!
STARCK	m	Please... help, help me...
MILLER	m	Give me your hand! Your hand!
MILLER	m	The forward airlock.
STARCK	m	Weir can't be alive.
MILLER	m	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't  Weir.
MILLER	m	Stay behind me.
STARCK	m	Cooper!
COOPER	m	Let me breathe, let me breathe...
STARCK	m	You're okay now, it's over...
MILLER	m	It's not over. It's just starting.
MILLER	m	Weir activated the drive. He's sending  us to the Other Place.
STARCK	m	We've got to shut it down, we've got  to...
COOPER	m	How? The Bridge is gone.
STARCK	m	There must be a way! What about  Engineering?
COOPER	m	Can you shut it down?
STARCK	m	I don't know the process, Dr. Weir  was the expert...
COOPER	m	I don't want to go where the last  crew went. I'd rather be dead.
MILLER	m	BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
STARCK	m	Blow it up?
MILLER	m	We blow the Corridor. Use the  foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it  from the rest of the ship. We stay  put...
COOPER	m	...and the gravity drive goes where  no man has gone before.
MILLER	m	You prep the gravity couches. I'm  going to manually arm those  explosives.
COOPER	m	Will it work?
MILLER	m	It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
STARCK	m	I'll do it --
MILLER	m	No. I'll be right back.
MILLER	m	Close it behind me. Just in case.
STARCK	m	Don't be long.
COOPER	m	I'm gonna activate the emergency  beacon.
STARCK	m	Hurry.
STARCK	m	Cooper...!
COOPER	m	Starck?
COOPER	m	What...?
STARCK	m	Run!
MILLER	m	We're armed. This fucker's ready to  blow...
MILLER 	m	...repeat, we're armed...
STARCK	m	Miller, he's back, he was in the  tank...
MILLER	m	Slow down, Starck, I can't understand  you, who was in the tank?
STARCK 	m	You have to get back here now, he's  out there now, if he finds you...
MILLER	m	Who? Who?
STARCK 	m	Weir.
MILLER	m	He's dead...
MILLER	m	You're dead, I saw you die.
WEIR	m	Weir is dead.
MILLER	m	Then who the fuck are you?
WEIR	m	Your fear. Do you remember the  Goliath, Miller?
BURNING MAN	m	Do you remember me?
MILLER	m	Corrick...
BURNING MAN	m	You left me behind.
MILLER	m	That's not true...
BURNING MAN	m	I begged you. I begged you to save  me and you did nothing. You stood  there and watched me burn...
MILLER	m	SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
BURNING MAN 	m	Don't leave me!
MILLER	m	You're not Edmund Corrick.
MILLER	m	What are you?
WEIR	m	You know.
MILLER	m	You want me to believe you're the  Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
WEIR	m	I'm not the Devil.
MILLER	m	Then what, what are you? Tell me...
WEIR	m	Better if I just show you.
MILLER	m	NO!
MILLER	m	You can't have them!
WEIR	m	I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much  older. I watched the Beginning and I  will see the End. I am the dark behind  the stars. I am the dark inside you  all.
MILLER	m	...not the Devil...
WEIR	m	There is no Devil. There is no God.  There is only... NOTHING.
MILLER	m	You're lying...!
WEIR	m	I'm not asking you to believe me.  You'll see for yourself... and so  will your crew. You're all coming  with me.
MILLER	m	Starck... Cooper...
WEIR	m	They are mine. And so are you...
MILLER	m	You can't have them. Go to hell.
WEIR	m	NOOO!
STARCK	m	Miller...
COOPER	m	It's over, hush now, it's over...
