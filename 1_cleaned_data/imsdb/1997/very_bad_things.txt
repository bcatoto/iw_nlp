MOORE	m	That ought to be about the end of  that.
FISHER	m	Yup.
ANNOUNCER 	f	"The Oakland Raiders have taken a 7 -  6 lead in a, tough, football game  and this crowd is standing..."
ANNOUNCER 	f	"Hang on to your hats, here come the  Steelers out of the Huddle..."
ANNOUNCER 	f	"It comes down to one big play, 4th  down, ten yards to go. Terry Bradshaw  at the controls..."
ANNOUNCER 	f	"And Bradshaw, back and  looking...Again, Bradshaw running  out of the pocket... Looking for  someone to throw to..."
ANNOUNCER 	f	...Bradshaw fires it down the field  and there's a collision!..."
ANNOUNCER 	f	"...and it's caught out of the air!  The ball is pulled in by Franco  Harris!"
ANNOUNCER 	f	Franco Harris running for the end  zone, all but home..."
LIZ	f	This is ridiculous.
FISHER	m	Government cutbacks.
LIZ	f	Why can't we do it through the mail?
FISHER	m	We missed the deadline.
LIZ	f	Can't we do it on the phone?
FISHER	m	I don't think so.
LIZ	f	Why is this Kid staring at me?
FISHER	m	I'm not sure.
LIZ	f	Did you send in all of the deposit  checks?
FISHER	m	I think so.
LIZ	f	What do you mean, you think so?
FISHER	m	I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure  what all of them are.
LIZ	f	The wedding cake check?
FISHER	m	Sent it.
LIZ	f	Photographer?
FISHER	m	Sent it.
LIZ	f	Florist?
FISHER	m	Yup.
LIZ	f	Caterer?
FISHER	m	Yes.
LIZ	f	Hotel for my parents, the tent, the  band, the Judge...
FISHER	m	I think I forgot the tent.
LIZ	f	You forgot the tent?
FISHER	m	I think so.
LIZ	f	Why?
FISHER	m	Why what?
LIZ	f	Why did you forget the tent check?
FISHER	m	I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
LIZ	f	You can't play around with these  tent people.
FISHER	m	I'm not playing around. I forgot.
LIZ	f	What else have you forgot?
FISHER	m	How could I know what else I forgot?
LIZ	f	I'm working my ass off here. I've  taken care of absolutely everything  Keith.
FISHER	m	Because you wanted to. You wanted  this to be your wedding not your  parent's.
LIZ	f	Don't you dare.
FISHER	m	What?
LIZ	f	Don't you put this on me. Don't do  it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
FISHER	m	Stop it. I'm sorry.
LIZ	f	You know how important this is to my  mother. You know that.
FISHER	m	I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the  tent. I don't think I forgot anything  else.
LIZ	f	I bet you didn't forget the bachelor  party checks.
FISHER	m	Are we going to do this again?
LIZ	f	I'm just saying I bet those checks  all found the mailboxes.
FISHER	m	I wouldn't know.
LIZ	f	It amazes me how organized you and  your little fun bunch can be when it  comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
FISHER	m	They organized this, not me. I have  nothing to do with it.
LIZ	f	Well it's bad timing.
FISHER	m	How do you figure?
LIZ	f	Right before the wedding?
FISHER	m	It's a bachelor party. You sort of  have to do it before the wedding.
LIZ	f	I suppose Boyd is the creative force  behind all this.
FISHER	m	He is.
LIZ	f	He's a moron.
FISHER	m	He's my friend. He's not a moron.
LIZ	f	David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
BOYD	m	David Boyd. Tina. Great. Okay. Here's  the deal, we're talking five guys.  Hard Rock. Nice guys Tina. My friends.  Yeah. I'm calling you directly so  you don't have to go through the  agency...
MAN	m	We're just trying to sneak a peak.
BOYD	m	Just stay off the property until I'm  off the phone.
MAN	m	Why?
BOYD	m	Cause that's the way they do it.
BOYD	m	So it's five guys, Hard Rock Casino.  Nine hundred bucks and you do the  thing with the rubber hoses. Are you  in? Tina, are you in? Good.
BOYD	m	David Boyd, nice to meet you.
LIZ	f	Why do you feel the need to explore  this side of your personality?
FISHER	m	What are you talking about?
LIZ	f	I'm talking about the kind of people  you hang out with... about growing  up, assuming responsibility of  yourself.
FISHER	m	I asked you to marry me. I'm ready  for marriage. That's responsibility.  That's growth.
LIZ	f	I just think that at some point you're  going to have to re-evaluate some of  your friendships...
FISHER	m	Who else?
LIZ	f	Charles Moore for instants.
FISHER	m	You don't like Moore? Since when?
LIZ	f	It's not that I don't like him. But  the wedding has really got me thinking  and... I just keep myself opening  up. Growning. And I want you keeping  up with me here.
FISHER	m	What does Moore have to do with your  growing?
LIZ	f	I just don't see him in the big  picture.
FISHER	m	I've known him since Cub Scouts.
LIZ	f	He's weird.
FISHER	m	He's quiet.
LIZ	f	He's weird.
FISHER	m	He just doesn't talk a lot.
LIZ	f	Why? What's his problem?
FISHER	m	He's a great chef.
LIZ	f	He's weird. And I expect more from  you.
FISHER	m	You expect more what?
LIZ	f	You're going to be hungover for three  days. Like those guys on "Oprah"  that get drunk and have disgusting  sex with prostitutes and then say  their vows with the stench of cheap  hotel whore sex all over them.
FISHER	m	Time out.
LIZ	f	It's vile!
FISHER	m	That's absurd.
LIZ	f	I've seen it on television.
FISHER	m	I'm not going to marry you with the  smell of prostitutes on my body.
LIZ	f	I am not common Keith. I am not  common. I am a creature like no other  and I will not be commoned! Is that  to much to ask? Is that to much to ask!?!
FISHER	m	You will not be common!!!
LIZ	f	Marriage license please.
LIZ	f	Do you love me?
FISHER	m	Of course.
LIZ	f	How much?
FISHER	m	With all my heart.
LIZ	f	Kiss me...?
MICHAEL	m	That's just insecurity.
FISHER	m	I don't know. She's really been  stressing out.
MICHAEL	m	Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut  splinters.
FISHER	m	What does that mean?
MICHAEL	m	It means she's insecure.
FISHER	m	About what?
MICHAEL	m	Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5  for 6. At 29.83 at 9. I'm amazed the windows don't blow  out of their fucking sockets with  all the repressed, ass-puckering  rage in these soul-less lizards.
FISHER	m	I just want her to be happy.
MICHAEL	m	Same alarm clock every morning, same  two pops on the same snooze button... Michael Brenn. Yes... Yes... Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321  at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at
FISHER	m	I'm not breathing right.
MICHAEL	m	You're not breathing right?
FISHER	m	Lately I'll just start getting  lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I  haven't breathed in like two minutes.
ADAM	m	We're leaving from my house in three  hours. If you want to come, get your  numbers in order by then.
MICHAEL	m	First of all...
ADAM	m	No first of all. I'm not in a game  mood.
MICHAEL	m	You're interrupting a personal  conversation.
ADAM	m	Sorry Fish.
FISHER	m	We'll be ready Adam.
ADAM	m	I know you'll be. Three hours.
MICHAEL	m	I don't care for him.
FISHER	m	He's your brother.
MICHAEL	m	So?
FISHER	m	Keith Fisher.
LIZ	f	We've got problems here.
FISHER	m	Problems?
LIZ	f	Seating problems.
FISHER	m	Okay.
LIZ	f	Keith do not trivialize this.
FISHER	m	I'm not. What's the problem?
LIZ	f	We're supposed to have gold-trimmed  padded seats, now they're telling me  that there was a mistake and we can't  have padded.
FISHER	m	What kind of seats can we have?
LIZ	f	Not padded ones.
FISHER	m	So what do we do?
LIZ	f	You go down there.
FISHER	m	Go down where?
LIZ	f	Go down to the seat place and  straighten this out.
FISHER	m	Honey I don't have the time...
LIZ	f	I need your help.
FISHER	m	We're leaving in three hours.
LIZ	f	I need your help.
FISHER	m	I'll call them from the road.
LIZ	f	Do you love me?
FISHER	m	More than I ever imagined being able  to love anyone ever.
LIZ	f	Take care of those chairs.
FISHER	m	We're leaving from Adam's. Come send  me off.
LIZ	f	Maybe.
LOIS	?	Notice how clean and well-behaved  they all appear, respectable members  of modern society. Timmy, Adam Jr.,  take a good look at this...
LOIS	?	...We will compare these before photos  with whatever form of degeneration  presented to us in 24 hours, no matter  how low, how vile...
LIZ	f	...embarrassing, shameful...
LOIS	?	...regression of Modern Man to his  most primitive, ape-like state...
LIZ	f	The stone age.
LOIS	?	The post-Vegas Man.
LIZ	f	A mutant species.
LOIS	?	Okay boys, smile!
LOIS	?	All right. As you were.
LIZ	f	Will you please call the chair people?
FISHER	m	I will.
LIZ	f	Do you love me?
FISHER	m	Of course.
LIZ	f	Just call and let me know that your  okay.
FISHER	m	I love you.
LIZ	f	Have a nice bachelor party.
ADAM	m	Not on your life.
BOYD	m	You're a fucking moron.
MICHAEL	m	It's my fucking opinion.
ADAM	m	It's really a stupid opinion. You  have developed an annoying habit of  talking for what seems to be no other  reason than to hear yourself speak.
MICHAEL	m	Because my opinion threatens yours,  it's poorly developed?
ADAM	m	No, because your opinions are idiotic  and have nothing to do with what any  given conversation is about, which  makes 85% of your eagerly injected  thought process highly offensive to  me.
MICHAEL	m	Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
BOYD	m	The hell I did!
MICHAEL	m	The hell you didn't!
BOYD	m	The hell I did!
MICHAEL	m	You said one in two marriages end in  divorce.
BOYD	m	I never heard that.
FISHER	m	You said that Boyd.
BOYD	m	Well, I didn't mean it.
MICHAEL	m	You're an asshole Adam.
ADAM	m	You're an asshole.
MICHAEL	m	Oh, and why am I an asshole?
ADAM	m	Multiple reasons.
MICHAEL	m	Name one.
ADAM	m	I don't have to...
FISHER	m	SHUT UP!
FISHER	m	Is this Pico Party rents? Can I speak  to whomever is in charge of chairs?  Chairs.
BOYD	m	Four hours and fifteen minutes. I  can make Vegas in 3 and change.
ADAM	m	I'm not getting a ticket.
FISHER	m	Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're  doing my wedding and I'm calling  about the chair situation. Yeah,  I'll hold.
BOYD	m	Who's up for making some real money?
ADAM	m	Don't even start.
BOYD	m	You want to hear me out?
MICHAEL	m	Nope.
BOYD	m	Moore?
MOORE	m	No I don't.
BOYD	m	Fish?
FISHER	m	Not really. Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
BOYD	m	Prison Communication Systems. An acquaintance friend of mine is  professionally involved with a  communications outfit in Denver that  I just happen to know for a fact is  about to be rewarded a very large,  exclusive contract to rewire every  state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
FISHER	m	No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs.  Keith Fisher. Okay.
BOYD	m	That would translate to government  guaranteed contract in excess of 35  million dollars.
FISHER	m	We need padded chairs.
BOYD	m	Or a stock kick of approximately  125% on shares which are currently  sitting around $4.38, or, in plain  English...
ADAM	m	SHUT UP!
MICHAEL	m	NO!
BOYD	m	What is wrong with you people? I'm a  helper here.
MOORE	m	Your investment ideas never work  out.
BOYD	m	That's the whole point. They rarely  work out. But on occasion they do.  And when they do, they do big.
MICHAEL	m	Your ideas never work out.
BOYD	m	Oh really? Starbucks?
ADAM	m	That's one idea.
FISHER	m	No... we want padded chairs... okay?
BOYD	m	One idea that if you had fucking  listened to, you would each be worth  approximately 15 million dollars.
ADAM	m	You can't keep bringing up Starbucks.  That was your only real hit in like  75 tries.
BOYD	m	I set up Fisher with the broker that  found his house. Took care of that  one, didn't I? Prison Communications.
MOORE	m	I don't think so Boyd.
BOYD	m	Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No  sir.
FISHER 	m	Yes, I was holding for Tony in chairs.  I have a chair problem. No, I'm not  Tony, I need to speak to Tony.
ADAM	m	All the bullshit aside Fish, we've  been coming up here for what, eight  years?
BOYD	m	More.
ADAM	m	Over eight years of some of the  hardest raging experiences of my  life.
MOORE	m	Good times.
MICHAEL	m	Drum banging real times.
FISHER	m	Real times.
ADAM	m	They've all been real times. And as  you prepare to enter into a new phase  of life, as you prepare for new roles;  father, husband, teacher, you will,  as I have, come to except the letting  go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing  will begin...
BOYD	m	But not tonight.
MOORE	m	Not tonight.
ADAM	m	Tonight we return once again to the  cave. Tonight we let the monsters  out. We fill ourselves with the  spirits of Genghis Kahn, Joe Namath,  JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
MICHAEL	m	Franco mother-fucking Harris!
MOORE	m	Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
BOYD	m	Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville,  Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson.  I dedicate this evening to fear and  to major loathing. So from sun set  to sun rise, let me be heard...
ALL	m	He who acts the beast, rids himself  of the pain of being a man!
LIZ 	f	Hello.
FISHER	m	Hi.
LIZ	f	Hi. Are you calling from jail?
FISHER 	m	Not yet.
LIZ	f	Well, the night is young. Did you  straighten out the chair situation?
FISHER 	m	I'm working on it, I've made three  calls. I can't stop thinking about how much  I love you.
LIZ	f	That's sweet.
FISHER 	m	Well I do.
LIZ	f	Well you should.
FISHER 	m	What are you doing?
LIZ	f	Just a bit of organizing.
FISHER 	m	Nesting?
LIZ	f	Yeah. Nesting.
FISHER 	m	I'm mad at you.
LIZ	f	Go have fun. Not too much.
FISHER 	m	I'll see you tomorrow...
BOYD	m	I don't hate women.
MICHAEL	m	You hate women.
BOYD	m	False.
MICHAEL	m	True.
BOYD	m	Not true.
MICHAEL	m	You have a King fantasy.
BOYD	m	I am a lover. In Africa, you can  stay king as long as you can service  your women every night.
MICHAEL	m	And what happens when you can't?
BOYD	m	New king.
ADAM	m	No. No. No. It's what my father said  to me. He said it and he meant it...  He said to me... He said, Adam, he  said... He told me and I heard him...  he said... Hell he said so many Goddamn things  I can't remember everything he said  for Christsake.
FISHER	m	Right! That's exactly what I'm saying.  My father said, first of all, I'm  your father not your friend. I'm  your father.
ADAM	m	Are you solid with that?
FISHER	m	No. I think it's fucked.
ADAM	m	Then fuck what your father said,  cause I'm gonna tell you right now...  You'll know what it's all about, why  you got married and why you love her  when you wake up at three in the  morning, and the streetlight's coming  through the window and it's just  catching a corner of her face, like  a sleeping angel. And her hair smells  sweet and she's your's. She's all  your's. Do you see where I'm going  here?
BOYD	m	If I'm the king of Israel, I say to  myself, King, I say to myself, King...  Take a good look around. What do I  see?
MICHAEL	m	Israel doesn't have a King.
BOYD	m	Then what do they have?
MICHAEL	m	They have a president. A Benjamin  Yahoo something.
BOYD	m	I say to myself, look at the map.  Look what's all around you. People  who wish bad bad things for you and  your people. For thousands of years  the Jews are fighting everybody. It  used to be they'd throw rocks, then  the iron revolution and they would  attack with spears. Then the gunpowder  revolution. Now they're shooting  fire power back and forth, all day  bullets flying, babies getting shot.
MICHAEL	m	What's your point?
BOYD	m	Now if I'm the King of Israel and  all these sand niggers are armed to  the gills and you know it's just a  matter of time... right? Am I right?
MICHAEL	m	The Israelis can protect themselves.  They got the Mossad thing happening.  Mossad's for real, man. They scalp  babies.
BOYD	m	There's my point exactly.
MICHAEL	m	What? What's your point?
BOYD	m	Take Mexico.
MICHAEL	m	What?
BOYD	m	Look up the chickens, dig up the  holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying  wall thing they bang their heads on  all day long, stick it all on a big  fucking tug boat. The whole country  picks up and takes Mexico.
FISHER	m	The bucks gonna stop right here. If my son doesn't know the six New  England states, if he has trouble  with geography, I won't stick it in  his face. I'll help the little guy.  I'll put him in the car and take him  out there. I'll take him to Maine  for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing  in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee  Stadium... I won't stare him down.
ADAM	m	Don't ever stare him down.
FISHER	m	I won't do it.
ADAM	m	Don't eyeball your kids.
BOYD	m	The Mexicans would love it. They're  dying for a little order down there.  They need direction.
MICHAEL	m	They need leadership.
BOYD	m	That's what I'm saying. Let the  Israelis straighten it up. They got  plenty of room down there, number  one. Plus, and this is just a plus,  they kind of look alike -- the Jews  and the Mexicans. So I think on a  whole your average Joe Mexican is  gonna have less of a problem getting  his head around the whole assimilation  thing. Am I right?
ADAM	m	I tell mine that they're little men.  I tell them they're strong. They  make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So  they really know that I need them  just as much. You know. Just as much  man. And you know, you're their  godfather...
FISHER	m	I know and I'm honored...
ADAM	m	If anything ever happens to me...
FISHER	m	I know...
ADAM	m	Y'see? That's the real point here.  That's what I'm driving for, when  the big storm comes and knocks down  all the forests and the rocks fall  down and the leave's are bare. What's  left? The little trees, the little  fellas that the storm didn't see.  The tiny little...
MOORE	m	The stripper's here.
ADAM	m	Excellent.
BOYD	m	Gentlemen, this is Tina.
TINA	f	Who's the lucky groom?
TINA	f	Hi Fisher.
MICHAEL	m	God, I love women.
BOYD	m	She's all your's Fish. Anything you  want. Happy bachelor party.
FISHER	m	I can't.
MICHAEL	m	I'll take a ride.
FISHER	m	Go for it.
MICHAEL	m	Come on.
TINA	f	You said just dancing.
BOYD	m	I'll take good care of you.
TINA	f	With him. Lucky me.
MOORE	m	She's fucking hot!
ADAM	m	I need a drink.
BOYD	m	Tequila...
TINA	f	Oh come on.
MICHAEL	m	I want to play.
TINA	f	It's gonna cost extra.
MICHAEL	m	I will pay.
TINA	f	Easy baby, easy.
MOORE	m	Cool.
MICHAEL	m	I really fucked up.
MOORE	m	Jesus.
ADAM	m	Don't touch her. Call 911.
MICHAEL	m	I was just playing... we were playing  just playing around.
ADAM	m	She's dead.
FISHER	m	No... No.
MOORE	m	How do you know she's dead.
ADAM	m	She's got no fucking pulse.
BOYD	m	You don't know what you're doing.
BOYD	m	Where do you look? What side of the  neck?
MOORE	m	Left side.
ADAM	m	Either side you idiot. I'm calling
FISHER	m	What happened? Oh my God...
MICHAEL	m	We were playing... she slipped...  she hit her head.
ADAM	m	Playing?
BOYD	m	Wait!
ADAM	m	What?
BOYD	m	What are you doing?
ADAM	m	What are you talking about?
BOYD	m	What do you think you are doing?
ADAM	m	I'm calling the ambulance.
BOYD	m	Just wait a second. Wait one second.  Okay. What are you doing?
ADAM	m	Calling the ambulance.
BOYD	m	Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling  an ambulance?
ADAM	m	We have to call the ambulance.
BOYD	m	Why?
FISHER	m	Oh, Jesus... call the police.
BOYD	m	No.
FISHER	m	She's dead. Call somebody!
BOYD	m	Shut up.
FISHER	m	Call 911.
BOYD	m	Shut up.
MICHAEL	m	She slipped.
ADAM	m	What did you do?
MICHAEL	m	You never heard of accidents?! Get  off me!
BOYD	m	Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
BOYD	m	Listen to me. Please. Everybody just  calm down a bit here. Okay... First...  are we sure she's dead?
ADAM	m	Her head's bashed in and her heart  isn't beating.
MOORE	m	She's dead.
MICHAEL	m	It was an accident!
BOYD	m	Are you sure this was an accident?
ADAM	m	You're a lying deviant. What did you  do?!
MICHAEL	m	The floor was wet. She slipped!
ADAM	m	Why was the floor wet?
MICHAEL	m	I don't know why the floor was wet!
ADAM	m	Why?!
BOYD	m	Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just  take a second here and take hold of  the situation, OK? Let's just review  our options here.
ADAM	m	We have a dead woman bleeding all  over the bathroom. What options?  Call the police.
BOYD	m	Call the police. Okay, that's one  option.
ADAM	m	That is not an "option." There is no  multiple choice here.
BOYD	m	Yes sir, there sure is an option  here. There are always options.
MOORE	m	I've never seen a dead person.
FISHER	m	Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
BOYD	m	Well we can definitely call the  police. That's an easy call. If we  call the police... What happens? They find a dead prostitute in the  bathroom... They ask us... What  happened? We say, ah... our friend,  Michael... Your brother... got a little out of  control... they were making love...  and he got a little excited... and  he, ah, sort of beat her head into  the side of a toilet, while he choked  her to death with a rubber hose...
ADAM	m	Stop it!
BOYD	m	There's more.
ADAM	m	Just stop.
BOYD	m	Just giving the facts.
ADAM	m	I'm calling the police.
BOYD	m	What were we doing officer? Why didn't  we help her? Well... we're all a bit  high, you know, bachelor party, that  kind of thing. Fisher here is getting  married in three days... Beautiful  wife... he didn't have anything at  all to do with it... It was all  Michael here... just Michael...
ADAM	m	You don't play games with Homicide  police. There are no options here.  There is not the luxury of worrying  about how the fallout will settle.
BOYD	m	I've known him for while maybe twenty  years kind of a close friend but hey  what the heck officer, take him away,  go on it's for his own good.
FISHER	m	What are you talking about? Adam's  right. We don't have a choice here  Boyd... I mean what are you talking  about? What options???
BOYD	m	Bury her out in the desert.
ADAM	m	Sure, why not.
MOORE	m	He's right.
BOYD	m	We can take her out to Red Rock.  Find some quiet place... and put her  in the ground.
ADAM	m	You don't just casually walk out of  a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
BOYD	m	We can do this. We can get her out  of here.
ADAM	m	Have you completely lost your mind?  So you get her out of here. So you  get her out into the desert somehow,  without anybody seeing, so what, you  don't think at some point somebody  might notice that she's gone?
BOYD	m	Nobody knows she's here. I called  her personally. Nobody knows.
FISHER	m	Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody  must know she's here.
BOYD	m	Nobody knows.
ADAM	m	Her blood is all over the bathroom.  I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
BOYD	m	It's a marble floor, we can clean it  up.
FISHER	m	Oh God. This is insane.
BOYD	m	What's insane is the fact that Michael  here put a fucking girl's head through  a toilet. That's insane.
MOORE	m	They'll get us on accessory to murder.
ADAM	m	Bullshit it's not accessory. I didn't  do shit. You call the cops, you  explain it was an accident...
BOYD	m	Her fucking head was caved in.
ADAM	m	So! I didn't fucking do it!
BOYD	m	She's got bondage burns on her wrists.  There's blow all over the room, Moore  looks like he went at it with a  mountain lion. This room looks like  the Manson Family stayed here a month.  Michael goes down, we all go down.
MOORE	m	I'm not going to ruin my life over a  dead whore.
ADAM	m	That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead  whore?" She's a person!
FISHER	m	I'm getting married...
MICHAEL	m	I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
ADAM	m	I've got a wife and two boys.
BOYD	m	Lets take a vote. A simple vote. Two  choices; we clean up the mess. Right  now. Bury it in the desert, go home,  and never look back. Or, we can call  the police... Open those doors, roll  the dice and hope that it's only  Michael who falls. Let's take a vote.  Desert... or police?
BOYD	m	Desert.
MOORE	m	Fucking desert.
MICHAEL	m	Fish, I'm really sorry. I just... I  owe you man. Desert.
BOYD	m	Nobody knows she's here.
FISHER	m	Good God... Good God...
ADAM	m	How do we get her out of here?
BOYD	m	Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the  car around to the back of the hotel,  throw her off the balcony, put her  in the car... Done.
ADAM	m	You don't think someone will have a  problem with a body being thrown off  a balcony?
BOYD	m	We check out the area and wait for a  time when it's clear.
ADAM	m	What about the blood?
BOYD	m	Someone goes to Walmart, gets some  buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and  Span, the works.
ADAM	m	Have you ever done this before?
BOYD	m	The reality is, you take away the  horror of this situation, take away  the tragedy of the death, take away  the moral and ethical implications  of all the crap you have had  conditioned, beaten, into your head  since grade one. What are we left  with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115  lbs. that must be moved from point A  to point B. Now, a straight line in  the shortest distance but we are  denied the luxury of a visible  straight line. But that line exists  and I see it. I see that line. Trust  me. Adam. Trust me... I can take  care of this.
RALPH 	m	Hello? Is anyone in there?
BOYD	m	What is it?
RALPH 	m	Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
BOYD	m	What?
RALPH 	m	I'm with Tina. Is she there?
BOYD	m	She's not here.
RALPH 	m	Where is she?
BOYD	m	She's here. She's just... Hold on a  second.
RALPH 	m	Could you open the door please.
RALPH	m	Okay. Hi.
RALPH	m	So who's the lucky guy?
BOYD	m	Who?
RALPH	m	The groom?
FISHER	m	Me.
RALPH	m	Cool... You all dudes from L.A.?
BOYD	m	Yup.
RALPH	m	Doing the bachelor party thing?
BOYD	m	That's right.
RALPH	m	Sin City. Devil's Playground. The  Black Bitch. All day every day. Where's Tina?
BOYD	m	She's in the bathroom... she's still  working.
RALPH	m	She's still working?
BOYD	m	That's right.
RALPH	m	Sweet deal.
RALPH	m	Is everything okay?
BOYD	m	Great. Fine. Perfect.
RALPH	m	I'm gonna just tell her I'm waiting.
BOYD	m	She's in there!
RALPH	m	I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
RALPH	m	My God!
FISHER 	m	No! NOOOO!!!
BOYD	m	Help me! Don't let him bleed on the  carpet!
BOYD	m	He'll bleed out! He'll bleed dry.  Help me hold the door.
MOORE	m	Oh God.
BOYD	m	All right people. New plan. Not even  a new plan so much as a modification  of the old plan.
FISHER	m	I'm calling the police.
BOYD	m	So help me God you touch that phone  and I bury you with them. Surrender is no longer an option. I  repeat -- It is not an option. Is  there anyone who does not understand  that?
BOYD	m	A little gut check time fellas. A  time for some serious self- exploration. How do I function? For  real? No more bullshit. Can I keep  my cool when they bounce my bananas?  When they won't play my fucking song?  etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get  me?
MICHAEL	m	Not really. no.
BOYD	m	Not a problem. Understand not my  words, but follow my orders. Follow  my orders
BOYD 	m	We will organize, we will mobilize,  we will maximize and prioritize.
BOYD	m	Let's do it people.
BOYD	m	All right. Looking good people.
BOYD	m	Sun rises at 5:52.
ADAM	m	I'm not wrecking the transmission!
ADAM	m	Wait. Wait a minute.
BOYD	m	What?
ADAM	m	We can't do this.
BOYD	m	We've already done this.
ADAM	m	No, I mean the suitcases. We can't  bury them in suitcases.
MICHAEL	m	Why?
ADAM	m	It's sacrilegious.
BOYD	m	How do you figure?
ADAM	m	According to Jewish law, the blood  and limbs are considered to be part  of the human being. They must be  buried together or their souls won't  rest in peace.
BOYD	m	So that's what we're doing.
ADAM	m	No we're not. The bodies are all  mixed up. We can't do this to them.
BOYD	m	She's Asian. They don't have Jews in  Asia.
ADAM	m	That is absolutely not true.
BOYD	m	Well what the fuck are we supposed  to do?
ADAM	m	Open the suitcases, unpack the body  parts and reunite the limbs.
FISHER	m	No way.
ADAM	m	It has to be done.
BOYD	m	We have to get going.
ADAM	m	I am not flexible on this.
BOYD	m	Alright. Let's do it.
BOYD	m	I got her arm.
MOORE	m	Here's his head.
BOYD	m	Now I am the last to say that we  have done here is a good thing. It's  not. It's not a good thing. But it  was, given the circumstances, the  smart play. We did what had to be  done. And... well... I'm proud of  us. I'm proud of each and every one  of us. We performed. Under the most  complex and nerve shattering of  situations, we stood fast and we  delivered. I feel proud.
ADAM	m	We are all going straight to hell.  Either hell or prison, whichever  comes first.
BOYD	m	Wrong. That is flat out wrong. hell  is for cowards, for hypocrites who  fear to live by the strength of their  own convictions. This is war. Given  the circumstances and given the fact  that we are alive and they are not,  we have chosen life over death. Two  wrongs don't make a right. So our  conviction and execution would only  mean more death here, not less.
MOORE	m	Boyd... I don't know man... It just  seems to me that ever since you took  Tony Robbins self-help thing... you're  all fucked-up in the head.
FISHER	m	I got to agree with that.
BOYD	m	That is a load of shit. Personal  power has nothing to do with any of  this. Tony Robbins has helped me to  unlock energy and see my options  more clearly, yes, but to give him  credit for this, for all of this...  Well that's just more than the man  deserves.
FISHER	m	I think we should say some words  over the grave.
BOYD	m	What kind of words?
FISHER	m	I'm talking about prayer.
BOYD	m	Go ahead.
FISHER	m	Dear God... I don't know how to pray.
MICHAEL	m	Just go ahead and say what's on your  mind.
BOYD	m	Speak from the heart my brother.
ADAM	m	This is pathetic.
MICHAEL	m	You're pathetic.
ADAM	m	What did you say?
MICHAEL	m	You're not a team player.
ADAM	m	Don't point at me.
MICHAEL	m	You never were a team player. That's  why you never had any friends.
ADAM	m	I have plenty of friends.
MICHAEL	m	The hell you do.
ADAM	m	The hell I don't.
MICHAEL	m	You have acquaintances -- business  friends and superficial golf buddies.  You have always been a fringe player.  You have some serious male on male  intimacy problems.
ADAM	m	What are you fucking talking about?
FISHER	m	Michael, now is probably not the  best time for this.
BOYD	m	No, this is the perfect time. This  is real time. Adam. Your brother and  I, as well as several others present,  have always suspected that you... ...are a fully repressed, living in  major denial, locked down, fly-boy  butt-fucker.
FISHER	m	Dear God, please forgive us for what  we have done here tonight. We have  lost our way. Speaking for myself,  let me say...
FISHER 	m	...I am deeply in love with the woman  I am about to marry and I look very  much forward to raising a family and  being a positive member of society.  We promise, if you forgive us, we  will never forget this tragedy and  will try with all our powers to use  it as a daily reminder that we are  here on earth to do good not evil.  Let us go from this day forward with  new purpose and spirit. You have  given us a second chance and let us  take that second chance and use it  as fuel to feed our fires of  productivity so that the spirits of  the two we now bury live on forever  in the good deeds and positive  achievements we from this moment on  shall make our life's work...
FISHER 	m	Thank you lord, and again, we ask  for your forgiveness and guidance...  Amen.
LIZ 	f	Hello.
FISHER	m	Hey. It's me.
LIZ 	f	Where are you?
FISHER	m	We're on our way home. I just...  we're running a little late.
LIZ 	f	How late?
FISHER	m	No. Just like an hour or so.
LIZ 	f	What about the chairs?
FISHER	m	Okay.
LIZ 	f	What okay?
FISHER	m	What!
LIZ 	f	The chairs.
FISHER	m	I left a message. I think it's going  to be okay.
LIZ 	f	You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
FISHER	m	No. No. I'll see you in about four  hours.
LIZ 	f	Do you love me?
ADAM	m	I want you to hear me out.
FISHER	m	What.
ADAM	m	You and I have done nothing. You  especially. We are innocent.
FISHER	m	I don't think so.
ADAM	m	We are. We go to the police. We tell  them the truth. Now. Before they  find out. Now. We save ourselves.
BOYD	m	Let's go!
ADAM	m	We save ourselves. It's our only  chance.
ADAM JR.	m	Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
BOYD	m	The past is the past. Today is the  beginning of the rest of our lives.
MOORE	m	Today is the best day of the rest of  our lives.
FISHER	m	The first day.
MOORE	m	What?
FISHER	m	It goes; "Today is the first day of  the rest of our lives."
BOYD	m	However it goes, the point is, nobody  says anything to anyone ever.  Right?... Right?
MICHAEL	m	Right.
MOORE	m	That's right.
BOYD	m	You're goddamn right. Adam?
ADAM	m	Right.
LOIS	?	Group shot. Here we go boys! Yes  sir, compare and contrast time!
LOIS	?	Feeling a little HUNGOVER are we? Do  you kids take note? See how pathetic Daddy and his jackass  friends look?!
LIZ	f	What's the word on the chairs?
FISHER	m	I'm working on it.
LIZ	f	Then you'd better work on it in the  car. We gotta go see the Judge.
JUDGE TOWER	m	We don't say "love, honor and obey"  anymore. And we don't say "till death  do us part." Today we say, "respect,  honor and cherish, as long as you  both do love." How does that sound?
LIZ	f	I kind of like "till death do us  part." I mean, this is forever. In  sickness and in health, through good  times and bad. Honey, what do you  think?
FISHER	m	Yea... It's great... seems like... I  don't know you've got all the  important stuff in there.
JUDGE TOWER	m	All right then. It's refreshing to  see two young people not afraid of  real commitment. Will you have friends  or family saying words -- singing or  anything?
FISHER	m	Are we supposed to?
JUDGE TOWER	m	It's not a question of supposed to,  it's an entirely personal decision...  Some do some don't.
LIZ	f	We don't think so. I mean, we just  want the singing when I come out.
JUDGE TOWER	m	Okay great. What will that be?
LIZ	f	We're just going to have the leader  of the band sing alone with his  guitar. Acoustic.
JUDGE TOWER	m	What song?
LIZ	f	"You Send Me."
JUDGE TOWER	m	Oh I know that. How does it go...
LIZ	f	You know, Darling you... you send me... Darling  you... You mend me. Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
FISHER	m	"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send  me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe,  mend me.
LIZ	f	"At first I thought it was  infatuation... But oh it's lasted so  long..."
FISHER & LIZ	m	"Now I find myself wanting to marry  you, marry you and take you home..."
MR. FISHER	m	I wanted to just take this final  opportunity to visit with you. You  know, just to be with you, father  and son, before you run off and do  your own husband, daddy thing. I'm just so goddamn proud of you...  God knows I didn't always play it  right with you...
FISHER	m	You did all right dad.
MR. FISHER	m	I could have done it better. I'm a  fucking ball-buster I am.
FISHER	m	You never walked away dad. You could  have walked away.
MR. FISHER	m	I'm just so scared of that song.  That fucking, "My son just arrived  the other day... he says thanks for  the ball, come on let's play. I got  lots of bills come again next day.  He's grown up just like me... My boy  is just like me." Gordon fucking  Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever,  that song just fucking kills me.
FISHER	m	Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
MR. FISHER	m	Just kills me...
FISHER	m	I love you dad.
MR. FISHER	m	I love you so much it hurts. Me and  your mother marvel at what you have  become. You're going to have a  wonderful journey with this girl. I  feel it deep inside. A wonderful,  magical journey. And I'm, like I said, just so proud  of how you turned out. (hugs Fisher)  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith.  Knock 'em dead!
FISHER	m	Where did you get that?
MICHAEL	m	At the newsstand on 3rd.
ADAM	m	Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot.  They're on to us.
MICHAEL	m	They're not on to us. I'm gonna call  Boyd.
BOYD	m	Oh that's just nothing. That's just  a missing persons thing, that's all.
MICHAEL	m	You said nobody would miss her.
BOYD	m	No. I said nobody knew she was coming  to the hotel.
ADAM	m	Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming  down!
BOYD	m	What does that mean?
ADAM	m	You got us into this mess.
BOYD	m	Oh I did? I think it was your little  rat fuck brother who decided to play  Hamburger Helper with the hooker's  head.
ADAM	m	Would you, shush?! These phones aren't  secure!
BOYD	m	Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
ADAM	m	Don't talk to me about character.
BOYD	m	Watch the tone fella.
ADAM	m	Fuck you Boyd!
BOYD	m	Any time fat boy!
LIZ	f	I love it. I just love, love, love,  love it.
MAGGIE	f	Are you guys gonna fill this place  with kids? You sure got room for  them.
LIZ	f	We're in no hurry. I think we'll  take some time to enjoy each other,  enjoy our freedom before we surrender  ourselves to kids.
MAGGIE	f	Take your time. I wish I had.
LIZ	f	We will.
MAGGIE	f	So where to on the honeymoon?
FISHER	m	This is our honeymoon.
LIZ	f	After the wedding, which we're paying  for ourselves, and this house...
MAGGIE	f	Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big  picture, take your time. I wish I  had.
LIZ	f	That's our plan.
MAGGIE	f	Well, I just need your signature on  these contracts and a deposit check  so I can get the ball rolling.
FISHER	m	How much?
MAGGIE	f	Five percent should be fine for now,  which is, let's see, twenty thousand  dollars. Of course I'll be splitting  my commission with your friend. He is a very sweet man.
KIDS	m	"Do your balls hang low, do they  wobble to and fro, can you tie 'em  in a knot, can you tie 'em in a bow?"
ADAM	m	Knock it off!
LOIS	?	Don't snap at them!
ADAM	m	They're driving me nuts!
LOIS	?	They're singing.
ADAM	m	It's a disgusting song.
SUIT	m	How ya doing?
ADAM	m	What?
SUIT	m	What's that?
ADAM	m	What did you say?
SUIT	m	I said how's it going?
ADAM	m	I didn't hear you.
SUIT	m	Well that's what I said.
SUIT	m	How do you like that mini-van?
LOIS	?	Honey, go in there and get some  Starbursts.
ADAM	m	What?
LOIS	?	They're screaming for Starbursts.
ADAM	m	Later.
LOIS	?	They're screaming like monsters and  it's giving me a headache. Go get  some fucking Starbursts.
ADAM	m	Fine.
ADAM	m	Oh my God.
COP 	m	Excuse me.
COP	m	You okay?
CLERK	m	Just leave it!
ADAM	m	It's okay.
CLERK	m	Leave it!
CLERK	m	GET OUT!
ADAM	m	I'm sorry.
ADAM	m	I'm sorry.
CLERK	m	GET OUT!
SUIT	m	The wife's begging me for one. How's  the mileage.
LOIS	?	Where's the candy?
ADAM	m	There is no candy!
LOIS	?	What do you mean? It's it's a goddamn  Mini-Mart?!
KIDS	m	Dad?!
ADAM	m	Have you thought about what I said?
FISHER	m	Jesus Adam, can we not get into this  now please?
ADAM	m	I got a migraine like a little monkey  kicking in the side of my skull,  Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge  hammer trying to crack...
FISHER	m	I got you.
ADAM	m	Where's the bathroom?
MR. FISHER	m	And this is Keith at age four and  his best friend "Bunker the Mule."  Evidently, when they were in camp,  Keith and Boyd got into some serious  arguments over exactly who was Keith's  best friend -- Boyd or the mule.
BOYD	m	Fisher had a less than normal  relationship with that Donkey.
FISHER	m	You always were a jealous man.
MR. FISHER	m	After camp came football, and for  those of you not following the sports  pages back in 1977, you might not  remember the Peewee Powerhouse  Oklahoma, who, under the brilliant  leadership of your's truly, rolled  to an auspicious league record of 0- 12 scoring exactly zero touchdowns.
MICHAEL	m	The problem was coaching. Poor  leadership.
BOYD	m	The problem was our quarterback had  trouble remembering his right from  left...
FISHER	m	No, the problem, as I recall, was  the lack of blocking...
FISHER	m	You all right?
ADAM	m	I can't fucking breathe. I'm sorry.
BOYD	m	OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely  inappropriate behavior here.
FISHER	m	Shut up Boyd.
BOYD	m	Negative. This is not what we have  worked out in terms of presented  behavior.
FISHER	m	He's having a problem here.
MICHAEL	m	What's the problem Adam?
MOORE	m	What's the problem?
BOYD	m	What is your problem?
ADAM	m	I can't do this.
MOORE	m	Can't do what?
ADAM	m	We're gonna get caught. I know we're  gonna get caught. They were eyeballing  my car.
BOYD	m	What?
ADAM	m	At the seven-eleven.
BOYD	m	Who? What are you talking about?
ADAM	m	They're on me. They're smoking me  out!
BOYD	m	Nobody's smoking anybody out.
FISHER	m	Shut up.
MOORE	m	Quiet.
LIZ	f	Keith? Is everything okay, honey?
FISHER	m	Yeah baby. Everything's great.
LIZ	f	Well, can you come back inside?
FISHER	m	Yeah. Sure.
LIZ	f	Now?
FISHER	m	Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in.  I just... we're just taking care of  some Groomsmen last minute business.
MR. FISHER	m	Everything okay?
FISHER	m	Yeah, Dad. It's great.
MR. FISHER	m	Well, I'm in the middle of my goddamn  toast here.
FISHER	m	OK, OK. You guys just go back in.  Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll  be right in. Go on.
BOYD	m	You got some mighty fucking fine bad  timing Adam. We got a rehearsal  situation here.
ADAM	m	I don't give a damn.
MICHAEL	m	About anybody but yourself. You never  have.
ADAM	m	And you're a little fucking reject.
MICHAEL	m	Eat my ass!
ADAM	m	Hey!
ADAM	m	If you ever touch my minivan again,  I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
MICHAEL	m	You're a loser.
ADAM	m	You're the loser! A big black hole  sucking up everything you touch! YOU
MICHAEL	m	You're the loser! You think your  shit's so fucking righteous! FUCK  YOU! You were there with us, boy!  Right there! SIDE BY FUCKING SIDE!!!
FISHER	m	Shut up!
BOYD	m	Shut your fucking mouths!!!
ADAM	m	I didn't do anything! I'll turn your  pathetic ass in!
BOYD	m	Adam! Calm down.
ADAM	m	I won't calm down. I can't do this.  We can't do this. It won't work. It  will not work.
BOYD	m	It has worked.
ADAM	m	I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber  optics, search parties, they got  infrared scanners, FBI scientists.  They figure this shit out. They always  figure it out.
BOYD	m	They won't figure it out.
ADAM	m	I got children. I've got a life.
MICHAEL	m	You got a retarded kid and a fat pig  wife.
ADAM	m	You fucking bastard!
LIZ	f	Keith?!
FISHER	m	Everything's OK. Just some more  preparations.
LIZ	f	Are they fighting?
FISHER	m	No baby. We'll all be right in.
BOYD	m	This is going to stop right now.  Right now!
MICHAEL	m	You will not screw this up.
ADAM	m	Don't you threaten me you little rat  fuck.
MICHAEL	m	Don't you fucking threaten me --  I'll fucking kill you.
ADAM	m	Go home!
MICHAEL	m	You go home!
BOYD	m	Why don't you just cool out. Go home  and go to sleep.
BOYD	m	Just go home, chill the fuck out.  Okay?
BOYD	m	Just go home.
BOYD	m	All right. Let's all go back in.  Adam? You're cool right?
ADAM	m	No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at  all.
MICHAEL	m	Mr. Fucking Minivan...
ADAM	m	NOOOO!!!!
BOYD	m	It was just a crazy freak accident.  He thought the car was in reverse...  He didn't realize.
COP	m	Was there some sort of an argument?
FISHER	m	No. Nothing like that.
COP	m	We heard there was some arguing going  on. Some loud talk.
BOYD	m	No. No. We were just all outside  just talking.
COP	m	What were you talking about?
BOYD	m	The wedding. We were talking bout  how it was going to be one of the  last times for us to all be together  with Fisher not being married...
COP	m	A lot of people seem to think there  was some hostility out there.
BOYD	m	Well I can't really comment on what  "a lot of people" thought. I can  only tell you that we had a horrible  accident here and were all feeling  extremely traumatized and your  questions are a bit poorly timed.  We're in full on grieving mode right  now thank you very much Officer...  Randone.
FISHER	m	Easy Boyd.
BOYD	m	No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in  there in pieces. How about a little  sensitivity?
COP	m	That's all I wanted to know.
DOCTOR	m	His situation is critical. He's asking  to speak to his wife.
BOYD	m	The need to know is clear. What did  Adam tell Lois? That's the name of  the game. What did Adam tell Lois?  What does Lois know?
MICHAEL	m	Ball park sausages.
BOYD	m	You want some breakfast meat, Michael.  Is that what you want?
MICHAEL	m	Franco Harris has a flare for the  dramatic. The former Pittsburgh  Steeler running back, beat known for  "The Immaculate Reception," his  improbable sixty yard Ricochet  Reception. I say Ricochet Reception  has made a bold move on corporate  America. Harris has lead a group of investors  in the purchase of the Park Sausage  Company. By taking on the challenge  of resurrecting Park's, Harris is  engaged in the equivalent of a sudden  death overtime.
BOYD	m	Easy Michael.
MICHAEL	m	He must take an open-field run to  profitability through excessive debt  large competitors and dwindling market  share. Before the clock runs out.
MOORE	m	Shut up Michael.
BOYD	m	Okay. Time to fly.
MICHAEL	m	I ran down my brother in cold blood.  Shame on me! Shame! Shame! Shame!
MICHAEL	m	Time to pay the man. "For if we  confess our sins he is faithful and  just, to forgive us our sins, and to  cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
FISHER	m	Thank you.
MICHAEL	m	"Kill one man and you are a murderer!  Kill millions and you are a conqueror --  Kill all and you are a God!"
MICHAEL	m	"The memory of the just is blessed  but the name of the wicked shall  rot."
BOYD	m	You will get yourself together here  mister. Are you hearing me?
FISHER	m	He's cracked up.
BOYD	m	He is not cracking up.
FISHER	m	Boyd... What have we done?
BOYD	m	What did you ask me?
FISHER	m	What?
BOYD	m	What is the question you asked me?
FISHER	m	I said, what have we done?
BOYD	m	Yes, you did. Now that is the  question! That is exactly the question  we should be asking ourselves. You  tell me Fisher. What have we done?
FISHER	m	I don't know! I just want to get  married.
BOYD	m	Say it again.
FISHER	m	What?
BOYD	m	What you just said. Say it again.
FISHER	m	I just want to get married.
BOYD	m	Exactly! Exactly my point.
MOORE	m	What's your fucking point?
BOYD	m	I'm not talking to you?
FISHER	m	What's your point?
BOYD	m	You want to know what you are doing  here?! You are love pumping. You are  protecting all that is sacred and  beautiful and in sync with poetry  and sunsets and little newborn babies.  You are walking the walk. This is it  Fisher, the real stuff. You love  this woman. Love is second to nothing.  I love you. I love Moore. I love  Michael. This car is full of love,  and nothing -- absolutely nothing --  supersedes love, man. Nothing. We  will do what it takes. Whatever it  takes.
BOYD	m	Love does not lose.
BOYD	m	Easy Michael.
LIZ	f	Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of  your fucking mind?!
FISHER	m	Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking  about modifying.
LIZ	f	No way.
FISHER	m	Can we just talk this out?
LIZ	f	Talk what out? We are locked and  loaded here. We are non-refundable.  I've got relatives on the airport  right now! I've got...
LIZ	f	Answer it!
FISHER	m	Hello?
LOIS	?	Keith. It's Lois. I just found a  note up in Adam's study. It's some  kind of crazy confession about killing  a stripper and cutting up bodies  and...
FISHER	m	...burying them outside of Vegas,  about Boyd being the ring leader...  She wants to know what the hell is  going on and I'm starting to freak  out here.
MICHAEL	m	We're goosed.
BOYD	m	We're not goosed.
MOORE	m	What's goosed?
BOYD	m	What is her disposition?
FISHER	m	Regarding what?
BOYD	m	Does she sound pissed, scared,  hostile? Did she mention the police?
FISHER	m	No, but she's definitely pissed and  hostile. And she's clearly starting  to think that's something's not right.
MICHAEL	m	We're goosed! Goosed by God!
BOYD	m	Michael get a grip. What did you tell her?
FISHER	m	I told her that I have no idea what  Adam was talking about in that letter.
MOORE	m	Did she believe you?
FISHER	m	I have no idea.
MOORE	m	You can tell when people believe  you. It's obvious.
FISHER	m	Well I don't have that skill and if  I had to guess I would say that in  no way did she believe me.
MICHAEL	m	Goosed!
BOYD	m	Stop it!
MICHAEL	m	Goosed!
BOYD	m	Stop.
MICHAEL	m	Goosed!
BOYD	m	Give me the Valium.
MOORE	m	He just had two.
BOYD	m	Give me two more.
BOYD	m	Open sesame.
FISHER	m	Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
BOYD	m	Suck my ass.
LOIS	?	I never liked you Boyd. You're a  snaky little fuck. Always have been.
BOYD	m	What are you talking about?
LOIS	?	Don't sweet lip me.
BOYD	m	I don't understand where this personal  attack is coming from...
LOIS	?	You're a liar. I want to know what  happened in Vegas.
BOYD	m	Nothing happened in Vegas.
LOIS	?	I don't want to hear it from the  liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher?  What happened in Vegas?
FISHER	m	Nothing happened in Vegas.
LOIS	?	Moore?
MOORE	m	Nothing happened.
LOIS	?	Michael? Do you have something to  tell me?
BOYD	m	Michael. Tell Lois that nothing...
LOIS	?	Shut up Boyd! Michael?
MICHAEL	m	Goosed.
LOIS	?	What?
MICHAEL	m	Lois we were bad, we were very, very  bad.
BOYD	m	He's upset about Adam. We're all  upset.
LOIS	?	I will call the police right now if  I don't start getting some answers.
BOYD	m	Lois please.
LOIS	?	Fuck you Boyd.
FISHER	m	Okay. Lois... here's the deal. Adam was with a prostitute in Las  Vegas.
LOIS	?	What?
FISHER	m	I'm sorry he was unfaithful to you.
BOYD	m	And it wasn't the first time... He  had a thing about prostitutes.
LOIS	?	My Adam?
BOYD	m	We're sorry.
BOYD	m	Mommy just needs a little time out.  Everything's gonna be okay. Okay? Okay.
BOYD	m	After you drop the kids off, take  Michael home. Put a few drinks in  him so he'll sleep.
FISHER	m	I don't think that's such a good  idea.
BOYD	m	Just do it.
FISHER	m	What are you going to do?
BOYD	m	Take care of business.
FISHER	m	What does that mean?
BOYD	m	And what does that mean? Are you insane?! You think I would hurt Lois?! She's  the mother of those kids! What is  wrong with you?
FISHER	m	I don't know...
BOYD	m	You got a nasty side to your thought  process.
FISHER	m	I'm sorry. Honey... it's just for  tonight.
FISHER	m	Lois is a mess and Michael's really  upset. Everyone's upset.
LIZ	f	We're not canceling.
FISHER	m	I know.
LIZ	f	I won't even discuss it.
FISHER	m	No one's discussing it. I'm just  gonna run Michael home. I'll be right  back.
LIZ	f	I need you to pick up the cake  tomorrow.
FISHER	m	Don't we already have someone to do  that for us?
LIZ	f	Yeah. You.
FISHER	m	Okay. Okay.
MICHAEL	m	Do you hear buzzing fish?
FISHER	m	Buzzing?
MICHAEL	m	Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing.  Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just  chipping away in the back of my skull.
FISHER	m	I don't hear it.
MICHAEL	m	Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
FISHER	m	Have another drink.
MICHAEL	m	Dad used to bring home these sparklers  to me and Adam. Out back we'd light  'em up. The three of us. We'd hold  'em up to the sky and watch the  explosions of light. Sparks. And dad  would be all... "Get ready"... "watch  for it"... "here it comes," here  comes the "wahoo"
FISHER	m	The wahoo?
MICHAEL	m	The sparkler would burn hot, then  hotter, then even hotter... and there  would be one moment of pure burn  when that little fucker would cook  just perfect. Perfect. It would only  last a second, but that second was  it. It was it. That's what dad had  us looking for... You get me?
FISHER	m	The wahoo moment?
MICHAEL	m	That's my point! You see Man...  burning at his absolute. To see all  the forces just come together, just  right, you know, just in perfect  harmony. That's what I'm driving at.  You get me?
FISHER	m	I think so.
MICHAEL	m	I've been looking for that flash and  I look and I look and I can't find  it. And what if I already had it?  You know. My moment? What if it's  gone? And I never saw it? You're getting married, man. That's  a fucking beautiful thing. Just a  beautiful thing. I just can't stop  breaking beautiful things.
LOIS	?	You picked the wrong woman mother- fucker!
MICHAEL	m	You see for me it's over. Over baby.  I'm gonna turn myself in. After the  wedding of course. After the wedding.  Out of respect.
MOORE	m	I don't think that's a good idea.
MICHAEL	m	I said out of respect. Respect for  you Fisher. For you and your wedding  and your beautiful bride. There will  be no more rain. You see where I am  here?
FISHER	m	I appreciate it. I do, but... maybe  you ought to just ease up on yourself  a bit.
MICHAEL	m	No. No. No. This is my doing. You  see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark  for my own. For Lois and the kids,  for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna  turn myself in. I am all that. I'm  gonna do it for sweet Lois.
MICHAEL	m	If I was to think... If I were to  think... No I mean I have thinked it  over... I have. And without putting  a lot of pressure on you I just...  Well I just...
FISHER	m	What is it?
MICHAEL	m	Well if you do think about names...  Michael's a pretty good one... It's  done me all right.
FISHER	m	Yeah.
BOYD	m	Okay. Here's the deal and it's a  good one. Lois is cool. It's a  pacified situation.
FISHER	m	What does that mean?
BOYD	m	I'm talking about Lois having relaxed  her anxiety. Only deal is... you  still got Michael there?
FISHER	m	Yeah.
BOYD	m	Good deal. Lois just wants to hear  it from Michael.
FISHER	m	Hear what?
BOYD	m	That it was all an accident. She  wants to here it from Michael's mouth.
FISHER	m	Now?
BOYD	m	That's right.
FISHER	m	Isn't it a little late?
BOYD	m	Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather  do this in the morning?
BOYD	m	She says now's the time. I got a peace treaty thing happening  over here... let's get this over  with.
BOYD	m	Okay Michael, let's go. Upsy daisy big guy.
MICHAEL	m	How about my Fatburger?
BOYD	m	Come on tough guy. Listen to me. You are going to tell Lois that it  was all an accident. Okay cowboy?  You got me?
MICHAEL	m	I love you.
MOORE	m	He's too drunk.
BOYD	m	He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go. You guys stay here.
MOORE	m	I'm thinking about maybe making a  move.
FISHER	m	A move?
MOORE	m	Greenpeace.
FISHER	m	Greenpeace?
MOORE	m	Maybe go up to the North Pole, the  Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart  guns. I've always had a pretty good  aim...
BOYD	m	Michael was having an affair with  Lois. That's what Michael and Adam  were arguing about in the parking  lot. Michael killed Adam in a jealous  rage. Lois broke it off with Michael,  he strangled her to death and then  shot himself in the head. Happens all the time.
BOYD	m	That Lois fought like a fucking  Comanche.
BARRY MORRIS	m	I don't see how this could have been  kept from you. The facts are quite  simple; last month Adam and Lois  changed their will. They requested  that you two, as a married couple,  be the Custodians of Record for their  estate including all properties,  cash holdings, security holdings  and... children. You are legal  custodians of the Brenn Trust.
LIZ	f	My god.
BARRY MORRIS	m	There's more.
FISHER	m	More?
BARRY MORRIS	m	Adam and Lois were not terribly  prudent in terms of providing for  the possibility of the unforeseen.
FISHER	m	What are you talking about?
BARRY MORRIS	m	I'm talking about Life insurance.  I'm talking about money.
LIZ	f	Money?
BARRY MORRIS	m	Yes money. Adam had a five hundred  thousand dollar Term Life Insurance  Policy.
LIZ	f	What does that mean?
FISHER	m	That means we get five hundred  thousand to help raise the kids.
LIZ	f	No.
FISHER	m	Yes.
BARRY MORRIS	m	Actually, no. Adam was switching to  a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled  his medical exam... and failed to  make his last payment... so his Term  Life lapsed. So it's value is null  and void. Now he did have a pension account,  worth another 150 thousand.
LIZ	f	Well, oh...
BARRY MORRIS	m	And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
LIZ	f	So where's that leave us?
FISHER	m	150 plus 350... we still get 500  thousand.
BARRY MORRIS	m	No. Not even close. With property  values down, the house is worth  100,000 less than 450 he paid for  it. With three credit cards, the  minivan payments, and other  outstanding debts... Plus the Income  and Estate Taxes assessed on his
LITTLE ADAM	f	Get away from me!
FISHER	m	I'm just trying to help...
LITTLE ADAM	f	I don't want your help!
FISHER	m	Stop kicking. Stop kicking!
BARRY MORRIS	m	So. When is the wedding.
LIZ	f	Tomorrow We are getting married tomorrow.
LIZ	f	It's okay... It's okay baby. Cry for  Mama. Cry for Mama.
FISHER	m	No it's not okay. It's not.
LIZ	f	Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
FISHER	m	Liz we've got to cancel, we have to  put it off.
LIZ	f	Don't even.
FISHER	m	Do you love me?
LIZ	f	What?
FISHER	m	Do you love me?
LIZ	f	What kind of stupid question is that?
FISHER	m	Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a  woman. We...
LIZ	f	What are you talking about?
FISHER	m	Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Michael  crushed her skull. She was dead.  There was nothing else to do. It was  an accident.
LIZ	f	Who's dead?
FISHER	m	The prostitute.
LIZ	f	You fucked a prostitute?
FISHER	m	No Michael did. It was an accident.
LIZ	f	You killed a prostitute.
FISHER	m	Michael, by accident.
LIZ	f	Call the police.
FISHER	m	It's too late.
LIZ	f	My God. You've got to call the police,  tell them it was an accident. Where  is she?
FISHER	m	She's in the desert. She's out in  the desert.
LIZ	f	You left a dead prostitute out in  the desert? Alone?
FISHER	m	She's not alone... She's... Boyd...  Oh God... He's gone nuts... He killed  Lois and Michael... it's all...
LIZ	f	Stop! You stop right here. I don't  want to know anymore. I told you not  to do this Bachelor Party thing. You  were warned.
FISHER	m	But...
LIZ	f	No buts. I told you your friends  were Jackasses.
FISHER	m	But...
LIZ	f	No buts. I've waited twenty-seven  years, twenty-seven years I have  focused and prepared to walk down  that aisle. I will not be derailed!  I will not be embarrassed! I will  not be denied! I am walking down  that aisle tomorrow come hell or  high fucking water!
BOYD	m	Okay, we're about two minutes out.  Moore, better take your position.
BOYD	m	Chop chop.
BOYD	m	This is a situation that defies  judgement. We have acted and showed  courage that is not of a kind known  by most.
FISHER	m	I'm getting really tired of your  bullshit.
BOYD	m	My what?
FISHER	m	You've got a warped thought process.  Your brain doesn't function properly.
BOYD	m	You care to add a little specification  to that slanderous accusation?
FISHER	m	I'm talking about some bad, bad,  very bad things. Bad things! Those  are bad fucking things!
BOYD	m	Okay fine.
FISHER	m	Fine? Fine what?
BOYD	m	Whatever you say Kojak.
FISHER	m	I'm serious.
BOYD	m	I'm serious. I'm the serious one  here. I'm the one making the play.  I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my  money.
LIZ	f	I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
FISHER	m	What money?
BOYD	m	Blood money. Insurance dollars that  you have thus fucking far decided  not to tell me about at all. In no  way have you mentioned that money.  And I find that to be very very  offensive.
FISHER	m	You're sick.
BOYD	m	And if you think you can fuck me,  don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated  Fisher. Protected. Backed up on  floppy. Do you get me? I want my  fucking money!
FISHER	m	Not a prayer.
BOYD	m	I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up  all night in the rain, in stormy  gale force wind, tornado and fucking  earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I  stay lit. I don't go dark. I never  go dark!
FISHER	m	You need help.
BOYD	m	I want that money!
LIZ	f	Here comes the bride.
MOORE	m	Where's Boyd?
FISHER	m	Downstairs in the closet.
JUDGE TOWER	m	May we have the rings please?
FISHER	m	What?
JUDGE TOWER	m	The rings?
MOORE	m	Got 'em.
JUDGE TOWER	m	These rings represent the commitment  Fisher and Liz make to each other on  the day. Fisher do you take Liz to  be your beloved wife, to respect,  honor and cherish till death do you  part?
FISHER	m	I do.
JUDGE TOWER	m	Liz do you take Fisher to be your  beloved husband, to respect, honor  and cherish him till death do you  part?
LIZ	f	I do.
JUDGE TOWER	m	I now pronounce you husband and wife.
MOORE	m	He came to me early today, was talking  about money, insurance money. Said  he was gonna get what was his.
FISHER	m	My God...
MOORE	m	He said he was the Brain Trust. Said  he was smarter than all of us. He  started reading "Atlas Shrugged,"  staring at himself in the mirror.
FISHER	m	Did he try to kiss you?
MOORE	m	All week long.
FISHER	m	He kept saying he was protected.
LIZ	f	What does that mean?
FISHER	m	Like if something happened to him,  he could still get us.
LIZ	f	Like how?
FISHER	m	I don't know. He could have told  someone. He could have, like in the  event of his death, somehow let  someone know where those bodies are  buried.
LIZ	f	The only proof is those bodies.
FISHER	m	So what do we do?
LIZ	f	Move the bodies.
FISHER	m	Move the bodies?
OLD MAN 	m	Excuse us?
LIZ	f	Thank you. Thank you. We will. Bye  bye.
FISHER	m	I... Liz... all I ever wanted, was  for you to be happy. I just wanted  to give you the wedding, the life  you always dreamed of... ...I just love you so much... So  much...
LIZ	f	You and Moore move the bodies and  bury Boyd with them. In fact, put  Moore in the ground too.
FISHER	m	What?
LIZ	f	If you don't tie up all the lose  ends it'll never be over.
FISHER	m	No...
LIZ	f	You put him down or don't bother  coming back.
FISHER	m	But...
LIZ	f	Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
MOORE	m	You alright?
FISHER	m	Yeah. I'm thinking about Michael's  Franco Harris fixation. You know how  Michael was always harping "Immaculate  Reception?" I've seen that play. A  lot of times... and I have to say  this... Franco was lucky. Flat out,  right place, right time. That's it.  He was where the ball bounced. You  get me?
MOORE	m	I guess.
FISHER	m	I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You  work your entire life, all the  training, focus, all the dedication,  all irrelevant. Where does the ball  bounce? My father spent his whole  life trying to start a company,  practiced every day, worked like a  dog, finally got enough money. He's  paid the dues, he's ready, does all  the market research, picks his shot --  "Pup Corn."
MOORE	m	Pup corn?
FISHER	m	That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie  treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's  figured it out. There is a hole in  the market and he's going to fill  it. Spends all out money, works  himself into not two but three heart  attacks getting this shit up. After  fifteen months, the big day arrives,  the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off  the belt. He comes running home with  that box, pulls us out of school. We  all pile into the living room, must  be fifty of us, and in comes  "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here  Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got  that little fucking pup corn in his  hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat  anything, she eats rocks, anything.  She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks  down at the little pellet, licks it  once, turns around, walks out of the  room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn."  Fifteen months of my dad's life,  right there. Not one dog ate Pup  Corn. Not one. Three months later,  "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven.  My father never got over it. Never.
FISHER	m	I think it was over here.
MOORE	m	It was over by those rocks.
FISHER	m	There.
MOORE	m	Where?
FISHER	m	There. This rock is where I stood  when I said the prayer.
FISHER	m	Bingo.
MOORE	m	Got it.
MOORE	m	I've been thinking about what you  said that day. The prayer. About  using this whole mess to bring out  the good in me...
FISHER	m	Yeah?
MOORE	m	I think there's a lot of truth in  that. I'm gonna pursue some options.  I want to join that Big Brother thing.
FISHER	m	That's a good one.
MOORE	m	I want a black one. A little black  brother. That's a big problem it  seems to me. Lack of racial  integration. That's a big one. You  think?
MOORE	m	What do you think?
FISHER	m	I think you'd make an excellent Big  Brother.
MOORE	m	That's what I'm thinking.
MOORE	m	Well that ought to be about the end  of that.
FISHER	m	Yup.
ANNOUNCER 	f	And it's Franco Harris running for...
ANNOUNCER 	f	A TOUCHDOWN FOR PITTSBURGH!
FISHER	m	Okay let's try it again.
FISHER	m	Let's see the salutes!
TIMMY	m	Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
FISHER	m	It's okay, it's okay.
FISHER 	m	Timmy SHUT UP! Help your brother!  ADAM! Let him help you!
FISHER	m	Remember a scout is helpful! A scout  doesn't scream in the face of  adversity.
FISHER	m	Okay, let's skip to the Scout's  Oath...
ADAM JR. & TIMMY	m	On my honor, I will do my best...
ADAM JR. & TIMMY	m	...to do my duty to God and my  country... To obey the Scout Law, to  help other people at all times...
ADAM JR. & TIMMY	m	To keep myself physically strong,  mentally awake, and morally straight.
