RIDER	m	Hey -- sorry. 
KAT	f	Leave it
BIANCA	f	Did you change your hair?
CHASTITY	f	No.
BIANCA	f	You might wanna think about it
BOY	m	Hey, Bianca.
GIRL	f	Awesome shoes.
MISS PERKY	f	I'm sure you won't find Padua any  different than your old school.  Same  little asswipe mother-fuckers  everywhere.
MISS PERKY	f	Any questions?
CAMERON	m	I don't think so, ma'am
MISS PERKY	f	Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got  deviants to see.
MISS PERKY	f	Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our  visits a weekly ritual.
PATRICK	m	I missed you.
MISS PERKY	f	It says here you exposed yourself to a  group of freshmen girls.
PATRICK	m	It was a bratwurst.  I was eating  lunch.
MISS PERKY	f	With the teeth of your zipper?
MICHAEL	m	You the new guy?
CAMERON	m	So they tell me...
MICHAEL	m	C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the  tour.
MICHAEL	m	So -- which Dakota you from?
CAMERON	m	North, actually.  How'd you   ?
MICHAEL	m	I was kidding. People actually live  there?
CAMERON	m	Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by  the cows, though.
MICHAEL	m	How many people were in your old  school?
CAMERON	m	Thirty-two.
MICHAEL	m	Get out!
CAMERON	m	How many people go here?
MICHAEL	m	Couple thousand. Most of them evil
MICHAEL	m	We've got your basic beautiful people.  Unless they talk to you first, don't  bother.
MICHAEL	m	Those 're your cowboys.
CAMERON	m	That I'm used to.
MICHAEL	m	Yeah, but these guys have never seen a  horse.  They just jack off to Clint  Eastwood.
MICHAEL	m	To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.   Very edgy.  Don't make any sudden  movements around them.
MICHAEL	m	And these delusionals are the White  Rastae.
MICHAEL	m	Big Marley fans.  Think they're black.   Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a  lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I  mean.
MICHAEL	m	Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?
DEREK	m	Michael, my brother, peace
CAMERON	m	So where do you fit in all this?
MICHAEL	m	Future MBAs-  We're all Ivy League,  already accepted.  Someday I'll be  sipping Merlot while those guys --
MICHAEL	m	are fixing my Saab.  Yuppie greed is  back, my friend.
CAMERON	m	That girl -- I --
MICHAEL	m	You burn, you pine, you perish?
CAMERON	m	Who is she?
MICHAEL	m	Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't  even think about it
CAMERON	m	Why not?
MICHAEL	m	I could start with your haircut, but it  doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to  date until her older sister does.  And  that's an impossibility.
MRS. BLAISE	f	Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that  does it for our analysis of The Old Man  and the Sea.  Any other comments? Kat?
KAT	f	Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?
MRS. BLAISE	f	I'm sorry?
KAT	f	This book is about a guy and his  fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial  topic.
KAT	f	Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still  revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive,  alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of  cats.
JOEY	m	As opposed to a bitter self-righteous  hag who has no friends?
MRS. BLAISE	f	That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
KAT	f	I guess the school board thinks because  Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's  worthy of our time
KAT	f	What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte?   Simone de Beauvoir?
PATRICK	m	Mother Goose?
MISS PERKY	f	Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've  been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
KAT	f	Expressing my opinion is not a  terrorist action.
MISS PERKY	f	Well, yes, compared to your other  choices of expression this year, today's  events are quite mild.  By the way,  Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation  went quite well, in case you're  interested.
KAT	f	I still maintain that he kicked himself  in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
MISS PERKY	f	The point is Kat -- people perceive you  as somewhat ...
KAT	f	Tempestuous?
MISS PERKY	f	No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the  term used most often.
MISS PERKY	f	You might want to work on that
KAT	f	As always, thank you for your excellent  guidance.
BIANCA	f	Not really.
TEACHER	m	Mandella -- since you're assisting us,  you might as well comment.  I'm assuming  you read the assignment.
MANDELLA	?	Uh, yeah, I read it all
TEACHER	m	The whole play^
MANDELIA	f	The whole folio.  All the plays.
TEACHER	m	You've read every play by William  Shakespeare?
MANDELLA	?	Haven't you?
KAT	f	The fact that you're cutting gym so you  can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear  his name, is a little without in itself  if you ask me.
MANDELLA	?	Who's that?
KAT	f	Patrick Verona   Random skid.
MANDELLA	?	That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone  for a year? I heard he was doing porn  movies.
KAT	f	I'm sure he's completely incapable of  doing anything that interesting.
MANDELLA	?	He always look so
KAT	f	Block E?
KAT	f	Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a  very slow way to die.
MANDELLA	?	Just a little.
KAT	f	What's this?
MANDELLA	?	An attempted slit.
KAT	f	I realize that the men of this fine  institution are severely lacking, but  killing yourself so you can be with  William Shakespeare is beyond the scope  of normal teenage obsessions.  You're  venturing far past daytime talk show  fodder and entering the world of those  who need very expensive therapy.
MANDELLA	?	But imagine the things he'd say during  sex.
KAT	f	Okay, say you do it.  You kill  yourself, you end up in wherever you end  up and he's there.  Do you really think  he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound  compulsive who failed volleyball?
COHORT	m	Virgin alert.
JOEY	m	Lookin' good, ladies.
MANDELLA	?	Tragic.
CAMERON	m	Why do girls like that always like guys  like that?
MICHAEL	m	Because they're bred to.  Their mothers  liked guys like that, and their  grandmothers before them. Their gene  pool is rarely diluted.
CAMERON	m	He always have that shit-eating grin?
MICHAEL	m	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish  I could say he's a moron, but he's  number twelve in the class.  And a  model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's  rumored to have a big tube sock ad  coming out.
MICHAEL	m	You know French?
CAMERON	m	Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
MICHAEL	m	Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
CAMERON	m	You mean I'd get a chance to talk to  her?
MICHAEL	m	You could consecrate with her, my  friend.
JOEY	m	The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't  you been reading your Sassy?
KAT	f	Yeah, and I noticed the only part of  you featured in your big Kmart spread  was your elbow.  Tough break.
JOEY	m	They're running the rest of me next  month.
KAT	f	The people at this school are so  incredibly foul.
MANDELLA	?	You could always go with me.  I'm sure  William has some friends.
JOEY	m	Need a ride, ladies?
MANDELLA	?	That's a charming new development
KAT	f	Remove head from sphincter!  Then  pedal!
CAMERON	m	You all right?
MICHAEL	m	Yeah, just a minor encounter with the  shrew.
CAMERON	m	That's her?  Bianca's sister?
MICHAEL	m	The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
KAT	f	"Undulating with desire, Adrienne  removes her crimson cape, revealing her  creamy --"
SHARON	f	In the microwave.
WALTER	m	Make anyone cry today?
KAT	f	Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty.
KAT	f	Where've you been?
BIANCA	f	Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
WALTER	m	Hello, precious.
KAT	f	How touching.
WALTER	m	What's this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?
KAT	f	I guess I got in
SHARON	f	What's a synonym for throbbing?
WALTER	m	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of  the country.
KAT	f	I know.
WALTER	m	I thought we decided you were going to  school here.  At U of 0.
KAT	f	You decided.
BIANCA	f	Is there even a question that we want  her to stay?
KAT	f	Ask Bianca who drove her home
SHARON	f	Swollen...turgid.
WALTER	m	Who drove you home?
BIANCA	f	Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's  this boy... and I think he might ask...
WALTER	m	No! You're not dating until your sister  starts dating.  End of discussion.
BIANCA	f	What if she never starts dating?
WALTER	m	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to  sleep at night.
BIANCA	f	But it's not fair -- she's a mutant,  Daddy!
KAT	f	This from someone whose diary is  devoted to favorite grooming tips?
WALTER	m	Enough!
WALTER	m	Do you know what this is?
WALTER	m	This is why you're not dating until  your sister does.
BIANCA	f	But she doesn't want to date.
WALTER	m	Exactly my point
WALTER	m	Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich  before you women start dilating?
SHARON	f	Tumescent!
WALTER	m	You're not helping.
BIANCA	f	Can we make this quick?  Roxanne  Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an  incredibly horrendous public break- up  on the quad.  Again.
CAMERON	m	Well, I thought we'd start with  pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
CAMERON	m	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some  French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
BIANCA	f	You're asking me out.  That's so cute.   What's your name again?
CAMERON	m	Forget it.
BIANCA	f	No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have  a proper introduction ---
CAMERON	m	Cameron.
BIANCA	f	The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the  mercy of a particularly hideous breed of  loser.  My sister.  I can't date until  she does.
CAMERON	m	Seems like she could get a date easy  enough...
CAMERON	m	Why?
BIANCA	f	Unsolved mystery.  She used to be  really popular when she started high  school, then it was just like she got  sick of it or something.
CAMERON	m	That's a shame.
BIANCA	f	Gosh, if only we could find Kat a  boyfriend...
CAMERON	m	Let me see what I can do.
MICHAEL	m	You're in school for one day and you  ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you  have no concept of the high school  social code?
CAMERON	m	I teach her French, get to know her,  dazzle her with charm and she falls in  love with me.
MICHAEL	m	Unlikely, but even so, she still can't  go out with you.  So what's the point?
CAMERON	m	What about him?
MICHAEL	m	You wanna go out with him?
CAMERON	m	No - he could wrangle with the sister.
MICHAEL	m	What makes you think he'll do it?
CAMERON	m	He seems like he thrives on danger
MICHAEL	m	No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard  he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just  got out of Alcatraz...
CAMERON	m	They always let felons sit in on Honors  Biology?
MICHAEL	m	I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He  sold his own liver on the black market  so he could buy new speakers.
CAMERON	m	Forget his reputation.  Do you think  we've got a plan or not?
MICHAEL	m	Did she actually say she'd go out with  you?
CAMERON	m	That's what I just said
MICHAEL	m	You know, if you do go out with Bianca,  you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone.   Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
CAMERON	m	I thought you hated those people.
MICHAEL	m	Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients  when I get to Wall Street.
CAMERON	m	So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
MICHAEL	m	I'll let you handle that.
PEPE	m	Some people like the Colombian, but it  all depends on your acidity preference.   Me?  I prefer East African and  Indonesian.  You start the day with a  Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian  Sidamo in your cup, you're that much  farther ahead than someone drinkin'  Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I  mean?
CAMERON	m	Hey, there
CAMERON	m	Later, then.
MICHAEL	m	Hey.
JOEY	m	Are you lost?
MICHAEL	m	Nope - just came by to chat
JOEY	m	We don't chat.
MICHAEL	m	Well, actually, I thought I'd run an  idea by you.  You know, just to see if  you're interested.
JOEY	m	We're not.
MICHAEL	m	Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't  you?
MICHAEL	m	But she can't go out with you because  her sister is this insane head case and  no one will go out with her. right?
JOEY	m	Does this conversation have a purpose?
MICHAEL	m	So what you need to do is recruit a guy  who'll go out with her.  Someone who's  up for the job.
MICHAEL	m	Exactly
MICHAEL	m	Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will  on my part.
MICHAEL	m	I have a dick on my face, don't I?
CAMERON	m	You got him involved?
MICHAEL	m	Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when  you let the enemy think he's  orchestrating the battle, you're in a  position of power. We let him pretend  he's calling the shots, and while he's  busy setting up the plan, you have time  to woo Bianca.
CAMERON	m	You're one brilliant guy
KAT	f	So he has this huge raging fit about  Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to  his male-dominated, puking frat boy,  number one golf team school. I have no  say at all.
MANDELLA	?	William would never have gone to a  state school.
KAT	f	William didn't even go to high school
MANDELLA	?	That's never been proven
KAT	f	Neither has his heterosexuality.
KAT	f	I appreciate your efforts toward a  speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?
MANDELLA	?	Does it matter?
KAT	f	If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any  school you want, precious.  Don't forget  your tiara."
MANDELLA	?	Janice Parker told me he was a roadie  for Marilyn Manson.
KAT	f	Janice Parker is an idiot
MISS PERKY	f	I don't understand, Patrick.  You  haven't done anything asinine this week.   Are you not feeling well?
PATRICK	m	Touch of the flu.
MISS PERKY	f	I'm at a loss, then.  What should we  talk about? Your year of absence?
PATRICK	m	How 'bout your sex life?
MISS PERKY	f	Why don't we discuss your driving need  to be a hemorrhoid?
PATRICK	m	What's to discuss?
MISS PERKY	f	You weren't abused, you aren't stupid,  and as far as I can tell, you're only  slightly psychotic -- so why is it that  you're such a fuck-up?
PATRICK	m	Well, you know -- there's the prestige  of the job title... and the benefits  package is pretty good...
MISS PERKY	f	Fine.  Go do something repugnant and  give us something to talk about next  week.
MANDELLA	?	Look, it's really easy.
TREVOR	m	You're a freedom fighter. Be proud,  sister.
MANDELLA	?	It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not  related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a  political figure.  I do not live in  South Africa.  My parents just spent a  few too many acid trips thinking they  were revolutionaries.
TREVOR	m	But you freed our people
MANDELLA	?	Your "people" are white, suburban high  school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I  have not freed you, Trevor. Only you can free yourself.
BIANCA	f	C'esc ma tete. This is my head
CAMERON	m	Right.  See?  You're ready for the  quiz.
BIANCA	f	I don't want to know how to say that  though.  I want to know useful things.   Like where the good stores are.  How  much does champagne cost?  Stuff like  Chat.  I have never in my life had to  point out my head to someone.
CAMERON	m	That's because it's such a nice one.
BIANCA	f	Forget French.
BIANCA	f	How is our little Find the Wench A Date  plan progressing?
CAMERON	m	Well, there's someone I think might be
BIANCA	f	Show me
BIANCA	f	Give me a sign when he walks by.  And  don't point.
CAMERON	m	There.
BIANCA	f	Where?
CAMERON	m	I guess he didn't see me
BIANCA	f	My God, he's repulsive. He's so  perfect!
PATRICK	m	What?
PATRICK	m	Yeah
JOEY	m	What do you think?
PATRICK	m	Two legs, nice rack...
JOEY	m	Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out  with her.
PATRICK	m	Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
JOEY	m	You just said
PATRICK	m	You need money to take a girl out
JOEY	m	But you'd go out with her if you had  the cake?
PATRICK	m	Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had  the plane.
JOEY	m	You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab,  you do the honors.
PATRICK	m	You're gonna pay me to take out some  girl?
JOEY	m	I can't date her sister until that one  gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch.   She doesn't want a boyfriend.
PATRICK	m	How much?
PATRICK	m	I can't take a girl like that out on  twenty bucks.
JOEY	m	Fine, thirty.
JOEY	m	Take it or leave it.  This isn't a  negotiation.
PATRICK	m	Fifty, and you've got your man.
MR. CHAPIN	m	Good run, Stratford.
PATRICK	m	Hey. Girlie.
PATRICK	m	I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
KAT	f	Sweating like a pig, actually.  And  yourself?
PATRICK	m	There's a way to get a guy's attention.
KAT	f	My mission in life.
KAT	f	Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So,  you see, it worked.  The world makes  sense again.
PATRICK	m	Pick you up Friday, then
KAT	f	Oh, right.  Friday.
PATRICK	m	The night I take you to places you've  never been before.  And back.
KAT	f	Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside?   Do you even know my name, screwboy?
PATRICK	m	I know a lot more than that
KAT	f	Doubtful.  Very doubtful.
PATRICK	m	You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
SCURVY	m	So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a  new Blaupunkt.
MICHAEL	m	He took the bait.
BIANCA	f	Have you ever considered a new look? I  mean, seriously, you could have some  potential buried under all this  hostility.
KAT	f	I have the potential to smack the crap  out of you if you don't get out of my  way.
BIANCA	f	Can you at least start wearing a bra?
PATRICK	m	Hey
PATRICK	m	You hate me don't you?
KAT	f	I don't really think you warrant that  strong an emotion.
PATRICK	m	Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at  the track with me.
KAT	f	And why would I do that?
PATRICK	m	Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer,  you with money in your eyes, me with my  hand on your ass...
KAT	f	You -- covered in my vomit.
PATRICK	m	Seven-thirty?
PATRICK	m	Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
KAT	f	Are you following me?
PATRICK	m	I was in the laundromat. I saw your  car. Thought I'd say hi.
KAT	f	Hi
PATRICK	m	You're not a big talker, are you?
KAT	f	Depends on the topic. My fenders don't  really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
KAT	f	Hey -- do you mind?
JOEY	m	Not at all
JOEY	m	You fucking bitch!
WALTER	m	My insurance does not cover PMS
KAT	f	Then tell them I had a seizure.
WALTER	m	Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You  punishing me?
KAT	f	I thought you were punishing me.
WALTER	m	Why can't we agree on this?
KAT	f	Because you're making decisions for me.
WALTER	m	As a parent, that's my right
KAT	f	So what I want doesn't matter?
WALTER	m	You're eighteen.  You don't know what  you want.  You won't know until you're  forty-five and you don't have it.
KAT	f	I want to go to an East Coast school! I  want you to trust me to make my own  choices.  I want --
WALTER	m	Christ!  I want a night to go by that  I'm not staring a contraction in the  face.
JOEY	m	When I shell out fifty, I expect  results.
PATRICK	m	I'm on it
JOEY	m	Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't  count as a date.
PATRICK	m	I got her under control. She just acts  crazed in public to keep up the image.
JOEY	m	Let me put it to you this way, if you  don't get any action, I don't get any  action.  So get your ass on hers by the  end of the week.
PATRICK	m	I just upped my price
JOEY	m	What?
PATRICK	m	A hundred bucks a date.
JOEY	m	Forget it.
PATRICK	m	Forget her sister, then.
JOEY	m	You better hope you're as smooth as you  think you are, Verona.
CAMERON	m	La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance?
BIANCA	f	A "copine" is someone you can count on.   An "ami" is someone who makes promises  he can't keep.
CAMERON	m	You got something on your mind?
BIANCA	f	I counted on you to help my cause. You  and that thug are obviously failing.   Aren't we ever going on our date?
CAMERON	m	You have my word.  As a gentleman
BIANCA	f	You're sweet.
CAMERON	m	How do you get your hair to look like  that?
BIANCA	f	Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days.   And I never, ever use a blowdryer  without the diffuser attachment.
CAMERON	m	You know, I read an article about that.
BIANCA	f	You did?
PATRICK	m	Say it
MICHAEL	m	What?
PATRICK	m	Whatever the hell it is you're standin'  there waitin' to say.
CAMERON	m	We wanted to talk to you about the  plan.
PATRICK	m	What plan?
MICHAEL	m	The situation is, my man Cameron here  has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
PATRICK	m	What is it with this chick?  She have  three tits?
MICHAEL	m	I think I speak correctly when I say  that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than  say -- Joey Dorsey's.
PATRICK	m	Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm  just in this for the cash.
MICHAEL	m	That's where we can help you.  With  Kat.
PATRICK	m	So Dorsey can get the girl?
MICHAEL	m	Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the  big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set  this whole thing up so Cameron can get  the girl.
PATRICK	m	You two are gonna help me tame the wild  beast?
MICHAEL	m	We're your guys.
CAMERON	m	And he means that strictly in a non-  prison-movie type of way.
PATRICK	m	Yeah -- we'll see.
MICHAEL	m	We're in.
CAMERON	m	This is it.  A golden opportunity.  Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
MICHAEL	m	In that case, we'll need to make it a  school-wide blow out.
CAMERON	m	Will Bogey get bent?
MICHAEL	m	Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself  with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
JOEY	m	Which do you like better?
BIANCA	f	I think I like the white shirt
JOEY	m	It's more
BIANCA	f	Expensive?
JOEY	m	Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's  thing on Saturday?
BIANCA	f	Hopefully.
JOEY	m	Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if  you won't be there.
BIANCA	f	Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's  party?
CAMERON	m	Sure have.
BIANCA	f	I really, really, really wanna go, but  I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
CAMERON	m	I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem  to be goin' for him.
CAMERON	m	She's not a...
BIANCA	f	Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of  Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm  pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex  tendencies.
CAMERON	m	So that's the kind of guy she likes?  Pretty ones?
BIANCA	f	Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say  is that she'd dip before dating a guy  that smokes.
CAMERON	m	All right.  What else is she partial  to?
PATRICK	m	Lou, it's okay.  They're with me.
PATRICK	m	What've you got for me?
CAMERON	m	I've retrieved certain pieces of  information on Miss Katarina Stratford I  think you'll find helpful.
PATRICK	m	What?!
MICHAEL	m	Good enough.
CAMERON	m	Number one.  She hates smokers
MICHAEL	m	It's a lung cancer issue
CAMERON	m	Her favorite uncle
MICHAEL	m	Dead at forty-one.
PATRICK	m	Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
MICHAEL	m	Just for now.
CAMERON	m	Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat  likes -- pretty guys.
PATRICK	m	What?  You don't think I'm pretty?
MICHAEL	m	He's pretty!
CAMERON	m	Okay!  I wasn't sure
CAMERON	m	Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist  prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of  the indie-rock persuasion".
PATRICK	m	So what does that give me?  I'm  supposed to buy her some noodles and a  book and sit around listening to chicks  who can't play their instruments?
MICHAEL	m	Ever been to Club Skunk?
PATRICK	m	Yeah.
CAMERON	m	Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow  night.
PATRICK	m	Don't make me do it, man
MICHAEL	m	Assail your ears for one night.
CAMERON	m	It's her favorite band.
MICHAEL	m	I also retrieved a list of her most  recent CD purchases, courtesy of  American Express.
PATRICK	m	Michael -- did you get this information  "illegally"?
MICHAEL	m	I prefer to think of it simply as an  alternative to what the law allows.
PATRICK	m	I'm likin' you guys better
PATRICK	m	This is really music?
BIANCA	f	Can you turn down the Screaming  Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study.
BIANCA	f	Don't tell me you're actually going  out?  On a school night, no less.
BIANCA	f	Oh my God, does this mean you're  becoming normal?
KAT	f	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at  Club Skunk and we're going.
BIANCA	f	Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask,  but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's  party Saturday night?
KAT	f	What do you think?
BIANCA	f	I think you're a freak.  I think you do  this to torture me.  And I think you  suck.
KAT	f	Let's hit it.
MANDELLA	?	You think this'll work?
KAT	f	No fear.
KAT	f	Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss!
BRUCE	m	I can count.
MANDELLA	?	I'll bet you can..
BRUCE	m	Go ahead. And you
MANDELLA	?	Yes?
BRUCE	m	Take it easy on the guys in there.
BRUCE	m	Next time, leave the Bic at home,  Skippy.
SKIPPY	m	It's a bottle opener.
BRUCE	m	Verona, my man.
PATRICK	m	Always a pleasure, Brucie.
BRUCE	m	Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss  fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen  belly-button ring for you?
PATRICK	m	Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of  minors come in?
BRUCE	m	Never
PATRICK	m	Padua girls.  One tall, decent body.  The other one kinda short and  undersexed?
BRUCE	m	Just sent 'em through.
BRUCE	m	Hey -- what happened to that chick you  brought last time?  The one with the  snake?
LEAD SINGER	m	Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and  we're from Olympia.
LEAD SINGER	m	Meow
KAT	f	I need agua!
KAT	f	Shit
KAT	f	Two waters.
KAT	f	You're not fooling anyone.
PATRICK	m	hey.  Great show, huh?
PATRICK	m	Excuse me?
KAT	f	That's what you want, isn't it?
PATRICK	m	Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it  for me.
KAT	f	You're not surrounded by your usual  cloud of smoke.
PATRICK	m	I know.  I quit.
KAT	f	Oh, really?
PATRICK	m	You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill  or The Raincoats, but they're right up  there.
KAT	f	You know who The Raincoats are?
PATRICK	m	Why, don't you?
PATRICK	m	I watched you out there   I've never  seen you look like that
PATRICK	m	Come to that party with me.
KAT	f	What?
PATRICK	m	I got it, Rick.
PATRICK	m	Nine-thirty then.
MANDELLA	?	What'd he say?
KAT	f	Who cares?
MANDELLA	?	Has he importun'd you with love in  honourable fashion?
MANDELLA	?	Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor  of romance.  You're the one that wants  to march on Washington every five  minutes.
KAT	f	Gigglepuss was so beyond.
MANDELLA	?	They were.  I only wish William could  have been here to witness the rebirth of  punk rock with us.
KAT	f	So true.
CAMERON	m	So, then she says that she almost  didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that  dress because she thought she was  mixing, you know, genres. And the fact  that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here - "really meant something."
MICHAEL	m	You told me that part already.
CAMERON	m	Hell, I've just been going over the  whole thing in my head and -
JOEY	m	Hey.  Dingo Boingo
JOEY	m	I hear you're helpin' Verona.
MICHAEL	m	Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
JOEY	m	You and Verona?
MICHAEL	m	What?  We took bathes together when we  were kids.
JOEY	m	What's your gig in all this?
CAMERON	m	I'm just the new guy.
JOEY	m	You better not fuck this up.  I'm  heavily invested.
MICHAEL	m	Hey -- it's all for the higher good  right?
CAMERON	m	Is it about me?
MISS PERKY	f	You're completely demented.
PATRICK	m	See you next week!
PATRICK/KAT	?	Yeah/No.
MISS PERKY	f	Dear God, stay away from her.  If you  two ever decided to breed, evil would  truly walk the earth.
BIANCA	f	She's obviously not going.
BIANCA	f	Daddy, I --
WALTER	m	And where're you going?
BIANCA	f	If you must know, we were attempting to  go to a small study group of friends.
WALTER	m	Otherwise known as an orgy?
BIANCA	f	It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew  you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria  Steinem" over there isn't going --
WALTER	m	Do you know about any party? Katarina?
BIANCA	f	Daddy, people expect me to be there!
WALTER	m	If Kat's not going, you're not going.
BIANCA	f	You're ruining my life'  Because you  won't be normal, I can't be normal.
KAT	f	What's normal?
BIANCA	f	Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but  you're too busy listening to Bitches Who  Need Prozac to know that.
WALTER	m	What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
BIANCA	f	Can't you forget for just one night  that you're completely wretched?
KAT	f	At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked  hedge-pig.
BIANCA	f	Like I'm supposed to know what that  even means.
KAT	f	It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard  of him?
BIANCA	f	Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's  boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not  allowed to go out, I should obsess over  a dead guy, too.
WALTER	m	Girls
KAT	f	I know about the goddamn party.  I'm  going.
WALTER	m	Oh, God.  It's starting.
BIANCA	f	It's just a party. Daddy.
WALTER	m	Wear the belly before you go.
BIANCA	f	Daddy, no!
WALTER	m	Just for a minute
WALTER	m	I want you to realize the weight of  your decisions.
BIANCA	f	You are so completely unbalanced.
KAT	f	Can we go now?
WALTER	m	Promise me you won't talk to any boys  unless your sister is present.
BIANCA	f	Why?
WALTER	m	Because she'll scare them away.
PATRICK	m	Nine-thirty right?
PATRICK	m	I'm early.
KAT	f	I'm driving.
PATRICK	m	Who knocked up your sister?
BOGEY	m	Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the  right, shots in the kitchen.
JOEY	m	Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
KAT	f	Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline  just recede?
JOEY	m	Where ya goin?
KAT	f	Away.
JOEY	m	Your sister here?
KAT	f	Leave my sister alone.
JOEY	m	And why would I do that?
JOCK	m	A fight!
COFFEE KID #1	m	That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you  Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.
JOEY	m	Just who I was looking for.
PATRICK	m	What's this?
KAT	f	"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that  what you're supposed to do at a party?
PATRICK	m	I say, do what you wanna do.
KAT	f	Funny, you're the only one
MICHAEL	m	Moose, my man!  Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters  have already started calling.
MICHAEL	m	Yo, Clem.  A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new  Leanne Rimes.  Ziggy, peace, bra.  Prefers a water pipe, but has been  known to use a bong.
MICHAEL	m	Follow the love, man
BIANCA	f	Where did he go?  He was just here.
CHASTITY	f	Who?
BIANCA	f	Joey.
CAMERON	m	Evening, ladies.
BIANCA	f	Hi.
CAMERON	m	Looks like things worked out tonight,  huh?
BIANCA	f	You know Chastity?
CAMERON	m	I believe we share an art instructor
CHASTITY	f	Great
BIANCA	f	Would you mind getting me a drink,  Cameron?
CAMERON	m	Certainly Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
BIANCA	f	Surprise me.
MICHAEL	m	Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
CAMERON	m	The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy  just picks up a girl and carries her  away while you're talking to her?
MICHAEL	m	Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're  making progress.
CAMERON	m	No, I ' m not.
CAMERON	m	She used me!  She wants to go out with  Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot!
MICHAEL	m	At least you're self-aware
JOEY	m	So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog  thing going -- and the tube sock gig "  that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up  for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
BIANCA	f	Queen Harry?
JOEY	m	It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be,  like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
BIANCA	f	Neat...
JOEY	m	My agent says I've got a good shot at  being the Prada guy next year.
BIANCA	f	I'll be right back.
BIANCA	f	He practically proposed when he found  out we had the same dermatologist. I  mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all,  but he's not exactly relevant party  conversation.
CHASTITY	f	Is he oily or dry?
BIANCA	f	Combination.  I don't know -- I thought  he'd be different.  More of a  gentleman...
CHASTITY	f	Bianca, I don't think the highlights of  dating Joey Dorsey are going to include  door-opening and coat-holding.
BIANCA	f	Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're  supposed to want to go out with are the  ones we actually want to go out with,  you know?
CHASTITY	f	All I know is -- I'd give up my private  line to go out with a guy like Joey.
KAT	f	Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need  to tell you --
BIANCA	f	I really don't think I need any social  advice from you right now.
KAT	f	I want another one
JOEY	m	My man
PATRICK	m	It's about time.
JOEY	m	A deal's a deal.
JOEY	m	How'd you do it?
PATRICK	m	Do what?
JOEY	m	Get her to act like a human
PATRICK	m	Okay?
KAT	f	I'm fine. I'm
PATRICK	m	You're not okay.
KAT	f	I just need to lie down for awhile
PATRICK	m	Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to  sleep
KAT	f	I know, just let me sleep
PATRICK	m	What if you have a concussion? My dog  went to sleep with a concussion and woke  up a vegetable. Not that I could tell  the difference...
KAT	f	Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake,  okay?
PATRICK	m	C'mon, let's walk
PATRICK	m	Cameron, I'm a little busy
CAMERON	m	It's off. The whole thing.
PATRICK	m	What 're you talking about?
CAMERON	m	She's partial to Joey, not me
PATRICK	m	Cameron -- do you like the girl?
CAMERON	m	Sure
PATRICK	m	Then, go get her
KAT	f	This is so patronizing.
PATRICK	m	Leave it to you to use big words when  you're shitfaced.
KAT	f	Why 're you doing this?
PATRICK	m	I told you
KAT	f	You don't care if I die
PATRICK	m	Sure, I do
KAT	f	Why?
PATRICK	m	Because then I'd have to start taking  out girls who like me.
KAT	f	Like you could find one
PATRICK	m	See that?  Who needs affection when  I've got blind hatred?
KAT	f	Just let me sit down.
PATRICK	m	How's that?
PATRICK	m	Jesus.  You're like a weeble
PATRICK	m	Why'd you let him get to you?
KAT	f	Who?
PATRICK	m	Dorsey.
KAT	f	I hate him.
PATRICK	m	I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big  deal to get you to mainline tequila. You  don't seem like the type.
KAT	f	Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can  be "cool"?  You don't think I can be  "laid back" like everyone else?
PATRICK	m	I thought you were above all that
KAT	f	You know what they say
PATRICK	m	No. What do they say?
PATRICK	m	Shit!
PATRICK	m	Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up  damn it!
PATRICK	m	Kat! Wake up!
KAT	f	What?
PATRICK	m	I thought you were...
KAT	f	Go away
BIANCA	f	Dinner taste better on the way out?
BIANCA	f	I don't get you.  You act like you're  too good for any of this, and then you  go totally apeshit when you get here.
KAT	f	You're welcome.
PATRICK	m	Cute
JOEY	m	A bunch of us are going to Jaret's  house.  Wanna come?
BIANCA	f	I have to be home in twenty minutes.
CHASTITY	f	I don't have to be home 'til two.
JOEY	m	Then, c'mon. Maybe next time --
CAMERON	m	Have fun tonight?
BIANCA	f	Tons
BIANCA	f	Cameron?
BIANCA	f	Do you think you could give me a ride  home?
PATRICK	m	I'm driving, so I get to pick the  tunes.
KAT	f	It's my car.
PATRICK	m	And I'm in control of it.
KAT	f	But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like  them.  I saw you there.
KAT	f	When you were gone last year -- where  were you?
PATRICK	m	Busy
KAT	f	Were you in jail?
PATRICK	m	Maybe.
KAT	f	No, you weren't
PATRICK	m	Then why'd you ask?
KAT	f	Why'd you lie?
KAT	f	I should do this.
PATRICK	m	Do what?
KAT	f	This.
PATRICK	m	Start a band?
KAT	f	My father wouldn't approve of that that
PATRICK	m	You don't strike me as the type that  would ask permission.
KAT	f	Oh, so now you think you know me?
PATRICK	m	I'm gettin' there
KAT	f	The only thing people know about me is  that I'm "scary".
PATRICK	m	So what ' s up with your dad?  He a  pain in the ass?
KAT	f	He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
PATRICK	m	Who?
PATRICK	m	No offense, but you're sister is  without.  I know everyone likes her and  all, but ...
KAT	f	You know -- you're not as vile as I  thought you were.
PATRICK	m	So, I'll see you in school
CAMERON	m	I looked for you back at the party, but  you always seemed to be "occupied".
BIANCA	f	I was?
CAMERON	m	You never wanted to go out with 'me,  did you?
BIANCA	f	Well, no...
CAMERON	m	Then that's all you had to say.
BIANCA	f	But
CAMERON	m	You always been this selfish?
CAMERON	m	Just because you're beautiful, doesn't  mean you can treat people like they  don't matter.
CAMERON	m	And I'm back in the saddle.
DEREK	m	Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of  my heart.
CLEM	m	Yippe kai-aye, bra.  Dance for me, cowgirl.
CLEM	m	Okay, now tell me again why he didn't  shoot the deputy?
DEREK	m	Because the deputy meant him no harm,  my friend.  It was only the sheriff that  was the oppressor.
JOEY	m	Kat, babe, you were on fire.
MRS. BLAISE	f	Well now, did everyone have a good  weekend?
JOEY	m	Maybe we should ask Verona
MRS. BLAISE	f	Okay then.  Well. Oh, yes
MRS. BLAISE	f	I'd like you all to write your own  version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.
MRS. BLAISE	f	Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme,  whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate  on his theme, however. Let's read it  aloud, shall we? Anyone?
MRS. BLAISE	f	Derek?
DEREK	m	In faith, I do not love thee with mine  eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors  note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what  they despise/ Who in despite of view is  pleas 'd to dote.
CLEM	m	Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom  pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as  a laxative on my person.
MANDELLA	?	You went to the party?  I thought we  were officially opposed to suburban  social activity.
KAT	f	I didn't have a choice.
MANDELLA	?	You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat  and what have you done with her?
KAT	f	I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
MANDELLA	?	You didn't
KAT	f	I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected.   It was big fun.
PATRICK	m	Hey
MICHAEL	m	So you got cozy with she who stings?
PATRICK	m	No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that  I'm about to lose.
CAMERON	m	What'd you do to her?
PATRICK	m	I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was  too drunk to remember it.
MICHAEL	m	I'm on it
MICHAEL	m	Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
MANDELLA	?	Hi.
MICHAEL	m	Cool pictures.  You a fan?
MANDELLA	?	Yeah.  I guess.
MANDELLA	?	You think?
MICHAEL	m	Oh yeah.
MANDELLA	?	Who could refrain that had a heart to  love and in that heart, courage to make  ' B love known?
MICHAEL	m	Macbeth, right?
MANDELLA	?	Right.
MICHAEL	m	Kat a fan, too?
MANDELLA	?	Yeah...
MICHAEL	m	So, listen... I have this friend
CAMERON	m	She hates you with the fire of a  thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
PATRICK	m	She just needs time to cool off I'll  give it a day.
PATRICK	m	Maybe two.
PATRICK	m	You makin' any headway?
CAMERON	m	She kissed me.
PATRICK	m	Where?
JOEY	m	Don't talk to me about the sweetest  date.  That little halo Bianca is gonna  be prone and proven on prom night.  Six  virgins in a row.
PATRICK	m	I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the  flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
JOEY	m	Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I  know.
JOEY	m	Take it
KAT	f	Can you even imagine?  Who the hell  would go to this a bastion of commercial  excess?
MANDELLA	?	Well, I guess we're not, since we don't  have dates .
KAT	f	Listen to you!  You sound like Betty,  all pissed off because Archie is taking  Veronica.
MANDELLA	?	Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like  I have a dress anyway
KAT	f	You ' re looking at this from the wrong  perspective.  We're making a statement.
MANDELLA	?	Oh, good.  Something new and different  for us.
JOEY	m	Hey, sweet cheeks.
BIANCA	f	Hi, Joey.
JOEY	m	You're concentrating awfully hard  considering it's gym class.
JOEY	m	Listen, I want to talk to you about the  prom.
BIANCA	f	You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat  doesn't go --
JOEY	m	Your sister is going.
BIANCA	f	Since when?
JOEY	m	I'm taking care of it.
PATRICK	m	Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine  Mystique?  I lost my copy.
KAT	f	What are you doing here?
PATRICK	m	I heard there was a poetry reading.
KAT	f	You 're so --
PATRICK	m	Pleasant?
PATRICK	m	Wholesome.
KAT	f	Unwelcome.
PATRICK	m	Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has  her panties in a twist.
KAT	f	Don't for one minute think that you had  any effect whatsoever on my panties.
PATRICK	m	So what did I have an effect on ?
KAT	f	Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
PATRICK	m	You were right. She's still pissed.
MICHAEL	m	Sweet love, renew thy force!
PATRICK	m	Man -- don't say shit like that to  me.  People can hear you.
CAMERON	m	You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice   yourself on the altar of dignity and   even the score.
MICHAEL	m	Best case scenario, you're back on the  payroll for awhile.
PATRICK	m	What's the worst?
CAMERON	m	You get the girl.
PATRICK	m	If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
PATRICK	m	"I'd hide it to myself.  And never talk  about it.  And didn't I go and shout it  when you walked into the room --"
PATRICK	m	" I think I love you I "
MISCREANT	m	Nice song, Verona.
PATRICK	m	Flog me.
KAT	f	Sir, I'd like to state for the record  that Mr. Verona ' s current  incarceration is unnecessary.  I never  filed a complaint.
MR. CHAPIN	m	You didn't have to.  He disrupted a  classroom.
KAT	f	But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a  simple serenade warrants a week of  detention.  There are far more hideous  acts than off-key singing being  performed by the student body on a  regular basis.
MR. CHAPIN	m	You're not gonna change my mind, Kat.  Rules stick.
KAT	f	Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something  I've always wanted to show you.
MR. CHAPIN	m	What?
KAT	f	These.
MR. CHAPIN	m	I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.   But if I catch you doing that again,  you'll be in here with the rest of these  guys.
KAT	f	Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
KAT	f	He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he  cruised on me.
PATRICK	m	I guess I never told you I'm afraid of  heights.
KAT	f	C'mon.  It's not that bad
PATRICK	m	Try lookin' at it from this angle
KAT	f	Put your right foot there --
PATRICK	m	Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
KAT	f	You want me to climb up and show you  how to get down?
PATRICK	m	Maybe.
KAT	f	You shit!
KAT	f	The Partridge Family?
PATRICK	m	I figured it had to be something  ridiculous to win your respect.  And  piss you off.
KAT	f	Good call.
PATRICK	m	So how'd you get Chapin to look the  other way?
KAT	f	I dazzled him with my wit
PATRICK	m	A soft side? Who knew?
KAT	f	Yeah, well, don't let it get out
PATRICK	m	So what's your excuse?
KAT	f	Acting the way we do.
PATRICK	m	Yes
KAT	f	I don't like to do what people expect.   Then they expect it all the time and  they get disappointed when you change.
PATRICK	m	So if you disappoint them from the  start, you're covered?
KAT	f	Something like that
PATRICK	m	Then you screwed up
KAT	f	How?
PATRICK	m	You never disappointed me.
PATRICK	m	You up for it?
KAT	f	For. . . ?
KAT	f	Damn it!
KID	m	Look, Mom
KAT	f	State trooper?
PATRICK	m	Fallacy.
KAT	f	The duck?
PATRICK	m	Hearsay.
KAT	f	I know the porn career's a lie.
PATRICK	m	Do you?
KAT	f	Tell me something true.
PATRICK	m	I hate peas.
KAT	f	No -- something real.  Something no one  else knows.
PATRICK	m	You're sweet.  And sexy.  And  completely hot for me.
KAT	f	What?
PATRICK	m	No one else knows
KAT	f	You're amazingly self-assured. Has  anyone ever told you that?
PATRICK	m	Go to the prom with me
KAT	f	Is that a request or a command?
PATRICK	m	You know what I mean
KAT	f	No.
PATRICK	m	No what?
KAT	f	No, I won't go with you
PATRICK	m	Why not?
KAT	f	Because I don't want to. It's a stupid  tradition.
PATRICK	m	People won't expect you to go...
KAT	f	Why are you doing this?
KAT	f	All of it -- what's in it for you?
KAT	f	Create a little drama?  Start a new  rumor?  What?
PATRICK	m	So I have to have a motive to be with  you?
KAT	f	You tell me.
PATRICK	m	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told  you that?
KAT	f	Answer the question, Patrick
PATRICK	m	Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me.   Just the pleasure of your company.
PATRICK	m	cover that up
BIANCA	f	Quick question -- are you going to the  prom?
BIANCA	f	Then Guillermo says, "If you go any  lighter, you're gonna look like an extra  on 90210."
CAMERON	m	No...
BIANCA	f	do you listen to this crap?
CAMERON	m	What crap?
BIANCA	f	Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm  like, boring myself.
CAMERON	m	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more  story about your coiffure...
CAMERON	m	I figured you'd get to the good stuff  eventually.
BIANCA	f	What good stuff?
CAMERON	m	The "real you".
BIANCA	f	Like my fear of wearing pastels?
BIANCA	f	I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become  this "persona"?  And you don't know how  to quit?
CAMERON	m	No
BIANCA	f	Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how  to lie.
TREVOR	m	You're gonna look splendiferous in  that, Mandella.
TREVOR	m	that's cool to say.
SHARON	f	Would you rather be ravished by a  pirate or a British rear admiral?
WALTER	m	Pirate -- no question.
BIANCA	f	Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with  you. It's tomorrow night --
WALTER	m	The prom?  Kat has a date?
BIANCA	f	No, but
WALTER	m	It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s  who you want me to bend my rules for?
BIANCA	f	He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that  is.
WALTER	m	You're not going unless your sister  goes.  End of story.
BIANCA	f	Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my  own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a  possession!
WALTER	m	You know what happens at proms?
SHARON	f	They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll  come home.  Let her go.
WALTER	m	Kissing?  Is that what you think  happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up  to my elbows in placenta all day.
KAT	f	Listen, I know you hate having to sit  home because I'm not Susie High School.
BIANCA	f	Like you care.
KAT	f	I do care. But I'm a firm believer in  doing something for your own reasons,  not someone else ' s .
BIANCA	f	I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only  sophomore that got asked to the prom and  I can't go, because you won ' t.
KAT	f	Joey never told you we went out, did  he?
BIANCA	f	What?
KAT	f	In 9th.  For a month
BIANCA	f	Why?
KAT	f	He was, like, a total babe
BIANCA	f	But you hate Joey
KAT	f	Now I do.  Back then, was a different  story.
BIANCA	f	As in...
KAT	f	He said everyone was doing it.  So I  did it.
BIANCA	f	You did what?
KAT	f	Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I  didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready.   He got pissed.  Then he broke up with  me.
BIANCA	f	But
KAT	f	After that, I swore I'd never do  anything just because "everyone else"  was doing it.  And I haven't since.  Except for Bogey's party, and my  stunning gastro-intestinal display --
BIANCA	f	Why didn't you tell me?
KAT	f	I wanted to let you make up your own  mind about him.
BIANCA	f	No. you didn't!  If you really thought  I could make my own decisions, you  would've let me go out with him instead  of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
KAT	f	That's not
BIANCA	f	I'm not stupid enough to repeat your  mistakes.
KAT	f	I guess I thought I was protecting you.
BIANCA	f	God, you're just like him! Just keep me  locked away in the dark, so I can't  experience anything for myself
KAT	f	Not all experiences are good, Bianca.  You can't always trust the people you  want to.
BIANCA	f	I guess I'll never know, will I?
BIANCA	f	Come in.
KAT	f	Feel like shopping?
WALTER	m	What do you wanna watch?  We've got  crap, crap, crap or crap
SHARON	f	Dr. Ruth?
BIANCA	f	Hi, Mommy.
SHARON	f	Honey, you look beautiful!
BIANCA	f	You like?  My date should be here in  five.
WALTER	m	I'm missing something.
BIANCA	f	I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a  captain of oppression like some men we  know.
CAMERON	m	Wow
BIANCA	f	Let's go.
SHARON	f	Have a great time, honey!
WALTER	m	But -- who -- what --?
KAT	f	Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See  you in a few.
WALTER	m	What just happened?
SHARON	f	Your daughters went to the prom.
WALTER	m	Did I have anything to say about it?
SHARON	f	Absolutely not.
WALTER	m	That ' s what I thought
JOEY	m	I'm here to pick up Bianca.
WALTER	m	late
KAT	f	How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
PATRICK	m	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted.   Where'd you get the dress?
KAT	f	It's just something I had.  You know
PATRICK	m	Oh huh
KAT	f	Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I  questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
PATRICK	m	No prob.
KAT	f	are you ready?
KAT	f	C'mon.  Let's get this over with.
KAT	f	Quite the ostentatious display
PATRICK	m	Look, Clem even wore his good boots
MANDELLA	?	Have you seen him?
KAT	f	Who?
MANDELLA	?	William - he asked me to meet him here.
KAT	f	Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't'  progressed to full-on hallucinations.
MICHAEL	m	Mi' lady.
BIANCA	f	What are you doing here?
CHASTITY	f	You think you ' re the only sophomore  at the prom?
BIANCA	f	I did.
CHASTITY	f	And just so you know, my date isn't  planning on spending most of the night  in his backseat.
CHASTITY	f	Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - -  your cherry. He practically made a  public announcement.
CHASTITY	f	I wanted to tell you
PATRICK	m	My grandmother's .
KAT	f	What?
PATRICK	m	That's where I was last year.  She'd  never lived alone -- my grandfather died  -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail,  I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've  never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent  a year sitting next to my grandma on the  couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of  story.
KAT	f	That ' s completely adorable!
PATRICK	m	It gets worse -- you still have your  freshman yearbook?
JOEY	m	What's Bianca doing here with that  cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let  some little punk ass snake me.
MICHAEL	m	Feces hitting fan.  C'mon
MICHAEL	m	Joey, pal, compadre.  Let's take it  easy.
CAMERON	m	Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.
DEREK	m	Very uncool, my brother
JOEY	m	I'm not your brother, white boy.
JOEY	m	Just so you know -- she'll only spread  her legs once.
BIANCA	f	That's for making my date bleed
BIANCA	f	That's for my sister.
BIANCA	f	And that's for me.
COWBOY	m	And that's for the fourth grade,  asshole.
PATRICK	m	Wait I...
KAT	f	You were paid to take me out!  By --  the one person I truly hate.  I knew it  was a set-up!
PATRICK	m	It wasn't like that.
KAT	f	Really?  What was it like?  A down  payment now, then a bonus for sleeping  with me?
PATRICK	m	I didn't care about the money.
PATRICK	m	I cared about --
KAT	f	You are so not what I thought you were.
BIANCA	f	Are you sure you don't want to come  with us?  It'll be fun.
KAT	f	I ' m sure .
BIANCA	f	You looked beautiful last night, you  know.
KAT	f	So did you
CAMERON	m	She okay?
BIANCA	f	I hope so.
WALTER	m	Was that your sister?
KAT	f	Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big  ones.  Full of sperm.
WALTER	m	Funny.
WALTER	m	I don't understand the allure of  dehydrated food.  Is this something I  should be hip to?
KAT	f	No, Daddy.
WALTER	m	So tell me about this dance. Was it  fun?
KAT	f	Parts of it.
WALTER	m	Which parts?
KAT	f	The part where Bianca beat the hell out  of some guy.
WALTER	m	Bianca did what?
KAT	f	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed  off on her?
WALTER	m	No -- impressed.
WALTER	m	You know, fathers don't like to admit  that their daughters are capable of  running their own lives.  It means we've  become spectators.  Bianca still lets me  play a few innings.  You've had me on  the bleachers for years.  When you go to  Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to  watch the game.
KAT	f	When I go?
WALTER	m	Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've  changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a  check.
CAMERON	m	I'd like to express my apologies.
KAT	f	For what?
CAMERON	m	I didn't mean for you to get -- When  Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend,  I had no idea it would turn out so --  ugly. I would never have  done anything  to compromise your - - -
TEACHER	m	Who can tell me at what point Lucentio  admits his deception?
KAT	f	Family emergency.
BIANCA	f	Let go!
KAT	f	You set me up.
BIANCA	f	I just wanted --
KAT	f	What? To completely damage me?  To send  me to therapy forever? What?
BIANCA	f	No! I just wanted
MISS PERKY	f	Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my  office?
MISS PERKY	f	So you're the real bitch
BIANCA	f	Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch.   I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I  could.  Apparently, this makes me a  horrible person.  I'm sorry.
BIANCA	f	I swear -- I didn't know about the  money.  I didn't even know Joey was  involved.  I would never intentionally  hurt you, Kat.
MISS PERKY	f	Do you care to respond?
KAT	f	Am I supposed to feel better? Like,  right now?  Or do I have some time to  think about it?
MISS PERKY	f	Just smack her now.
BIANCA	f	We'll be getting back to you.
MISS PERKY	f	What, no hug?
BIANCA	f	Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or  is it just me?
KAT	f	It's just you.
MRS. BLAISE	f	All right.  I'm assuming everyone found  time to compose, their poems. Except for  Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.
MRS. BLAISE	f	Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?
KAT	f	I'11 go
MRS. BLAISE	f	Oh, Lord.
MRS. BLAISE	f	Please proceed.
KAT	f	I hate the way you talk to me/ and the  way you cut your hair/ I hate the way  you drive my car/ I hate it when you  stare.
KAT	f	I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and  the way you read my mind/ I hate you so  much it makes me sick/ it even makes me  rhyme.
KAT	f	I hate the way you're always right/ I  hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you  make me laugh/ even worse when you make  me cry/ I hate it that you're not  around/ and the fact that you didn't  call/ But mostly I hate the way I don '  t hate you/ not even close, not even a  little bit, not even any at all.
KAT	f	A Fender Strat. You bought this?
PATRICK	m	I thought you could use it. When you  start your band.
PATRICK	m	Besides, I had some extra cash. Some  asshole paid me to take out a really  great girl.
KAT	f	Is that right?
PATRICK	m	Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for  her.
PATRICK	m	You know -- it's not every day you find  a girl who'll flash her tits to get you  out of detention.
KAT	f	You can't just buy me a guitar every  time you screw up, you know.
PATRICK	m	I know
KAT	f	And don't just think you can
KAT	f	Why is my veggie burger the only burnt  object on this grill?
PATRICK	m	Because I like to torture you.
KAT	f	Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman  yearbook?
PATRICK	m	Don ' t you even dare. . .
CAMERON	m	They do to!
BIANCA	f	They do not!
CAMERON	m	Can someone please tell her that  sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?
MANDELLA	?	I can't remember a word of Shakespeare  right now. Isn't that weird?
KAT	f	You're freaked over this, aren't you?
BIANCA	f	He's more than freaked.  He's froke
KAT	f	I'd like to call your attention to  Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look  of 1995 ---
BIANCA	f	Patrick -- is that- a.
KAT	f	Perm?
PATRICK	m	Ask my attorney.
