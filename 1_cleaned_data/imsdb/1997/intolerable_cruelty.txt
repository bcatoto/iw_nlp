MAN	m	Number Seven.
MAN	m	Zing!
MAN	m	Choo! Choo!...
MAN	m	I'm a locomotive, baby! I'm the Wabash  cannonball! I'm a hunka-hunka  burninnnnn' love! I got fire in my  boiler and a fuh -- a fuh --
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Tickets, please.
MAN	m	Excuse me, Miss, is this the train  to Ecsssstasy?
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're  comin' to a tunnel!
MAN	m	I'm gonna nail your ass!
MAN	m	I'm gonna nail your ass!!
MAN	m	I'm gonna nail your ass!
GUS	m	I nailed his ass.
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	Trains...
MARYLIN	f	...I thought he'd outgrown trains.
GUS	m	They never grow-up, lady. They just  get tubby. Me, I've always had ample  proportions. But it's all muscle --  I'm hard as a rock. I'm not on of  these cream puff sit-behind-a desk  private dicks; I'm an assnailer
MARYLIN	f	So I see.
VOICE	m	I'm gonna nail your ass.
MARYLIN	f	Hard to believe that's the best he  could do.
GUS	m	Probably you're the best he could  do.
MARYLIN	f	Oh. Thank you.
GUS	m	You're takin' it pretty well. I seen  'em weep like they'd hired me to  prove their husbands weren't fooling  around. And I seen 'em celebrate.  Like I just handed 'em a winning  lottery ticket.
MARYLIN	f	I'm just enjoying the movie.
MILES	m	-- hello Marjory, any messages? Yeah?  Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have Wrigley look  up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its  relevance to the Chapman filing. She  took the kids where? Tahoe? Which  side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise  goes all the way around the lake,  she left the state and she's in  breach. She can't leave the state.  Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to  attach everything. Primary residence,  autos, stocks... Sure. Put him through. Hello Ross. What? She's sleeping  with the nanny? Well, you're  separated. She can sleep with -- is  this the one you slept with? Oh. A  guy? Interesting career choice. Hmmm?  Yes. I know you want her dead.  Everyone in your tax bracket wants  their ex wives dead.
REX	m	Honey! ...Honey?!
MARYLIN	f	Rex. Get away from the door.
REX	m	Look, Marylin, can't we have a  civilized discussion about this?
MARYLIN	f	We are. And it's winding down.
REX	m	But Marylin, you know a divorce would  ruin me right now. Everything I have --  everything we have -- is tied up in  my business. The business is my entire  life.
MARYLIN	f	Are you forgetting about the Atcheson,  Topeka and the Santa Fe?
REX	m	Marylin?
MARYLIN	f	Rex. Go away. I don't want to have  to sic the dogs on you.
REX	m	Dogs?
RECEPTIONIST	m	Mr. Massey will be right with you.
MILES	m	The problem is that everyone is  willing to compromise. That's the  problem with the institution of  marriage -- it's based on compromise.  Even through its dissolution. One  attorney will try to score some  points, the opposition will try to  impeach. The process will find an  equilibrium point determined by the  skill of the opposing lawyers, and  then each party will walk away with  their portion of the "goodies." Some  say, "Life is compromise." But at  Massey Myerson we believe life is  struggle and the ultimate destruction  of your opponent.
RECEPTIONIST	m	Your eleven o'clock is here.
MILES	m	Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will  continue this at the Associates  Meeting next Friday. In the meantime,  I want you to consider this... Ivan  the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila  the Hun -- what did they have in  common?
ASSOCIATE	?	Middle names?
MILES	m	Mr. Rexroth.
REX	m	Rex, please.
MILES	m	Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and  consider this office your office,  your haven, your war room -- for the  duration of the campaign.
REX	m	Thank you.
MILES	m	Now Rex.
MILES	m	-- Tell me your troubles.
REX	m	Jeez. Where do I start?
REX	m	...Well, my wife has me between a  rock and a hard place.
MILES	m	That's her job. You have to respect  that.
REX	m	When I first met Marylin -- Well, we  were crazy about each other. Not  emotionally, of course. We just  couldn't keep our hands off each  other.
MILES	m	Mm.
REX	m	But then... But then...
MILES	m	Time marches on. Ardor cools.
REX	m	No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly  cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And  very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of  it out there.
MILES	m	Ah.
REX	m	You know what I mean when I say "it."
MILES	m	Gotcha. No need to get anatomically  correct with me, Rex.
REX	m	Seems like there's more of it than  ever before --
MILES	m	Well, with the expanding global  population -- Let me ask you this --  your wife. Has she pursued the  opportunities which must present  themselves to the "knock-out, sexy  woman" you described?
REX	m	I don't know. I can assume...
MILES	m	Not in court you can't. Has she  retained counsel?
REX	m	I'm not sure.
MILES	m	And your wife is aware of or has  evidence of your activities?
REX	m	Video.
MILES	m	Mmm... And to cut to the chase,  forensically speaking -- is there a  pre-nup?
MILES	m	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars, but in ourselves. Well,  let me ask you this: what kind of  settlement do you seek? What are,  for you, the parameters of the  possible?
REX	m	That's the problem. I can't afford  to give her anything.
MILES	m	Nothing?
REX	m	I know that sounds rough but I'm  about to close on a deal to develop  some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged  up to my ass. If this deal goes south,  I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
MILES	m	So, you propose that in spite of  demonstrable infidelity on your part,  your unoffending wife should be tossed  out on her ear?
REX	m	Well -- is that possible?
SARAH	f	You want to come out to the beach  house tomorrow?
MARYLIN	f	I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
SARAH	f	Neither did I until my lawyer found  it -- quite a paper trail -- he had  it in the dog's name.
RAMONA	f	So who'd you hire?
MARYLIN	f	Ruth Rabino.
SARAH	f	She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis  or a Pearlman? She definitely did a  Factor.
MARYLIN	f	She did a Harriman.
SARAH	f	Wow.
MARYLIN	f	In the words of my Private  Investigator, we're going to nail  his ass.
RAMONA	f	I've been trying to nail George's  for years, but he's very careful.  I'll just keep having children. I  think I'm pregnant, by the way.
SARAH	f	Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
RAMONA	f	Three is not Farrow.
SARAH	f	Who's Rex's guy?
MARYLIN	f	Miles Massey.
SARAH	f	Of Massey Myerson?
MARYLIN	f	Do you know him?
SARAH	f	By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey  that cute little island of George's.
RAMONA	f	George was so impressed he hired him  when he divorced his second.
SARAH	f	Muriel Rumsey.
MARYLIN	f	Who's she?
SARAH	f	Now? She's a night manager at  McDonalds.
RAMONA	f	You should have tried to get pregnant  Marylin -- solidify your position.
MARYLIN	f	No.
RAMONA	f	You like kids.
MARYLIN	f	I can't have a baby with a man I  don't love... And I can't submit a  child to divorce.
SARAH	f	It's not so bad these days. Kids  like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
RAMONA	f	Maybe next time.
MARYLIN	f	Maybe.
SARAH	f	We do have a man for you.
RAMONA	f	Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just  separated from his third. He's in  fish. He is fish.
SARAH	f	She's keeping his name. And one of  his planes. And all seven of his  children
RAMONA	f	And only two are hers.
MARYLIN	f	Please. I'm not seeing anyone until  this is over. One husband at a time.
SARAH	f	I wish I had your discipline.
LAWYER	m	Mrs. Guttman, you have testified  that you were your husband's sexual  slave for thirty-six years, ever  since you were married --
WITNESS	m	Except for two years when he was in  the Navy, in Korea.
LAWYER	m	Prior to your marriage, what was  your profession?
WITNESS	m	I was a hostess. For Trans-World  Airlines.
LAWYER	m	What is your husband's profession?
WITNESS	m	He manufactures staples and industrial  brad-tacks. He's very successful.
WRIGLEY	?	Wait... He wants to give her...?
MILES	m	Nothing.
WRIGLEY	?	And she has...?
MILES	m	Video.
WRIGLEY	?	What the fuck...?
MILES	m	Wrigley!
WRIGLEY	?	Sorry.
MILES	m	Sometimes I have serious doubts about  you.
WRIGLEY	?	I am very sorry.
MILES	m	Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
WRIGLEY	?	No. You're not.
MILES	m	I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer  clerked for Scalia.
BACKGROUND LAWYER 	m	Couldn't you simply walk away from  this abusive relationship?
WOMAN	f	No, he had the videos...
MILES	m	Anyway, I need a challenge. This --
MILES	m	-- is not a challenge. I need  something I can sink my teeth into,  professionally speaking.
WOMAN	f	He would invite these girls home  from the staple factory to our  condominium in Palm Springs. He had  a device he called the Intruder.
JUDGE	m	Mr. Massey! I ask again, if you have  any questions for the complainant.
MILES	m	I'm sorry, your honor, I was just  conferring with my associate...
MILES	m	Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know  a gentleman named Morris Rudnick?
MRS. GUTTMAN	f	Well, yes, Morris is my accountant.
MILES	m	Accountant.
MILES	m	We would like to offer these  photographs into evidence...
RECEPTIONIST	m	Mr. Massey will see you now.
MILES	m	...Ruth!
MILES	m	-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth.  And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
MARYLIN	f	And you must be Mr. Massey.
MARYLIN	f	Hello, Rex.
REX	m	Marylin.
MARYLIN	f	Are you alright? You lost weight.
REX	m	My whole metabolism is -- off.
MILES	m	So, Ruth. How's Sam?
RUTH	f	Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly  fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
MILES	m	A yert. Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a  time when most women are in Boca,  having early bird specials -- she's  working so her husband can be in  Montana. In a yert.
REX	m	What's a yert?
RUTH	f	I ran into your mother at the  radiologist last week.
MILES	m	What?!
RUTH	f	Oh, just a routine mammogram. She  said to say hello. She's going to  Positano with your brother's family.
MILES	m	How nice.
MARYLIN	f	Positano is beautiful. Remember when  we were there, Rex? We stayed in the  Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
REX	m	Yeah.
RUTH	f	So, Miles. If you have a proposal,  let's hear it.
MILES	m	At this point my client is still  prepared to consider reconciliation.
RUTH	f	My client has ruled that out.
MILES	m	My client is prepared to entertain  an amicable dissolution of the  marriage without prejudice.
RUTH	f	That's delusional.
MILES	m	My client proposes a thirty day  cooling off period.
RUTH	f	My client feels sufficiently  dispassionate.
MILES	m	My client asks that you not initiate  proceedings pending his setting  certain affairs in order.
RUTH	f	Ha Ha.
MILES	m	Heh heh.
REX	m	What's so goddamn funny?
MILES	m	Please -- let me handle this.
MILES	m	-- So much for the icebreakers.  What're you after, Ruth?
RUTH	f	My client is prepared to settle for  fifty percent of the marital assets.
MILES	m	Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why  not ask for a hundred percent?
RUTH	f	Oh brother. Here we go.
MILES	m	Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
RUTH	f	Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe  we're being too conservative. Seventy  five percent.
MARYLIN	f	Do you need a Tagamet?
REX	m	You have some?
MARYLIN	f	These are yours.
MILES	m	Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
MARYLIN	f	Have you been taking your digestive  enzymes?
REX	m	Sometimes I forget.
MARYLIN	f	I'm sorry. Where were we?
RUTH	f	We were about to request the primary  residence, and thirty percent of the  remaining assets.
MILES	m	Are you familiar with Kirshner?
RUTH	f	Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner  was in Kentucky.
REX	m	What's Kirshner?
MILES	m	Please -- let me handle this. Okay,  Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your  bottom line?
RUTH	f	The primary residence and FORTY  percent of the remaining assets.  You're becoming tedious Miles.
REX	m	Aren't we going in the wrong  direction?
MILES	m	Shhh. Please. Let me do my job. Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten  about Kirshner?
RUTH	f	See you at the preliminary.
MILES	m	Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.
MILES	m	I think that went as well as could  be expected.
REX	m	She always looked out for me.
MILES	m	And she had private investigators  assisting her.
REX	m	She brought my digestive enzymes.
MILES	m	In anticipation of making you sick.
REX	m	Maybe I should reconsider my...
MILES	m	A superficial display of marital  solicitude, and you lose your resolve?  Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm  your attorney, and if you choose to  reward her for that mediocre charade  of spousal concern...
REX	m	You're right. Screw her.
MARYLIN	f	I don't know what his game is. He  dismissed every one of Ruth's  proposals. And Sarah, we weren't  unreasonable.
SARAH	f	Well what does he want?
MARYLIN	f	I don't know. Ruth kept her cool,  but I could tell she was surprised.
SARAH	f	He has a reputation for being tough.
MARYLIN	f	Lilly's up.
SARAH	f	Oh, God!
MARYLIN	f	Every week --
SARAH	f	I'm dying.
MARYLIN	f	Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by  his intransigence. If I didn't know  better, I'd swear Massey had some  personal investment in my ruination.
SARAH	f	So where are you now?
MARYLIN	f	Well, if he continues to maintain  this position -- we're in court.
SARAH	f	Shit.
MARYLIN	f	Get this! He called and invited me  to dinner.
INSTRUCTOR	m	Marylin? Ready.
MARYLIN	f	Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure.
SARAH	f	That's completely odd.
MARYLIN	f	I know. That's why I accepted. Find  out what's up with this clown.
INSTRUCTOR	m	That was excellent, Marylin. But you  forgot to yell "no."
MARYLIN	f	Ah. No.
MILES	m	Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming.
MARYLIN	f	I have to admit. I was curious. And  hungry.
MAITRE D'	m	Something to start? Some wine,  perhaps?
MILES	m	French? Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57.
MARYLIN	f	I assume this is on Rex?
MILES	m	Isn't everything?
MILES	m	Your husband told me you were  beautiful, but I was unprepared.
MARYLIN	f	"Dismiss your vows, your feigned  tears, your flattery, for where a  heart is hard, they make no battery."
MILES	m	Simon & Garfunkel?
MILES	m	Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
MARYLIN	f	Did you see the tape?
MILES	m	Not yet.
MARYLIN	f	See the tape. Then we can discuss my  heart.
MARYLIN	f	Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your  performance about this afternoon?
MILES	m	What does your lawyer think?
MARYLIN	f	Ruth says you've been too successful,  that you're bored, complacent, and  you're on your way down.
MILES	m	But you don't agree?
MARYLIN	f	How do you know?
MILES	m	Why would you be here?
MARYLIN	f	I told you. I was hungry.
MILES	m	I'll have the tournedos of beef. And  the lady will have the same? I assume you're a carnivore.
MARYLIN	f	I know you do.
MARYLIN	f	Risotto with white truffles, please.
MILES	m	"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at  first sight?"
MARYLIN	f	You didn't ask me here to pick me  up. You could get in trouble for  that.
MILES	m	Not really. You're not my client.  Freedom of association. Big issue  with the First Amendment fans. Want  to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
MARYLIN	f	Have you ever been married, Miles?
MILES	m	No.
MARYLIN	f	You don't believe in it.
MILES	m	As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
MARYLIN	f	You just haven't met the right person.
MILES	m	No. I haven't. Have you?
MARYLIN	f	All right, Miles. Let me tell you  everything you THINK you know. I was  married to Rex for a long time. I  was an excellent wife, a partner, a  lover, a hostess and a friend. There  was only one thing I did wrong during  the five years we were together. I  got five years older. Think he should  be able to ditch me for that?
MILES	m	He wants a reconciliation.
MARYLIN	f	See the tape. Then we can discuss  reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I  nailed his ass. Now I'm going to  have it mounted and have my  girlfriends over to throw darts at  it. Then I'm getting on with my life.  That's all I'm after.
MILES	m	Gotcha.
MARYLIN	f	What is it you're after, Miles?
MILES	m	Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking  for an ass to mount.
MARYLIN	f	Well, don't look at mine!
VOICE 	m	Oyez. Oyez. Family court for the  fifth district of Los Angeles County  is now in session.
CLERK	m	-- The Honorable Marva Munson  presiding. All rise.
REX	m	Have you sat before her before?
WRIGLEY	?	-- the judge sits. We argue. We argue  before her. She sits before us.
REX	m	Okay. Has she sat before you before?
WRIGLEY	?	You can't sit before her. That's the  rule! She sits before we argue!
MILES	m	Shut! Up!
VOICE	m	I'm gonna nail your ass.
MARYLIN	f	I was devastated. Of course.
RUTH	f	Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
JUDGE	m	Mr. Massey, any questions?
MILES	m	Mmmm --
MILES	m	"Dismiss your vows, your feigned  tears, your flattery, for where a  heart is hard, they make no  battery..."
MILES	m	Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?
RUTH	f	Objection, your honor!
JUDGE	m	Grounds?
RUTH	f	Uh... poetry recitation.
MILES	m	Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how  high is that wall around your heart?
RUTH	f	Your honor, this is harassment! Arid  frankly it's still a little...
RUTH	f	...arty farty!
MILES	m	Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you  ever been in love?
MARYLIN	f	Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
MILES	m	And you've always loved him?
MARYLIN	f	"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at  first sight?"
MILES	m	And you hoped to spend the rest of  your life with him?
MARYLIN	f	Yes. Why is that so difficult for  you to understand?
MARYLIN	f	Rex was -- is -- a very appealing  man. I am sorry I couldn't... I tried my best.
MILES	m	That'll be all Mrs. Rexroth. Please  forgive me for causing you additional  anguish. Thank you, Your Honor. No further  questions.
JUDGE	m	Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
RUTH	f	We rest, Your Honor.
JUDGE	m	Mr. Massey?
MILES	m	Yes, Your honor. I call Patricia  Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.
BAILIFF	?	Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.
RUTH	f	Who's that?
MARYLIN	f	Jesus.
BAILIFF	?	Mrs. Isenberg.
PATRICIA	f	Banderas.
BAILIFF	?	Mrs. Banderas, do you solemnly swear  that the testimony you are about to  give shall be the truth, the whole  truth, and nothing but the truth so  help you God?
PATRICIA	f	Yes, Mr. Bailiff. I do.
MILES	m	Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your  relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
PATRICIA	f	We don't have much of a relationship  anymore. I haven't seen her since  before she married Rex. We had some  very nice times prior to that. We  were quite close.
RUTH	f	Is this a lover?
MARYLIN	f	Please!
MILES	m	And how would you define your  relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You  know -- you are her...?
PATRICIA	f	Mother?
RUTH	f	What?!
MILES	m	Her Mother?
PATRICIA	f	Hi, Sweetie.
MILES	m	Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you  are frequently mistaken for sisters.
MARYLIN	f	He'll regret this.
MILES	m	Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
PATRICIA	f	No. I haven't. But I've been out of  town. Hello, Rex. Hello there.
MILES	m	You were never invited to meet your  son-in-law?
PATRICIA	f	No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm?  No. Well... no.
RUTH	f	Objection, Your Honor. This isn't  about Mrs. Rexroth's filial  obligations.
JUDGE	m	Sustained.
MILES	m	Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
PATRICIA	f	Of course. Of course she was married.  What else would she be? Single? I  don't think so.
PATRICIA	f	Let me tell you something about Patty.
MILES	m	Who's "Patty."
PATRICIA	f	Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like  mine. I was Pat and she was Patty.  But she changed it after seeing "Some  Like It Hot." To Marylin. After  Marylin Monroe.
MILES	m	I see. And what were you going to  tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
PATRICIA	f	When she was a tiny girl? And people  asked her what she wanted to be when  she grew up? She never said the usual  things little girls say -- like --  nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman?  She always said -- "When I grow up, I want to be  divorced."
MILES	m	Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
PATRICIA	f	Well, not just divorce. She used to  say "I want to be divorced from some  big dumb rich guy..." And I guess  her dream is coming true. I'm happy for you Patty
MARYLIN	f	It was like that scene in The  Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is  called to testify against the Family.  And he's in court, and he looks into  the spectators gallery, and sees his  Brother. They brought the brother  from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a  word. He can't testify. That's what  it was like seeing Pat in there. I  couldn't even have Ruth cross examine  her.
RAMONA	f	Why do you think she did it?
MARYLIN	f	Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA.  Maybe they offered her money. Massey  is very seductive. Who knows.
RAMONA	f	Maybe they put a horse head in her  bed?
SARAH	f	That stinks. They left you with  absolutely nothing. It makes you  wonder about the entire legal system.  Like Rodney King.
MARYLIN	f	They bought her speech. If I was  only in it for Rex's money, he  shouldn't have to give me any.
RAMONA	f	That doesn't make sense. It's like  punishing you for being goal oriented.
SARAH	f	Well, you can live here as long as  you want. Do you have any plans?
MARYLIN	f	Nothing specific, but I'll have my  own place soon.
SARAH	f	So, Marylin. Is that what you said  when you were a little girl?
MARYLIN	f	Probably. Every woman in my life was  divorced at least twice. What was I  supposed to say. Anthropologist?
RAMONA	f	I begged you to have a baby!
MARYLIN	f	In the Godfather, after the courtroom  scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his  veins in the bathtub.
SARAH	f	You're not...
MARYLIN	f	No. I'll see some blood before this  is over, but it won't be mine.
MILES	m	She got absolutely nothing. Zero.  Zip.
KENNETH	m	So. I won't be seeing her? Your  clients usually visit me after the  settlement.
MILES	m	Not this one. Not unless her HMO  covers plastic surgery, which,  incidentally, she does not need.
KENNETH	m	Everyone needs plastic surgery. You  need it.
MILES	m	I don't need it.
KENNETH	m	You want Botox?
MILES	m	What the hell is Botox?
KENNETH	m	It's a form of botulism. I just inject  it into your forehead, and it  paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't  raise them...
MILES	m	Why in God's name would I want...?
KENNETH	m	No frown lines. New watch?
MILES	m	It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can  flip the face, and set it for two  time zones.
KENNETH	m	Why would you need two time zones?  You never leave Beverly Hills.
MILES	m	It was a gift from a client.
KENNETH	m	Set one side for Bel Air.
MILES	m	Botox. Christ. We had aspirations  when we were in college.
KENNETH	m	We did not.
MILES	m	You were going to be a Cardiac  Surgeon. I was going to clerk for  the Supreme Court.
KENNETH	m	I was going to play golf. You were  going to have Asian girlfriends.
MILES	m	Denial is not a river in Egypt.
KENNETH	m	You're in check.
MILES	m	I should be in therapy.
MILES	m	Yes. Your husband did show remarkable  foresight in taking those pictures.  And, yes, absent a swimming pool,  the presence of the pool man would  appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie,  who is the real victim here? Let me  suggest the following. Your husband,  who on a prior occasion slapped you --  beat you --
BONNIE	f	Well, I wouldn't say --
MILES	m	Your husband, who has beaten you --  repeatedly --
BONNIE	f	He --
MILES	m	Please -- was at the time brandishing  your firearm, trying in his rage to  shoot an acquaintance -- friend of  long standing --
BONNIE	f	They hate each other --
MILES	m	So he says now! But if not for your  cool headed intervention, his tantrum  might have ended this schmoe's life  and ruined his own... As for the  sexual indiscretion which he imagined  had taken place, wasn't it in fact  he who had been sleeping with the  pool man?
MILES	m	Am I going to far here?
VOICE	m	Mr. Massey, Mr. Meyerson would like  to see you when you have a moment.
MILES	m	Herb wants to see me?
VOICE	m	When you have a moment.
VOICE	m	Thoity-six objections sustained,  tree overruled; fawteen summary  judgements sought, toiteen ranite,  eighteen movments to voice fuh  respondent's prejudice, eighteen  ranite which is a hunnut pissent
VOICE	m	-- Twelve cawt days on the Rexrawt  case alone; tree hunut'n twenty  billable hours paralegal soivicies;  four hunnut'n two billable associate  counsel and consultative; six hunnut'n  eighty billable at full attorney  rate and eightyfive lunches charged.
VOICE	m	-- Counseluh, you are the engine  that drives this foim --
MILES	m	Thank you Herb.
VOICE	m	Mr. Massey --
MILES	m	Please! No calls! I'm feeling very  fragile.
VOICE	m	I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt  certain you'd want to know -- Marylin  Rexroth wants to see you.
MILES	m	Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
VOICE	m	She's here now.
MILES	m	Marylin! How nice.
MILES	m	Marylin! How lovely, uh --
MILES	m	-- Marylin! What a pleasure --
MILES	m	Marylin, what a pleas -- who the  fuck are you?
MARYLIN	f	Miles, how nice of you to see us --  may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of  Doyle Oil.
DOYLE	m	I told you we know each other, baby.  Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
MILES	m	Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
DOYLE	m	After you, Doll.
MILES	m	And how is Mrs. Reiser?
DOYLE	m	Few suicide attempts, little inpatient  stint. Naturally, she misses her  kids. Six weekends a year and  alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh  to us but -- hey -- all's fair.  Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse,"  takes her meds and goes to  occupational therapy at a local  sheltered workshop.
MILES	m	So she's uh, flourishing?
DOYLE	m	She makes felt wallets. Got one right  here.
DOYLE	m	Yeah. I know. Leather would be more  practical, but whatcha gonna do?
MARYLIN	f	Miles, I know you're busy and that  you charge by the hour so I'll come  to the point. Howard and I are  planning to marry.
MILES	m	Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
DOYLE	m	Yep. My divorce just came through.  Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a  better deal! My wife still has health  insurance and gets to see the  children. But, I don't know. Guess  I'm just a softie. After all Amanda  and me were together for -- what --  you'd know better than me, Marylin.  She was your best friend.
MARYLIN	f	Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen  and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
DOYLE	m	Here. Got pictures.
MILES	m	I... uh guess congratulations are in  order.
DOYLE	m	Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up  and...
MARYLIN	f	Honey, I don't think this is really  relevant to...
DOYLE	m	...and one day, this sweet girl calls  me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder  to cry on deal. One thing leads to  another and before I know it --
MARYLIN	f	-- we realized we'd always been very  attracted to one another.
MILES	m	No!
DOYLE	m	I had no idea until after, but --
DOYLE	m	Baby. You are so HOT!
MARYLIN	f	Howard!
MILES	m	What a touching story.
DOYLE	m	You know, Miles, after my wife --  wife's mastectomy -- things were  never the same. This might sound  cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey,  but... I like my women with two boobs.
MARYLIN	f	Howard and I are here, Miles, because  I have learned through bitter  experience that when it comes to  matrimonial law, you are the very  best.
MARYLIN	f	As you are well aware, my previous  marriage ended with an unjustified  strain on my reputation My motives  were questioned. I was slandered in  court.
DOYLE	m	You did good, Massey!
MARYLIN	f	Therefore in an effort to remove any  trace of suspicion from my sweet  Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
DOYLE	m	And -- there's no talking her out of  it. Believe me, I've tried.
MARYLIN	f	They say the Massey pre-nup has never  been penetrated.
DOYLE	m	She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
MILES	m	Oh, for the love of...
MARYLIN	f	That is true, isn't it Miles? Your  pre-nup is the best there is?
MILES	m	That is correct. Not to blow my own  horn, but they devote an entire  semester to it at Harvard Law.
DOYLE	m	Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
MILES	m	I just want to make sure that you  both --
MILES	m	-- understand what you're asking for  here. The Massey pre-nup provides  that in the event of a dissolution  of the marriage for any reason, both  parties shall leave it with whatever  they brought in, and earned during.  No one can profit from the marriage.  The pre-nup protects the wealthier  party.
DOYLE	m	Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
MILES	m	And without it, that party is exposed --  a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
DOYLE	m	A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put  that in the Malibu house. Screw the  screening room!
MILES	m	-- and we are sure...
MILES	m	-- we are both sure that's what we  want?
MARYLIN	f	Absolutely.
DOYLE	m	Course I can't do much "wriggling"  if you tie me up like that again.  Massey -- this is one bad bad little  girl.
MARYLIN	f	We'd better go before we get thrown  out.
MILES	m	Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could  just borrow your charming fiancee  for a moment.
DOYLE	m	What part?
MILES	m	I'd just like to have a word with  her.
DOYLE	m	Why not? I'm going to have her for a  lifetime.
MILES	m	What are you doing?
MARYLIN	f	Getting married.
MILES	m	To him? He's a sick freak.
MARYLIN	f	He's passionate.
MILES	m	Passionate! He's a pervert. He should  have to register when he moves.
MARYLIN	f	All girls enjoy a little rough trade  from time to time.
MILES	m	Marylin! Listen to me.
MARYLIN	f	No. You listen to me. You busted me, Miles. You left me  with nothing! What did you expect me  to do? Get a degree in counseling?  Write a book about table linen?  Because that's what wives do when  they get dumped, and frankly, I'm  not quite ready for that.
MILES	m	But why him?
MARYLIN	f	We told you. We realized we've always  been in love.
MILES	m	The Massey pre-nup has never been  pene -- successfully challenged.
MARYLIN	f	So I hear. Is that all?
MILES	m	No, that's not all.
MILES	m	You fascinate me.
MILES	m	Do you think I'm going to end up  like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy  bag instead of a family?
KENNETH	m	Got any symptoms?
MILES	m	Yes. The inability to experience  pleasure.
KENNETH	m	Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen.
MILES	m	What?
KENNETH	m	The Center Counter Defense. The thing  is not to move your queen too early.
MILES	m	She can't really love that idiot,  can she?
KENNETH	m	What?
MILES	m	Marylin Rexroth. She came into my  office and signed a pre-nup with  Howard Doyle.
KENNETH	m	Doyle Oil? A Massey Pre-nup? She loves him.
MILES	m	He's the wrong man.
KENNETH	m	Miles! Don't waste time with someone  else's queen, either.
BOLENSKY	?	Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme --  Remember me to one who lives there...
BOLENSKY	?	-- she once was a true love of mine.
MILES	m	What the hell is wrong with you?
WRIGLEY	?	I can't help it. Even with the  business we're in, I -- it gets me  every time. It's so -- optimistic.
MILES	m	Is she going through with it?
WRIGLEY	?	If she's not going through with it,  she's cutting it awful close.
RABBI BOLENSKY	m	Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme.  Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients  for the banquet we call -- life.  Marriage is like a Great Feast.  Courtship is the Appetizer. A small  mixed green taste of things to come.  The Early Years -- The First Course --  a carefully poached fish dish  dependent on freshness and delicate  handling. Or perhaps a light pasta --  a tortellini stuffed with cheese and  hope.
WRIGLEY	?	You have any gum or mints?
RABBI	m	The main course -- Mature Love -- a  hearty stew, cooked slowly in the  oven of companionship until the meat  falls off the bone. And then --  dessert. The reward for years spent  together -- the sweetness of a Life  Well Lived. A sorbet of grandchildren,  followed by the decafe demitasse of  retirement.
RABBI BOLENKSY	m	Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin  to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang  though the lean years as well as  those that are heavily marbled?
DOYLE	m	I do.
RABBI BOLENSKY	m	And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take  Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel?  The stock in your sauce?
MARYLIN	f	I do.
MILES	m	Argh.
RABBI BOLENSKY	m	Then, by the power vested in me by  the state of California, and as the  maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star  Restaurant of Life, I now pronounce  you -- man and wife...
WRIGLEY	?	What do you think?
MILES	m	What are they?
WRIGLEY	?	Berry spoons.
MILES	m	Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm  surprised at you. What is this? Some  Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are  the most cockamamie things I've ever --
WRIGLEY	?	Miles -- why so angry?
MILES	m	Why couldn't we be the club sandwich?
DOYLE	m	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:  I have something to say to my bride.
DOYLE	m	-- Darling, like the rabbi said...  life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe,  and Marylin, darling... I just want  you to know that I am IN the kitchen  and I CAN STAND THE HEAT!
DOYLE	m	And I'm going to start this marriage  by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot  hors d'oerve of this love story is --  Pre-nup Primavera!
DOYLE	m	Carmine! Bring on the Pesto!
DOYLE	m	-- This is for you, darling.
DOYLE	m	-- this is for you, Darling.
MILES	m	Brilliant.
WRIGLEY	?	Why is he doing that?
MILES	m	Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating  the pre-nup.
DOYLE	m	This is for you, Darling!
WRIGLEY	?	That's -- the most romantic thing  I've ever seen -- in my LIFE!
DOYLE	m	THIS IS FOR YOU, DARLING!
MILES	m	I'd like to offer my congratulations.  That was a beautiful gesture of  Howard's.
MARYLIN	f	Howard is a beautiful person.
MILES	m	Yes. He's a diamond in the rough.  And I have a feeling that someday  soon you'll be taking that diamond  and leaving the rough.
MARYLIN	f	Miles. Miles. Miles.
MILES	m	I am thrilled for you, but tell me  this... How'd you get Howard to do  it? I've addressed enough juries to  appreciate the power of suggestion,  but it seemed like he thought it was  his own idea.
MARYLIN	f	It was his idea. It was a gesture of  love and trust. Be happy for me,  Miles.
MILES	m	Well, when this goes south -- promise  you'll have dinner with me?
MARYLIN	f	Have you tried the duck?
MILES	m	I figure a couple of months. That's  how long it should take for the ink  on the settlement to dry.
MARYLIN	f	It has bones. Be sure to swallow  one.
MILES	m	Although knowing you as I do -- there  will be no settlement. This time it  will be complete and total  annihilation.
PILOT	m	Jesus --
CO-PILOT	m	What --?
PILOT	m	-- I've heard some -- I've heard  some sick things -- in my --
CO-PILOT	m	What?!
MALE VOICE	m	Oh Casey Jones was the rounder's  name, T'was on the 6:02 that he rode  to fame!
CO-PILOT	m	Who is that guy?
PILOT	m	Rex Rexroth, the mini-mall king.  Getting to be the richest man on the  West Coast, from what they say.
CO-PILOT	m	Jesus.
FROM THE SPEAKER	m	Hup! Come all you rounders if you  wanna hear...
CO-PILOT	m	Why're they going to Muncie?
PILOT	m	He's thinking of buying Indiana.
MILES	m	And of course we shall have to  litigate. Sentence. Paragraph.
MILES	m	-- Naturally the first concern for  both parties is the welfare of little  Wendell junior. Nevertheless, we  question whether the continuing  expenses for his special ed classes  are truly justified given the great  strides --
WRIGLEY	?	I'm sorry I'm late. I was having  lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant.  Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is  divorced!
WRIGLEY	?	...and I hear she's richer than  Croesus.
MILES	m	Ah, but is she richer than Mrs.  Croesus?
WRIGLEY	?	She could buy and sell you ten times  over.
MILES	m	She deserves every penny. They pay  great athletes a fortune. Well,  Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the  peak of her power.
MILES	m	Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
WRIGLEY	?	What...?
MILES	m	She owes me a meal.
WRIGLEY	?	I'd stay away from her, Miles.
MILES	m	I know you would, Wrigley. But would  Kramer?
RECEPTIONIST	m	Mrs. Doyle for you.
WAITER	m	Le Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, 1982.
MILES	m	Thank you. I'll take care of it.
MILES	m	To victory.
MARYLIN	f	I don't feel victorious Miles. I  feel betrayed, abandoned and  humiliated. I have pictures of him  with another woman...
MILES	m	More pictures? My God, Marylin. You  can open an erotic art gallery.
MARYLIN	f	Did you invite me here to score some  cheap laughs.
MILES	m	No. Just to comfort you, and  appreciate you --
MARYLIN	f	You really think I engineered the  whole thing. You think the marriage  and the divorce was part of some  scheme. You came here to celebrate  because you think I'm without morality  or soul. You -- sound like my mother.
WAITER	m	Should we order?
MARYLIN	f	Yes, I -- well, I'm not really...
MILES	m	Not hungry, huh? Neither am I.
MARYLIN	f	Thank you. And good-night.
MILES	m	Marylin --
PROSECUTOR	m	...and he asked you if...?
WITNESS	m	..if I reckon I could find someone  to keel him his wife.
PROSECUTOR	m	Who asked you this?
WITNESS	m	Dean Leonard. Da defendant. That guy!
SANDPAPERY VOICE	m	Eighteen hunnut billable hours. Twelve  hunnut'n twenty-one motions tuh  void...
SANDPAPERY VOICE	m	...five nunnut'n sixty faw summary  judgenents. A hunnut'n twenty-nine  thousand four hunnut'n seventeen  lunches charged...
SANDPAPERY VOICE	m	Counseluh? Counseluh?
MILES	m	Hello?
MARYLIN	f	Miles?
MILES	m	Yes? Marylin?
MARYLIN	f	You're right about me. I am worthless.  I am nothing. I don't deserve to  live.
MILES	m	Marylin? When did I say...?
MARYLIN	f	I don't blame them for betraying me.  I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my  father. You see, Miles, I'm going to  tell you something about me. Something  you may or may not know. I suck!
MARYLIN	f	Screw you, asswipe!
MILES	m	Marylin? Forgive me but are you --  drunk?
MARYLIN	f	A little. You get out of the car. That's right,  Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
MILES	m	You shouldn't be driving. Where are  you?
MARYLIN	f	I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills  hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in  the Polo...?
MILES	m	I live right near there. The 800  Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin --  come here right now before -- just  come here.
MARYLIN	f	Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and  pick up a blended for --
MILES	m	No. Don't stop.
MARYLIN	f	Okay Miles.
MARYLIN	f	I just cried when I got home. Somehow,  your disdain for me -- I'm pretty  tough Miles, but I'm human. All my  life people have been ascribing these  terrible motives to me. I used to  think they were jealous, or they  didn't understand, but... I dunno.  Maybe others see something in me.  Something I'm not even aware of.  Anyway, thank you for letting me  come here. I guess I was a little  drunk.
MARYLIN	f	You have a very nice home, Miles.  Very inviting.
MILES	m	Thank you.
MARYLIN	f	You have wonderful art. I love that  lithograph. Hockney?
MILES	m	Yes. I just got that, actually. It  was a gift.
MARYLIN	f	From a -- girlfriend.
MILES	m	No. No. I don't have a... no. It was  from a client.
MARYLIN	f	No kidding. I'll bet you have some  very grateful clients. What'd Rex  buy you?
MILES	m	Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
MARYLIN	f	Is that you?
MILES	m	Me. Yes.
MARYLIN	f	Oh. And that is -- mom?
MILES	m	Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
MARYLIN	f	You look like you were a very  sensitive child. You have expressive  eyes.
MILES	m	Hmmm...
MARYLIN	f	And your mother was very beautiful.  She must be proud of you.
MILES	m	She never particularly cared for me.
MARYLIN	f	She didn't love you?
MILES	m	No. She loved me. She would never  not love her son. She just didn't...  I wasn't her "type." She said I was  a very, colicky baby. You know?  Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't  eat well? We got off to a bad start,  and she never seemed to recoup --
MARYLIN	f	She held that against you?
MILES	m	Apparently she was very disappointed.
MARYLIN	f	Boy. Boy, oh boy.
MARYLIN	f	And here I thought my mother was...
MILES	m	Your mother was.
MARYLIN	f	Oh right. You met Patricia.
MARYLIN	f	We're damaged goods.
MILES	m	No, we're not!
MARYLIN	f	We are, Miles. You know I'm right.  There's something "off" about you  and me Miles. And maybe it isn't  because of these women -- maybe they  were just extremely insightful and  recognized our "deficiencies" very  early on. Maybe...
MILES	m	That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch  and yours is a psycho. I can't believe  you're saying this, Marylin! There's  nothing wrong with us. We're  attractive and charismatic and  successful and... I like us.
MARYLIN	f	I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen  to me. I'm sure you have a very  fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm  depressing.
MILES	m	No.
MARYLIN	f	Thank you for the coffee. It's very  robust.
MARYLIN	f	Friends?
MILES	m	Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
MILES	m	I have to say -- I'm speechless. No.  I'm never speechless.
MARYLIN	f	I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not  used to losing control with such --  volume.
MILES	m	And I'm not used to -- Marylin --  there's something I want to ask you.
MARYLIN	f	What is it Miles?
MILES	m	I want... I want to...
MILES	m	I want to be your -- your wife.
MARYLIN	f	Huh?
MILES	m	No... That wasn't right. I want YOU  to be MY wife.
MARYLIN	f	Did you just propose to me?
MILES	m	Yes. I am. What else could those  words mean? I believe we belong  together and we can make one another  happy. And we should be happy because  happiness is better than the  alternative which is -- just jump in  any old time, Marylin. You have more  experience at this than I do.
MARYLIN	f	Yes.
MILES	m	Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
MARYLIN	f	Yes, Miles. I accept.
MILES	m	You do?
MARYLIN	f	Do you want me to sleep on it?
MILES	m	No.
MARYLIN	f	Do you want to sleep on it?
MILES	m	No ma'am. I have been asleep all my  life up to this moment. Marylin,  will you marry me?
MARYLIN	f	Yes. Again.
MILES	m	I don't have a ring!
MARYLIN	f	I know.
MILES	m	I have a watch.
MARYLIN	f	I'm happy.
KENNETH	m	I'm happy for you, pal.
MILES	m	Thanks, buddy.
KENNETH	m	Is she Asian?
MILES	m	Asian? No.
KENNETH	m	Well... I'm still...
MILES	m	Wrigley?
WRIGLEY	?	Miles.
MILES	m	Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley.  Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
WRIGLEY	?	The plastic surgeon! I read about  you in LA Style.
MILES	m	Do you have it?
KENNETH	m	I have it.
MILES	m	You have the pre-nup?
KENNETH	m	No. I have the ring. Was I supposed  to have a pre-nup?
MILES	m	No. You have the ring. Wrigley has  the pre-nup.
KENNETH	m	Oh. I thought maybe -- Gee!
SARAH	f	Dr. Beck!
KENNETH	m	Sarah! How are you?
MILES	m	You know each other? Of course you  do.
RAMONA	f	You're Dr. Beck? I have an appointment  to see you in March. Right after I  lose the babyweight. Which of course,  will be after I have the baby...
MARYLIN	f	Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona --  this is Miles Massey.
SARAH	f	Hello Miles.
RAMONA	f	Congratulations Miles.
MILES	m	Hi. Hello. Marylin. You know my young associate,  Wrigley.
MARYLIN	f	I do. He was at my divorce and my  wedding. What would a marital related  event be without Wrigley?
WRIGLEY	?	It has become a tradition, hasn't  it?
MARYLIN	f	I loved the berry spoons. I didn't have any. Thank you.
MILES	m	Well, Wrigley brought something else  for you today, darling.
MILES	m	This -- is the Massey Pre-nup.
MILES	m	Marylin, you're welcome to examine  it, but as you know -- it's iron  clad.
SARAH	f	It is. It's famous.
WRIGLEY	?	I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't  get her.
MILES	m	We wanted Ruth here for your  protection as well --
WRIGLEY	?	The Judge is here. Over here, Judge  Munson.
MARYLIN	f	Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce  hearing?
MILES	m	Yes. Short notice you know, but I  think there's nice closure to it.  Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as  always.
JUDGE MUNSON	m	What's up with you two.
MILES	m	We're getting married.
JUDGE MUNSON	m	What's the gag?
MILES	m	A gag? No.
MARYLIN	f	Excuse me, Judge Muson.
JUDGE	m	You got it, Patty.
MARYLIN	f	You brought a pre-nup to our wedding?
MILES	m	Yes. It's for your protection, sweetheart.  You're the one with the -- the...
WRIGLEY	?	-- the coin?
MARYLIN	f	Miles. I don't want to sign this. I  want this marriage to be different.  Okay. Judge Munsen and Wrigley are  here, but other than that...
JUDGE	m	Should I go out for a smoke?
MILES	m	No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin,  if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit  from the marriage.
MARYLIN	f	Oh Miles!
MILES	m	What I mean is, your wealth is  completely protected.
MARYLIN	f	Miles. Listen to me. You are about  to become my husband. I don't want  to be protected from you. I want to  be protected for you.
WRIGLEY	?	Ohhh...
MILES	m	But?
MARYLIN	f	I want this to be a marriage based  on love, trust and community property.  That's all I've ever wanted.
SARAH	f	But Marylin, without this, you're  completely exposed.
MARYLIN	f	I want to be exposed.
RAMONA	f	You're vulnerable.
MARYLIN	f	It's about time.
JUDGE	m	You're a sitting duck.
MARYLIN	f	Quack.
JUDGE MUNSON	m	Do you, Miles Herbert Massey of Massey  Meyerson take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth- Doyle?
MARYLIN	f	Yes.
JUDGE MUNSON	m	"Doyle", to be your lawful wedded  wife to --
MILES	m	I do, yah I do, uh huh --
JUDGE MUNSON	m	Let me finish!
JUDGE MUNSON	m	-- Jesus! Haven't you ever been  married before?
JUDGE MUNSON	m	-- To have and hold, to love and to  cherish, till death do you part?
MILES	m	-- I do.
JUDGE MUNSON	m	And do you, Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth  Doyle, take Miles Herbert Massey of  Massey Meyerson, to be your lawful  wedded husband, to have and to hold,  to love and to cherish, till death  do you part?
MARYLIN	f	I do.
JUDGE MUNSON	m	I now pronounce you man and wife.
SECRETARY	f	I have Mrs. Massey on line one for  you.
MILES	m	Mom...?
MILES	m	For the first time in my life, I  stand before you naked...  vulnerable... and in love. Love. A  word matrimonial lawyers shy away  from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have  been frightened of this emotion which  is, in a sense, the seed of my  livelihood. But today, I am here to  tell you: Love should cause us no  fear. Love should cause us no shame.  Love... is good. Let me ask you a question. When our  clients come to us confused, angry,  hurting because their flame of love  is fluttering and threatens to die --  should we seek to extinguish that  flame, so that we can sift through  the smoldering wreckage for our paltry  reward? Or should we seek to fan  this precious flame -- this most  precious flame -- back to loving,  roaring life?
WRIGLEY	?	Extinguish?
MILES	m	Should we counsel fear -- or trust?  Should we seek to destroy -- or to  build? Should we meet our clients'  problems with cynicism -- or with  love?
MILES	m	Kramer?
KRAMER	m	Build?
MILES	m	The decision of course, is each of  ours. For my part, I have made the  leap of love, and there is no going  back --
MARYLIN	f	I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll  move to the...
MILES	m	No. Stay. I want you close to me.  This couch is wrong. It's not a  "married couch."
MARYLIN	f	Honey, I could sit...
MILES	m	In fact, this is not a married house --  it's a bachelor pad.
MARYLIN	f	Hardly. You have six bedrooms
MILES	m	I know. But I've converted most of  them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms --  a billiard room, a card room, a gym --  Honey, want you to go out, as soon  as you feel up to it -- and buy  married things. Woman things.  Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make  this your house.
MILES	m	Here's my card. Spend as much as you  want. We get mileage.
MARYLIN	f	Well, I suppose I could "girly" it  up for you with a little Fortuny,  and some passementerie --
MILES	m	Good. Are those foods?
MARYLIN	f	Fabric and fringe.
MILES	m	Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not  right away -- There's a room right  off the bedroom -- It would be perfect  for a nursery. It's a walk in humidor right now --  but if I took out the refrigeration  unit --
MARYLIN	f	Miles.
MILES	m	I think a nursery should be right  off the master suite. My parents put  mine in the guest house. Apparently  they did have a Fisher Price intercom,  but my mother turned it off when I  was seven months old because I was  so --
MILES	m	You want children, don't you?
RAMONA	f	You said 'yes' didn't you?
MARYLIN	f	I said yes.
MARYLIN	f	Is this Ming?
SARAH	f	It's not Ming. It's Tong.
RAMONA	f	Is Tong older than Ming?
MARYLIN	f	I think Ming is older than Tong. What is this?
SALESMAN	m	That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's  Chen dynasty.
MARYLIN	f	Ok. I'll take it.
MARYLIN	f	I can't do this anymore. Let's get  some lunch.
SARAH	f	What about rugs? I thought we were  stopping at Mansour?
MARYLIN	f	Right.
SALESMAN	m	And will this be check or --?
SALESMAN	m	Very good, Mrs. Massey.
MARYLIN	f	Well. He said to "make the house  mine."
RAMONA	f	Oh boy. If he only knew.
MARYLIN	f	Yeah. I guess. You know --
SARAH	f	What?
MARYLIN	f	He's not what I expected. He's very --  he's so -- happy.
SARAH	f	But you're going through with it?
MARYLIN	f	Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've  never been the first wife. Rex was  married before me.
SARAH	f	So what?
MARYLIN	f	Miles is different. He's still so  idealistic.
SARAH	f	Well, that's about to change big  time.
MARYLIN	f	He has no cynicism or anger. For  once I'm not the repository of rage  at some other woman.
SARAH	f	Soon, you'll have your own rage!
MARYLIN	f	I guess.
WOMAN	f	Wait. I know you.
MILES	m	Yes?
WOMAN	f	You're Miles Massey! You probably  don't recognize me. The drugs made  me put on weight and grow facial  hair.
MILES	m	Excuse me?
WOMAN	f	You ruined my life you sonofabitch.  Gimme those.
WOMAN	f	But my brother got you. He got you,  you slimeball.
NURSE	f	Emily!
MILES	m	What are you... Is she yours?
WOMAN	f	Howard Doyle is my brother? You know  my brother, Howard Doyle. You do  know my brother, don't you?
NURSE	f	I'm sorry, Sir. Emily. Give the man  back.
MILES	m	Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
WOMAN	f	He tricked you. With a phony wife  and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He  got you. You married Marylin, didn't  you? You thought she had money. HA  HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think  that because of what you did to me.  And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard  all about it. My brother Howard Doyle  got you. Neener neener neener.
MILES	m	He divorced his wife -- he married  Marylin -- he divorced Marylin --  and he -- remarried his WIFE? What  kind of sick --
RUTH	f	Marylin was friends with Howard and  Amanda Doyle. They don't like the  way you operate. They helped her.
MILES	m	He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
RUTH	f	I have no idea what Howard Doyle  eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
MILES	m	Did Marylin end up with money?
RUTH	f	She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask  her? Anyway, I assume she signed the  highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
MILES	m	I don't have a pre-nup
RUTH	f	...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars...
MILES	m	Don't give me that crap. That's MY  crap.
RUTH	f	And it's good!
MILES	m	I'll have you suspended. I'll have  you disbarred.
RUTH	f	Don't threaten me, Miles. I did  nothing illegal.
MILES	m	...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
RUTH	f	That's attorney client privilege. Sorry, Miles. But as a great and  clever man once said, What's good  for the goose --
MARYLIN	f	Hi.
MILES	m	Hello Marylin.
MARYLIN	f	I have a surprise for you.
MILES	m	I bet.
MARYLIN	f	Ta Da.
MARYLIN	f	You don't like it?
MARYLIN	f	You don't like me?
MILES	m	I love you. I want to have your baby.
MARYLIN	f	What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too  much?
MARYLIN	f	Miles. I have a very good relationship  with all the salesmen. I can return  everything.
MILES	m	Can you Marylin? Can you return the  trust? Can you return the hopes? The  dreams? Can you just...
MARYLIN	f	Miles? You're scaring me.
MILES	m	I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's  chic and timeless and elegant and  eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It  is YOU.
MARYLIN	f	But Ruth -- things have changed --  yes -- yes I understand. But you see --  I couldn't file, did I? And maybe I  wasn't going to file. Maybe -- maybe  Ruth -- Yes. Okay.
MARYLIN	f	Miles? Open the door, Miles. Please  open the door. I want to talk to  you. Miles? I'm coming in. Here I  come.
PROSECUTOR	m	How far would this gun have to be in  order to inflict a wound without  leaving powder burns on the scalp.
EXPERT WITNESS	m	Approximately three feet.
PROSECUTOR	m	And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot  herself in the back of the head from  a distance of three feet?
KENNETH	m	Really long arms?
MILES	m	They won't get a conviction. The  husband called it in as a suicide.  The forensic guys weren't thinking  murder. I'm sure some of the evidence  was compromised.
KENNETH	m	It's your move, Miles.
MILES	m	I already made my move, Kenneth.
SARAH	f	Vishu! Knock it off. That hurts.
VISHNU	m	Breathe through it.
VISHNU	m	That's good, Marylin.
MARYLIN	f	I don't even know where he is. He  looked so devastated. If I could  just talk to him for a few minutes.
MARYLIN	f	Was that the bell?
RAMONA	f	It sounded like a bell.
MARYLIN	f	I'll be right back.
MARYLIN	f	Yes? Can I help you?
POLICE OFFICER	m	Marylin Hamilton Rexroth Doyle Massey?
MARYLIN	f	Yes.
POLICE OFFICER	m	We have a warrant for your arrest.
MARYLIN	f	What?
POLICE OFFICER	m	You can go now, Mrs. Massey. Someone  made bail.
MARYLIN	f	Forgery and Fraud?
RUTH	f	You used his credit card.
MARYLIN	f	He told me to -- he said he wanted  me to --
RUTH	f	Quite a little shopping spree. How  do you spend six figures in less  than six hours? Oh, never mind I've  seen it before. I've seen everything.
MARYLIN	f	Do you think he set me up? Do you  think that was his intention?
RUTH	f	Like I know his intention? Or yours  for that matter? I should join Sam. I'm too old for  this bullshit.
MARYLIN	f	He never even asked. He just assumed --
RUTH	f	He was right, wasn't he?
MARYLIN	f	So. Now what?
RUTH	f	Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a  deal or find out how Jean Harris  made it work for her.
MILES	m	Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
MARYLIN	f	May I come in?
MILES	m	I don't know. Maybe I should grab my  mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have  little experience with "the criminal  mind."
MARYLIN	f	I'd just like to pick up a few of my  things
MILES	m	I don't believe you have "things."
MARYLIN	f	On the contrary. We're married and  we have no pre-nup, so a case could  be made that everything in here is  mine.
MARYLIN	f	Comfy!
MILES	m	What do you want?
MARYLIN	f	I want to nail you ass.
MILES	m	Are you threatening me, because I'm  sure that's a violation of the terms  of your bail.
MARYLIN	f	I'm reporting you to the IRS.
MILES	m	The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting  a refund.
MILES	m	I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported  every dollar I've ever made. Try  again, girlfriend.
MARYLIN	f	I'm not talking about dollars,  studmuffin. I'm talking about --
MARYLIN	f	STUFF.
MILES	m	What kind of "stuff?"
MARYLIN	f	Arty Farty stuff. Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans.  Watches and mileage on private jets.  Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from  grateful clients.
MILES	m	Those are gifts.
MARYLIN	f	Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on  Bellagio Road?
MILES	m	You can't prove anything.
MARYLIN	f	I don't have to. That's what the IRS  guys do. And they do it with great  zeal. See, they work at these tortuous  civil service jobs, and when five  hundred dollar an hour boys like you  take their trade out in luxury  goodies, these saps feel.. well,  they feel like saps. And they feel  bitter and they feel vengeful and  they feel WRATH. What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
MILES	m	You're out of your league, Marylin.  Rexroth was a primate. I'm a  professional.
MARYLIN	f	I know. So am I, right? And so is  Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue  Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid  graduate of Southwestern University --  very tenacious, and never more so  than when he's dealing with an  unscrupulous colleague. I think it's only fair to warn you:  I'm going to file an action, Miles.  And after a decent interval I plan  to have Ruth seek an injunction that  will forbid your approach within 500  feet of my house.
MILES	m	Meaning my house.
MARYLIN	f	I believe the residence will be part  of the settlement.
MILES	m	Did our marriage ever mean anything  to you?
MARYLIN	f	Drop the bogus forgery charge and  I'll forget about your generous  friends slash clients.
MILES	m	That's blackmail.
MARYLIN	f	That's marriage.
MARYLIN	f	You'll always be my favorite husband.
MILES	m	Pity you can't be here. You'd enjoy  this.
HERB	m	This woman has humbled, shamed and  disgrazed the entire foim.
MILES	m	Yes Herb,
HERB	m	Counseluh, this foim deals in powuh.  This foim deals in p'seption. This  foim cannot prospuh... nor long  endowwa. if it is p'seeved as dancin'  to the music..
HERB	m	-- of the hoidy-goidy.
MILES	m	I understand Herb... I just... for  the first time in my career -- I  don't know what to do. I'm a patsy.  A sitting duck. I'm lost.
HERB	m	Lost! I'll tell you what you can do,  you can --
HERB	m	-- leave us.
HERB	m	-- You can act like a man. Let me  tell you sumpn, smart guy. You tawt  you had it all figgud out. Trust.  Marriage. All ya goddamn love love  love. Well now you lissean me. I'm  gonna talk to you about the goddamn
HERB	m	-- We SOIVE THE LAW! We HONUH the  law! We make our goddamn bread and  BUTTUH by the law! And sometimes,  counseluh, we OBEY THE LAW --
HERB	m	-- but conseluh -- This is not one a  those times.
NIKKI	f	We are interrupting our scheduled  weekend coverage because we have  just received word there is a verdict  in the Kentucky v Leonard Case. We  now join the case -- live.
BAILIFF	?	Of the charges of murder in the first  degree, we the jury find the defendant --  not guilty.
NIKKI	f	He got away with it.
GUEST	m	Simpson started a trend.
VOICE	m	...Are you Joe?
GANGSTER	m	...Dumbarton?
MILES	m	I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton,  on a... matter of some delicacy.
GANGSTER	m	Who's the pigeon?
MILES	m	Excuse me?
GANGSTER	m	Who do you want me to kill?
MILES	m	Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr.  Dumbarton -- would like you to uh,  neutralize a, uh, business associate  by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle  Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
GANGSTER	m	Is that... one person?
MILES	m	Here's her picture...
MILES	m	...and the address where she's  staying. It's the residence of a Mr.  Massey. Uh, Dumbarton. Massey. Uh,  it's not Mr. Dumbarton's house. Though  he's not involved. And because of an  impending legal action this needs to  happen within a certain... time frame.  Uh... on an expedited basis.
GANGSTER	m	You're in a rush.
MILES	m	Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
MILES	m	She won't suffer, will she?
GANGSTER	m	...not unless you pay extra.
REX	m	I've been working on the railroad --
TARTS	m	All the livelong day!
REX	m	I've been working on the railroad
TARTS	m	Just to pass the time away!
REX	m	Can'tcha hear the whistle... the  whistle... AWWWWWWW.
REX	m	Awwwwwww --
TART	?	-- Whatsa matter, Rexie?
VOICE	m	Hello. Yes, he's here. Just a minute --
KENNETH	m	Miles. It's for you.
MILES	m	Hello. Yes -- what?! Yes -- I see --
MILES	m	My God.
KENNETH	m	What?
MILES	m	That was Marvin Untermeyer.
KENNETH	m	Yes?
MILES	m	He was Rex Rexroth's personal  attorney.
KENNETH	m	What do you mean, was.
MILES	m	Rex just had a massive coronary. In  the middle of a business meeting.  He's dead.
KENNETH	m	I'm sorry to hear that. But you  weren't close, were you?
MILES	m	Marvin says that Rex's will is four  years old. He never redrafted it.
KENNETH	m	Yes.
MILES	m	Everything goes to Marylin.
MILES	m	She's rich. We're still married. We  have no pre-nup.
KENNETH	m	So, that's good, right?
VOICE	m	This is Joe. Wuddya need?
MILES	m	Joe. This is Mr. uh... friend of --  we met. This is to instruct you it's  No Go! Do you understand me?! NO GO  on Marylin Rexroth Doyle -- No Go.
KENNETH	m	Who was that?
MILES	m	That was -- oh, shit. What if he's  on his way over there?
KENNETH	m	Huh?
MILES	m	Marylin! What have I done?
KENNETH	m	I don't know, but don't call me  Marylin.
MILES	m	Get her out, buy some time; get her  out --
MARYLIN	f	Hello?
MILES	m	Marylin?
MARYLIN	f	Miles? Miles! Where have you been?  I've been trying to get in touch.
MILES	m	You have to leave the house  immediately!
MARYLIN	f	I will, Miles. I will leave. But  Miles --
MILES	m	No buts. Now. Out.
MARYLIN	f	Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles.  It's true that my initial intention  was to...
MILES	m	Please! Leave the house.
MARYLIN	f	I fell in love Miles.
MILES	m	So did I. Now pack up a few basics  and --
MARYLIN	f	You do? You do love me?
MARYLIN	f	Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
JOE	m	Mr. Dumbarton.
MARYLIN	f	Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
JOE	m	No...
JOE	m	That's his lawyer.
MARYLIN	f	Triple!
JOE	m	Who's the pigeon?
MILES	m	Marylin?
MILES	m	Joe! Thank God you're in time. You're  not in time. I'm in time. Thank God  I'm in time.
MILES	m	It's a no go! Get it? No one any the  wiser. Okay!
MILES	m	You can go home now! Goodbye! Thanks  so much!
MILES	m	No no! No contract! It's all over.
MARYLIN	f	It's a no go, Joe.
MILES	m	Marylin!
MARYLIN	f	It's okay Joe.
MILES	m	Wait! He works for YOU?
MARYLIN	f	Now. But first, he worked for you.
MILES	m	You were going to have this thug...?
MARYLIN	f	Wait just a second there. You sent  him here. You unearthed this  pestilence.
JOE	m	You're calling me a pestilence? That's  a hoot!
MARYLIN	f	I'm sorry. That was unkind and --  but, we changed our minds. Did you really mean what you said on  the phone. It wasn't because you  found out about Rex?
MILES	m	Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband.  I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No  matter what happened to you.
MARYLIN	f	That's true.
JOE	m	Lemme tell you something. You are  the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
MARYLIN	f	Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay  you the twenty thousand.
MILES	m	It was fifty for you.
JOE	m	That's cause you're a lawyer. I gave  her the lawyer discount. But I shouldn't of. Cause you're a  whore. A whore who worships the  dollar.
MARYLIN	f	Well, actually, all whores worship  the dollar, if you want to get  technical.
JOE	m	Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like  you. And my clients? Whores just  like you.
MILES	m	Were you with a firm?
JOE	m	Kaplan.
MILES	m	Kaplan? I know Kaplan. Wait. You're  Joe Gittelson? I knew you looked --  You were great -- we studied you.
JOE	m	Twenty years in "matrimonial law"  and it made me sick. I broke up homes and families, never  givin' it a second thought. Till one  day. I had an epiphany. You know  what that is? Came with a damn stigmata if you can  believe that! I said to myself --  Joe -- everyone you see wants blood.  Everyone wants their ex's dead. So  why jerk around with rest. You wanna  best serve your clients? Kill em.
MILES	m	Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
MARYLIN	f	I'm not leaving you. I took self  defense
MILES	m	Joe!
MILES	m	WE told him it was no go...
RUTH	f	Alright.
WRIGLEY	?	Ruth.
MILES	m	Hello Marylin.
MARYLIN	f	Hello Miles.
MILES	m	Hard to believe this is the way it  will end up for us.
MARYLIN	f	It's not something I wanted either.
MILES	m	But then -- I guess -- something  inside me died when I realized that  you'd hired a goon to kill me.
MARYLIN	f	Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt  when I realized you'd hired the goon  to kill...
RUTH	f	Now you both wait a minute. Nobody  hired anyone to kill anyone.
WRIGLEY	?	Hear, hear.
WRIGLEY	?	Apparently, from what I can gather,  a burglar broke into your house --  became despondent over his lifestyle  and shot himself.
MILES	m	Where does that leave us?
RUTH	f	We've outlined a settlement...
RUTH	f	We think it's more than generous.
WRIGLEY	?	My client is prepared to consider a  reconciliation.
MARYLIN	f	How could I trust you, after... after  all of this.
MILES	m	You wounded me first, Marylin.
MARYLIN	f	Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
MILES	m	You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
MARYLIN	f	Forgery? Fraud?
MILES	m	Income tax evasion?
MARYLIN	f	Murder?
MILES	m	Murder!
MARYLIN	f	I don't see how we can ever find our  way back from...
MILES	m	You know... there's nothing in the  Massey pre-nup that says it can't be  executed after the parties wed.
RUTH	f	It's the Massey pre-nup --
RUTH	f	O-kay. I'm going back to the office
RUTH	f	Come on Wrigley, I'll buy you a drink  and an anti depressant.
WRIGLEY	?	No one will ever love me that way.
RUTH	f	Not if you're lucky. No.
MILES	m	Let's go home.
MILES	m	Wait. Just wait for one minute. Sweet  Jesus, are you crazy?
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	m	Sorry, Mr. Massey. Thought you cleared  that shit out.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2	m	You know, man... those things'll  kill ya. I know all you old boomer  potheads like em. They're illegal,  and you get to put em in fancy boxes --  but -- shit man! It's still tobacco.
MARYLIN	f	You know, sweets, he's right.
MILES	m	Pre-Castro.
MARYLIN	f	Fine. They were created during a  dictatorship. What if something happened to you?  What would I tell little Gus when he  asked "what was my daddy like?"
MILES	m	Here, buddy. These are for you.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	m	Great. Now I can die.
MILES	m	Well. You'd say "they devoted a whole  semester at Harvard to your Dad. But  your Mom was the one that ever only  nailed his ass."
MARYLIN	f	Sweet.
MILES	m	I thought so.
