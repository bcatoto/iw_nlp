NED 	m	To some guys, women are like a cheap  puzzle... with pieces that just don't  fit. They think the soul of a woman  is darker than a back alley... more  tangled than a telephone cord... and  colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada.  But those guys don't even have a  clue.
NED 	m	When you know women the way I do,  you understand exactly what what  makes them tick... what makes them  hum... what makes them jiggle up and  down when they walk. And it's not  the kind of thing you can learn from  a correspondence course.
NED 	m	There are two kinds of women in this  world... and I've known 'em both.
NED 	m	One will take you for a fast ride on  a bumpy road with no seat belt. But  the other kind...
ARCH	m	Jeez... knock off the chatter, will  ya.
NED	m	Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.
ARCH	m	I'm awake! Where do you come up with  all that crap about women?
NED	m	It's true. Women are very complex,  but if you know how to read 'em...  they're an open book. You can always  tell the rotten apples from the  peaches.
ARCH	m	Are you kiddin'?
NED	m	I'd stake my career on it. Anybody  ever proves me wrong, I'll throw  away my badge.
ARCH	m	Aayyhh... women are trouble...
NED	m	I used to believe that too. Until I  married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.
ARCH	m	Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff,  pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a  beautiful wife waitin' for ya at  home. Everything a guy could ever  want, including NO kids.
NED	m	I'd love to have kids.
ARCH	m	What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break! Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes  you think Milo's gonna show up here?
NED	m	Logic. He knocked off all those banks.  He's got cash. He's gonna want to  spend it. This is one of the few  places that still takes cash. Sooner  or later... he's gotta turn up.
ARCH	m	And how we s'posed to recognize this  scumbag?
NED	m	The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you  see him... you'll know him.
ARCH	m	These are the best damn Nachos in  North America. Maybe the world!
ARCH	m	I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill.  You want some?
LOLA	f	Got a light?
NED	m	Sure.
LOLA	f	How about a match?
NED	m	No thanks. I have plenty.
LOLA	f	You really are incredibly stupid,  aren't you? I like that in a man.
NED	m	I'd be insulted, but I know you're  serious.
LOLA	f	You sound so sure of yourself.
NED	m	I'm not as dumb as I look.
LOLA	f	Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...
NED	m	Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?
LOLA	f	Thirsty. What about that drink?
NED	m	I'm on duty.
LOLA	f	Brain surgeon?
NED	m	Cop.
LOLA	f	Oooo... and I bet you have a big  gun.
NED	m	You lose.
LOLA	f	If I can't buy you a drink... ...let me buy you one of those.
NED	m	Who can say no to a weiner?
LOLA	f	Not me.
LOLA	f	Two dogs. Hot.
NED	m	You come here often?
LOLA	f	Only when I'm in heat.
NED	m	Oh! Sorry.
LOLA	f	Where ya going?
NED	m	Get something to wipe it off.
LOLA	f	That's okay. You're doing just fine.
NED	m	I'll get you a wet paper towel.
NED	m	Hold it right there, Milo!
RESTROOM PATRON	m	Look out! He's got a weenie!
NED	m	Police emergency! I need your car!
NED	m	You take science in high school,  Milo?
MILO	m	I skipped high school, cop!
NED	m	Then you're probably not familiar  with the theory of inverse  proportionate explosive dynamics.
MILO	m	What about it?
NED	m	If you fire a weapon with the barrel  obstructed, the explosive force  multiplies by twenty-three point  five nine eight and reverses on itself  with diametric polarity?
MILO	m	Yeah. So?
NED	m	The gun will blow up in your hand...  and it won't even scorch my pinkie.
MILO	m	Ha! That's just theoretical  hypothesis. Inverse proportionate  explosive dynamics has never been  demonstrated conclusively in a  laboratory environment.
NED	m	Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart  guy. Let's find out.
NED	m	You have the right to remain silent...  next... if you waive that right,  anything you say... next...
NED	m	...may be used against you in a court  of law... next... You have the right  to an attorney... Do you have an  attorney?
MILO	m	Nahhhh!
NED	m	Then today's your lucky day...
LANA 	f	Oh yes, Frank! Adjust the stroke by  ten percent! That's it. Now tweak my points. Oh yes, oh yes! You got it! Stabilize your ball joints  and grind my rear differential! Now accelerate! Floor it! Lay rubber,  baby! VRRROOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!
LANA	f	Not bad for an auto mechanic...
FRANK	m	Yeah, well you're not so bad  yourself... for a lawyer's wife...
LANA	f	Better watch your tongue, sweetie,  or I'll have my husband arrest you.
FRANK	m	Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When  does he ever find time for you?
LANA	f	He doesn't. That's why I need you to  keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why  drive a jalopy when you can have a  hot rod?
FRANK	m	Maybe you should trade him in on a  new model.
LANA	f	I would... if I could make any money  on the deal.
FRANK	m	Want to go for another test drive?
LANA	f	Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm  still under warranty.
NED	m	Morning sweetheart.
LANA	f	Uh huh. Want some coffee?
NED	m	No thanks.
LANA	f	Frank here was just grabbing a little  before going back to work on my car.
NED	m	How long you been working on Lana's  Mercedes, Frank?
FRANK	m	Oh... I don't know... six, seven  weeks.
NED	m	And ya still haven't found the  problem?
FRANK	m	Think I got my finger on it though.
NED	m	I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't  born yesterday. He's not fixing your  car. He's SCREWING you!
NED	m	YOU are screwing my wife! I can see  what your game is, Frank. You open  up her hood, poke around in there...  squirt some lubrication in... play  around with all her parts... then  take an old used piston and stick it  in... then pull it out... in, out,  in, out! Every day! There's no end  to it. You just keep coming and  COMING!... and the bill just gets  bigger and BIGGER!
NED	m	But you don't see it, do you, Lana?  You're too good... too pure. You  can't see the evil in people like  him. Well, you're not getting away with  it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're  fired!
LANA	f	Ned... don't you have to be somewhere?
NED	m	Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late  for court.
NED	m	You are so naive.
NED	m	Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!
FRANK	m	Who's that?
LANA	f	Just the postman. He always rings  twice.
NED	m	Laura... do you know where...?
LAURA	f	Right here. The judge decided to  skip arraignment and take Milo direct  to trial. You're six minutes late,  but don't sweat it. You got Judge  Allen. He's always eleven minutes  late.
LAURA	f	I suggest you try Lemming versus  Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped  in the water and everybody followed.
NED	m	Yeah. Good idea.
NED	m	I don't know what I'd do without  you?
LAURA	f	Really?
NED	m	Laura, how long have you worked for  me?
LAURA	f	Two years, seven months, twenty-three  days, nineteen hours... ...six minutes and fifty-two seconds. ...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty- five... fifty-six...
NED	m	And when was the last time I gave  you a raise?
LAURA	f	Never. But that's okay. I don't need  a raise. In fact... I was thinking  of giving you a rebate on my salary.
NED	m	Naw. That's okay. You keep it.
LAURA'S HUSBAND	m	Did we forget something?
LAURA'S HUSBAND	m	Did we forget something?
NED	m	Laura. Laura! What is it?
LAURA	f	I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a  bit... claustrophobic... in the  bathroom.
NED	m	Maybe we should try some prune juice.
LAURA	f	Wear the blue one.
NED	m	Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you...  does this look like the face of a  crook?
NED	m	Of course it does. But the question  of my client's guilt or innocence is  not the issue here today. I'm certain  every member of the jury can clearly  see that he's guilty!
BLIND JUROR	m	I can't.
NED	m	Put yourself in his shoes. Look  through his eyes. See the world the  way HE sees it!
NED	m	Things just don't look the same.  It's fuzzy... and frightening!
NED	m	Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley  is not the perpetrator here. He is  the VICTIM!
NED	m	Like ALL of us... this man is the  unfortunate victim of these tragically  difficult economic times. And what  does that mean? He can't support his  family!
NED	m	For God's sake!... He can't even  support his own FACE!
JUDGE ALLEN	m	Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum  in my courtroom... unless you have  enough for everyone.
JUDGE ALLEN	m	Bailiff. Pass these out.
JUDGE ALLEN	m	And don't forget the jury.
NED	m	And so, desperate and broke, with no  other options before him, Mr. Crumley  went to eleven Savings & Loans and  did what any of you would have done.  He stole back the money that the  S&Ls had stolen from him!
JUDGE ALLEN	m	Mr. Ravine... please approach the  bench.
JUDGE ALLEN	m	You're not running for congress here,  so knock off the speeches and quit  inciting these brainless morons! Now  pick up the pace and wrap this son- of-a-bitch up! Call your first  witness.
NED	m	I call... Detective Ned Ravine.
BAILIFF	?	Do you swear to tell the truth, the  whole truth and nothing but the truth,  so help you God?
NED	m	I do.
NED	m	Detective Ravine, at the time of the  arrest, did you read the defendant  his Miranda rights?
NED	m	Of course. That's standard procedure.
NED	m	Are these the cards Officer Brooks  used to prompt you while reading Mr.  Crumley his rights?
NED	m	Yeah. These are them.
NED	m	Reading from the cards now... quote  "You have the right to remain silent,  if you waive that right, anything  you say... may be used against you  in a court of law." Is that right?
NED	m	That's right.
NED	m	WRONG! The official Miranda warning  is... "anything you say CAN be used  against you in a court of law." Not  "may"... "CAN!" Don't you know the difference between  "can" and "may", Detective? Every  school kid knows "can" is a verb  that indicates ability to perform,  while "may" is a verbal auxiliary  indicating the permission to act.
NED	m	I didn't have time to worry about  past participles or interrogative  pronouns! I was trying to protect  society from a deranged MADMAN! But this ivy league fop...!!!
NED	m	I have no more use for this witness.
JUDGE ALLEN	m	Mr. Ravine...
JUDGE ALLEN	m	I'm dismissing this case on the  grounds of improper grammar.
NED	m	Ow!
PROSECUTOR	m	But your Honor...!
JUDGE ALLEN	m	I know, I know. It's a technicality.  But it's the kind of technicality  that makes the American legal system  what it is today! Court's adjourned!
LOLA	f	I waited. You never came back.
NED	m	I got busy. Here's that paper towel  I promised.
LOLA	f	Thanks...
NED	m	How'd you get in? The door was locked.
LOLA	f	It's miraculous what a real woman  can do... with a bobbie pin.
LOLA	f	Cigarette?
NED	m	No... thanks. They're bad for ya.
LOLA	f	Yes, I know. I like things that are  bad for me. So... I hear you go both ways.
NED	m	Only once. It was a fraternity prank.  I never saw him again.
LOLA	f	No, I mean... you're a cop and a  lawyer.
NED	m	Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of  scum out there on the streets... but  they all deserve a fair and costly  trial.
LAURA	f	I'll get that.
NED	m	Oh... Laura... this is, uh...
LOLA	f	Lola Cain.
LOLA	f	So lovely to meet you, Laura.
NED	m	Gotta keep these darn books in their  right place or we'll never find the  ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M...  R thru B... W thru F...
LAURA	f	It's getting late. I'll give you a  ride home, Ned.
NED	m	I have my car.
LAURA	f	I'll tow you.
NED	m	Not today. You don't need to wait.  I'll see you tomorrow.
LAURA	f	I should call someone to fix this...
NED	m	Tomorrow...
LAURA	f	I'll call from home.
LOLA	f	I think I should warn you, Mr.  Ravine... I'm not wearing any  underwear.
NED	m	Try these on.
NED	m	So... what can I do for you?
LOLA	f	I've run across some... papers...  and I thought you might be able to  tell me what they are. You see, I'm  not very experienced when it comes  to... papers.
NED	m	I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able.  Do you have the... papers... here?
LOLA	f	No... they're at home. I thought you  might stop by...
NED	m	I'm on duty tonight.
LOLA	f	Don't they ever give you a night  off?
NED	m	Yeah. Tomorrow.
LOLA	f	Why don't we meet tomorrow evening  then?
LOLA	f	I'll let you know where.
NED	m	What's wrong with my office?
LOLA	f	Nothing a good interior decorator  couldn't fix.
LOLA	f	Take care of this for me, will ya?
FRANK	m	I came back for my shower cap.
LANA	f	Yeah, well you came to the right  place.
LANA	f	Sit down.
FRANK	m	Where is he?
LANA	f	On duty all night. By the time he  wraps up his reports, it'll be close  to noon tomorrow.
LANA	f	I was just reading over...
LANA	f	Take off the hat, Frank.
LANA	f	I was just reading over my husband's  insurance policies. You wouldn't  know anything about insurance, would  you, Frankie?
FRANK	m	Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies  part-time. I got half a brain... or  didn't you notice?
LANA	f	I musta had my eye on something else. How about a translation.
FRANK	m	Standard accident policy... all the  usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The  face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three  million bucks! And there's a triple indemnity rider.
LANA	f	Meaning?
FRANK	m	Aw, it's just something agents throw  in so we can boost the premium. If  the policy holder dies under very  specific conditions, it pays off  three times the face value of the  policy.
LANA	f	Nine million dollars...?
FRANK	m	Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the  company. Nobody ever collects.
LANA	f	Why not?
FRANK	m	Well, like here... it only pays off  if he's shot with a pistol, falls  from a moving northbound train and  drowns in a fresh water stream.
LANA	f	All three?
FRANK	m	See what I mean, sweetheart? What  are the odds of that?
LANA	f	It could happen. Suppose it did happen?
FRANK	m	Then you'd be rich.
LANA	f	Then we'd be rich.
FRANK	m	What're you sayin'...?
LANA	f	We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch!  And I know exactly how! He has a  legal symposium in Santa Barbara  this weekend... All we have to do is  get him to take the train up instead  of driving.
FRANK	m	How we gonna do that? Didn't you  tell me he hates trains?
LANA	f	That's where you come in, baby. You're  gonna rig his car so it doesn't work.  That should be no problem for you.
LANA	f	Then... we give him a lift to the  train station... through Dealey Plaza,  past the Book Suppository and around  the grassy knoll...
FRANK	m	Isn't that out of our way?
LANA	f	Move, Frank.
LANA	f	And pay attention.
LANA	f	Ten minutes out of the station he'll  be standing in the vestibule between  cars... trying to avoid a panic  attack. Fourteen minutes and ten  seconds out, the train crosses the  Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen  minutes and fifty-four seconds, I  shoot him, shove him out the door...  he hits the river and drowns. Bingo!  A triple play. We're rich!
FRANK	m	You been thinking about this a lot,  haven't you?
LANA	f	No. It just came to me. I had this image of a big, powerful,  throbbing train... plunging into a  long, dark, wet tunnel.
NED	m	Stand over there and shut up!
GANG MEMBER #1	m	Hey, man, we got rights! Don't you  be layin' no deleterious malfeasance  on us.
NED	m	Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want  to hear language like that!
ARCH	m	Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy.  You seem a little tense tonight.  What is it?
NED	m	Aw... I don't know. I guess it's  Lana. It's just... I know she wants  to have a baby so bad...
NED	m	...but I never get to spend any time  with her. And when I am home... it's  like she's, you know... avoiding  sex.
GANG MEMBER #1	m	You should try to be more sensitive,  man. More romantic. Bring her flowers.
GANG MEMBER #1	m	Try to understand how she feels.  After all...
GANG MEMBER #1	m	She may be weary... Women do get  weary... Wearing that same old shabby  dress... But when she's weary... Try  a little ten-der-ness...
NED	m	That can't be it. I'm the tenderest  guy on the force. Nah... I think  she's just afraid she won't be able  to get pregnant.
ARCH	m	What's to be afraid! It's like making  breakfast! You bring home the bacon...  she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it  up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got  an omelette in the oven! Why don't you knock off early... go  home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake  up in the morning and find you there  for a change.
NED	m	Naw... I can't. I got all this  paperwork.
ARCH	m	Don't worry about that.
GANG MEMBER #1	m	We'll do our own paperwork, man!
OTHER GANG MEMBERS	m	Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit.
WILLARD SCOTT	m	...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of  Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and  thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of  female! Smokes three cigars a day,  drinks a straight shot of vodka at  bedtime... and still has sex!
NED	m	Damn birds!
LAURA	f	My God, Ned... you look like you  were hit by a bus.
NED	m	I was. Who's in my office?
LAURA	f	Max Shady's mother.
NED	m	Not again.
NED	m	Hello, Mrs. Shady.
NED	m	Laura... check on my insurance. Make  sure it's paid up.
MRS. SHADY	f	Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max,  is getting out of prison tomorrow.
NED	m	Gee, has it been seven years already?
MRS. SHADY	f	Seven long, miserable years in the  slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.
NED	m	Well, being locked in a tiny room  with no TV can make a guy feel pretty  tense.
MRS. SHADY	f	I'm very concerned about him, Mr.  Ravine. He said you were a two-bit  shyster... and he's going to rip  your head off and use it for a bowling  ball!
NED	m	I'm sure the experience wasn't all  negative. He probably made a lot of  friends...
MRS. SHADY	f	You think?
NED	m	...learned a useful trade...
MRS. SHADY	f	Oh yes... live autopsies...
NED	m	...caught up on all those books he  wanted to read...
MRS. SHADY	f	Maybe so... but he said he's going  to punch you in the testicles...
MRS. SHADY	f	...smash your face...
MRS. SHADY	f	...and decimate your wardrobe.
MRS. SHADY	f	And I wouldn't want that to happen. He's a naughty naughty boy. I just  thought I should warn you.
MRS. SHADY	f	Bye for now. Oh... may I have a cookie?
LAURA	f	Sure.
MRS. SHADY	f	Thank yooooooooou.
LAURA	f	Oh my God, Ned.
NED	m	I hate when she comes to see me.
LAURA	f	Don't you realize, Ned?... you could  be in real danger.
NED	m	What's that?
LAURA	f	Extreme peril. You know, the risk of  personal bodily harm.
NED	m	No... I mean that.
LAURA	f	Your insurance file. But the policy's  missing. Did you take it home?
NED	m	I don't think so.
LAURA	f	Oh, wait a second...
LAURA'S HUSBAND	m	Lau-raaaaa!
NED	m	Laura! Are you alright? That was a  very long flashback you had.
LAURA	f	Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a  little... pre-menstrual.
LAURA	f	That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped  by. She left this!
NED	m	Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked  me to take care of this.
LOLA	f	Thanks...
NED	m	You smoke too much. It's hot tonight.
LOLA	f	Is it? I never know. My body heat  runs about twenty degrees above  normal.
NED	m	Maybe we should look for a cooler  place.
LOLA	f	I doubt we'll find one. Even the  wind chimes on my porch aren't moving  much these days. They keep thudding  softly, like dairy cows bumping butts  in the night. I go out there expecting  to find a cool breeze... but it's  just a lot of hot air.
NED	m	What're they lookin' at?
LOLA	f	A lot of them have tried that seat.  You're the first one's lasted this  long.
NED	m	I feel honored.
LOLA	f	Don't. It's broken.
NED	m	Did you bring the... papers?
LOLA	f	No. I thought you might come over...
NED	m	Sure. I'll drive you.
LOLA	f	I brought my own car.
NED	m	I'll follow you then.
LOLA	f	I know it sounds silly, but would  you leave first... wait in your car?  I come here a lot and I wouldn't  want those men to think I'm "easy"...  a slut who'll jump into bed with  anyone at the drop of a hat. But if  you leave first...
NED	m	...they'll think I'm a putz for  passing up a sure thing.
LOLA	f	Now leave me alone!
NED	m	Well, here we are... in the dark.
LOLA	f	I have The Clapper.
NED	m	You what?
LOLA	f	My wind chimes.
NED	m	You know, these would work a lot  better if you took them out of the  boxes.
LOLA	f	Well well... I guess you have been  around. I'm impressed.
NED	m	Why don't we take a look at those...  papers?
LOLA	f	Papers. Right.
NED	m	That's it? These are the... papers?
LOLA	f	Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can  you tell me what they are?
NED	m	This one's a laundry receipt... and  the other one's an expired lottery  ticket.
LOLA	f	No. You keep them... as a memento of  our time together.
LOLA	f	I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay  you for all you've done?
NED	m	Cash would be nice.
LOLA	f	Isn't there some other way?
NED	m	I suppose you could wash my car.
LOLA	f	No, I mean, isn't there something  else you want? Something I could  give you?
NED	m	Hey... slow down... there's a speed  limit in this state. Sixty-five miles  an hour.
LOLA	f	How fast was I going, officer?
NED	m	Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.
LOLA	f	Suppose you pull me over and frisk  me?
NED	m	Suppose I let you off with a warning?
LOLA	f	Suppose I find a cop with a bigger  nightstick?
NED	m	Suppose I put you under arrest for  being a bad girl with bad thoughts?
LOLA	f	Suppose you handcuff me to the bed?
NED	m	Suppose I do and then we lose the  key and while I'm gone to get a  duplicate made the house catches on  fire and I can't get back to save  you because the bridge is washed out  and so you die a horrible death  toasted like a Polish sausage on a  flaming spit! Nah... I better be going.
LOLA	f	You're not so tough. Last chance.
NED	m	No thanks. I got a cold shower and a  wife who trusts me waiting at home.
LOLA	f	What's the matter? Don't you want  me? It's the way I look, isn't it?
NED	m	Don't forget to lock up.
LOLA	f	I knew you'd come back...
NED	m	I forgot my car keys.
LOLA	f	That's not what you came back for.
NED	m	Yes it is.
LOLA	f	...don't... stop...
LOLA	f	...Oh Ned... please... don't...  stop...
LOLA	f	That takes care of foreplay.
GUARD	m	It's time, Max.
REPORTER #1	m	Mr. Shady! What's the first thing  you're gonna do now that you're out?
MAX SHADY	m	Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off  and use it for a bowling ball!
REPORTER #2	m	Are you a good bowler?
REPORTER #3	m	You ever bowled a three-hundred game?
REPORTER #4	m	How would you handle a seven-ten  split?
REPORTER #1	m	Say, aren't you wearing one of  Ravine's "trademark" blue suits?
MAX SHADY	m	Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a  gift... to make up for losing my  case. Now I'm going to wear it to  his friggin' funeral!!
MAX SHADY	m	Ma!
NED	m	That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?
LOLA	f	Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.
NED	m	Oh yeah, sure... now I can hear it.
LOLA	f	It tells the sad story of a woman  who is rejected by her lover after a  brief, but torrid, affair... so she  stalks him with an ice pick and stabs  him with it more than a thousand  times.
NED	m	Really? I never could understand the  lyrics.
NED	m	You know, what happened last night  was very, uh...
LOLA	f	Yes... it was. I should check on my  homeowners insurance.
NED	m	But we can't ever let it happen again.  Ever!
LOLA	f	What are you saying, Ned? That you're  rejecting me, your lover, after a  brief, but torrid, affair?!
NED	m	I wouldn't put it exactly like that.  It's just that... well, I'm married  to a wonderful woman... who is very,  very attractive... ...not that you aren't very  attractive!
NED	m	...you aren't very attractive... you  aren't very attractive... you aren't  very attractive...
CLERK	m	Don't touch anything. You bond with  it... you buy it. Whatdya want?
NED	m	I'd like to buy a pet.
CLERK	m	Yeah. For what purpose?
NED	m	It's a gift... for my wife.
CLERK	m	Right. They all say that.
NED	m	She spends a lot of time alone. I  thought it might be nice if she had  something to keep her company.
CLERK	m	Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know  you're not the kind of guy who punches  out parakeets? Or takes some poor  defenseless animal, throws it in a  sack and runs over it with your car  five or six times.
NED	m	I would never hurt an animal.
CLERK	m	Boy, I would. They're driving me
CLERK	m	Shuddup!
CLERK	m	Okay... tell me more about this broad  you're married to. I like to match  people with the pets they deserve.
ARCH	m	Uh-uh.
NED	m	You do all my paperwork?
NED	m	Get out of here.
ARCH	m	And a damn good job, too. One of 'em  even did it in Spanish.
ARCH	m	Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.
MAX 	m	...I'd like to reach down Ned Ravine's  throat and pull out his guts with my  bare hands!
ARCH	m	Jesus... you hear that?
NED	m	He's just working through his anger,  trying to find a constructive outlet.
ARCH	m	Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The  guy's a friggin' looney!
NED	m	Trust me, I spent a lot of time with  him when I was preparing his case.  He's really a very sweet, sensitive  human being.
MAX	m	I'd like to mash his head like a  ripe melon...
NED	m	He gets a little melon-dramatic.
MAX	m	...then cut off all his fingers and  rip out his liver with my teeth!
NED	m	See. Loves to exaggerate.
ARCH	m	Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit.
NED	m	Lieutenant Ravine.
LOLA	f	I want to see you, Ned.
NED	m	I told you not to call me! It's  finished between us. No. No, I'm not  sucking anything of yours anymore! It's done! OVER!
NED	m	Wrong number.
FRANK	m	How come we gotta meet here?
LANA	f	We have to be careful now. We can't  risk being seen together at the house  or someone might connect us to the  murder later on.
LANA	f	Here... put this on.
LANA	f	Speak Yiddish.
FRANK	m	What?
LANA	f	Red Yiddish.
FRANK	m	Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der  nisht geshtoigen un nisht gefloygen.
LANA	f	Zein nisht azoy meshige! Der plan iz  kosher vi yosher.
FRANK	m	Yo! Ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug.  Un schissen un schtippen in vasser  arein. Oy a broch! Mir zenen git  bakackt.
LANA	f	Vus iz mit idr? Die host a vaichen  schmoke?
FRANK	m	Ven hob ich gehat a vaichen schmoke?
LANA	f	Lest'n Yomkippur.
FRANK	m	Nu shoin, ein mul. Es paseert tsie  yeyden man.
FRANK	m	Oy! Mir vellen zein oif groise tsures.  Me'vet unz chap'n.
OLDER GENTLEMAN	m	There's very little risk involved.  Statistics reveal that less than  thirty-two percent of all murderers  are ever apprehended.
LANA	f	You speak Yiddish?
OLDER GENTLEMAN	m	No. But I can read sub-titles.
SUB-TITLE	?	Oy vay!
LAURA	f	Oh gee, you shouldn't have...
NED	m	I didn't. It's for my wife.
LAURA	f	She called. Wondered why you never  came home last night. I told her you  were working with a client,  undercover.
LAURA	f	Were you?
NED	m	What?
LAURA	f	There's lipstick on your collar.
NED	m	No there isn't.
LAURA	f	No... there isn't. But you answered  my question. She's a real looker,  huh?
NED	m	Who?
LAURA	f	Lola Cain.
NED	m	I hadn't noticed.
LAURA	f	Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't  noticed. That's alright. She noticed enough  for both of us.
LAURA	f	I worry about you, Ned. I worry a  lot. Max Shady's been faxing death threats  to you all morning.
NED	m	...stick a knife in your... ...rip the eyeballs out of your... ...drive razor-sharp spikes under  your...
LAURA	f	Did you get to the one...?
NED	m	...cut it off... shove it in a  blender.
LAURA	f	Yeah... that one.
NED	m	He's just getting it out of his  system. Once they say it... they  never do it. You know... like the  President.
LAURA	f	Wait. It might be him.
NED	m	Where did you get that?
LAURA	f	From my purse.
NED	m	What are you doing with it?
LAURA	f	Handing it to you.
NED	m	Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun  for?
LAURA	f	You shoot it. A bullet comes out.  Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a  cop, I'd think you'd know these  things.
NED	m	Laura... put the gun away.
DELIVERY MAN	m	Flowers for Ned Rav... Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy?  Man, you are dead meat!
LAURA	f	Is this another sick joke from Max  Shady?
NED	m	What is it...?
LAURA	f	Lola Cain.
LAURA	f	I'll put these in water for you.
LOLA'S VOICE	f	Ned, darling... I know this seems  like a strange way to talk with you...  but since you won't take my calls, I  have no other choice. Watch it! That red car's turning  left!
LOLA'S VOICE	f	I love you, Ned. We're meant to be  together... forever. The light's changing! Floor it! Go!  Go! Go!
LOLA'S VOICE	f	Nice move! Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not  even your wife. I'd hate to have to  tell her about us, but if necessary...  I will.
LANA	f	What happened to you last night?
NED	m	Why? What have you heard?
LANA	f	You could have called. But then, I  suppose you were tied up.
NED	m	Only part of the time.
LANA	f	I never know when you're coming home,  Ned. How can I ever make any plans?
NED	m	I promise I'll spend more time with  you. I know it's been rough, being  alone so much. But I'll make it up  to you. Maybe we should try again,  you know... to have a baby.
LANA	f	So what's in the box?
NED	m	Oh... I brought you a present!
LANA	f	What is it?
NED	m	It's... sorta like a cat.
LANA	f	Not enough like a cat.
NED	m	It's a little skunk. I got it at  Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us.
NED	m	So... what're you going to name him?
LANA	f	How about... Ned?
NED	m	Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've  always liked the name Ned.
LANA	f	No kidding.
NED	m	So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior  as much as you love me?
LANA	f	At least.
LANA	f	Hello?... Hello?... Hello? Frank? Is that you?
LANA	f	I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK!
LOLA	f	Who's Frank?
NED	m	Frank? The only Frank I know is an  auto mechanic... but I sure as hell  wouldn't recommend the guy. He's  really slow.
LOLA	f	I had to see you, Ned. I need to  feel your arms around me! I wanna  suck your toes til the nails pop  off!
NED	m	I told you, what happened was a big  mistake. A one night stand. It's  over. I have a wife...
LOLA	f	It doesn't matter. She'll know all  about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In  my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE!
LOLA	f	I got us tickets to see Iron  Butterfly!
NED	m	I hate opera!
LOLA	f	Why are you running from me? Didn't  it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing  my buns with carnuba wax? Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey  want to go exploring?
NED	m	He's busy right now.
NED	m	Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a  big mistake! One lousy mistake in  his whole stinkin' life! So why don't  you give him a BREAK! Besides... he  belongs to my wife!
JUDGE ARUGULA	m	I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey  for setting yet another unusual legal  precedent. This is the first time  I've ever tried a case in which the  JURY was found to be insane.
BAILIFF	?	What're you? A thirty-eight long?
JUDGE ARUGULA	m	The jury will be remanded to the  Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi  Valley. Court's adjourned.
NED	m	Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you  tell me?
LAURA	f	It's not important. I just had one  last year.
NED	m	Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate!
LAURA	f	Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll  have another one sometime.
NED	m	I insist. And I want to get you a  nice present.
LAURA	f	You're so sweet. You don't have to.  You gave me a present last year.  Those lovely Ginzu knives.
NED	m	Yeah... aren't they great! They last  forever. And you can cut right through  a shoe with 'em!
NED	m	It's nice to be off the streets...  away from all the pain and misery  out there.
LAURA 	f	What's he thinking when he looks at  me with that goofy smile...?
NED 	m	Boy, does she look stupid in that  hat.
LAURA 	f	If I told him how I really feel,  he'd probably fire me. What am I  saying? He probably doesn't even  know I exist.
NED 	m	Laura's incredible. And so smart.  Smart enough to recognize that Ginzu  knives are the gift of a lifetime. But she never goes out with guys. I  wonder why?
LAURA 	f	I guess I'll just have to wait. But  he's married. I could wait forever.  Than again... maybe Lana will get  hit by a runaway truck. There's always  a chance that...
NED 	m	But who cares if she... Oh, sorry.
LAURA 	f	That's alright. I was just rambling.
NED 	m	Go ahead...
LAURA 	f	No, no, really... you first...
NED 	m	I insist... please...
LAURA	f	Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind  you about...
NED	m	...the Legal Symposium...
LAURA	f	...in Santa Barbara...
NED	m	...tomorrow...
NED & LAURA	m	..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones."
NED	m	Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning.
LAURA 	f	He's so cute. He can't even look me  in the eye.
LAURA	f	What is it, Ned? You can tell me.
NED	m	I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel  passion at one time or another. Even  me.
LAURA	f	Really?
NED	m	What would you think of a married  man who gave in to those wild,  sensual, raging desires?
LAURA	f	Oh... wow... golly...
NED	m	What if, for just one crazy moment,  he couldn't resist...? He got knocked  for a loop and lost control?
LAURA	f	Gosh... that might be okay.
NED	m	What if a tidal wave of lust crashed  over him and he was sucked into a  vortex of wild, thrashing urges?
NED	m	Well... it's not your problem. I'll  work it out.
LOLA	f	Like some ice for your drink?
LOLA	f	Does your wife know you're...  "working" late? I certainly hope so,  Mr. Ravine.
LANA	f	Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!
FRANK	m	It's all taken care of. When do I  knock on the door?
LANA	f	Wait until I signal you. When I raise  the blinds... you knock.
LANA	f	Not now!
FRANK	m	Oh, later... right... okay.
LANA	f	Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye- bye to Little Ned. He loves his  daddy... don't you Stink Pot?
NED	m	See you tonight, Junior.
LANA	f	What's wrong?
NED	m	This neighborhood is getting worse  all the time! Damn kids stole my  engine!
LANA	f	Why don't you catch the train to  Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty  minutes.
NED	m	I'll just fly up.
LANA	f	No!
LANA	f	I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists  seized the airport this morning. A  plane crashed into the tower... and  all the runways are on fire!
NED	m	Yeah. So?
LANA	f	And it's fogged in.
NED	m	Dammit.
LANA	f	For my peace of mind... take the  train.
NED	m	I can't do it. You know how I feel  about riding trains.
LANA	f	Darling... it's only a short trip.
NED	m	Yeah... right. A short trip.
NED	m	A short trip to hell in a metal tomb!
LANA	f	Just because both your parents died  in a train wreck...
NED	m	And my brother, Jeff...
LANA	f	And your brother, Morty...
NED	m	My two sisters...
LANA	f	Right...
NED	m	My best friend, Al... my dog, Woof...  Grandma Rose... and Uncle Lionel.  All killed by trains!
LANA	f	Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's  the past. They're gone.
NED	m	Yeah. I guess I can't bring them  back by not riding on a train.
LANA	f	That's right.
NED	m	But I just can't get over this stupid  nagging fear that...
LANA	f	Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I  don't want to raise a child in a  home filled with fear!
LANA	f	But if you can conquer your fear...  maybe I can conquer my fear of having  a baby with a father who's fearful. Ned... don't let a train kill our  child before it's even conceived!
NED	m	I guess you're right.
LANA	f	You're sure now...?
NED	m	But we'll never make it to the  station. By the time a cab gets  here...
FRANK	m	I was in the neighborhood. Thought  I'd stop by and pick up my tools.
LANA	f	Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank?
FRANK	m	Sure, I'll take you to the train  station.
NED	m	Twelve minutes. We'll never make it.
NED	m	We're not going to make it.
FRANK	m	We'll make it!
LANA	f	Okay... now what're you going to do  if you feel queasy going through the  tunnel?
NED	m	I'll stand in the vestibule between  the cars.
LANA	f	That's right. When you get queasy...  go stand in the vestibule between  the cars.
WOMAN PASSENGER	f	OH! My dear gracious!
IRRITABLE MAN	m	SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish  that foul smelling cigar?
MAX	m	You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU  want me to put out my cigar? You  want ME to put out my CIGAR?
IRRITABLE MAN	m	Yeah.
MAX	m	Certainly.
LANA	f	It's already getting to him. He'll  be out of that seat and into the  vestibule within ten minutes... I  guarantee it.
MAX	m	You talkin' to me? You talkin' to  ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?
CONDUCTOR	m	Ticket?
CONDUCTOR	m	Sorry pal... automatic weapons are  only allowed in the club car after  nine p.m.
CONDUCTOR	m	I'll check it with baggage. You can  claim it at the depot in Santa  Barbara.
JEFF	m	Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years  old. Didja know if ya put a penny on  the track it'll make the train crash?  No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck?  My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really  neat. Everybody gets creamed! All  bloody guts... heads ripped off and  stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song  "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy  Gopher Guts"?
LANA	f	You want to earn a couple bucks,  kid?
JEFF	m	Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years  old. Didja know if ya put a penny on  the track it'll make the train crash?
LANA	f	He's losing it. You better get up to  the next car. Remember, give me the  high sign as soon as you see the  river. It'll be two minutes and nine  seconds past the tunnel. I'll take  care of the rest. Anything goes  wrong... just make sure you back me  up. And don't let him see you.
NED	m	This... is not a toy!
JEFF	m	Yes it is.
MAX	m	Here... let me help you with that.
OLD WOMAN	f	What a nice young man. You are so  polite.
MAX	m	I try to be.
JEFF	m	Great green gobs of greasy, grimy  gopher guts... mutilated monkey  meat... chopped up dirty birdie's  feet... one pint jar of all-purpose  porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan  stew.
JEFF	m	French fried eyeballs and ugly scabs  you wanna pick... stuff to make your  mother sick... dog poop on a stick...  puke and snot all mixed together in  a pot...
JEFF	m	Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel!
LANA	f	Way to go, Ned. Right on time.
MAX	m	You shootin' at me?
MAX	m	Yeah... you're definitely shootin'  at me.
NED	m	In this crazy world, there's not a  whole lot a guy can count on. But  when the chips are down, I can always  count on you.
NED	m	You risked your life to save mine. A  guy can't ask any more from a woman  than that.
NED	m	But I saw you shoot him, Lana. In  cold blood. I gotta arrest you for  murder.
LANA	f	Ned... you wouldn't...
NED	m	Sorry. I'm a cop. I have a job to  do.
LANA	f	But... you said it yourself. I saved  your life.
NED	m	Don't worry, baby. I know a good  lawyer.
REPORTER #1	m	What kind of gun did she use?
NED	m	That's a question for the arresting  officer.
REPORTER #2	m	Aren't you the arresting officer?
NED	m	You'll have to ask her attorney.
REPORTER #1	m	But aren't you her attorney?
NED	m	Only her husband can answer that.
REPORTER #3	m	What will Mrs. Ravine be wearing at  the trial?
NED	m	A lovely powder blue dress with a  cinch waist, full bodice and a  delicately pleated skirt.
REPORTER #3	m	Does it have a matching jacket?
NED	m	No comment.
REPORTER #3	m	Is it cotton or rayon?
NED	m	I said... NO COMMENT!
REPORTER #1	m	Did she eat any of the victim's body  parts?
NED	m	Jeez... they're really throwing some  tough questions out there today.
LAURA	f	They're just doing their job.
NED	m	Yeah... well I call it a "high-tech  lynching of an uppity white  housewife."
NED	m	What's this?
ARCH	m	Only cell available. They had that  serial killer locked up here... you  know, the one who talks his victims  to death then eats them... Hannibal  the Lecturer. But they let him out  for a three week tour to publicize  his new book.
NED	m	"To Serve Man."
ARCH	m	It's a cookbook.
ARCH	m	And look, look... he autographed it.
NED	m	To Arch... Love to have you for dinner  sometime... Hannibal. Very nice.
ARCH	m	They're waiting for ya. They didn't  want to start without her attorney  being present.
LANA	f	PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could  use a good exterminator.
INVESTIGATOR # 2	m	Let's get the SWAT Team in here.
LANA	f	Can't you get me out of this cage,  Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here.
NED	m	Judge said no bail. Don't worry.  Just tell the truth, you'll be fine.
NED	m	Who's gonna handle the interrogation?
INVESTIGATOR 1	m	It's your collar... your bust...  your call... your show... your play...  your move... your wife...
NED	m	Okay, okay!... I'll handle it.
INVESTIGATOR 2	m	Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup  allowed in this building.
LANA	f	What're you gonna do... arrest me  for primping?
NED	m	Don't give us a tough time. Just  spill it! What were you doing on  that train?
LANA	f	Well...
NED	m	As your attorney, I must advise you...  you don't have to answer that  question.
NED	m	Alright, quit playing games with us! Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get  the gun? What's your link with the
LANA	f	I...
NED	m	Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I  will not tolerate this unwarranted  badgering of my client. She'll have  her day in court, gentlemen.
NED	m	I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine,  for being so cooperative with these  gentlemen. Did you get all that down, Laura.  Every word she said?
LAURA	f	Yep. Both of 'em.
NED	m	NO!
LOLA	f	Yes.
NED	m	NOOOOO!
LOLA	f	Yes!
NED	m	NOOOOOOOooooooo!!!
LOLA	f	YES! Cappelini pomodoro!
NED	m	What?
LOLA	f	Pasta with tomato sauce. Whatsa matta?  You don't like Italian?
NED	m	Where's Ned Junior? WHERE IS HE?!
LOLA	f	I thought he might like to get out,  so I took him to the amusement park.
NED	m	You can't just break into my house,  cook my food... borrow my skunk! Leave me alone. Stay out of my face!  Out of my neighborhood! Out of my
LOLA	f	You haven't seen the last of me,  Ned.
LOLA	f	I told you.
CHEERLEADERS	f	Lana, Lana, she's the one Shot a bad  guy with a gun Blew that sucker off  a train Some guys are a friggin'  pain YaaaaaAAAAAAAAY LANA!
COMMENTATOR	?	Once again, Americans are making a  mockery of their courts, turning a  murder trial into a media circus!  How can justice ever prevail when it  is ridiculed and reviled in such a  heinously revolting manner? This is  Clement Von Franckenstein returning  you to our BBC studios in London for  the latest photographs of Lady Di  naked in the bath.
SPORTSCASTER	?	What a great day for a trial! We  have lots of incandescent lighting,  seventy-two degrees inside... and no  wind!
BAILIFF	?	Oy vay! Oy vay! Superior Court of  Los Angeles is now in session. And  here he is... direct from a triumphant  one-week engagement in Las Vegas  Circuit Court... the honorable...  the venerable... the totally  irrepressible... Judge Harlan Skan- kyyyyyyy!
SPORTSCASTER	?	Wow... has this defense team been  HOT! Thirty-seven straight victories  this year! Let's go down for the  coin toss.
SPORTSCASTER 	?	The Prosecution wins the flip of the  coin and elects to kick things off.
PROSECUTOR	m	...the prosecution will prove that  this repulsive and degenerate woman  coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding  citizen...
NED	m	Objection! Move to strike. Hearsay,  irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca- doody poo-poo...
JUDGE SKANKY	m	Sustained.
NED	m	And can you tell us what this is?
LAURA	f	Yes. It's a death threat that Max  Shady FAXED to you on the day he was  released from prison.
NED	m	A FAX in which he threatened to puree  certain parts of my anatomy in a  blender! I'd like to submit this  into evidence.
PROSECUTOR	m	Objection! Who cares about the FAX  in this case?
JUDGE SKANKY	m	I'll allow it.
CHEERLEADERS	f	U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi!  You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A- M-A! How you think you got that way?  Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama!
NED	m	And is this the blender you found in  the lavatory of the train?
CONDUCTOR	m	Yes... it is.
NED	m	I'd like this marked as evidence.
SPORTSCASTER	?	Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's  check out the re-play.
SPORTSCASTER	?	Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide  open! But instead of handing it off,  Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh!  The pass is wide! A real wobbler!  There's no way! He scrambles, but he  just can't get his hands on it...  And RIGHT THERE!... ...WHAM! That blender is gone!
LAURA	f	Ned... did you ever consider that  maybe you don't know women as well  as you think you do?
PROSECUTOR 	m	Now would you tell the court, in  your own words, what you said to Mr.  Ravine?
NED	m	I'm really worried about this guy.  He could blow our whole case right  out of the water.
JEFF	m	Great green gobs of greasy grimy  gopher guts... mutilated monkey  meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet...  Great green gobs of greasy grimy  gopher guts... and me without a spoon!
JEFF	m	That lady paid me two bucks to sing  it to him...!
JUDGE SKANKY	m	Recess! Ten minutes!
PROSECUTOR	m	Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha!
LAURA	f	No you didn't!
NED	m	No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile!
BAILIFF	?	Recess is over! Let's go... move it,  move it, move it!
SPORTSCASTER	?	There they go... the UCLA Marching  Band! And now... Holy Toledo!... it  looks like the victim's mother...  Helen Shady... is gonna take the  stand! This will be the first  defensive play of the afternoon.
NED	m	Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about  your son, Max. Was he a... a good  boy?
MRS. SHADY	f	He was the best. And that's not just  a mother talking. You can ask anybody.
NED	m	But he got into trouble once in  awhile... like all kids do?
MRS. SHADY	f	Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes  and things. But he was so cute. I  have pictures!
MRS. SHADY	f	Here. This is when he set the cat on  fire... Oh... but the cat deserved it.
NED	m	And what, uh... what are these...?
MRS. SHADY	f	Marshmallows. He just loved to toast  marshmallows over a roaring cat.  Burned on the outside... all soft in  the middle. And right here... this was taken on  the day he left the priesthood to  join the Green Berets.
NED	m	This is cute.
MRS. SHADY	f	Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux  Klan phase. He would take the sheets  right off my bed... cut those little  holes in them. What a stitch he was!
NED	m	And is this Max... with all the  tools... fixing his bike?
MRS. SHADY	f	Why that shouldn't even be in there!  It's his rotten little half-brother. Stinkin' little pecker... he never  was any good...
MRS. SHADY	f	Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi  boys. They were all so fussy and  persnickety about everything. Heil  this and heil that. Oh look... here's Max with his  chainsaw. He loved to go to the  national park and cut down those  giant old trees. It made him feel so  patriotic. You know, if he hadn't  been such a successful criminal... I  think he would have been a lumberjack.
MRS. SHADY	f	But now he'll never be anything! Not  since... ...that woman, your wife, pulled the  trigger and put my little Max in his  grave!
JUDGE SKANKY	m	Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger  in my courtroom. It's discourteous,  impolite and disrespectful.
MRS. SHADY	f	Don't you tell me what to do with my  finger! It's been more places than  you've ever dreamed of!
JUDGE SKANKY	m	Sit down!
MRS. SHADY	f	I'll point my finger wherever I want!
NED	m	Did you encounter the victim... Max  Shady... on board the train?
IRRITABLE MAN	m	Yeah. And I told him... "this is the  NO SMOKING car! Would you please put  out your damn cigar!"
NED	m	And is that the cigar in your ear?
IRRITABLE MAN	m	I believe it is.
NED	m	I'd like the cigar and the head of  this witness entered into evidence.
NED	m	The defense calls... Lana Ravine!
BAILIFF	?	Do you swear to tell the truth, the  whole truth and nothing but the truth  so help you God?
LANA	f	Do I have to answer that, Harlan?
JUDGE SKANKY	m	No, no dear. I'll vouch for her.
NED	m	Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you  Lana?
LANA	f	No. Call me Angel Tits.
PROSECUTOR	m	I object!
JUDGE SKANKY	m	Sustained. Counselor... you will  address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine.
NED	m	Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell  the court... what were you doing on  that train?
LANA	f	I saw Max Shady at the station...  saw him get on board. I knew he'd  made threats to kill you and mutilate  your reproductive organs...
LANA	f	...so I got on the train too... so I  could warn you.
NED	m	Do you want to have children?
LANA	f	Someday. With the right man.
NED	m	But you couldn't have children if  my... ...were... ...and, uh...
LANA	f	It would be difficult.
NED	m	So you followed him, knowing you had  to protect me... your husband...  your best friend... the man you  love... the future father of your  children.
LANA	f	Something like that.
NED	m	And when you saw that maniac standing  in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize  my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and  fired and fired and FIRED!
LANA	f	And fired and fired and fired and  fired and fired and fired and fired...
LANA	f	...and fired and fired and fired.
NED	m	The defense rests, your Honor.
NED	m	How can you convict a courageous  woman who risked everything to save  the life of her beloved husband? A  woman who acted boldly to stop a  demented maniac from doing THIS!...
NED	m	...pulverizing the private parts of  the man she loves!
NED	m	Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the  potential mother of my potential  child. I challenge YOU to strike a  blow for motherhood and the American  justice system! Put the "con" back  in the Constitution. Put the "ju"  back in jurisprudence. Put the "can"  back in American. And put the "dom"  back in freedom. Find this woman  INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed  happy tonight!
REPORTER	m	The jury's back!
JUDGE SKANKY	m	So... has the jury reached a verdict?
JURY FOREMAN	m	Yes we have, your Honor.
JUDGE SKANKY	m	How do you find the defendant... on  the count of manslaughter?
JURY FOREMAN	m	Not guilty.
JUDGE SKANKY	m	On the count of murder in the first  degree?
JURY FOREMAN	m	Not guilty.
JUDGE SKANKY	m	On the Count of Monte Cristo?
JURY FOREMAN	m	Not guilty.
JUDGE SKANKY	m	Good. Then on the count of three,  let's all get the hell out of here!  One... two...
JUDGE SKANKY	m	Wait... for... it...
JUDGE SKANKY	m	Two and a half... THREE!
LANA	f	Well, counselor, looks like you won  another case. Lucky for me.
BAILIFF 	?	Attention courtroom shoppers! All  trial evidence now on sale. Forty to  sixty percent off all exhibits!  Everything must go!
IRRITABLE WOMAN	f	I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars  is bad for your hearing!
COURT CLERK	m	Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya?
LANA	f	How much for my gun?
LAURA	f	I don't believe it! She just bought  her gun back! The gun she used to  kill a man!
NED	m	Yeah... the same gun that saved my  life. I'm sure it has sentimental  value.
FRANK	m	So... you did it. Ya beat the rap.
LANA	f	No thanks to you.
FRANK	m	Hey... I knew he'd spring ya.
LANA	f	You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You  let me take all the heat.
FRANK	m	Heeeee-eeey... what could I do?
LANA	f	You were gonna let me rot in the  slammer... never say a thing.
FRANK	m	Look... you're out... free. Now we're  together. That's what counts. We can  try again! Forget triple indemnity.  We'll whack him and split three mil.
LANA	f	I'm not splitting anything, Frank. And you know too much.
FRANK	m	Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot  me.
LANA	f	You're right. Maybe I'll just screw you to death.
FRANK	m	Now you're talkin' baby.
FORENSIC MAN	m	Watch your step, guys. There's a lot  of blood.
INVESTIGATOR	m	Looks like a suicide. We found a  note.
INVESTIGATOR	m	It was stuck up his nose.
ARCH	m	"I can't take it anymore. I'm a  mediocre mechanic... and a lousy  lover."
NED	m	He's sure got that right.
NED	m	The "mechanic" part, I mean.
NED	m	I don't know why, Arch, but I just  can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't  suicide.
LANA	f	Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um...
NED	m	Um? She told you her name was Um?  And what other lies did she tell  you? I've never seen this woman in  my life! Never followed her home!  Never had sex with her in the  refrigerator! It's all a sick  fantasy... and I deny everything!
NED	m	When will women like you learn, you  can't tear apart a perfectly good  marriage with your vicious lies...  Miss UMMMM!
LOLA	f	Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith.  I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine.  The big powerful kind that suck up  everything in sight. I was just  telling your wife, if she wants to  get rid of all her dirt, she has to  be willing to pay the price.
LOLA	f	Let me know what you decide, Mrs.  Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a  convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure  meeting you... Ned.
LANA	f	I... hate... SALESMEN!
NED	m	I know it's been a tough ordeal...  with the trial and everything. Tell  you what... let's take a trip.
LANA	f	A trip?
NED	m	Yeah. Just the two of us.
LANA	f	I like that. Just you and me... all  alone. I'll start packing.
NED	m	Great. Listen... I got something to  take care of. I'll be back in awhile.
LOLA	f	Who is it?
NED	m	I just want to talk.
LOLA	f	Why didn't you say so?
LOLA	f	Would you like a drink?
NED	m	No thanks. I'm driving.
LOLA	f	Then let's get to the point!
LOLA	f	So what's your problem, tough guy?
NED	m	Stay away from my life, my wife, my  home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on  a vacation and when I come back, I  don't ever want to see your face  again!
LOLA	f	A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a  VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl!  She always was and always will be!
NED	m	What are you talking about? You don't  know anything about Lana?
LOLA	f	I know EVERYTHING!
NED	m	How do you know her? Who is she to  you? TELL ME!
NED	m	Who is she!
LOLA	f	She's your wife!
NED	m	Who is she!?
LOLA	f	She's my sister!
NED	m	Liar! Who is she?
LOLA	f	She's your wife!
NED	m	WHO IS SHE!
LOLA	f	She's my sister!
LOLA	f	She's your wife... AND my sister!
LOLA	f	She was spoiled rotten! She stole  everything I ever had. Everything!  Including him.
NED	m	Him? Who, him?
LOLA	f	Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He  was older. So mature... so strong.  He smelled like dirty sweat socks  and old basketballs. And he was all  mine. For awhile. But Lana wasn't satisfied with her  own things. She had to have mine  too. She took it all... my makeup,  my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...
NED	m	You wore the same clothes?
LOLA	f	We were identical twins.
NED	m	What're you talking about? You two  don't look anything alike.
LOLA	f	Not anymore. One day I caught her  stealing my lavender eye shadow and  she smashed my face in with a shovel.  I had fifty-three operations. When  the doctors were finished with me...  I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY!
NED	m	You're beautiful.
LOLA	f	Don't lie to me.
NED	m	They did a terrific job!
LOLA	f	I look in the mirror. I can SEE!
NED	m	But... you're gorgeous!
LOLA	f	Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my  face, he left me for HER... because  she looked more like me than I did!  First she stole my looks... then she  stole the only man who ever loved  me!
LOLA	f	But I found a way to get even. The  best revenge possible. Destroy her  marriage!
NED	m	That's why you did all this? Seduced  me... harrassed me... the tape...  the flowers... the phone calls...
LOLA	f	You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy,  haven't ya?
NED	m	It won't work. Lana loves me.
LOLA	f	It doesn't matter. I'm blackmailing  her for everything she's worth. She  murdered that greasy auto mechanic.  I saw her do it.
NED	m	Lana killed Frank Kelbo?
LOLA	f	Kelbo! His name was Kelbo?
NED	m	Yeah. Why? Did he burn you on car  repairs too?
LOLA	f	Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a  son. Frankie Kelbo.
NED 	m	The pieces of the puzzle were falling  into place and I didn't like the  picture they were making. If Lana  really killed Frank Kelbo, then I  had misjudged her by a mile. Sure...  he was a lousy mechanic. But murder?
NED 	m	It was all starting to give me a  headache bigger than the national  deficit.
NED	m	Lana?
LAURA	f	Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so  much to tell you.
NED	m	Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab  a chair.
LAURA	f	Thanks... I brought my own.
NED	m	So... what have you got?
LAURA	f	A lottery ticket and a laundry  receipt. I found them in the pocket of that  suit you wore the night you were  working under cover with a client.
LAURA	f	You remember that night, don't ya  Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts  with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L- O... L-A. Lola.
LAURA	f	Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's  mind works.
NED	m	How about Ovaltine?
LAURA	f	Fine. Then I remembered you told me  some guy named Frank had been working  on your wife's car for two months.  You with me so far?
NED	m	I'm way ahead of you.
LAURA	f	Well back it up. You probably took a  wrong turn. Remember your insurance  policy... the one we couldn't find?  I started thinking, who else had  access to it beside you and me? The  answer came up... Lana. And since  she's a woman, it's probably hidden  right here.
NED	m	So that's where she hid the Oreos.
LAURA	f	Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your  life when she shot Max Shady. She  and Frank were plotting to kill you  and collect on your insurance policy.  But she shot the wrong guy.
NED	m	That's the craziest thing I ever  heard.
LAURA	f	Don't you see... Frank was going to  let her take the fall. So she murdered  him and tried to make it look like  suicide. That's when I realized there was a  connection between Lola and Lana...
NED	m	Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters.
LAURA	f	Well, hang on to your jock strap,  Ned. There's more.
LAURA	f	Not only is Frank's father Dwayne  Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher  and Lola Cain's former lover...  Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max  and Frank are half-brothers who never  met.
LAURA	f	Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered  both of Helen Shady's sons.
NED	m	This is so unbelievable.
LAURA	f	And you haven't even heard my story.
LAURA	f	He turned into a monster. And that's  when I left him. I just couldn't...
NED	m	That damn faucet keeps turning on  all by itself. I'll go check it.
LAURA	f	Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine.
GUEST MUSICIAN	m	I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a  gig tonight.
LAURA'S HUSBAND	m	Forget something, sweetheart?
LAURA'S HUSBAND	m	You forgot to flush, darling.
LOLA	f	What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me  away?
LAURA	f	I never forget anything... honey.
LAURA	f	Those are MY panties!
LAURA	f	Oh Ned!
NED	m	You were right... there's a million  things I don't know about women.  Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.
NED	m	Hell... I had too many careers anyway.
LAURA	f	Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved  you!
LAURA	f	Got 'em!
LAURA	f	I said... I GOT 'EM!
NED	m	HUH?!!!
LAURA	f	Okay. But I want to have kids.
NED	m	Great.
NED 	m	So... maybe I was wrong. Maybe women  really are like a big jigsaw puzzle...  with pieces that never seem to fit  where you want 'em to.
NED 	m	All I know is, there are three things  that men can't possibly ever do...
NED	m	...understand women... give birth...  and program a VCR. And giving birth  is the easy one.
LAURA	f	Ned...
NED	m	Yeah, Laura?
LAURA	f	Knock off the chatter, will ya?
LAURA	f	We won't need you anymore.
LAURA	f	We can make our own music.
LAURA 	f	Ned, do you know... I want you to  make love to me all night long?
NED 	m	No. But if you hum a few bars...  I'll fake it.
