YOUNG MAN	m	No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm  through doin' that shit.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	You always say that, the same thing  every time: never again, I'm through,  too dangerous.
YOUNG MAN	m	I know that's what I always say. I'm  always right too, but �
YOUNG WOMAN	f	� but you forget about it in a day  or two -
YOUNG MAN	m	� yeah, well, the days of me  forgittin' are over, and the days of  me rememberin' have just begun.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	When you go on like this, you know  what you sound like?
YOUNG MAN	m	I sound like a sensible fucking man,  is what I sound like.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	You sound like a duck. Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,  quack, quack...
YOUNG MAN	m	Well take heart, 'cause you're never  gonna hafta hear it again. Because  since I'm never gonna do it again,  you're never gonna hafta hear me  quack about how I'm never gonna do  it again.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	After tonight.
YOUNG MAN	m	Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
WAITRESS	?	Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Oh yes, thank you.
YOUNG MAN	m	I'm doin' fine.
YOUNG MAN	m	I mean the way it is now, you're  takin' the same fuckin' risk as when  you rob a bank. You take more of a  risk. Banks are easier!  Federal  banks aren't supposed to stop you  anyway, during a robbery. They're  insured, why should they care? You  don't even need a gun in a federal  bank. I heard about this guy, walked  into a federal bank with a portable  phone, handed the phone to the teller,  the guy on the other end of the phone  said: "We got this guy's little girl,  and if you don't give him all your  money, we're gonna kill 'er."
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Did it work?
YOUNG MAN	m	Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm  talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in  a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,  not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,  cleans the place out, and they don't  lift a fuckin' finger.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Did they hurt the little girl?
YOUNG MAN	m	I don't know. There probably never  was a little girl � the point of the  story isn't the little girl. The  point of the story is they robbed  the bank with a telephone.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	You wanna rob banks?
YOUNG MAN	m	I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,  I'm just illustrating that if we  did, it would be easier than what we  been doin'.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	So you don't want to be a bank robber?
YOUNG MAN	m	Naw, all those guys are goin' down  the same road, either dead or servin'  twenty.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	And no more liquor stores?
YOUNG MAN	m	What have we been talking about?  Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,  it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too  many foreigners own liquor stores.  Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't  fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:  "Empty out the register," and they  don't know what it fuckin' means.  They make it too personal. We keep  on, one of those gook motherfuckers'  gonna make us kill 'em.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	I'm not gonna kill anybody.
YOUNG MAN	m	I don't wanna kill anybody either.  But they'll probably put us in a  situation where it's us of them. And  if it's not the gooks, it these old  Jews who've owned the store for  fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got  Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the  counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try  walkin' into one of those stores  with nothin' but a telephone, see  how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget  it, we're out of it.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Well, what else is there, day jobs?
YOUNG MAN	m	Not this life.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Well what then?
YOUNG MAN	m	Garcon! Coffee!
YOUNG MAN	m	This place.
WAITRESS	?	"Garcon" means boy.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Here? It's a coffee shop.
YOUNG MAN	m	What's wrong with that? People never  rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor  stores, gas stations, you get your  head blown off stickin' up one of  them. Restaurants, on the other hand,  you catch with their pants down.  They're not expecting to get robbed,  or not as expecting.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	I bet in places like this you could  cut down on the hero factor.
YOUNG MAN	m	Correct. Just like banks, these places  are insured. The managers don't give  a fuck, they're just tryin' to get  ya out the door before you start  pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget  it, they ain't takin' a bullet for  the register. Busboys, some wetback  gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour  gonna really give a fuck you're  stealin' from the owner. Customers  are sittin' there with food in their  mouths, they don't know what's goin'  on. One minute they're havin' a Denver  omelet, next minute somebody's  stickin' a gun in their face.
YOUNG MAN	m	See, I got the idea last liquor store  we stuck up. 'Member all those  customers kept comin' in?
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Yeah.
YOUNG MAN	m	Then you got the idea to take  everybody's wallet.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Uh-huh.
YOUNG MAN	m	That was a good idea.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Thanks.
YOUNG MAN	m	We made more from the wallets then  we did the register.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Yes we did.
YOUNG MAN	m	A lot of people go to restaurants.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	A lot of wallets.
YOUNG MAN	m	Pretty smart, huh?
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Pretty smart. I'm ready, let's go, right here,  right now.
YOUNG MAN	m	Remember, same as before, you're  crowd control, I handle the employees.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	Got it.
YOUNG WOMAN	f	I love you, Pumpkin.
YOUNG MAN	m	I love you, Honey Bunny.
PUMPKIN	f	Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
HONEY BUNNY	f	Any of you fuckin' pricks move and  I'll execute every one of you  motherfuckers!  Got that?
JULES	m	� Okay now, tell me about the hash  bars?
VINCENT	m	What so you want to know?
JULES	m	Well, hash is legal there, right?
VINCENT	m	Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a  hundred percent legal. I mean you  can't walk into a restaurant, roll a  joint, and start puffin' away. You're  only supposed to smoke in your home  or certain designated places.
JULES	m	Those are hash bars?
VINCENT	m	Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's  legal to buy it, it's legal to own  it and, if you're the proprietor of  a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.  It's legal to carry it, which doesn't  really matter 'cause � get a load of  this � if the cops stop you, it's  illegal for this to search you.  Searching you is a right that the  cops in Amsterdam don't have.
JULES	m	That did it, man � I'm fuckin' goin',  that's all there is to it.
VINCENT	m	You'll dig it the most. But you know  what the funniest thing about Europe  is?
JULES	m	What?
VINCENT	m	It's the little differences. A lotta  the same shit we got here, they got  there, but there they're a little  different.
JULES	m	Examples?
VINCENT	m	Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer  in a movie theatre. And I don't mean  in a paper cup either. They give you  a glass of beer, like in a bar. In  Paris, you can buy beer at  MacDonald's. Also, you know what  they call a Quarter Pounder with  Cheese in Paris?
JULES	m	They don't call it a Quarter Pounder  with Cheese?
VINCENT	m	No, they got the metric system there,  they wouldn't know what the fuck a  Quarter Pounder is.
JULES	m	What'd they call it?
VINCENT	m	Royale with Cheese.
JULES	m	Royale with Cheese. What'd they call  a Big Mac?
VINCENT	m	Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call  it Le Big Mac.
JULES	m	Le Big Mac. What do they call a  Whopper?
VINCENT	m	I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger  King.  But you know what they put on  french fries in Holland instead of  ketchup?
JULES	m	What?
VINCENT	m	Mayonnaise.
JULES	m	Goddamn!
VINCENT	m	I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a  little bit on the side of the plate,  they fuckin' drown 'em in it.
JULES	m	Uuccch!
JULES	m	We should have shotguns for this  kind of deal.
VINCENT	m	How many up there?
JULES	m	Three or four.
VINCENT	m	Counting our guy?
JULES	m	I'm not sure.
VINCENT	m	So there could be five guys up there?
JULES	m	It's possible.
VINCENT	m	We should have fuckin' shotguns.
VINCENT	m	What's her name?
JULES	m	Mia.
VINCENT	m	How did Marsellus and her meet?
JULES	m	I dunno, however people meet people.  She usta be an actress.
VINCENT	m	She ever do anything I woulda saw?
JULES	m	I think her biggest deal was she  starred in a pilot.
VINCENT	m	What's a pilot?
JULES	m	Well, you know the shows on TV?
VINCENT	m	I don't watch TV.
JULES	m	Yes, but you're aware that there's  an invention called television, and  on that invention they show shows?
VINCENT	m	Yeah.
JULES	m	Well, the way they pick the shows on  TV is they make one show, and that  show's called a pilot. And they show  that one show to the people who pick  the shows, and on the strength of  that one show, they decide if they  want to make more shows. Some get  accepted and become TV programs, and  some don't, and become nothing. She  starred in one of the ones that became  nothing.
JULES	m	You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half- black, half-Samoan, usta call him  Tony Rocky Horror.
VINCENT	m	Yeah maybe, fat right?
JULES	m	I wouldn't go so far as to call the  brother fat. He's got a weight  problem.  What's the nigger gonna  do, he's Samoan.
VINCENT	m	I think I know who you mean, what  about him?
JULES	m	Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up  good.  And word around the campfire,  it was on account of Marsellus  Wallace's wife.
VINCENT	m	What'd he do, fuck her?
JULES	m	No no no no no no no, nothin' that  bad.
VINCENT	m	Well what then?
JULES	m	He gave her a foot massage.
VINCENT	m	A foot massage?
VINCENT	m	That's all?
VINCENT	m	What did Marsellus do?
JULES	m	Sent a couple of guys over to his  place.  They took him out on the  patio of his apartment, threw his  ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell  four stories. They had this garden  at the bottom, enclosed in glass,  like one of them greenhouses � nigger  fell through that. Since then, he's  kinda developed a speech impediment.
VINCENT	m	That's a damn shame.
VINCENT	m	Still I hafta say, play with matches,  ya get burned.
JULES	m	Whaddya mean?
VINCENT	m	You don't be givin' Marsellus  Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
JULES	m	You don't think he overreacted?
VINCENT	m	Antwan probably didn't expect  Marsellus to react like he did, but  he had to expect a reaction.
JULES	m	It was a foot massage, a foot massage  is nothing, I give my mother a foot  massage.
VINCENT	m	It's laying hands on Marsellus  Wallace's new wife in a familiar  way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out  � no, but you're in the same fuckin'  ballpark.
JULES	m	Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right  there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'  a bitch a foot massage ain't even  the same fuckin' thing.
VINCENT	m	Not the same thing, the same ballpark.
JULES	m	It ain't no ballpark either. Look  maybe your method of massage differs  from mine, but touchin' his lady's  feet, and stickin' your tongue in  her holyiest of holyies, ain't the  same ballpark, ain't the same league,  ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Foot massages don't mean shit.
VINCENT	m	Have you ever given a foot massage?
JULES	m	Don't be tellin' me about foot  massages � I'm the foot fuckin'  master.
VINCENT	m	Given a lot of 'em?
JULES	m	Shit yeah. I got my technique down  man, I don't tickle or nothin'.
VINCENT	m	Have you ever given a guy a foot  massage?
JULES	m	Fuck you.
VINCENT	m	How many?
JULES	m	Fuck you.
VINCENT	m	Would you give me a foot massage �  I'm kinda tired.
JULES	m	Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'  pissed � this is the door.
JULES	m	What time is it?
VINCENT	m	Seven-twenty-two in the morning.
JULES	m	It ain't quite time, let's hang back.
JULES	m	Look, just because I wouldn't give  no man a foot massage, don't make it  right for Marsellus to throw Antwan  off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the  way the nigger talks. That ain't  right, man. Motherfucker do that to  me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause  I'd kill'a motherfucker.
VINCENT	m	I'm not sayin' he was right, but  you're sayin' a foot massage don't  mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.  I've given a million ladies a million  foot massages and they all meant  somethin'. We act like they don't,  but they do. That's what's so fuckin'  cool about 'em. This sensual thing's  goin' on that nobody's talkin about,  but you know it and she knows it,  fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan  shoulda known fuckin' better. That's  his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna  have a sense of humor about that  shit.
JULES	m	That's an interesting point, but  let's get into character.
VINCENT	m	What's her name again?
JULES	m	Mia. Why you so interested in big  man's wife?
VINCENT	m	Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida  and when he's gone, he wants me to  take care of Mia.
JULES	m	Take care of her?
VINCENT	m	Not that! Take her out. Show her a  good time. Don't let her get lonely.
JULES	m	You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace  out on a date?
VINCENT	m	It ain't a date. It's like when you  and your buddy's wife go to a movie  or somethin'. It's just... you know...  good company.
VINCENT	m	It's not a date.
JULES	m	Hey kids.
JULES	m	How you boys doin'?
JULES	m	Am I trippin', or did I just ask you  a question.
BRETT	m	We're doin' okay.
JULES	m	Do you know who we are?
JULES	m	We're associates of your business  partner Marsellus Wallace, you  remember your business partner  dont'ya?
JULES	m	Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:  you're Brett, right?
BRETT	m	I'm Brett.
JULES	m	I thought so. Well, you remember  your business partner Marsellus  Wallace, dont'ya Brett?
BRETT	m	I remember him.
JULES	m	Good for you. Looks like me and  Vincent caught you at breakfast,  sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?
BRETT	m	Hamburgers.
JULES	m	Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any  nutritious breakfast. What kinda  hamburgers?
BRETT	m	Cheeseburgers.
JULES	m	No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where?
BRETT	m	Big Kahuna Burger.
JULES	m	Big Kahuna Burger. That's that  Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they  got some tasty burgers. I ain't never  had one myself, how are they?
BRETT	m	They're good.
JULES	m	Mind if I try one of yours?
BRETT	m	No.
JULES	m	Yours is this one, right?
BRETT	m	Yeah.
JULES	m	Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger. Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna  Burger?
VINCENT	m	No.
JULES	m	You wanna bite, they're real good.
VINCENT	m	I ain't hungry.
JULES	m	Well, if you like hamburgers give  'em a try sometime. Me, I can't  usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's  a vegetarian. Which more or less  makes me a vegetarian, but I sure  love the taste of a good burger. You know what they call a Quarter  Pounder with Cheese in France?
BRETT	m	No.
JULES	m	Tell 'em, Vincent.
VINCENT	m	Royale with Cheese.
JULES	m	Royale with Cheese, you know why  they call it that?
BRETT	m	Because of the metric system?
JULES	m	Check out the big brain on Brett.  You'a smart motherfucker, that's  right. The metric system. What's in this?
BRETT	m	Sprite.
JULES	m	Sprite, good, mind if I have some of  your tasty beverage to wash this  down with?
BRETT	m	Sure.
JULES	m	Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot! You, Flock of Seagulls, you know  what we're here for?
JULES	m	Then why don't you tell my boy here  Vince, where you got the shit hid.
MARVIN	m	It's under the be �
JULES	m	� I don't remember askin' you a  goddamn thing. You were sayin'?
ROGER	m	It's under the bed.
VINCENT	m	Got it.
JULES	m	We happy?
JULES	m	Vincent!
JULES	m	We happy?
VINCENT	m	We're happy.
BRETT	m	Look, what's your name? I got his  name's Vincent, but what's yours?
JULES	m	My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'  your ass outta this shit.
BRETT	m	I just want you to know how sorry we  are about how fucked up things got  between us and Mr. Wallace. When we  entered into this thing, we only had  the best intentions �
JULES	m	Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your  concentration? I didn't mean to do  that.  Please, continue. I believe  you were saying something about "best  intentions."
JULES	m	Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through  anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would  you describe for me what Marsellus  Wallace looks like?
JULES	m	What country you from!
BRETT	m	What?
JULES	m	"What" ain't no country I know! Do  they speak English in "What?"
BRETT	m	What?
JULES	m	English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it?
BRETT	m	Yes.
JULES	m	Then you understand what I'm sayin'?
BRETT	m	Yes.
JULES	m	Now describe what Marsellus Wallace  looks like!
BRETT	m	What?
JULES	m	Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What"  again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya  motherfucker, say "What" one more  goddamn time!
JULES	m	Now describe to me what Marsellus  Wallace looks like!
BRETT	m	Well he's... he's... black �
JULES	m	� go on!
BRETT	m	...and he's... he's... bald �
JULES	m	� does he look like a bitch?!
BRETT	m	What?
JULES	m	Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!
BRETT	m	No.
JULES	m	Then why did you try to fuck 'im  like a bitch?!
BRETT	m	I didn't.
JULES	m	Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck  'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?
BRETT	m	Yes.
JULES	m	There's a passage I got memorized,  seems appropriate for this situation:  Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the  righteous man is beset on all sides  by the inequities of the selfish and  the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is  he who, in the name of charity and  good will, shepherds the weak through  the valley of darkness, for he is  truly his brother's keeper and the  finder of lost children. And I will  strike down upon thee with great  vengeance and furious anger those  who attempt to poison and destroy my  brothers. And you will know my name  is the Lord when I lay my vengeance  upon you."
MARSELLUS 	m	I think you're gonna find � when all  this shit is over and done � I think  you're gonna find yourself one smilin'  motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right  now you got ability. But painful as  it may be, ability don't last. Now  that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of  life, but it's a fact of life your  ass is gonna hafta git realistic  about. This business is filled to  the brim with unrealistic  motherfuckers who thought their ass  aged like wine.  Besides, even if  you went all the way, what would you  be? Feather-weight champion of the  world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you  can even get a credit card based on  that.
MARSELLUS 	m	Now the night of the fight, you may  fell a slight sting, that's pride  fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride  only hurts, it never helps. Fight  through that shit. 'Cause a year  from now, when you're kickin' it in  the Caribbean you're gonna say,  "Marsellus Wallace was right."
BUTCH	m	I got no problem with that.
MARSELLUS 	m	In the fifth, your ass goes down.
MARSELLUS 	m	Say it!
BUTCH	m	In the fifth, my ass goes down.
ENGLISH DAVE	m	Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,  git your ass on in here.
VINCENT	m	Where's the big man?
ENGLISH DAVE	m	He's over there, finishing up some  business.
ENGLISH DAVE 	m	Hang back for a second or two, and  when you see the white boy leave, go  on over.  In the meanwhile, can I  make you an espresso?
VINCENT	m	How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'  American?
ENGLISH DAVE	m	Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia  out tomorrow?
VINCENT	m	At Marsellus' request.
ENGLISH DAVE	m	Have you met Mia?
VINCENT	m	Not yet.
VINCENT	m	What's so funny?
ENGLISH DAVE	m	Not a goddamn thing.
VINCENT	m	Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big  man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit  across a table, chew my food with my  mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and  that's all I'm gonna do.
ENGLISH DAVE	m	My name's Paul, and this is between  y'all.
BUTCH	m	Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?
ENGLISH DAVE	m	Filters?
BUTCH	m	Non.
BUTCH	m	Lookin' at somethin', friend?
VINCENT	m	I ain't your friend, palooka.
BUTCH	m	What was that?
VINCENT	m	I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.
MARSELLUS 	m	Vincent Vega has entered the building,  git your ass over here!
ENGLISH DAVE 	m	Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.
JODY	?	...I'll lend it to you. It's a great  book on body piercing.
TRUDI	f	You know how they use that gun when  they pierce your ears? They don't  use that when they pierce your  nipples, do they?
JODY	?	Forget that gun. That gun goes against  the entire idea behind piercing. All  of my piercing, sixteen places on my  body, every one of 'em done with a  needle. Five in each ear. One through  the nipple on my left breast. One  through my right nostril.  One through  my left eyebrow. One through my lip.  One in my clit. And I wear a stud in  my tongue.
VINCENT	m	Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm  curious, why would you get a stud in  your tongue?
JODY	?	It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.
LANCE 	m	Vince, you can come in now!
LANCE	m	Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very  good stuff. This is Bava, different,  but equally good. And this is Choco  from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.  Now the first two are the same, forty- five an ounce � those are friend  prices � but this one... ...this one's a little more expensive.   It's fifty-five. But when you shoot  it, you'll know where that extra  money went.  Nothing wrong with the  first two. It's real, real, real,  good shit. But this one's a fuckin'  madman.
VINCENT	m	Remember, I just got back from  Amsterdam.
LANCE	m	Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?  No.  You're in my house. White people  who know the difference between good  shit and bad shit, this is the house  they come to. My shit, I'll take the  Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit  any ol' day of the fuckin' week.
VINCENT	m	That's a bold statement.
LANCE	m	This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is  a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'  dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back  in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole  seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,  they're as hot as hell.
VINCENT	m	Give me three hundred worth of the  madman.  If it's as good as you say,  I'll be back for a thousand.
LANCE	m	I just hope I still have it. Whaddya  think of Trudi? She ain't got a  boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get  high?
VINCENT	m	Which one's Trudi? The one with all  the shit in her face?
LANCE	m	No, that's Jody. That's my wife.
VINCENT	m	I'm on my way somewhere. I got a  dinner engagement. Rain check?
LANCE	m	No problem?
VINCENT	m	You don't mind if I shoot up here?
LANCE	m	Me casa, su casa.
VINCENT	m	Mucho gracias.
LANCE	m	Still got your Malibu?
VINCENT	m	You know what some fucker did to it  the other day?
LANCE	m	What?
VINCENT	m	Fuckin' keyed it.
LANCE	m	Oh man, that's fucked up.
VINCENT	m	Tell me about it. I had the goddamn  thing in storage three years. It's  out five fuckin' days � five days,  and some dickless piece of shit fucks  with it.
LANCE	m	They should be fuckin' killed. No  trial, no jury, straight to execution.
VINCENT	m	I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,  ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything  to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been  worth his doin' it, if I coulda just  caught 'em, you know what I mean?
LANCE	m	It's chicken shit. You don't fuck  another man's vehicle.
MIA 	f	Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.  The door's open. Come inside and  make yourself a drink.
VINCENT	m	Hello?
MIA	f	Vincent.
MIA	f	Vincent. I'm on the intercom.
MIA	f	It's on the wall by the two African  fellas.
MIA	f	To your right.
MIA	f	...warm. Warmer. Disco.
VINCENT	m	Hello.
MIA	f	Push the button if you want to talk.
VINCENT	m	Hello.
MIA	f	Go make yourself a drink., and I'll  be down in two shakes of a lamb's  tail.
MIA	f	The bar's by the fireplace.
VINCENT	m	Okay.
MIA	f	Let's go.
VINCENT	m	What the fuck is this place?
MIA	f	This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis  man should love it.
VINCENT	m	Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.
MIA	f	You can get a steak here, daddy-o.  Don't be a...
VINCENT	m	After you, kitty-cat.
BUDDY	m	Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?
VINCENT	m	I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
BUDDY	m	How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,  or bloody as hell?
VINCENT	m	Bloody as hell. And to drink, a  vanilla coke.
BUDDY	m	How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?
MIA	f	I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger �  bloody � and a five-dollar shake.
BUDDY	m	How d'ya want that shake, Martin and  Lewis, or Amos and Andy?
MIA	f	Martin and Lewis.
VINCENT	m	Did you just order a five-dollar  shake?
MIA	f	Sure did.
VINCENT	m	A shake? Milk and ice cream?
MIA	f	Uh-huh.
VINCENT	m	It costs five dollars?
BUDDY	m	Yep.
VINCENT	m	You don't put bourbon in it or  anything?
BUDDY	m	Nope.
VINCENT	m	Just checking.
MIA	f	Whaddya think?
VINCENT	m	It's like a wax museum with a pulse  rate.
MIA	f	What are you doing?
VINCENT	m	Rollin' a smoke.
MIA	f	Here?
VINCENT	m	It's just tobacco.
MIA	f	Oh. Well in that case, will you roll  me one, cowboy?
VINCENT	m	You can have this one, cowgirl.
MIA	f	Thanks.
VINCENT	m	Think nothing of it.
MIA	f	Marsellus said you just got back  from Amsterdam.
VINCENT	m	Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
MIA	f	That was my fifteen minutes.
VINCENT	m	What was it?
MIA	f	It was show about a team of female  secret agents called "Fox Force Five."
VINCENT	m	What?
MIA	f	"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a  bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in  we're a force to be reckoned with.  Five, as in there's one... two ...  three... four... five of us. There  was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal  from that show "Baton Rouge," she  was the leader. A Japanese one, a  black one, a French one and a brunette  one, me.  We all had special skills.  Sommerset had a photographic memory,  the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,  the black girl was a demolition  expert, the French fox' specialty  was sex...
VINCENT	m	What was your specialty?
MIA	f	Knives. The character I played, Raven  McCoy, her background was she was  raised by circus performers. So she  grew up doing a knife act. According  to the show, she was the deadliest  woman in the world with a knife. But  because she grew up in a circus, she  was also something of an acrobat.  She could do illusions, she was a  trapeze artist � when you're keeping  the world safe from evil, you never  know when being a trapeze artist's  gonna come in handy. And she knew a  zillion old jokes her grandfather,  an old vaudevillian, taught her. If  we woulda got picked up, they woulda  worked in a gimmick where every  episode I woulda told and ol joke.
VINCENT	m	Do you remember any of the jokes?
MIA	f	Well I only got the chance to say  one, 'cause we only did one show.
VINCENT	m	Tell me.
MIA	f	No. It's really corny.
VINCENT	m	C'mon, don't be that way.
MIA	f	No. You won't like it and I'll be  embarrassed.
VINCENT	m	You told it in front of fifty million  people and you can't tell it to me?  I promise I won't laugh.
MIA	f	That's what I'm afraid of.
VINCENT	m	That's not what I meant and you know  it.
MIA	f	You're quite the silver tongue devil,  aren't you?
VINCENT	m	I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
MIA	f	That's not what you said Vince. Well  now I'm definitely not gonna tell  ya, 'cause it's been built up too  much.
VINCENT	m	What a gyp.
MIA	f	Yummy!
VINCENT	m	Can I have a sip of that? I'd like  to know what a five-dollar shake  tastes like.
MIA	f	Be my guest.
MIA	f	You can use my straw, I don't have  kooties.
VINCENT	m	Yeah, but maybe I do.
MIA	f	Kooties I can handle.
VINCENT	m	Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'  good milk shake.
MIA	f	Told ya.
VINCENT	m	I don't know if it's worth five  dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'  good.
MIA	f	Don't you hate that?
VINCENT	m	What?
MIA	f	Uncomfortable silences. Why do we  feel it's necessary to yak about  bullshit in order to be comfortable?
VINCENT	m	I don't know.
MIA	f	That's when you know you found  somebody special. When you can just  shit the fuck up for a minute, and  comfortably share silence.
VINCENT	m	I don't think we're there yet. But  don't feel bad, we just met each  other.
MIA	f	Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to  the bathroom and powder my nose,  while you sit here and think of  something to say.
VINCENT	m	I'll do that.
MIA	f	I said goddamn!
MIA	f	Don't you love it when you go to the  bathroom and you come back to find  your food waiting for you?
VINCENT	m	We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy  Holly doesn't seem to be much of a  waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn  Monroe's section.
MIA	f	Which one, there's two Marilyn  Monroes.
VINCENT	m	No there's not.
VINCENT	m	That's Marilyn Monroe...
VINCENT	m	... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I  don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it  must be her night off.
MIA	f	Pretty smart.
VINCENT	m	I have moments.
MIA	f	Did ya think of something to say?
VINCENT	m	Actually, there's something I've  wanted to ask you about, but you  seem like a nice person, and I didn't  want to offend you.
MIA	f	Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like  mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you  actually have something to say.
VINCENT	m	Only if you promise not to get  offended.
MIA	f	You can't promise something like  that. I have no idea what you're  gonna ask. You could ask me what  you're gonna ask me, and my natural  response could be to be offended.  Then, through no fault of my own, I  woulda broken my promise.
VINCENT	m	Then let's just forget it.
MIA	f	That is an impossibility. Trying to  forget anything as intriguing as  this would be an exercise in futility.
VINCENT	m	Is that a fact?
MIA	f	Besides, it's more exciting when you  don't have permission.
VINCENT	m	What do you think about what happened  to Antwan?
MIA	f	Who's Antwan?
VINCENT	m	Tony Rocky Horror.
MIA	f	He fell out of a window.
VINCENT	m	That's one way to say it. Another  way is, he was thrown out. Another  was is, he was thrown out by  Marsellus. And even another way is,  he was thrown out of a window by  Marsellus because of you.
MIA	f	Is that a fact?
VINCENT	m	No it's not, it's just what I heard.
MIA	f	Who told you this?
VINCENT	m	They.
MIA	f	They talk a lot, don't they?
VINCENT	m	They certainly do.
MIA	f	Well don't by shy Vincent, what  exactly did they say?
MIA	f	Let me help you Bashful, did it  involve the F-word?
VINCENT	m	No. They just said Rocky Horror gave  you a foot massage.
MIA	f	And...?
VINCENT	m	No and, that's it.
MIA	f	You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror  out of a four-story window because  he massaged my feet?
VINCENT	m	Yeah.
MIA	f	And you believed that?
VINCENT	m	At the time I was told, it seemed  reasonable.
MIA	f	Marsellus throwing Tony out of a  four story window for giving me a  foot massage seemed reasonable?
VINCENT	m	No, it seemed excessive. But that  doesn't mean it didn't happen. I  heard Marsellus is very protective  of you.
MIA	f	A husband being protective of his  wife is one thing. A husband almost  killing another man for touching his  wife's feet is something else.
VINCENT	m	But did it happen?
MIA	f	The only thing Antwan ever touched  of mine was my hand, when he shook  it. I met Anwan once � at my wedding  � then never again.  The truth is,  nobody knows why Marsellus tossed  Tony Rocky Horror out of that window  except Marsellus and Tony Rocky  Horror. But when you scamps get  together, you're worse than a sewing  circle.
ED SULLIVAN	m	Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment  you've all been waiting for, the  worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist  contest.
ED SULLIVAN	m	...One lucky couple will win this  handsome trophy that Marilyn here is  holding.
ED SULLIVAN	m	...Now, who will be our first  contestants?
MIA	f	Right here.
MIA	f	I wanna dance.
VINCENT	m	No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.
MIA	f	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do  believe Marsellus, my husband, your  boss, told you to take me out and do  whatever I wanted, Now, I want to  dance. I want to win. I want that  trophy.
VINCENT	m	All right.
MIA	f	So, dance good.
VINCENT	m	All right, you asked for it.
ED SULLIVAN	m	Let's hear it for our first  contestants.
ED SULLIVAN	m	Now let's meet our first contestants  here this evening. Young lady, what  is your name?
MIA	f	Missus Mia Wallace.
ED SULLIVAN	m	And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?
MIA	f	Vincent Vega.
ED SULLIVAN	m	All right, let's see what you can  do. Take it away!
VINCENT	m	Was than an uncomfortable silence?
MIA	f	I don't know what that was. Music and drinks!
VINCENT	m	I'm gonna take a piss.
MIA	f	That was a little bit more information  than I needed to know, but go right  ahead.
MIA	f	Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,  you've been holding out on me.
VINCENT	m	One drink and leave. Don't be rude,  but drink your drink quickly, say  goodbye, walk out the door, get in  your car, and go down the road.
VINCENT	m	...It's a moral test of yourself,  whether or not you can maintain  loyalty. Because when people are  loyal to each other, that's very  meaningful.
VINCENT	m	So you're gonna go out there, drink  your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had  a very lovely evening," go home, and  jack off.  And that's all you're  gonna do.
VINCENT	m	Jesus Christ!
VINCENT	m	Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?
VINCENT	m	I'll be a son-of-a-bitch. Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer  me honey, what did you take?
VINCENT	m	Okay honey, we're getting you on  your feet.
VINCENT	m	We're on our feet now, and now we're  gonna talk out to the car. Here we  go, watch us walk.
PREACHER 	m	Hold hands, you love birds.
JODY 	?	Lance! The phone's ringing!
LANCE	m	I can hear it!
JODY 	?	I thought you told those fuckin'  assholes never to call this late!
LANCE	m	I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna  tell this fuckin' asshole right now! Hello, do you know how late it is?  You're not supposed to be callin' me  this fuckin' late.
VINCENT	m	Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big  fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way  to your place.
LANCE	m	Whoa, hold you horses man, what's  the problem?
VINCENT	m	You still got an adrenaline shot?
LANCE	m	Maybe.
VINCENT	m	I need it man, I got a chick she's  fuckin'  Doing on me.
LANCE	m	Don't bring her here!  I'm not even  fuckin' joking with you, don't you  be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt  to my house!
VINCENT	m	No choice.
LANCE	m	She's ODin'?
VINCENT	m	Yeah. She's dyin'.
LANCE	m	Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take  'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!
VINCENT	m	Negative.
LANCE	m	She ain't my fuckin' problem, you  fucked her up, you deal with it �  are you talkin' to me on a cellular  phone?
VINCENT	m	Sorry.
LANCE	m	I don't know you, who is this, don't  come here, I'm hangin' up.
VINCENT	m	Too late, I'm already here.
JODY 	?	What the hell was that?
LANCE	m	Have you lost your mind?! You crashed  your car in my fuckin' house! You  talk about drug shit on a cellular  fuckin' phone �
VINCENT	m	If you're through havin' your little  hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get  your needle and git it now!
LANCE	m	Are you deaf? You're not bringin'  that fucked up bitch in my house!
VINCENT	m	This fucked up bitch is Marsellus  Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'  croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But  before he turns me into a bar soap,  I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about  how you coulda saved her life, but  instead you let her die on your front  lawn.
JODY	?	It's only one-thirty in the goddamn  mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on  out here?
JODY	?	Who's she?
LANCE	m	Get that black box in the bedroom I  have with the adrenaline shot.
JODY	?	What's wrong with her?
VINCENT	m	She's ODing on us.
JODY	?	Well get her the hell outta here!
LANCE AND VINCENT	m	Get the fuckin' shot!
JODY	?	Don't yell and me!
VINCENT	m	You two are a match made in heaven.
LANCE	m	Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta  get a medical book.
VINCENT	m	What do you need a medical book for?
LANCE	m	To tell me how to do it. I've never  given an adrenaline shot before.
VINCENT	m	You've had that thing for six years  and you never used it?
LANCE	m	I never had to use it. I don't go  joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all  of my friends can handle their highs!
VINCENT	m	Well then get it.
LANCE	m	I am, if you'll let me.
VINCENT	m	I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.
LANCE	m	Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'  to her.
VINCENT 	m	Hurry up man! We're losin' her!
LANCE	m	I'm looking as fast as I can!
JODY 	?	What's he lookin' for?
VINCENT 	m	I dunno, some medical book.
JODY 	?	What are you lookin' for?
LANCE	m	My black medical book!
JODY	?	Whata're you looking for?
LANCE	m	My black fuckin' medical book. It's  like a text book they give to nurses.
JODY	?	I never saw a medical book.
LANCE	m	Trust me, I have one.
JODY	?	Well if it's that important, why  didn't you keep it with the shot?
LANCE	m	I don't know! Stop bothering me!
JODY	?	While you're lookin' for it, that  girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're  never gonna find it in all this shit.   For six months now, I've been telling  you to clean this room �
VINCENT 	m	� get your ass in here, fuck the  book!
VINCENT	m	Quit fuckin' around man and give her  the shot!
LANCE	m	While I'm doing this, take her shirt  off and find her heart.
VINCENT	m	Does it have to be exact?
LANCE	m	Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving  her an injection in the heart, so I  gotta exactly hit her in the heart.
VINCENT	m	Well, I don't know exactly where her  heart is, I think it's here.
LANCE	m	That's it.
VINCENT	m	I need a big fat magic marker, got  one?
JODY	?	What?
VINCENT	m	I need a big fat magic marker, any  felt pen'll do, but a magic marker  would be great.
JODY	?	Hold on.
LANCE	m	It's ready, I'll tell you what to  do.
VINCENT	m	You're gonna give her the shot.
LANCE	m	No, you're gonna give her the shot.
VINCENT	m	I've never does this before.
LANCE	m	I've never done this before either,  and I ain't starting now. You brought  'er here, that means you give her  the shot. The day I bring an ODing  bitch to your place, then I gotta  give her the shot.
JODY	?	Got it.
VINCENT	m	Okay, what do I do?
LANCE	m	Well, you're giving her an injection  of adrenaline straight to her heart.  But she's got a breast plate in front  of her heart, so you gotta pierce  through that. So what you gotta do  is bring the needle down in a stabbing  motion.
VINCENT	m	I gotta stab her?
LANCE	m	If you want the needle to pierce  through to her heart, you gotta stab  her hard.
VINCENT	m	What happens after that?
LANCE	m	I'm curious about that myself.
VINCENT	m	This ain't a fuckin' joke man!
LANCE	m	She's supposed to come out of it  like � � that.
VINCENT	m	Count to three.
LANCE	m	One...
LANCE 	m	...two...
LANCE 	m	...three!
LANCE	m	If you're okay, say something.
MIA	f	Something.
JODY	?	Anybody want a beer?
VINCENT 	m	Mia!
VINCENT	m	What are your thoughts on how to  handle this?
MIA	f	What's yours?
VINCENT	m	Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus  can live his whole live and never  ever hear of this incident.
MIA	f	Don't worry about it. If Marsellus  ever heard of this, I'd be in as  much trouble as you.
VINCENT	m	I seriously doubt that.
MIA	f	If you can keep a secret, so can I.
VINCENT	m	Let's shake on it.
VINCENT	m	Mum's the word.
VINCENT	m	If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home  and have a heart attack.
MIA	f	You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE  FIVE" joke?
VINCENT	m	Sure, but I think I'm still a little  too petrified to laugh.
MIA	f	Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's  not funny. But if you still wanna  hear it, I'll tell it.
VINCENT	m	I can't wait.
MIA	f	Three tomatoes are walking down the  street, a poppa tomato, a momma  tomato, and a little baby tomato.  The baby tomato is lagging behind  the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa  tomato gets mad, goes over to the  momma tomato and stamps on him � � and says: catch up.
MIA	f	See ya 'round, Vince.
WOMAN'S VOICE 	f	Butch.
MOTHER	f	Butch, stop watching TV a second. We  got a special visitor. Now do you  remember when I told you your daddy  dies in a P.O.W. camp?
BUTCH 	m	Uh-huh.
MOTHER	f	Well this here is Capt. Koons. He  was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
CAPT. KOONS	m	Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard  a bunch about you. See, I was a good  friend of your Daddy's. We were in  that Hanoi pit of hell over five  years together.  Hopefully, you'll  never have to experience this  yourself, but when two men are in a  situation like me and your Daddy  were, for as long as we were, you  take on certain responsibilities of  the other. If it had been me who had  not made it, Major Coolidge would be  talkin' right now to my son Jim. But  the way it worked out is I'm talkin'  to you, Butch. I got somethin' for  ya.
CAPT. KOONS	m	This watch I got here was first  purchased by your great-granddaddy.  It was bought during the First World  War in a little general store in  Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought  by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge  the day he set sail for Paris. It  was your great-granddaddy's war watch,  made by the first company to ever  make wrist watches. You see, up until  then, people just carried pocket  watches. Your great-granddaddy wore  that watch every day he was in the  war. Then when he had done his duty,  he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his  wrist and put it in an ol' coffee  can. And in that can it stayed 'til  your grandfather Dane Coolidge was  called upon by his country to go  overseas and fight the Germans once  again. This time they called it World  War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave  it to your granddad for good luck.   Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as  good as his old man's. Your granddad  was a Marine and he was killed with  all the other Marines at the battle  of Wake Island. Your granddad was  facing death and he knew it. None of  those boys had any illusions about  ever leavin' that island alive. So  three days before the Japanese took  the island, your 22-year old  grandfather asked a gunner on an Air  Force transport named Winocki, a man  he had never met before in his life,  to deliver to his infant son, who he  had never seen in the flesh, his  gold watch. Three days later, your  grandfather was dead. But Winocki  kept his word. After the war was  over, he paid a visit to your  grandmother, delivering to your infant  father, his Dad's gold watch. This  watch. This watch was on your Daddy's  wrist when he was shot down over  Hanoi. He was captured and put in a  Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew  if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd  be confiscated. The way your Daddy  looked at it, that watch was your  birthright. And he'd be damned if  and slopeheads were gonna put their  greasy yella hands on his boy's  birthright. So he hid it in the one  place he knew he could hide somethin'.  His ass. Five long years, he wore  this watch up his ass. Then when he  died of dysentery, he gave me the  watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk  of metal up my ass for two years.  Then, after seven years, I was sent  home to my family. And now, little  man, I give the watch to you.
KLONDIKE	m	It's time, Butch.
BUTCH	m	I'm ready.
SPORTSCASTER #1 	?	� Well Dan, that had to be the  bloodiest and, hands-down, the most  brutal fight this city has ever seen.
SPORTSCASTER #1 	?	...Coolidge was out of there faster  than I've ever seen a victorious  boxer vacate the ring. Do you think  he knew Willis was dead?
SPORTSCASTER #2 	?	My guess would be yes, Richard. I  could see from my position here, the  frenzy in his eyes give way to the  realization of what he was doing. I  think any man would've left the ring  that fast.
SPORTSCASTER #1 	?	Do you feel this ring death tragedy  will have an effect on the world of  boxing?
SPORTSCASTER #2 	?	Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't  help but shake the world of boxing  to its very foundation. But it's of  paramount importance that during the  sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the  W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the �
ESMARELDA	f	Are you the man I was supposed to  pick up?
BUTCH	m	If you're the cab I called, I'm the  guy you're supposed to pick up.
ESMARELDA	f	Where to?
BUTCH	m	Outta here.
VINCENT	m	Mia. How you doin'?
MIA	f	Great. I never thanked you for the  dinner.
MARSELLUS 	m	What'cha got?
ENGLISH DAVE	m	He booked.
MARSELLUS 	m	I'm prepared to scour the earth for  this motherfucker. If Butch goes to  Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'  in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a  cap in his ass.
ENGLISH DAVE	m	I'll take care of it.
BUTCH	m	Hey, how do I open the window back  here?
ESMARELDA	f	I have to do it.
ESMARELDA	f	Hey, mister?
BUTCH	m	What?
ESMARELDA	f	You were in that fight? The fight on  the radio � you're the fighter?
BUTCH	m	Whatever gave you that idea?
ESMARELDA	f	No c'mon, you're him, I know you're  him, tell me you're him.
BUTCH	m	I'm him.
ESMARELDA	f	You killed the other boxing man.
BUTCH	m	He's dead?
ESMARELDA	f	The radio said he was dead.
BUTCH	m	Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.
ESMARELDA	f	What does it feel like?
BUTCH	m	What does what feel like?
ESMARELDA	f	Killing a man. Beating another man  to death with your bare hands.
BUTCH	m	Are you some kinda weirdo?
ESMARELDA	f	No, it's a subject I have much  interest in. You are the first person  I ever met who has killed somebody.  So, what was it like to kill a man?
BUTCH	m	Tell ya what, you give me one of  them cigarettes, I'll give you an  answer.
ESMARELDA	f	Deal!
BUTCH	m	So...
BUTCH	m	...Esmarelda Villalobos � is that  Mexican?
ESMARELDA	f	The name is Spanish, but I'm  Columbian.
BUTCH	m	It's a very pretty name.
ESMARELDA	f	It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."
BUTCH	m	That's one hell of a name you got  there, sister.
ESMARELDA	f	Thank you. And what is your name?
BUTCH	m	Butch.
ESMARELDA	f	Butch. What does it mean?
BUTCH	m	I'm an American, our names don't  mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,  what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?
ESMARELDA	f	I want to know what it feels like to  kill a man �
BUTCH	m	� I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know  he was dead 'til you told me he was  dead. Now I know he's dead, do you  wanna know how I feel about it?
BUTCH	m	I don't feel the least little bit  bad.
BUTCH	m	What'd I tell ya, soon as the word  got out a fix was in, the odds would  be outta control. Hey, if he was a  better fighter he's be alive. If he  never laced up his gloves in the  first place, which he never shoulda  done, he'd be alive. Enough about  the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's  talk about the rich and prosperous  Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you  spread it around with?
	?	Eight? How long to collect? So by tomorrow evening, you'll have  it all? Good news Scotty, real good news � I  understand a few stragglers aside.  Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in  the morning. It should take us a  couple days to get into Knoxville.  Next time we see each other, it'll  be on Tennessee time.
BUTCH	m	Fabienne my love, our adventure  begins.
ESMARELDA	f	Forty-five sixty.
BUTCH	m	Merci beaucoup. And here's a little  something for the effort.
BUTCH	m	Now if anybody should ask you about  who your fare was tonight, what're  you gonna tell 'em?
ESMARELDA	f	The truth. Three well-dressed,  slightly toasted, Mexicans.
BUTCH	m	Bon soir, Esmarelda.
ESMARELDA	f	Sleep well, Butch.
FABIENNE	f	Keep the light off.
BUTCH	m	Is that better, sugar pop?
FABIENNE	f	Oui. Hard day at the office?
BUTCH	m	Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
FABIENNE	f	Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
FABIENNE	f	I was looking at myself in the mirror.
BUTCH	m	Uh-huh?
FABIENNE	f	I wish I had a pot.
BUTCH	m	You were lookin' in the mirror and  you wish you had some pot?
FABIENNE	f	A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are  sexy.
BUTCH	m	Well you should be happy, 'cause you  do.
FABIENNE	f	Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!  I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna  when she did "Lucky Star," it's not  the same thing.
BUTCH	m	I didn't realize there was a  difference between a tummy and a pot  belly.
FABIENNE	f	The difference is huge.
BUTCH	m	You want me to have a pot?
FABIENNE	f	No. Pot bellies make a man look either  oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a  woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The  rest of you is normal. Normal face,  normal legs, normal hips, normal  ass, but with a big, perfectly round  pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a  tee-shirt two sizes too small to  accentuate it.
BUTCH	m	You think guys would find that  attractive?
FABIENNE	f	I don't give a damn what men find  attractive. It's unfortunate what we  find pleasing to the touch and  pleasing to the eye is seldom the  same.
BUTCH	m	If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in  it.
FABIENNE	f	You'd punch me in my belly?
BUTCH	m	Right in the belly.
FABIENNE	f	I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your  right on your face 'til you couldn't  breathe.
BUTCH	m	You'd do that to me?
FABIENNE	f	Yes!
BUTCH	m	Did you get everything, sugar pop?
FABIENNE	f	Yes, I did.
BUTCH	m	Good job.
FABIENNE	f	Did everything go as planned?
BUTCH	m	You didn't listen to the radio?
FABIENNE	f	I never listen to your fights. Were  you the winner?
BUTCH	m	I won alright.
FABIENNE	f	Are you still retiring?
BUTCH	m	Sure am.
FABIENNE	f	What about the man you fought?
BUTCH	m	Floyd retired too.
FABIENNE	f	Really?! He won't be fighting no  more?!
BUTCH	m	Not no more.
FABIENNE	f	So it all worked out in the finish?
BUTCH	m	We ain't at the finish, baby.
FABIENNE	f	We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
FABIENNE	f	If they find us, they'll kill us,  won't they?
FABIENNE	f	But they won't find us, will they?
FABIENNE	f	Do you still want me to go with you?
FABIENNE	f	I don't want to be a burden or a  nuisance -
FABIENNE	f	Say it!
BUTCH	m	Fabienne, I want you to be with me.
FABIENNE	f	Forever?
BUTCH	m	...and ever.
FABIENNE	f	Do you love me?
BUTCH	m	Oui.
FABIENNE	f	Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
BUTCH	m	Will you kiss it?
FABIENNE	f	But you first.
FABIENNE	f	Butch my love, the adventure begins.
BUTCH	m	I think I cracked a rib.
FABIENNE	f	Giving me oral pleasure?
BUTCH	m	No retard, from the fight.
FABIENNE	f	Don't call me retard.
BUTCH	m	My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!
FABIENNE	f	Shut up fuck head! I hate that  Mongoloid voice.
BUTCH	m	Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it  back!  Can I have a towel please,  Miss Beautiful Tulip.
FABIENNE	f	Oh I like that, I like being called  a tulip. Tulip is much better than  Mongoloid.
BUTCH	m	I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I  called you a retard, but I took it  back.
BUTCH	m	Merci beaucoup.
FABIENNE	f	Butch?
BUTCH	m	Yes, lemon pie.
FABIENNE	f	Where are we going to go?
BUTCH	m	I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.  We're gonna get a lot of money from  this. But it ain't gonna be so much,  we can live like hogs in the fat  house forever. I was thinking we  could go somewhere in the South  Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll  carry us a long way down there.
FABIENNE	f	So if we wanted, we could live in  Bora Bora?
BUTCH	m	You betcha. And if after awhile you  don't dig Bora Bora, then we can  move over to Tahiti or Mexico.
FABIENNE	f	But I do not speak Spanish.
BUTCH	m	You don't speak Bora Boran either. Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta  el zapataria?
FABIENNE	f	What does that mean?
BUTCH	m	Where's the shoe store?
FABIENNE	f	Donde esta el zapataria?
BUTCH	m	Excellent pronunciation. You'll be  my little mama ceta in no time.
BUTCH 	m	Que hora es?
FABIENNE	f	Que hora es?
BUTCH 	m	What time is it?
FABIENNE	f	What time is it?
BUTCH 	m	Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.
FABIENNE	f	Butch.
FABIENNE	f	Forget it.
FABIENNE	f	Merde! You startled me. Did you have  a bad dream?
BUTCH	m	What are you watching?
FABIENNE	f	A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the  name.
BUTCH	m	Are you watchin' it?
FABIENNE	f	In a way. Why? Would you like for me  to switch it off?
BUTCH	m	Would you please?
BUTCH	m	It's a little too early in the morning  for explosions and war.
FABIENNE	f	What was it about?
BUTCH	m	How should I know, you were the one  watchin' it.
FABIENNE	f	No, imbecile, what was your dream  about?
BUTCH	m	Oh, I... don't remember. It's really  rare I remember a dream.
FABIENNE	f	You just woke up from it.
BUTCH	m	Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I  don't remember.
FABIENNE	f	Well, let's look at the grumpy man  in the morning. I didn't say you  were lying, it's just odd you don't  remember your dreams. I always  remember mine. Did you know you talk  in your sleep?
BUTCH	m	I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk  in my sleep?
FABIENNE	f	You did last night.
BUTCH	m	What did I say?
FABIENNE	f	I don't know. I couldn't understand  you.
FABIENNE	f	Why don't you get up and we'll get  some breakfast at that breakfast  place with the pancakes.
BUTCH	m	One more kiss and I'll get up.
FABIENNE	f	Satisfied?
BUTCH	m	Yep.
FABIENNE	f	Then get up, lazy bones.
BUTCH	m	What time is it?
FABIENNE	f	Almost nine in the morning. What  time does our train arrive?
BUTCH	m	Eleven.
FABIENNE	f	I'm gonna order a big plate of  blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,  eggs over easy, and five sausages.
BUTCH	m	Anything to drink with that?
FABIENNE	f	Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a  tall glass or orange juice and a  black cup of coffee. After that, I'm  going to have a slice of pie.
BUTCH	m	Pie for breakfast?
FABIENNE	f	Any time of the day is a good time  for pie. Blueberry pie to go with  the pancakes. And on top, a thin  slice of melted cheese �
BUTCH	m	� where's my watch?
FABIENNE	f	It's there.
BUTCH	m	No, it's not. It's not here.
FABIENNE	f	Have you looked?
BUTCH	m	Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
BUTCH	m	What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!  Are you sure you got it?
FABIENNE	f	Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
BUTCH	m	� on the little kangaroo.
FABIENNE	f	Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.
BUTCH	m	Well it's not here!
FABIENNE	f	Well it should be!
BUTCH	m	Oh it most definitely should be here,  but it's not. So where is it?
BUTCH	m	Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'  watch. You know what my father went  through to git me that watch?... I  don't wanna get into it right now...  but he went through a lot. Now all  this other shit, you coulda set on  fire, but I specifically reminded  you not to forget my father's watch.  Now think, did you get it?
FABIENNE	f	I believe so...
BUTCH	m	You believe so? You either did, or  you didn't, now which one is it?
FABIENNE	f	Then I did.
BUTCH	m	Are you sure?
FABIENNE	f	No.
BUTCH	m	No! It's not your fault. You left it at the apartment.
BUTCH	m	If you did leave it at the apartment,  it's not your fault. I had you bring  a bunch of stuff. I reminded you  about it, but I didn't illustrate  how personal the watch was to me. If  all I gave a fuck about was my watch,  I should've told you. You ain't a  mind reader.
FABIENNE	f	I'm sorry.
BUTCH	m	Don't be. It just means I won't be  able to eat breakfast with you.
FABIENNE	f	Why does it mean that?
BUTCH	m	Because I'm going back to my apartment  to get my watch.
FABIENNE	f	Won't the gangsters be looking for  you there?
BUTCH	m	That's what I'm gonna find out. If  they are, and I don't think I can  handle it, I'll split.
FABIENNE	f	I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,  I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
BUTCH	m	Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing  you could ever do would make me  permanently angry at you. I love you, remember? Now here's some money, order those  pancakes and have a great breakfast.
FABIENNE	f	Don't go.
BUTCH	m	I'll be back before you can say,  blueberry pie.
FABIENNE	f	Blueberry pie.
BUTCH	m	Well maybe not that fast, but fast.  Okay?  Okay?
FABIENNE	f	Okay.
BUTCH	m	Bye-bye, sugar pop.
FABIENNE	f	Bye.
BUTCH	m	I'm gonna take your Honda.
FABIENNE	f	Okay.
BUTCH	m	Of all the fuckin' things she coulda  forgot, she forgets my father's watch.  I specifically reminded her not to  forget it. "Bedside table � on the  kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't  forget my father's watch."
BUTCH	m	Holy shit.
BUTCH	m	That's how you're gonna beat 'em,  Butch.  They keep underestimatin'  ya.
PEDESTRIAN	m	Jesus, are you okay?
BUTCH	m	I guess.
GAWKER #1	?	He's dead! He's dead!
GAWKER #2	?	If you need a witness in court, I'll  be glad to help. He was a drunken  maniac. He hit you and crashed into  that car.
MARSELLUS	m	Who?
GAWKER #2	?	Him.
MARSELLUS	m	Well, I'll be damned.
BUTCH	m	Sacre bleu.
LOOKY-LOO WOMAN	f	Oh my God, I've been shot!
MAYNARD	m	Can I help you wit' somethin'?
BUTCH	m	Shut up!
MAYNARD	m	Now you just wait one goddamn minute
BUTCH	m	So you like chasing people, huh?
BUTCH	m	Well guess what, big man, you caught  me �
MAYNARD 	m	� hold it right there, godammit!
BUTCH	m	Look mister, this ain't any of your  business �
MAYNARD	m	� I'm makin' it my business! Now  toss that gun!
MAYNARD	m	Now you on top, stand up and come to  the counter.
MAYNARD	m	Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just  caught a coupl'a flies.
MAYNARD	m	Nobody kills anybody in my place of  business except me or Zed.
MAYNARD	m	That's Zed.
ZED	m	You said you waited for me?
MAYNARD	m	I did.
ZED	m	Then how come they're all beat up?
MAYNARD	m	They did that to each other. They  was fightin' when they came in. This  one was gonna shoot that one.
ZED	m	You were gonna shoot him?
ZED	m	Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front  of this place?
MAYNARD	m	Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?
ZED	m	No, it's Thursday.
MAYNARD	m	Then she'll be fine.
ZED	m	Bring out The Gimp.
MAYNARD	m	I think The Gimp's sleepin'.
ZED	m	Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em  up then, won't you?
MAYNARD	m	Wake up!
MAYNARD	m	Down!
MAYNARD	m	Who's first?
ZED	m	I ain't fer sure yet.
ZED	m	Wanna do it here?
MAYNARD	m	Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old  room.
MAYNARD	m	Up!
MAYNARD	m	Keep an eye on this one.
MAYNARD 	m	Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight  in 'em!
ZED 	m	You wanna fight? You wanna fight?  Good, I like to fight!
MAYNARD 	m	That's it... that's it boy, you're  goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like  that... that's good. Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!  Zed goddammit, git over here and  hold 'em!
THE GIMP	m	Huhng?
BUTCH	m	Hey hillbilly.
BUTCH	m	You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.
MARSELLUS 	m	Step aside, Butch.
BUTCH	m	You okay?
MARSELLUS	m	Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from  okay!
BUTCH	m	What now?
MARSELLUS	m	What now? Well let me tell you what  now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe- hittin' niggers, who'll go to work  on homes here with a pair of pliers  and a blow torch. Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I  ain't through with you by a damn  sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on  your ass.
BUTCH	m	I meant what now, between me and  you?
MARSELLUS	m	Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell  ya what now between me an' you. There  is no me an' you. Not no more.
BUTCH	m	So we're cool?
MARSELLUS	m	Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I  ask � two things I ask: Don't tell  nobody about this. This shit's between  me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'- the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in- agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It  ain't nobody else's business. Two:  leave town. Tonight. Right now. And  when you're gone, stay gone.  You've  lost your Los Angeles privileges.   Deal?
BUTCH	m	Deal.
MARSELLUS	m	Go on now, get your ass outta here.
MARSELLUS	m	Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta  bit of a situation.
FABIENNE 	f	Butch, I was so worried!
BUTCH	m	Honey, grab your radio and your purse  and let's go!
FABIENNE 	f	But what about all our bags?
BUTCH	m	Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train  if we don't split now.
FABIENNE 	f	Is everything well? Are we in danger?
BUTCH	m	We're cool. In fact, we're super- cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait  for you outside.
FABIENNE	f	Where did you get this motorcycle?
BUTCH	m	It's a chopper, baby, hop on.
FABIENNE	f	What happened to my Honda?
BUTCH	m	Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.
FABIENNE	f	You're hurt?
BUTCH	m	I might've broke my nose, no biggie.  Hop on.
BUTCH	m	Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!
BUTCH	m	I'm sorry, baby-love.
FABIENNE	f	You were gone so long, I started to  think dreadful thoughts.
BUTCH	m	I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie. Everything's fine. Hey, how was  breakfast?
FABIENNE	f	It was good �
BUTCH	m	� did you get the blueberry pancakes?
FABIENNE	f	No, they didn't have blueberry  pancakes, I had to get buttermilk �  are you sure you're okay?
BUTCH	m	Baby-love, from the moment I left  you, this has been without a doubt  the single weirdest day of my entire  life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about  it.
FABIENNE	f	Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
BUTCH	m	It's a chopper.
FABIENNE	f	Whose chopper is this?
BUTCH	m	Zed's.
FABIENNE	f	Who's Zed?
BUTCH	m	Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.
JULES 	m	You ever read the Bible, Brett?
BRETT 	m	Yes!
JULES 	m	There's a passage I got memorized,  seems appropriate for this situation:  Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the  righteous man is beset on all sides  by the inequities of the selfish and  the tyranny of evil men..."
JULES 	m	"...blessed is he who, in the name  of charity and good will, shepherded  the weak through the valley of  darkness. And I will strike down  upon thee with great vengeance and  furious anger those who attempt to  poison and destroy my brothers. And  you will know I am the Lord when I  lay my vengeance upon you."
VINCENT 	m	Friend of yours?
JULES 	m	Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.
FOURTH MAN	m	Die... die... die... die...!
FOURTH MAN	m	I don't understand �
VINCENT	m	Why the fuck didn't you tell us about  that guy in the bathroom? Slip your  mind?  Forget he was in there with a  goddamn hand cannon?
JULES	m	We should be fuckin' dead right now. Did you see that gun he fired at us?  It was bigger than him.
VINCENT	m	.357.
JULES	m	We should be fuckin' dead!
VINCENT	m	Yeah, we were lucky.
JULES	m	That shit wasn't luck. That shit was  somethin' else.
VINCENT	m	Yeah, maybe.
JULES	m	That was... divine intervention. You  know what divine intervention is?
VINCENT	m	Yeah, I think so. That means God  came down from Heaven and stopped  the bullets.
JULES	m	Yeah, man, that's what is means.  That's exactly what it means! God  came down from Heaven and stopped  the bullets.
VINCENT	m	I think we should be going now.
JULES	m	Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do  that!  Don't blow this shit off!  What just happened was a fuckin'  miracle!
VINCENT	m	Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit  happens.
JULES	m	Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just  happen.
VINCENT	m	Do you wanna continue this theological  discussion in the car, or at the  jailhouse with the cops?
JULES	m	We should be fuckin' dead now, my  friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,  and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge  it!
VINCENT	m	Okay man, it was a miracle, can we  leave now?
VINCENT	m	...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I  was watchin' it once and this cop  was on it who was talkin' about this  time he got into this gun fight with  a guy in a hallway. He unloads on  this guy and he doesn't hit anything.  And these guys were in a hallway.  It's a freak, but it happens.
JULES	m	If you wanna play blind man, then go  walk with a Shepherd. But me, my  eyes are wide fuckin' open.
VINCENT	m	What the fuck does that mean?
JULES	m	That's it for me. For here on in,  you can consider my ass retired.
VINCENT	m	Jesus Christ!
JULES	m	Don't blaspheme!
VINCENT	m	Goddammit, Jules �
JULES	m	� I said don't do that �
VINCENT	m	� you're fuckin' freakin' out!
JULES	m	I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm  through.
VINCENT	m	While you're at it, be sure to tell  'im why.
JULES	m	Don't worry, I will.
VINCENT	m	I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he  laughs his ass off.
JULES	m	I don't give a damn if he does.
VINCENT	m	Marvin, what do you make of all this?
MARVIN	m	I don't even have an opinion.
VINCENT	m	C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came  down from Heaven and stopped the  bullets?
JULES	m	What the fuck's happening?
VINCENT	m	I just accidentally shot Marvin in  the throat.
JULES	m	Why the fuck did you do that?
VINCENT	m	I didn't mean to do it. I said it  was an accident.
JULES	m	I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in  my time �
VINCENT	m	� chill out, man, it was an accident,  okay? You hit a bump or somethin'  and the gun went off.
JULES	m	The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'  bump!
VINCENT	m	Look! I didn't mean to shoot this  son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went  off, don't ask me how!
JULES	m	Look at this mess! We're drivin'  around on a city street in broad  daylight �
VINCENT	m	� I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'  about the splatter.
JULES	m	Well you better be thinkin' about it  now, motherfucker! We gotta get this  car off the road. Cops tend to notice  shit like you're driving a car  drenched in fuckin' blood.
VINCENT	m	Can't we just take it to a friendly  place?
JULES	m	This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus  don't got no friendly places in the  Valley.
VINCENT	m	Well, don't look at me, this is your  town, Jules.
VINCENT	m	Who ya callin'?
JULES	m	A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.
VINCENT	m	Where's Toluca Lake.
JULES	m	On the other side of the hill, by  Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass  ain't home, I don't know what the  fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any  other partners in 818. Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules. Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are  in some serious shit. We're in a car  we gotta get off the road, pronto! I  need to use your garage for a couple  hours.
JULES	m	We gotta be real fuckin' delicate  with this Jimmie's situation. He's  one remark away from kickin' our  asses out the door.
VINCENT	m	If he kicks us out, whadda we do?
JULES	m	Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made  a couple phone calls. But I never  want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's  my friend and you don't bust in your  friend's house and start tellin' 'im  what's what.
VINCENT	m	Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He  kinda freaked out back there when he  saw Marvin.
JULES	m	Put yourself in his position. It's  eight o'clock in the morning. He  just woke up, he wasn't prepared for  this shit. Don't forget who's doin'  who a favor.
VINCENT	m	If the price of that favor is I gotta  take shit, he can stick his favor  straight up his ass.
JULES	m	What the fuck did you just do to his  towel?
VINCENT	m	I was just dryin' my hands.
JULES	m	You're supposed to wash 'em first.
VINCENT	m	You watched me wash 'em.
JULES	m	I watched you get 'em wet.
VINCENT	m	I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to  get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,  I coulda done a better job.
JULES	m	I used the same soap you did and  when I dried my hands, the towel  didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie  pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who  cares? But it's shit like this that's  gonna bring this situation to a boil.  If he were to come in here and see  that towel like that... I'm tellin'  you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause  if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie  on account of you... Look, I ain't  threatenin' you, I respect you an'  all, just don't put me in that  position.
JULES	m	Jules, you ask me nice like that, no  problem. He's your friend, you handle  him.
JULES	m	Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious  gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda  been satisfied with freeze-dried  Tasters Choice. You spring this  gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What  flavor is this?
JIMMIE	m	Knock it off, Julie.
JULES	m	What?
JIMMIE	m	I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can  stop butterin' me up. I don't need  you to tell me how good my coffee  is. I'm the one who buys it, I know  how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie  goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy  the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause  when I drink it, I wanna taste it.  But what's on my mind at this moment  isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's  the dead nigger in my garage.
JULES	m	Jimmie �
JIMMIE	m	� I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a  question, Jules. When you drove in  here, did you notice a sign out front  that said, "Dead nigger storage?"
JIMMIE	m	� answer to question. Did you see a  sign out in front of my house that  said, "Dead nigger storage?"
JULES	m	Naw man, I didn't.
JIMMIE	m	You know why you didn't see that  sign?
JULES	m	Why?
JIMMIE	m	'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my  fuckin' business!
JIMMIE	m	� I ain't through! Now don't you  understand that if Bonnie comes home  and finds a dead body in her house,  I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage  counselor, no trial separation �  fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna  get fuckin' divorced. The last time  me an' Bonnie talked about this shit  was gonna be the last time me an'  Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I  wanna help ya out Julie, I really  do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife  doin' it.
JULES	m	Jimmie �
JIMMIE	m	� don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I  can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'  you can say that's gonna make me  forget I love my wife. Now she's  workin' the graveyard shift at the  hospital. She'll be comin' home in  less than an hour and a half. Make  your phone calls, talk to your people,  than get the fuck out of my house.
JULES	m	That's all we want. We don't wanna  fuck up your shit. We just need to  call our people to bring us in.
JIMMIE	m	Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's  in my bedroom.
MARSELLUS	m	...well, say she comes home. Whaddya  think she'll do? No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That  ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,  I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?
JULES	m	You got to appreciate what an  explosive element this Bonnie  situation is. If she comes home from  a hard day's work and finds a bunch  of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'  shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'  what she's apt to do.
MARSELLUS	m	I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm  doin' is contemplating the "ifs."
JULES	m	I don't wanna hear about no  motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna  hear from your ass is: "you ain't  got no problems, Jules. I'm on the  motherfucker. Go back in there, chill  them niggers out and wait for the  cavalry, which should be comin'  directly."
MARSELLUS	m	You ain't got no problems, Jules.  I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in  there, chill them niggers out and  wait for The Wolf, who should be  comin' directly.
JULES	m	You sendin' The Wolf?
MARSELLUS	m	Feel better?
JULES	m	Shit Negro, that's all you had to  say.
THE WOLF	m	Is she the hysterical type? When she due? Give me the principals' names again? Jules...
THE WOLF	m	...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...
THE WOLF	m	Expect a call around 10:30. It's  about thirty minutes away. I'll be  there in ten.
THE WOLF	m	You're Jimmie, right? This is your  house?
JIMMIE	m	Yeah.
THE WOLF	m	I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.
JIMMIE	m	Good, 'cause we got one.
THE WOLF	m	So I heard. May I come in?
JIMMIE	m	Please do.
THE WOLF	m	You must be Jules, which would make  you Vincent. Let's get down to brass  tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed  correctly, the clock is ticking, is  that right, Jimmie?
JIMMIE	m	100%.
THE WOLF	m	Your wife, Bonnie... ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is  that correct?
JIMMIE	m	Uh-huh.
THE WOLF	m	I was led to believe if she comes  home and finds us here, she wouldn't  appreciate it none too much.
JIMMIE	m	She won't at that.
THE WOLF	m	That gives us forty minutes to get  the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you  do what I say when I say it, should  by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a  car, minus a head, in a garage. Take  me to it.
THE WOLF	m	Jimmie?
JIMMIE	m	Yes.
THE WOLF	m	Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I  smelled some coffee in there. Would  you make me a cup?
JIMMIE	m	Sure, how do you take it?
THE WOLF	m	Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
THE WOLF	m	About the car, is there anything I  need to know? Does it stall, does it  make a lot of noise, does it smoke,  is there gas in it, anything?
JULES	m	Aside from how it looks, the car's  cool.
THE WOLF	m	Positive?  Don't get me out on the  road and I find out the brake lights  don't work.
JULES	m	Hey man, as far as I know, the  motherfucker's tip-top.
THE WOLF	m	Good enough, let's go back to the  kitchen.
THE WOLF	m	Thank you, Jimmie.
THE WOLF	m	Okay first thing, you two. Take the body, stick it in the trunk.  Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty  domesticated house. That would lead  me to believe that in the garage or  under the sink, you got a bunch of  cleansers and cleaners and shit like  that, am I correct?
JIMMIE	m	Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
THE WOLF	m	Good. What I need you two fellas to  do is take those cleaning products  and clean the inside of the car. And  I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You  need to go in the backseat, scoop up  all those little pieces of brain and  skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe  down the upholstery � now when it  comes to upholstery, it don't need  to be spic and span, you don't need  to eat off it. Give it a good once  over. What you need to take care of  are the really messy parts. The pools  of blood that have collected, you  gotta soak that shit up.  But the  windows are a different story.  Them  you really clean. Get the Windex, do  a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to  raid your linen closet. I need  blankets, I need comforters, I need  quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker  the better, the darker the better.  No whites, can't use 'em. We need to  camouflage the interior of the car.  We're gonna line the front seat and  the backseat and the floor boards  with quilts and blankets. If a cop  stops us and starts stickin' his big  snout in the car, the subterfuge  won't last. But at a glance, the car  will appear to be normal.  Jimmie �  lead the way, boys � get to work.
VINCENT	m	A "please" would be nice.
THE WOLF	m	Come again?
VINCENT	m	I said a "please" would be nice.
THE WOLF	m	Set is straight, Buster. I'm not  here to say "please."I'm here to  tell you want to do. And if self- preservation is an instinct you  possess, you better fuckin' do it  and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa  luck gentlemen.
JULES	m	It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your  help is definitely appreciated.
VINCENT	m	I don't mean any disrespect. I just  don't like people barkin' orders at  me.
THE WOLF	m	If I'm curt with you, it's because  time is a factor. I think fast, I  talk fast, and I need you guys to  act fast if you want to get out of  this. So pretty please, with sugar  on top, clean the fuckin' car.
THE WOLF	m	It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. White. Nothin', except for the mess inside. About twenty minutes. Nobody who'll be missed. You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon. How we comin', Jimmie?
JIMMIE	m	Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand  somethin' �
THE WOLF	m	� Winston, Jimmie � please, Winston.
JIMMIE	m	You gotta understand something,  Winston. I want to help you guys out  and all, but that's my best linen.  It was a wedding present from my  Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and  they ain't with us anymore �
THE WOLF	m	� let me ask you a question, if you  don't mind?
JIMMIE	m	Sure.
THE WOLF	m	Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny  millionaires?
JIMMIE	m	No.
THE WOLF	m	Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And  I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and  Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they  would've furnished you with a whole  bedroom set, which your Uncle  Marsellus is more than happy to do. I like oak myself, that's what's in  my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,  you an oak man?
JIMMIE	m	Oak's nice.
JULES	m	I will never forgive your ass for  this shit. This is some fucked-up  repugnant shit!
VINCENT	m	Did you ever hear the philosophy  that once a man admits he's wrong,  he's immediately forgiven for all  wrong-doings?
JULES	m	Man, get outta my face with that  shit! The motherfucker who said that  never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces  of skull with his fingers on account  of your dumb ass.
VINCENT	m	I got a threshold, Jules. I got a  threshold for the abuse I'll take.  And you're crossin' it. I'm a race  car and you got me in the red. Redline  7000, that's where you are. Just  know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be  drivin' a race car when it's in the  red. It could blow.
JULES	m	You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a  mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!   Every time my fingers touch brain  I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS  OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker  usta talk about. In fact, what the  fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're  the motherfucker should be on brain  detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'  windows and you're pickin' up this  nigger's skull.
THE WOLF	m	Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out  of this yet.
JIMMIE	m	I can't believe that's the same car.
THE WOLF	m	Well, let's not start suckin' each  other's dicks quite yet. Phase one  is complete, clean the car, which  moves us right along to phase two,  clean you two.
THE WOLF	m	Strip.
VINCENT	m	All the way?
THE WOLF	m	To your bare ass.
THE WOLF	m	Quickly gentlemen, we got about  fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better- half comes pulling into the driveway.
JULES	m	This morning air is some chilly shit.
VINCENT	m	Are you sure this is absolutely  necessary?
THE WOLF	m	You know what you two look like?
VINCENT	m	What?
THE WOLF	m	Like a couple of guys who just blew  off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'  off those bloody rags is absolutely  necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's  garbage bag.
JULES	m	Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid  like puttin' that out in front of  your house for Elmo the garbage man  to take away.
THE WOLF	m	Don't worry, we're takin' it with  us. Jim, the soap.
THE WOLF	m	Okay gentlemen, you're both been to  County before, I'm sure. Here it  comes.
JULES	m	Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!
THE WOLF	m	Better you than me, gentlemen.
THE WOLF	m	Don't be afraid of the soap, spread  it around.
THE WOLF	m	Towel 'em.
THE WOLF	m	You're dry enough, give 'em their  clothes.
THE WOLF	m	Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've  planned this better. You guys look  like... what do they look like,  Jimmie?
JIMMIE	m	Dorks. They look like a couple of  dorks.
JULES	m	Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,  motherfucker.
JIMMIE	m	I guess you just gotta know how to  wear them.
JULES	m	Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert  on wearin' dorky shit that your is.
THE WOLF	m	C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and  jokin' our way into prison. Don't  make me beg.
THE WOLF	m	Gentlemen, let's get our rules of  the road straight. We're going to a  place called Monster Joe's Truck and  Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter  Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.   The place is North Hollywood, so a  few twist and turns aside, we'll be  goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll  drive the tainted car. Jules, you  ride with me.  Vincent, you follow  in my Porsche. Now if we cross the  path of any John Q. Laws, nobody  does a fuckin' thing 'til I do  something.
	?	What did I say?
JULES	m	Don't do shit unless �
THE WOLF	m	� unless what?
JULES	m	Unless you do it first.
THE WOLF	m	Spoken like a true prodigy. How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you  keep your spurs from jingling and  jangling?
VINCENT	m	I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went  off, I dunno how.
THE WOLF	m	Fair enough. I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep  up. If I get my car back any different  than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna  be disposing of two bodies.
JULES	m	We cool?
WINSTON	m	Like it never happened.
WINSTON	m	Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all  this will be hers.
RAQUEL	f	Hi. You know, if they ever do "I  SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,  I'd be great.  What's with the  outfits. You guys going to a  volleyball game?
WINSTON	m	I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.  Maybe I can drop you two off. Where  do you live?
VINCENT	m	Redondo Beach.
JULES	m	Inglewood.
WINSTON	m	It's your future: I see... a cab  ride. Sorry guys, move out of the sticks. Say goodbye, Raquel.
RAQUEL	f	Goodbye, Raquel.
WINSTON	m	I'll see you two around, and stay  outta trouble, you crazy kids.
JULES	m	Mr. Wolf.
JULES	m	I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
WINSTON	m	Call me Winston.
WINSTON	m	You hear that, young lady? Respect.  You could lean a lot from those two  fine specimens. Respect for one's  elders shows character.
RAQUEL	f	I have character.
WINSTON	m	Just because you are a character  doesn't mean you have character.
RAQUEL	f	Oh you're so funny, oh you're so  funny.
JULES	m	Wanna share a cab?
VINCENT	m	You know I could go for some  breakfast.  Want to have breakfast  with me?
JULES	m	Sure.
VINCENT	m	Thanks a bunch. Want a sausage?
JULES	m	Naw, I don't eat pork.
VINCENT	m	Are you Jewish?
JULES	m	I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig  on swine.
VINCENT	m	Why not?
JULES	m	They're filthy animals. I don't eat  filthy animals.
VINCENT	m	Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste  good.
JULES	m	A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin  pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if  it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy  motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in  shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't  wanna eat nothin' that ain't got  enough sense to disregard its own  feces.
VINCENT	m	How about dogs? Dogs eat their own  feces.
JULES	m	I don't eat dog either.
VINCENT	m	Yes, but do you consider a dog to be  a filthy animal?
JULES	m	I wouldn't go so far as to call a  dog filthy, but they're definitely  dirty. But a dog's got personality.  And personality goes a long way.
VINCENT	m	So by that rationale, if a pig had a  better personality, he's cease to be  a filthy animal?
JULES	m	We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one  motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd  have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
VINCENT	m	Good for you. Lighten up a little.  You been sittin' there all quiet.
JULES	m	I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
VINCENT	m	About what?
JULES	m	The miracle we witnessed.
VINCENT	m	The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed  a freak occurrence.
JULES	m	Do you know that a miracle is?
VINCENT	m	An act of God.
JULES	m	What's an act of God?
VINCENT	m	I guess it's when God makes the  impossible possible. And I'm sorry  Jules, but I don't think what happened  this morning qualifies.
JULES	m	Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't  matter. You're judging this thing  the wrong way. It's not about what.  It could be God stopped the bullets,  he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found  my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge  shit like this based on merit. Whether  or not what we experienced was an  according-to-Hoyle miracle is  insignificant. What is significant  is I felt God's touch, God got  involved.
VINCENT	m	But why?
JULES	m	That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I  don't know why. But I can't go back  to sleep.
VINCENT	m	So you're serious, you're really  gonna quit?
JULES	m	The life, most definitely.
PATRON	m	Garcon! Coffee!
VINCENT	m	So if you're quitting the life,  what'll you do?
JULES	m	That's what I've been sitting here  contemplating. First, I'm gonna  deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,  basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.
VINCENT	m	What do you mean, walk the earth?
JULES	m	You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."  Just walk from town to town, meet  people, get in adventures.
VINCENT	m	How long do you intend to walk the  earth?
JULES	m	Until God puts me where he want me  to be.
VINCENT	m	What if he never does?
JULES	m	If it takes forever, I'll wait  forever.
VINCENT	m	So you decided to be a bum?
JULES	m	I'll just be Jules, Vincent � no  more, no less.
VINCENT	m	No Jules, you're gonna be like those  pieces of shit out there who beg for  change. They walk around like a bunch  of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in  garbage bins, they eat what I throw  away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got  a word for 'em, they're called bums.  And without a job, residence, or  legal tender, that's what you're  gonna be � a fuckin' bum!
JULES	m	Look my friend, this is just where  me and you differ �
VINCENT	m	� what happened was peculiar � no  doubt about it � but it wasn't water  into wine.
JULES	m	All shapes and sizes, Vince.
VINCENT	m	Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
JULES	m	If you find my answers frightening,  Vincent, you should cease askin'  scary questions.
VINCENT	m	I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
PUMPKIN	f	Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!
HONEY BUNNY	f	Any of you fuckin' pricks move and  I'll execute every one of you  motherfuckers!  Got that?!
PUMPKIN	f	Customers stay seated, waitresses on  the floor.
HONEY BUNNY	f	Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,  do it or fucking die!
PUMPKIN	f	You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out  here!  Asta luego!
PUMPKIN	f	On the floor or I'll cook you ass,  comprende?
MANAGER	m	I'm the manager here, there's no  problem, no problem at all �
PUMPKIN	f	You're gonna give me a problem?
PUMPKIN	f	What? You said you're gonna give me  a problem?
MANAGER	m	No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you  any problem!
PUMPKIN	f	I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks  like the hero type to me!
HONEY BUNNY	f	Don't take any chances. Execute him!
MANAGER	m	Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm  just a coffee shop manager. Take  anything you want.
PUMPKIN	f	Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll  be all over.
MANAGER	m	Everybody just be calm and cooperate  with them and this will be all over  soon!
PUMPKIN	f	Well done, now git your fuckin' ass  on the ground.
PUMPKIN	f	Okay people, I'm going to go 'round  and collect your wallets. Don't talk,  just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
PUMPKIN	f	In the bag.
PUMPKIN	f	What's in that?
JULES	m	My boss' dirty laundry.
PUMPKIN	f	You boss makes you do his laundry?
JULES	m	When he wants it clean.
PUMPKIN	f	Sounds like a shit job.
JULES	m	Funny, I've been thinkin' the same  thing.
PUMPKIN	f	Open it up.
JULES	m	'Fraid I can't do that.
PUMPKIN	f	I didn't hear you.
JULES	m	Yes, you did.
HONEY BUNNY	f	What's goin' on?
PUMPKIN	f	Looks like we got a vigilante in our  midst.
HONEY BUNNY	f	Shoot 'em in the face!
JULES	m	I don't mean to shatter your ego,  but this ain't the first time I've  had gun pointed at me.
PUMPKIN	f	You don't open up that case, it's  gonna be the last.
MANAGER	m	Quit causing problems, you'll get us  all killed! Give 'em what you got  and get 'em out of here.
JULES	m	Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat  man, this ain't any of your goddamn  business!
PUMPKIN	f	I'm countin' to three, and if your  hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna  unload right in your fuckin' face.  Clear? One...
PUMPKIN	f	...two... three.
JULES	m	You win.
JULES	m	It's all yours, Ringo.
PUMPKIN	f	Open it.
HONEY BUNNY	f	What is it? What is it?
PUMPKIN	f	Is that what I think it is?
PUMPKIN	f	It's beautiful.
HONEY BUNNY	f	Goddammit, what is it?
HONEY BUNNY	f	Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow  your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!  I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're  gonna fuckin' die bad!
JULES	m	Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,  bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!
PUMPKIN	f	Chill out, honey!
HONEY BUNNY	f	Let him go!
JULES	m	Tell her it's gonna be okay.
PUMPKIN	f	I'm gonna be okay.
JULES	m	Promise her.
PUMPKIN	f	I promise.
JULES	m	Tell her to chill.
PUMPKIN	f	Just chill out.
JULES	m	What's her name?
PUMPKIN	f	Yolanda.
JULES	m	So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna  do anything stupid, are we?
YOLANDA	f	Don't you hurt him.
JULES	m	Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're  gonna be like three Fonzies. And  what' Fonzie like?
JULES	m	C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?
YOLANDA	f	He's cool?
JULES	m	Correct-amundo! And that's what we're  gonna be, we're gonna be cool. Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three  and I want you to let go your gun  and lay your palms flat on the table.  But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?
JULES	m	One... two... three.
YOLANDA	f	Okay, now let him go!
JULES	m	Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be  cool.  When you yell at me, it makes  me nervous.  When I get nervous, I  get scared. And when motherfuckers  get scared, that's when motherfuckers  get accidentally shot.
YOLANDA	f	Just know: you hurt him, you die.
JULES	m	That seems to be the situation. Now  I don't want that and you don't want  that and Ringo here don't want that.  So let's see what we can do. Now this is the situation. Normally  both of your asses would be dead as  fuckin' fried chicken. But you  happened to pull this shit while I'm  in a transitional period. I don't  wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.  But I'm afraid I can't give you the  case. It don't belong to me. Besides,  I went through too much shit this  morning on account of this case to  just hand it over to your ass.
VINCENT 	m	What the fuck's goin' on here?
JULES	m	It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't  do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's  cool baby, nothin's changed. We're  still just talkin'. Tell her we're still cool.
PUMPKIN	f	It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still  cool.
VINCENT	m	What the hell's goin' on, Jules?
JULES	m	Nothin' I can't handle. I want you  to just hang back and don't do shit  unless it's absolutely necessary.
VINCENT	m	Check.
JULES	m	Yolanda, how we doin, baby?
YOLANDA	f	I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
JULES	m	Just hang in there, baby, you're  doing' great, Ringo's proud of you  and so am I.  It's almost over. Now I want you to go in that bag and  find my wallet.
PUMPKIN	f	Which one is it?
JULES	m	It's the one that says Bad  Motherfucker on it.
JULES	m	That's my bad motherfucker. Now open  it up and take out the cash. How  much is there?
PUMPKIN	f	About fifteen hundred dollars.
JULES	m	Put it in your pocket, it's yours.  Now with the rest of them wallets  and the register, that makes this a  pretty successful little score.
VINCENT	m	Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen  hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on  general principle.
JULES	m	You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,  now hang back and shut the fuck up.  Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.  I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.  Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?
PUMPKIN	f	What?
JULES	m	Your life. I'm givin' you that money  so I don't hafta kill your ass. You  read the Bible?
PUMPKIN	f	Not regularly.
JULES	m	There's a passage I got memorized.  Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the  righteous man is beset on all sides  by the inequities of the selfish and  the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is  he who, in the name of charity and  good will, shepherds the weak through  the valley of the darkness. For he  is truly his brother's keeper and  the finder of lost children. And I  will strike down upon thee with great  vengeance and furious anger those  who attempt to poison and destroy my  brothers. And you will know I am the  Lord when I lay my vengeance upon  you." I been sayin' that shit for  years.  And if you ever heard it, it  meant your ass. I never really  questioned what it meant. I thought  it was just a coldblooded thing to  say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped  a cap in his ass. But I saw some  shit this mornin' made me think twice.  Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're  the evil man. And I'm the righteous  man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the  shepherd protecting my righteous ass  in the valley of darkness. Or is  could by you're the righteous man  and I'm the shepherd and it's the  world that's evil and selfish.  I'd  like that. But that shit ain't the  truth. The truth is you're the weak.  And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But  I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to  be a shepherd.
JULES	m	It's cold.
VINCENT	m	I think we oughta leave now.
JULES	m	That's probably a good idea.
