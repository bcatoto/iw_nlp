CRAWFORD	m	I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here... 
GRAHAM	m	I don't want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. 
CRAWFORD	m	How much do you know? 
GRAHAM	m	What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions?

CRAWFORD	m	I have to. 
CRAWFORD	m	Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it... 
MOLLY	f	You wouldn't like it, either if you had it. 
CRAWFORD	m	Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you? 
MOLLY	f	No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'... 
CRAWFROD	?	I'LL try to keep him as far away from it as I can... 
GRAHAM	m	Thanks for the lift. 
OFFICER	m	I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
