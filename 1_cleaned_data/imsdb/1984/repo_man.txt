SHERIFF	m	What could have done that to him? Gasoline?  Napalm?
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	It happens sometimes. People just explode.  Natural causes.
SHERIFF	m	What?
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Suspect presence on west coast confirmed.  Do not notify police.
OTTO	m	Night watchman in Pomona.
KEVIN	m	Yep.

KEVIN	m	Yep Yep!
OTTO	m	French fry maker Agoura. Ha Ha that's  absurd.
KEVIN	m	Yeah? Well you think it's funny huh?  There's fucking (lots of) room to move  as a fry cook, man. You know I could  be manager in two years? King! God!  (egad!)
OTTO	m	You know Kevin, I had this wild fucking  (flippin) dream the other night.
KEVIN	m	I bet.
OTTO	m	It was with you and me and we were working  in this sleazy shithole (shabby) motel  down in Miami, Florida. And we were  bellhops and we were sixty-five years  old. It was so real it was really real,  realistic.
KEVIN	m	And then what, you woke up in a puddle  (cold sweat)?
OTTO	m	Fuck you! (drop dead)
KEVIN	m	Fucking (you) jerk.
KEVIN	m	Where you going asshole (snotnose)?
OTTO	m	Away from you.
OTTO	m	Mother, father. Got anything to eat?
REVEREND LARRY	m	Occasionally we get a letter from a  viewer that says now the only reason  Reverend Larry comes on your television  set is because he wants your money.  And do you know what? They're right!  I do want your money. Because god wants  your money. So I want you to go out  and mortgage that home and sell that  car and send me your money. You don't  need that car. (continues in background)
OTTO MOM	f	Put it on a plate son you'll enjoy it  more.
OTTO	m	I couldn't enjoy it any more mom MMM  MMM MMM This is swell.
OTTO	m	Dad? Hey Dad?
OTTO DAD	m	What is it son?
OTTO	m	Do you remember that you once told me  along time ago. Well not too long ago  but ummm. That you told me that you'd  give me a thousand dollars to go to  Europe if I finish school. Well you  know something? You were right. About  finishing school that's ah that's what  I'd like to do. But umm I want to know  if I could have the money first. Like  now. [You know I really love you Dad  I've always loved you. You too mom.  What do you say?
OTTO DAD	m	I don't have it anymore.
OTTO	m	What?]
OTTO MOM	f	You father gave all our extra money  to the Reverend's telethon, Otto.
OTTO	m	Well what about me?
OTTO DAD	m	You're on the honor roll of the chariots  of fire. Same as us, Otto. It was a  gift. From all of us jointly.
OTTO MOM	f	We're sending bibles to El Salvador.
OTTO	m	So how much do I get paid, twenty-five  buck a car.
BUD	m	Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding,  you work on commission, that's better  than getting paid.
BUD	m	Most cars you rip are worth two or three  hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar  Porsche (german pronounciation) might  make ya five grand.
BUD	m	It helps if you dress like a detective,  too. Detectives dress kind of square.  People think this guy is a cop. They're  going to think you're packing something.  They don't fuck (mess) with you so much.
OTTO	m	Are you?
BUD	m	Am I what?
OTTO	m	Packin' something.
BUD	m	Ha. Only an asshole (a jackass) gets  killed for a car. Guys who make it are  the guys who get into their cars at  anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up  at four. That's why there ain't a repo  man I know that don't take speed.
OTTO	m	Speed huh?
BUD	m	I'll call you back! (hangs up) Flippin  general telephone.
BUD	m	C'mon.
BUD	m	Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired  a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk.  I shall not cause harm to any vehicle  nor the personal contents thereof. Nor  through inaction let that vehicle or  the personal contents thereof come to  harm. That's what I call the repo code  kid. Don't forget it etch it in your  brain. Not many people got a code to  live by anymore.
BUD	m	Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those  assholes (that) over there.
BUD	m	Ordinary  people I hate 'em.
OTTO	m	Me too.
BUD	m	What do you know? See an ordinary person  spend his life avoiding tense situations.  Repoman spends his life getting into  tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink.
BUD	m	Tense situations kid. Get into five  or six of them a day and it don't mean  shit (zilch) anymore. I mean I seen  men stabbed and it didn't mean shit  (zilch). I've seen guns. Guns too they  don't mean shit (zilch) but that's when  you got to watch your self. Here I'll  handle it pal. Uh settle down.
BUD	m	Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day,  it doesn't mean shit (zilch).
DUKE	m	Wasn't that Otto?
DEBBI	f	Otto who?
DUKE	m	You gotta watch yourself. (takes off  mask) Have a nice day . . . night.
BUD	m	This is what I call phase 2 ace. If  the dealer don't have the keys, you  call the truck. And it is a heartbreak  to be sitting waiting for the truck  and the giblet comes out and drives  it away. Once you've got this baby on  the hooks, she's all ours.
PAKMAN	m	Oh no you don't. I'm nipping this in  the bud right now. You are not going  to take this car. I know my rights.  There is absolutely no way you're going  to take it.
BUD	m	Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman?
PAKMAN	m	Obviously not. I'm Arthur Pakman. Luann  is my daughter. Now you're going to  have to take this matter up with her.
BUD	m	Well don't think I haven't tried, sir,  but she hasn't had the decency to call  us in months. I mean, I've skipped trace  this car all over town.
PAKMAN	m	Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn  car isn't working anyway, and I know,  I know that's why she hasn't paid you.
BUD	m	Well, she could have called us? Look,  all you've go to do is call my branch  manager, I will abide with whatever  he says.
PAKMAN READING CARD	m	I. G. Farben. . . What do you take me  for, a moron? If I go in there, you're  going to take this car away.
BUD	m	What, and lose my job? The law requires  that I stay right here until you call  my branch manager.
PAKMAN	m	That's the law?
BUD	m	That's the law.
PAKMAN	m	I'll be right back.
BUD	m	There's going to be some bad shit (stuff)  coming down one of these days kid.
OTTO	m	Oh yeah? Where you going to be? On the  moon?
BUD	m	Ung Uh, I'm going to be right here heading  north at a hundred and ten per.
OTTO	m	In this junker?
OTTO	m	Cool car.
BUD	m	Uh Oh! The Rodriguez brothers.
OTTO	m	Motherfucker just flipped you off.
BUD	m	Roll the window down.] Roll the window  down.
LAGARTO	m	A donde vas, pendejo?
BUD	m	A chingas tu esposa!
A BROTHER	m	Hey Bud, hey Bud, who's your new girlfriend?
OTTO	m	Watch it mother fucker. (Girlfriend?  watch it melonfarmer!)
LAGARTO	m	Hey fuck you pussy punk. (flip you,  you punk.)
[OTTO	?	Holy shit.]
NAPOLEON	m	Want me to take them?
OTTO	m	Wo! Hey!
BUD	m	God damn dipshit Rodriguez gypsy dildo  punks. I'll get your ass!dang blamed dumb suck Rodriguez gypsy  devil punks. I'll get your can!)
OTTO	m	HAHAHA WOW! That was intense.
BUD	m	Repo man's always intense. Come on let's  go get a drink.
OTTO	m	Gee bud. You never told me it was going  to be like this man. Cops and robbers.  Hahahahah. Real live car chases. Hahahahah.
ARCHIE	m	Shit (shoot)! Debbi!
DUKE	m	If you say our names we'll have to kill  all these people Archie.
ARCHIE	m	They all ran away.
DEBBI	f	Come on you douche bags. (come on, get  the lead out.)
BUD	m	Awful quiet in here. It's too quiet.
OTTO	m	So who are these Rodriguez boys.
BUD	m	Rodriguez brothers. Lagarto and Napoleon.  Two notorious delinquents currently  responsible for at least thirty vehicles  in the field.
OTTO	m	Scumbags
LITE	m	They ain't scumbags. They car thieves  just like use.
LITE	m	There's Miss Magruder. You want to go  for it?
OTTO	m	Good gag, you pull this one a lot?
LITE	m	Only on the women. It never fails.
OTTO	m	Excuse me? Miss Magruder? I have something  here for you.
MS. MAGRUDER	f	Uhm how utterly charming.
OTTO	m	Ow! Ow! Ow! Motherfucker! (mother...)  Ow! Ow! Ow! Christ! I'm blind man. Lite?  Lite, where are you man?
BUD	m	Ruthside Peason brokerage consultant.  Fucking (flippin) millionaire six payments  behind. I've never understood it.
OTTO	m	What's that?
BUD	m	The fucking (flippin) millionaires.  They never pay their bills. See you  at the yard.
OTTO	m	Let me get this one.
BUD	m	No. I'll handle this one. Mister Peason  is carrying a permit for a pistol.
BUD	m	Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me that.
OTTO	m	Don't underestimate me ace.
RUTHSIDE PEASON	?	And also, naturally, I'd like them to  be right next to each other. In addition  I'd like them to be as close to the  window as possible so I can sit in my  car and watch my things. So all you  have to do is take your clothes out  of here like this and put them into  a machine over there like that.
RUTHSIDE PEASON	?	Oh my god (lord)! Oh! Oh my god (lord)!  Stop!
OTTO	m	Hey! Hey! You want a ride? Hey babe  need a ride?
OLD LADY	m	Pick it up! Look at you. You pick it  up. You know yourself you were wrong.
OTTO	m	Well what were they doing out in the  middle of the street?
OLD LADY	m	They weren't in the middle of the street.  That not the middle of the street that's  the corner.
OLD LADY	m	Go on you pick it up.
OTTO	m	What?
OLD LADY	m	You pick it up.
OTTO	m	Haha, no way. You still want a ride  or what?
OLD LADY	m	No I don't.
OTTO	m	My name is Otto.
LEILA	f	Leila. Is this your car?
OTTO	m	Yeah it's one of them.
LEILA	f	Heh, one of them? You think you're pretty  slick don't ya? I bet you're a used  car salesman.
OTTO	m	I am not.
LEILA	f	You dress like one.
OTTO	m	I'm a repo man.
LEILA	f	What's that?
OTTO	m	It�s a repossesser. I take back cars  from dildos (deadbeats) who don't pay  their bills. Cool huh?
LEILA	f	No.
OTTO	m	What are you doing?
LEILA	f	Those men in the car next to us don't  look at them. Don't look at them! If  they see me they'll kill me.
OTTO	m	Really why?
OTTO	m	Ow! What the hell are you doing?
OTTO	m	What's going on?
LEILA	f	Take a look at this.
OTTO	m	What's this? It looks like sausage.
LEILA	f	It isn't sausage Otto. That's a picture  of four dead aliens.
OTTO	m	HAHAHAH
LEILA	f	Laugh away fuckface (fatface) that picture  is going to be on the cover of ever  major newspaper in two days time.
OTTO	m	How do you know that?
LEILA	f	Part of a secret network. A scientist  who is also in our secret sect smuggled  the corpses off of this air force base.  Now he's got them in the truck of his  car. It's a Chevy Malibu. We've got  to find him.
OTTO	m	What are you going to do with them,  put them on Johnny Carson?
LEILA	f	Yes! We're going to have a press conference  and tell the world.
RADIO	m	Ehw. What's that? I don't know dear.  But it is alive. It seems friendly though.  Aw look it's curled up. How cute oh  no. Maybe we can take it home it doesn't  seem to have any. Oh yes let's. But  no! No matter how appealing do not let  strange creature in you house. We all  know strange creatures are on the increase.  Many of them do seem furry and adorable,  but beware we don't know from whence  they came. Be safe. Be safe. Report  strange incidences today. (continues  in background)
OTTO	m	United fruitcake outlet.
LEILA	f	My door doesn't open.
LEILA	f	Thanks for the ride.
OTTO	m	Sure Ummm I don't know. what do you  think? Ah want to go out with me again  sometime?
LEILA	f	I don't know. I'm going to be kind of  busy with work, the Malibu and everything.
OTTO	m	Hey great. Terrific. Here's your shit  (stuff).
LEILA	f	What's your problem? I mean girls might  like you if you lightened up a little  bit.
OTTO	m	Fuck (Flip me). Girls pay to go out  with me. All right?
LEILA	f	You wanna get back in the car?
OTTO	m	What, here?
LEILA	f	Yeah.
OLY	f	Twenty thousand dollars for a Chevy  Malibu?
OLY	f	Who's double X finance?
MARLENE	f	Store front operation, but the money  is in escrow.
MARLENE	f	Want me to notify the boys?
OLY	f	Uh, naw. They're always bitching (crying)  about their case load. I think I'll  go out for a while.
MARLENE	f	Why? We out of beer?
OLY	f	Somebody has to work around here. Keep  making me money kid.
OTTO	m	Fuck (flip) you.
LITE	m	Man we've been looking for this little  red devil for a long time. Just act  natural. Nobody knows if it�s your car  or somebody elses car.
LITE	m	Now you work with that. You give it  a try. All right?
LITE	m	Let me give you a hand we don�t have  a whole year to find it boy.
OTTO	m	Got it.
LITE	m	Lets get out of here. Put your seat  belt on.
LITE	m	Put your seat belt on boy! I don't ride  with anybody unless they wear their  seatbelt. It's one of my rules.
LITE	m	Put that damn gun down boy. It ain't  no toy.
LITE	m	I walk into someone's place of work.  They shit (plum) scared. They know I'm  not a cop. They think I've come to kill  'em and I would. I'd kill anybody who  crosses me. You know what I mean?
LITE	m	Do you like music?
OTTO	m	Sure.
LITE	m	In that case you're going love this.
LITE	m	I was into these dudes before anybody.  Partied with them all the time. Asked  me to be their manager. I called bullshit  (no way) on that. Managing a pop group  hey that ain't no job for no man.
LITE	m	You read that book I gave you?
OTTO	m	What book?
LITE	m	Dioretix. Science of matter over mind.
OTTO	m	Unh uhg
LITE	m	You'd better read it and quick. That  book will change your life. Found it  in a Maseratti in Beverly hills.
MILLER	m	A lot of people don't realize what's  really going on. They view life as a  bunch of unconnected incidences and  things. They don't realize that there's  this like lattice of coincidence that  lays on top of everything. I'll Give  you an example, show you what I mean.  Suppose you thinking about a plate of  shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like  plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out  of the blue no explanation. No point  in looking for one either. It's all  part of a cosmic unconsciousness.
OTTO	m	You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in  the hippie days?
MILLER	m	I'll give you another instance. You  know the way everybody's into weirdness  right now. Books in all the supermarkets  about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how  the Mayans invented television. That  kind of thing.
OTTO	m	I don't read them books.
MILLER	m	Well the way I see it it's exactly the  same. There ain't no difference between  a flying saucer and a time machine.  People get so hung up on specifics.  They miss out on seeing the whole thing.  Take South America for example. In South  America thousands of people go missing  every year. Nobody knows where they  go. They just like disappear. But if  you think about it for a minute, you  realize something. There had to be a  time when there was no people. Right?
OTTO	m	Yeah. I guess.
MILLER	m	Well where did all these people come  from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The  future. Where did all these people disappear  to? hmmm?
OTTO	m	The past?
MILLER	m	That's right and how did they get there?
OTTO	m	How the fuck (hell) do I know?
MILLER	m	Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah  you got it. Time machines. I think a  lot about this kind of stuff. I do my  best thinking on the bus. That how come  I don't drive, see?
OTTO	m	You don't even know how to drive.
MILLER	m	I don't want to know how. I don't want  to learn. See? The more you drive, the  less intelligent you are.
BUD	m	You know I think I saw one of those  things once. One of those UFOs. I mean  it was really it was kind of kind of  scary. I saw all these colored lights  and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights  like I never heard before. I mean it  was really weird.
OTTO	m	Bud.
BUD	m	Yeah?
OTTO	m	Do you think all repo men follow the  code?
BUD	m	Of course. Well I mean you see a lot  of fucked (messed) up cars come in but...99  time out of 100 it was the customer  who fucked (mucked) them up. Assholes  (Damn fools).
BUD	m	I'm offering a thousands dollars for  his Falcon. You know what that is Napoleon?  It's a bribe.
NAPOLEON	m	Who the hell is this? Napoleon? Who  the fuck (hell) are you calling?
BUD	m	It's a grand if you show me where his  car is Napoleon.
[NAPOLEON	?	Ahh. Go fuck yourself asshole.]
BUD	m	Hello? Prick (Jerk).
NAPOLEON	m	Sixty-four Chevy Malibu. Twenty grand.
BUD	m	Waiting!
NAPOLEON	m	We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene.
MARLENE	f	Think you can find it now?
BUD IN THE STREET	m	I'm not going anywhere.
NAPOLEON	m	Now how come this junk is worth so much?  What's in it? Drugs?
BUD IN THE STREET	m	Got all night amigo!
LAGARTO	m	Los Hermanos Rodriguez don't approve  of drugs.
MARLENE	f	Neither do I, but it's my birthday.
BUD IN THE STREET	m	I'm going to get your .
[MARLENE	?	That motherfucker's still down there.]
BUD	m	Don't care how long it takes, dildos  (jerks). Repo man's got all night every  night.
OTTO	m	Hey Leila! All right, um, this is Otto.  The guy who gave you a ride and stuff.  I heard something about that car.
LEILA	f	Otto. Otto stop. You said you had something  to tell me.
LEILA	f	Otto? Otto!
OTTO	m	Huh?
LEILA	f	What did you want to tell me?
OTTO	m	Oh! Take off your clothes.
LEILA	f	I'm at work, Otto!
OTTO	m	Oh yeah? Me too.
LEILA	f	Your work is different than mine.
OTTO	m	Says who?
LEILA	f	What are you doing.? Don't do that.
[OTTO	?	Well the least you could do is give  me a blow job.
OTTO	m	Heh, I guess that means no.]
DEADRA	f	Leila? We have a cell meeting in two  minutes time.
LEILA	f	Thanks Deadra. I'll be right there.
BUD	m	See that motherfucker (melonfarmer)  only thinks I don't know what's going  on, Lite. As soon as I find that Chevy  I'm going indy. I'm going to buy myself  a tow truck, a couple of pitbulls, and  run a yard. Sit around and watch everybody  else do the work for a while (change).
LITE	m	No way you can do that on twenty grand  man.
BUD	m	The hell I can as long as you have good  credit and my credit is spotless. The hell I can't, as long as your credit  record's good and mine is spotless.)
LITE	m	If I find the Malibu, you won't see  me for dust, I'm going to move to Mendecino  County, raise me a bumper crop of tomato  plants.
BUD	m	Credit is a sacred trust. It's what  our free society is founded on. You  think they give a damn about their bills  in Russia? I said do you think they  give a damn about their bills in Russia?
OTTO	m	They don't pay bills in Russia. It's  all free.
BUD	m	All free? Free my ass, what are you  a fucking (flippin) commie? Huh?
OTTO	m	No I ain't no commie.
BUD	m	Well you'd better not be I don't want  any commies in my car. No Christians  either.
KEVIN	m	I'll deal with you later. I've got a  customer to attend to. You too.
KEVIN	m	Hi! I'm Kevin. Vacuum sir?
KEVIN	m	Need a vacuum sir?
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Have you any machines?
KEVIN	m	You don't want to eat from a machine.  Look, there's a nice Del Taco across  the street. They've got enchurritos  and everything.
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	But I do want to eat from a machine.  Vended food contains all the necessary  nutrients for survival. Taste damn good  too, by golly. And plus, on any given  evening, the machine that last night  gave you cheetos might dispense instead...  Doritos. Yohos. Oreos. Tosquitos (tostitos?).  Or Lorna Doones.
KEVIN	m	Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones.
KEVIN	m	Oh hey! You want me to check the trunk?  Scuze me.
KEVIN	m	Hi! I'm Kevin!
NAPOLEON	m	Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don't  you remember me? I was here yesterday.  Heh. Listen I think I left a book of  matches over in your office over there.  You want to go and check for me huh?
KEVIN	m	Sure thing.
NAPOLEON	m	Hey thanks a lot buddy.
KEVIN	m	Any thing for you babes.
NAPOLEON	m	All right, you're beautiful. I love  you.
KEVIN	m	I'll be right back.
KEVIN	m	What??
OTTO	m	It's really very simple Mrs. Parks.  You don't want me to take your car and  I don't want to take your car. Now I  said to the boss I said ah Look! I do  not want to repossess this lady�s car.
MRS. PARKS	f	Well I've been in the hospital you see.
OTTO	m	Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really  on the line over this one. I could lose  it right away.
MRS. PARKS	f	I'll see if I can borrow some money  from somewhere.
OTTO	m	That's terrific. Really terrific.
MRS. PARKS	f	Oh how was the rehearsal son?
MRS. PARKS' SON	f	It was O.K. Who's this?
MRS. PARKS	f	Oh this is Mr. Otto. He's from the finance  company. He's been telling me that he  isn't going to take the car this time,  even though he could.
OTTO	m	Well, uh, gotta get going here.
MRS. PARKS	f	Did you like the tea?
OTTO	m	The tea?
MRS. PARKS	f	Uh huh?
OTTO	m	Yeah, it was terrific.
OTTO	m	Thank you
MRS. PARKS	f	You're welcome.
OTTO	m	Uh excuse me.
MRS. PARKS	f	I gave you the money last week to pay  it and you didn't do it. What did you  do with it? I'm so tired of giving you  money and you squandering it. I know  what you done you all went out dancing  some where. That's what you did. Next  time I give you some money I want you  to put it in the car ya hear. You're  working. How come you didn't do it huh?  I don't know what's happened to you.  (continues softly)
OTTO	m	Hey it's cool. It's cool. I like music  too man, hey
PLETTSCHNER	?	Some people aren't cut out to be repo  men. Why don't you smarten up kid?
OTTO	m	Fuck (flip) you Plettschner! OWW! OWW!
PLETTSCHNER	?	Don't you say fuck (flip) you to me.  Don't you know who I am?
OTTO	m	Yeah you're Plettschner.
PLETTSCHNER	?	You're fucking (flippin) right I'm Plettschner.  Otto Plettschner. Three times decorated  in two world wars. I was killing people  while you were still swimming around  in your father's balls (guts). You little  scum bag! I worked five years in a slaughter  house and ten years as a prison guard  in Attica.
OTTO	m	So what?
PLETTSCHNER	?	So what? So never say fuck (flip) you  to me. Because you haven't earn the  rights yet.

OTTO	m	Fuck (flip) you!
PLETTSCHNER	?	Fuck you! (What!) You little scumbag.
LITE	m	Shut up, Phlettschner.
PLETTSCHNER	?	Don't you ever tell me to shut up.
NAPOLEON	m	Shit (shoot)! (?)! It's too hot in here  man. What the hell's going on? So fucking  (flippin) hot I think that shit in the  trunk is going to melt. I think we better  take a look, all right?
LAGARTO	m	Go get us two sodas.

OTTO	m	You know Marlene? Man she's pretty hot.
LITE	m	Otto my man. I jumped on that action  from day one. I found out where she  was coming from.

LITE	m	Hey! Blanks get the job done too.
OTTO	m	You repo men, you guys are all out to  fuckin (flippin) lunch. Let's get out  of here.

LEILA	f	(garbled noises in background) Look  out!
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	What?
AGENT	m	Happy face! You want a ride?
LEILA	f	What do you want from me?
AGENT	m	We ask the questions.
LEILA	f	You're not going to torture me are you?
LEILA	f	Torture you? What for?
LEILA	f	To find out what I know. I'd torture  someone in a second if it was up to  me.
AGENT	m	Huh? Why are you looking for the Malibu?
LEILA	f	Because of the trunk. The aliens inside.
AGENT	m	Illegal aliens?
LEILA	f	No, Silly, Extraterrestrials.
AGENT	m	Ahhh, heh. Did you ever think about  joining the CIA?

PLETTSCHNER	?	Hey Marlene. I'm on my coffee break.
BUD	m	Repo man don't go running to the man  Marlene. A repo man goes at it alone.
LITE	m	Yes sirree bob.
MARLENE	f	Just like John Wayne.
OLY	f	Damn right just like John Wayne what's  wrong about that?
PLETTSCHNER	?	Greatest American that ever lived.
MILLER	m	John Wayne was a fag (freak).
BUD	m	What did you say man?
PLETTSCHNER	?	Whaa?
OLY	f	What?
[MILLER	?	John Wayne was a fag.]
EVERYONE	m	The hell he was.
MILLER	m	He was too you boys. I installed two  way mirrors in his pad in Brentwood.  And he'd come to the door in a dress.
PLETTSCHNER	?	Ah, you're fucking (flippin) nuts.
OLY	f	That doesn't mean he was a homo (freak),  Miller. Lotta straight guys like to  watch their buddies fuck (play). I know  I do.
BUD	m	They do?
PLETTSCHNER	?	Yeah.
OLY	f	Don't you?
PLETTSCHNER	?	Damn straight I do.
LITE	m	Fuck (Damn) John Wayne man. Tell us  his name you little pussy (sissy).
OTTO	m	Kiss off you asshole (airhead).
OTTO	m	Ow you bastards (loonies)!
BUD	m	Hey take it easy. Take it easy. The  guys head is hurt.
OLY	f	This is too personal sonny. The thing  is a repo man got beat up in the line  of duty. Now it doesn't matter that  that man was you. What really matters  is that the guy that did it has got  to pay the price. Now stop being selfish  and tell us his name.
LITE	m	Come on.
OTTO	m	Ahh Oww You bastard (buzzard).
OTTO	m	All right! All right! All right! All  right! O.K. his name was...
OLY	f	Mr. Humphries?
MR. HUMPHRIES	m	Yes? Yes I'm Mr. Humphries. What do  you want? Ungghhh...
T.V.	?	The president admitted that U.S. war  planes have napalmed refugees camps  in Southern Mexico. He explained that  these camps were in fact guerrilla bases.  In strife torn Guatemala shots were  fires at the U.S. embassy and government  troops retaliated killing 50... (continues  in background)
MARLENE	f	Helping hand acceptance corporation.  Marlene speaking.
LEILA	f	Hello, is Otto there?

OTTO	m	Yeah.
LEILA	f	Hi Otto? It's Leila.
OTTO	m	Leila who?
OTTO	m	I can't believe I used to like these  guys.
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Listen to me! For the sake of this and  future generations you must tell us  everything you know.
OTTO	m	Yeah. Sure. I need another drink.
LEILA	f	Otto, these aliens aren't on ice or  anything. They could be starting to  decay. We've got to find them before  they turn into mush.
DUKE	m	Well! Well! Well! If it ain't the repo  man.
ARCHIE	m	You look like shit (snot) you wankers  (weirdos).
OTTO	m	Duke. Debbi. Archie. I'd like you to  meet Leila and her weird friend.
DUKE	m	How you doing, asshole (airhead)?

DEBBI	f	Kill him Duke!
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	You know what? I think you're afraid  to find out.
DEBBI	f	Kill him.
ARCHIE	m	Come on Duke you putty butt, kill him.
DUKE	m	I aint afraid of nothing see.
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	It's all right I don't blame you for  being afraid.
DUKE	m	I said I ain't afraid of nothing. I  kill people like you.
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Oh well. I guess you're right. It's  better not to look.
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Beautiful evening. You can almost see  the stars.

BUD	m	Look at these people man there's one  person in each car. City wants up to  car pool but nobody gives a shit.
MILLER	m	People car pool, we'd be out of work.
LITE	m	AWW bullshit!
OLY	f	How come that pig's got a wooden leg?  Well said the farmer said about three  months ago I was out there walking the  pig.

LAGARTO	m	How's your neck Napoleon?
NAPOLEON	m	Oh my neck? Yeah! Oh!  my neck is killing  me man. I think I got whiplash.
LAGARTO	m	Aside from whiplash, this isn't a repo  car.
[BUD	?	Bullshit! I got the fucking papers on  it.]
LAGARTO	m	We paid it off. You see, uh this is  our favorite car.
NAPOLEON	m	Yeah that's right. You got insurance
BUD	m	Come on . Whose side are you on ? Let  me go .
OLY	f	Yeah Yeah that's what I said when the  marshal woke me up at 4 o'clock this  morning . Unfortunately it isn't bullshit  (hokum), it's a summons.
OLY	f	Have you read it? The goddamn (gol-durn)  Rodriguez brothers are suing us for  malicious damage, medical expenses and  harassment for a car they fucking (flippin)  own.
BUD	m	The Rodriguez brothers. But. Ha! You  believe the fucking (flippin) Rodriguez  brothers? They're a couple of scumbags  Oly. You know that?
OLY	f	I know that bud. But we've got to sit  down and get our stories straight.
BUD	m	Bullshit (Hogwash) you're taking their  word against mine.
OLY	f	I was there remember? Why don't you  go home? Take the rest of the week off.
BUD	m	Take the rest of the? I can't take the  it. Take the flippin rest of the week  off budsky. So you can get the flippin  twenty thousand dollars for the Malibu.
OLY	f	Make it a fucking (flippin) month.
BUD	m	Yeah? Well fuck (flip) you.
OLY	f	On second though Budsky. Don't bother  coming back at all.
BUD	m	Great! I'll come back and pick up my  stuff later when the fucking (flippin)  place don't stink so bad.
PLETTSCHNER	?	Ha! Ha! Ha!
OLY	f	Shut up!
BUD	m	. Makes you wonder how much they owe.  Most of them are on the run. Don't even  use their fucking (flippin) social security  numbers. If there was just some way  to find out how much the motherfuckers  (melonfarmers) owe and making them pay.
OTTO	m	Jesus Christ (Holy cow) bud. They're  winos, they don't have any money. You  think they'd be bums if they did?
BUD	m	You want out? Do ya?
OTTO	m	No!
BUD	m	What's a matter with you? Don't you  like your job anymore? Not too happy  in your job? I mean I feel like were  not communicating any more. When we  first started out I though I could teach  you something share something with you  for Christ's sake. Answer me!
AGENT	m	(heard in background) I'm picking up  the dead. I'm putting my hands around  this dead body. I'm, I'm carrying his  limp torso to the truck. And he feels  like like he has only been dead a little  while but...
OTTO	m	ott, ott...
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	What line of work you in?
OTTO	m	re, re, re..
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Rock'n'roller, eh!? I used to be a musician  myself, college days. Of course it was  folk songs and protest songs back then.  (begins singing, badly) We shall overcome,  we shall overcome...
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	(stops singing and scratches ear) Did  you ever feel as if your mind had started  to erode?
OTTO	m	No.
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Ever been to Utah?
OTTO	m	Nuh-uh
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	I go to Utah every year. Friend of mine,  was a designer of the MX missile race  track basing mode. A hundred thousand  miles of railroad track on a big loop  through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Bombs  were going to hide in locomotive sheds.  That way the red team would never know  exactly where they were. I still go  out to Utah, just to think about the  way things might have been.
OTTO	m	Sir. I represent the Helping Hand Acceptance  Corporation.
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Radiation, yes indeed! You hear the  most outrageous lies about it. Half-baked  goggle-boxed do-gooders telling everybody  it�s bad for you. Pernicious nonsense!  Everybody could stand a hundred chest  X-rays a year. They ought to have 'em  too. When they canceled the project  it almost did me in. One day my mind  was literally a-burst. The next day  nothing. Swept away... But I showed  them. I had a lobotomy in the end.
OTTO	m	Lobotomy? Isn't that for loonies?
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Not at all. A friend of mine had one.  Designer of the neutron bomb. Ever hear  of the neutron bomb? Destroys people.  Leaves buildings standing. It fits in  a suit case. It's so small no one knows  it's there until blammo. Eyes melt skin  explodes everybody dead. It's so immoral  working on the thing can drive you mad.  That's what happened to this friend  of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's  well again.
OTTO	m	What kind of car does your... does your  friend drive?
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Chevy Malibu.
OTTO	m	And you do the same type of work?
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Didn't I tell you? I can't tell you  what I do. I'm classified.
OTTO	m	This is really a nice old car. Why don't  you let me drive?
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	What do you mean?
OTTO	m	Well I don't know. I mean...uh! Don't  you feel funny.?
J. FRANK PARNELL	m	Why should I feel funny? The two hemispheres  are fundamentally at odds. Hemisphere,  Hemisphere. You know it's strange. I  do feel funny...
OLY	f	By the way kid, sign this.
OTTO	m	What is this?
OLY	f	Equity turnover. Standard practice.  Protects you in case we get sued. .  . Don't read the damn thing, kid, just  sign it.
REPO WIFE 1	f	Here's the young new-waver we've all  heard so much about.
REPO WIFE 2	f	My old man had a mohawk on him when  I met him. He was in the service then.
OLY	f	He signed it over to me. But he didn�t  realize-
REPO WIFE 2	f	My old man was such a monster. I used  to have to tell him no.
REPO WIFE 1	f	My old man was exactly the same way  until we got married.
LITE	m	Hey Oly. You're wife's hanging all over  Otto.
OLY	f	Yeah. Like flies on shit (spit).
OTTO	m	Um. Have you see uh bud anywhere?
REPO WIFE 1	f	Who?
TV	m	...another wonderful Christian opportunity.  The Reverend Larry...
BUD	m	Hey there hero. Get the money yet?
OTTO	m	Not yet. Oly's going to get it for me  though. I just signed the papers.
BUD	m	Whu, what do you mean, what papers?
OTTO	m	Beats me, just some, uh, contract or  something.
BUD	m	Didn't you read it?
OTTO	m	Well, no, just, uh, standard practice,  uh, contract...
BUD	m	Melonfarmer Oly! ...oooh, shoot.
OTTO	m	What, is that not a happening deal?
BUD	m	Hey ace. Wait up.
OTTO	m	So you want to talk about it?
BUD	m	Talk about what kid?
OTTO	m	Why you're so damn mad at me?
BUD	m	I'm not mad at you.  damn. I'm not.  I'm not mad at you.
OTTO	m	All right O.K.
[DUKE	?	Debbie?
DEBBIE	f	What?
DUKE	m	I've been thinking. Now that we've got  some money and Archie's gone, don't  you think it's time we we settle down?  Get a little house. I want you to have  my baby.
DEBBIE	f	Why?
DUKE	m	Well I don't know. Every body does it.  And it just seems like the thing to  do and...
DEBBI	f	Asshole.]
DUKE	m	Let's go do the job.
OTTO	m	Duke! Debbie! What what are you guys  doing here?
DUKE	m	What's it look like ace?
DEBBIE	f	Up against the wall.
DUKE	m	I'm going to kill him. I'm going to  kill him. I'm going to kill everybody.  ha-ha-ha
LOUIE	m	Drop it motherfucker (melonfarmer).
BUD	m	Oww shit (shoot).
OTTO	m	Debbie Ah. Ah Do You, uh, do you think  it's too late uh for us to get romantically  involved?
DEBBIE	f	I think a little.
OTTO	m	Wait! Wait! Stick with me. I'll make  you a repo wife.
DEBBI	f	Bollocks. Here. (tosses Otto a bag of  popcorn)
DUKE	m	Otto?
OTTO	m	Yeah I'm here man.
DUKE	m	The lights are growing dim. I know a  life of crime led me to this sorry fate.  And yet I I blame society. Society made  me what I am.
OTTO	m	That's bullshit (nonsense). You're a  white suburban punk, just like me.
DUKE	m	But it still hurts.
OTTO	m	You're going to be all right man
OTTO	m	Maybe not.
AGENT	m	Yep he's dead all right.
AGENT	m	No doubt about it.
AGENT	m	He's a goner.
AGENT	m	Man.
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Don't touch the body, don't touch the  body.
AGENT	m	Sorry.
AGENT	m	Telephone call for you agent.
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Don't bother me now.
AGENT	m	But Agent Rogersz, it's the Gipper.
AGENT	m	Look.
AGENT	m	Booth's setting him on fire
REVEREND LARRY ON TV	m	...fail to register for patriotic chores.  So, please call this toll free number.  Praise the lord. There is no redemption  for the unredeemed, no escape for the  fair weather patriots. No salvation  from the boiling blistering fires of  eternal damnation. Now these are the  end times. Because in these days there  shall be hell in time. Man shall be  lovers of their own self rather than  lovers of God.
OTTO'S DAD	m	Haven't seen you in a while, Son.
TV	m	No escape...
OTTO'S MOM	f	Some men were just here looking for  you, Otto.
TV	m	No salvation from the blistering files  of eternal damnation. For in these days  there shall be hell in time, there shall  be war and more war, and earthquakes  in diverse places...
OTTO	m	What kind of men?
OTTO'S MOM	f	Very nice young men. They wore sunglasses.
OTTO	m	Well, what did you tell them? Did you  tell them I was sick?
OTTO'S DAD	m	We told them the truth, son. Gave them  your address at work.
TV	m	Money shall run out and the people will  line up at the banks and there won't  be anything . . . these prophecies are  in your bible. The same one that you  have in your home. Now I want you to  get up off of your sofa and put that  beer down and go wherever it is in your  house pick up that book and turn with  me...
AGENT	m	Where's the car baby? That Chevy Malibu  baby. Where's the car?
PLETTSCHNER	?	Otto!
OTTO	m	Jeeze.
PLETTSCHNER	?	You got to stay out of this.
OTTO	m	Why?
PLETTSCHNER	?	It's none of your business. You want  to be a hero? Or would you rather be  a chicken man?
OTTO	m	What?
PLETTSCHNER	?	A chicken man. Did you ever see a farmer's  wife? Huh?
OTTO	m	Let go of me!
[PLETTSCHNER	?	It's peaceful man.]
AGENT 1	m	The Malibu.
AGENT 2	m	Yeah?
MARLENE	f	Let's go
OTTO	m	No way Marlene.
OTTO	m	My car's gone and we're going to get  to the bottom of this.
MARLENE	f	Like hell we are.
AGENT 2	m	Not in my face.
PLETTSCHNER	?	Hold it Marlene. Freeze!
AGENT 2	m	My Face!
MARLENE	f	Over my dead body.
PLETTSCHNER	?	That's how it's going to have to be.
MARLENE	f	Come and get me. Come on.
PLETTSCHNER	?	I've been wanting to do that one for  a long time honey.
MARLENE	f	Come on. Come on. Come on if you think  your man enough.
OTTO	m	Hey Fletch. Coffee break.
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Good evening Otto. This is agent Rogersz.  I'm going to ask you a few questions.  And since time is short and you may  lie, I'm going to have to torture you.  But I want you to know it isn't personal.
OTTO	m	Look Ah this isn't really necessary.  I'll tell you anything you want to know.
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Good! Where is the Malibu?
OTTO	m	I don't know. Somebody ripped it from  the yard.
LEILA	f	I don't think he knows.
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Increase the voltage.
LEILA	f	But what if he's innocent?
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	No one is innocent. Proceed.
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Ah yes! Look at them. High heels, hair  nets, those ridiculous trench coats.  They're pathetic.
AGENT 1	m	But agent Rogersz, they're getting away.
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	That's all part of the plan.
MARLENE	f	Otto, Otto pull your self together.
OTTO	m	Marlene? What's going on?
MARLENE	f	We're going to the hospital.
OLD LADY	m	Hey, I know you. You're the one that  run into my trash.
OTTO	m	Shh!
OLD LADY	m	Shhh to you too.
LAGARTO	m	Out of order. Take the stairs.
KEVIN	m	Otto?
NURSE 1	f	Let me see that. All wrong do it over.
OLD LADY	m	They're going through it all the and  they won't pick it up.
NURSE 2	f	Oh well isn't that a shame.
OLD LADY	m	Oh tell you it comes to something when  they expect you to pick it up.
OTTO	m	How are you doing man?
MARLENE	f	Ask him about the Malibu.
OTTO	m	Look about the other night. I'm sorry  I split. I know I should have stayed  with you but ah it's like when I was  a kid you know I I had this set of big  wheels you know.
MARLENE	f	Otto!
BUD	m	Shit (shoot). (starts to get up off  of the bed)
REVEREND LARRY	m	Praise the lord.
NAPOLEON	m	Go. Go. Go.
NAPOLEON	m	Come on. Let's go.
OTTO	m	Dude slow down.
NAPOLEON	m	All right don't shoot come on all right  all right
AGENTS	m	Chicken shits (stuff). braak-braak-braak
AGENT ROGERSZ	m	Where's the Malibu?
OTTO	m	Don't even ask because I don't know.  I mean I don't have it Marlene doesn't  have it you and your crazy friends don't  have it. So that only leaves...
AGENT	m	Where is he.
AGENT	m	Where the fuck (hell) is he.
NAPOLEON	m	Later!
MARLENE	f	Bye, Bye.
VOICE FROM THE RADIO	m	Here's another weird one. Reports are  coming in about apparent hail of ice  cubes south of downtown. Scientist are  at a loss to explain the freak showers  of tiny cubes of ice.
OTTO	m	That's some weird fucking shit (filthy  stuff) Eh Bud? What's going on man?
BUD	m	Shit (damn)! Eleven years of repoing  cars and what have I got? Shit (zilch)!
OTTO	m	Bud listen to me. You're sitting in  a car worth twenty thousand dollars.  Look look we we turn it in we take the  money and split it sixty forty. You  and me.
